begin your first lesson by starting off
with the basics well these ideas may
seem simple their fundamental enough
that we should quickly go over them
before tackling more complex topics
we'll begin by discussing the very
basics of working with numbers in Python
this should be pretty straightforward
to start off numbers in Python have two
main forms it's either integers those
are whole numbers such as 1 2 3
100 200 etc or floating-point numbers
those are numbers we have decimal points
such as four point three five point six
you get the idea Python can perform
basic math operations easily let's begin
your training by opening up a Jupiter
notebook and discussing these ideas
further
as we just mentioned there are two main
types of numbers that is integers
remember those are whole numbers so if I
have 100 or 10 or 1 those are all
integers you can easily check the type
of an object using the type function T
ype open and close parentheses passing
the object you want to check in this
case I'll pass in 100 then we run shift
enter and I can say have int indicating
an integer type
let's try passing in ten point two
that's a floating-point number so we get
back the type float something to notice
though is if I pass in type 100 point
zero that's also a floating-point number
and also notice that if I type in 100
dot I don't actually need to indicate a
zero there for Python to recognize that
this is a floating point number so 100
point zero and 100 points or 100 dot
those are both floating-point numbers
integers can't have any decimal points
now as you may have expected Python can
perform basic arithmetic quite easily
there's addition which you can easily do
with just a plus sign 1 + 1 run shift
enter and you get back the result - you
can do subtraction so 100 minus 1 gets
you 99 that's just the dash
multiplication is with an asterisk so
you say - asterisk - that's
multiplication division is with a simple
forward slash 3 divided by 2 that's 1
point 5 note here that division always
returns floats so even when we say 1
divided by 1 that is equal to 1 if you
ever perform division in Python that's
going to return back a float 1.0 if you
want to do powers or exponents that's
two asterisks in a row - asterisk
asterisks 3 is 2 to the power of 3 and
you actually don't need the spacing
there it's up to you stylistically how
you can perform that and if you wanted
to you could also do things like square
roots so you could do four asterisks to
the power of 1/2 mathematically that's
actually the same thing as taking the
square root of 4
now we'll discuss more math operations
later on in fact Python actually has an
entire math library for more complex
features of mathematics now that we
understand the basics of arithmetic
let's finally discuss order of
operations if you ever need to indicate
order of operations you can use
parentheses as I've done here so let's
dive into this example a little further
imagine I had 1 plus 2 times 1000 plus 1
well what do you expect the result to be
in this case it's going to be two
thousand two because the multiplication
is going to happen to first do to order
of operations and then we'll add in 1 on
both ends but let's imagine you wanted
one plus two to happen first and then
one thousand plus ones happen and then
you wanted those two results to be
multiplied well you can use parentheses
to indicate order of operations 1 plus 2
multiplied by one thousand plus one and
now when I run this you can see the
result is three thousand three or three
times 1001 let's now discuss variable
assignments you can assign variable
names in order to keep track of objects
in either your script or your notebook
or whatever development environment
you're using we'll start off with a
simple example we'll say a is equal to 2
and now I have assigned two to the
variable a so if I check the type of a
it brings back an integer since a is 2
and then I can do something like a plus
3 and if I run that I get back 5 because
2 plus 3 is 5 I can also do another
assignment such as B is equal to 3 and
then interact with variables such as a
plus B important to note here is that I
can do a reassignment
so I can say a is equal to 100 and now
if I say just ask for a return the back
it's no longer two but now it's 100 and
if I say a plus B now I get back 103 now
you can also reassign with the same
variable so what does this actually look
like
if I take a look at a remember that a is
100 I can do a reassignment referencing
the same variable so now I'm going to
indicate that a is equal to a plus a
since a is currently 100 I should expect
the result of a to be reassigned to 200
meaning if I run this and I ask for a
back
it is now 200 if I run this cell more
than one time so notice my in operator
it says number 25 if I were to run this
again so now it's 27 and then ask for a
a is now 400 because it's 200 plus 200
and every time you run this you're going
to keep adding on to that reassignment
so in notebook settings you want to be
careful and try to organize your code
that cell should be run in order from
top down if you're running a dot PI
script you don't have to worry about
this because you'll basically be running
your entire script every time you run
your dot PI script at your command line
finally let's work through a simple
example of variable assignments we'll
start off by creating a message and
let's say our message is the sequence 1
1 1 or the number 111 then we'll create
another variable called hash code and
notice here what's happening with the
word hash hash is being highlighted
green if you ever see a variable name
being highlighted that indicates that
it's actually a special keyword that's
built into Python so you'll probably
want to choose a different name so if
you start doing things like list or STR
notice how they're being especially
highlighted that means those are already
pre-built
in keywords in Python and you should
avoid reassigning those so instead of
just saying hash I'm going to say
underscore code and this use of
underscore to separate words in your
variable names is known as snake casing
or snake case there's also camel case
where you can do something like
and then the next word has a capital
letter for variable names in Python try
to use a snake casing that is separating
the words out with underscores later on
when we learn about more complex topics
such as object-oriented programming
we'll see that there's a given
convention for naming and camel casing
and snake casing have their particular
moments right now for variable names try
to keep it with a snake case that is the
use of those underscores to separate
words so I will say my hash code is 1 2
3 4 5 and let's say I want to create a
secret message for another agent out in
the field to discover well I will say
secret message is going to be equal to
my message multiplied by my hash code
and then I can send my secret message
and I can use tab to autocomplete this I
can send that secret message out to the
agent and if they know the hash code to
get back the real message we can say
real message is the secret message
notice my tab auto-completion divided by
the hash code that they knew and then
they can see that the real message was
like we said 1 1 now again notice that
whenever you perform the vision your
number gets converted to a
floating-point number okay that was
actually a very basic example of
something called encryption or you try
to encrypt an original message using
some sort of secret key later on we'll
learn about much better ways of doing
this this is just for a very simple
example of variable assignment okay
excellent work recruit it's time to move
on to other basic Python data types</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
