development teacher at udemy.com in my
complete javascript course which
includes premium support I get a ton of
questions from my students so I decided
to create this video where I reply to
the top five questions that I get from
my students all the time and the first
question goes like this hey Jonas what
is hosting and how does it work and
that's an excellent question because
hoisting is extremely important in
JavaScript
now the answer about how hosting works
behind the scenes is actually very
complex but here is what you really need
to know so before the JavaScript code
that you write actually execute the
JavaScript engine scans your code for
function declarations and variable
declarations it then makes these
functions in variables available even
before the code starts running in a so
called execution phase however there is
a difference between the way it works
for variables and for functions so
variables are simply set to undefined
before the execution phase which isn't
all that helpful
for function declarations however it's
extremely helpful because they are
available before the execution phase
starts so before your code actually
starts running and because of that the
code in this example works just fine so
let's analyze this code it starts by
setting the diameter variable to 5 and
in the next line we calculate the area
using the clock area function which is
only defined later in a code right but
thanks to hosting this will still work
because as I explained before function
declarations like this one are hoisted
and made available before the execution
phase even starts and as you can imagine
this is extremely helpful
because otherwise we would have to put
all our functions first in the code and
could only use them after that and that
would not be ideal right so I hope that
made sense and that you understand now
what hoisting is and how it works as I
mentioned in the beginning the way
hoisting actually works behind the
scenes is a bit more complex than this
but if you want you can
learn all about it in my complete
JavaScript course and since we were
talking about hoisting here is another
related question that I get all the time
which is this one what's the difference
between function declarations and
function expressions and this is
actually an easy one so the first
difference is the way that we write them
for the function declaration we just
used the function keyword and give the
function a name like you see here in
this example for the function expression
we define a variable and assign it a
function like in the second piece of
code in the example so it looks a bit
different but both functions work in the
same way by the way the arrow function
that we have in es6 which is the third
piece of this code here is also a
function expression just written in a
slightly different way now the main
difference between function declarations
and expressions has to do with hoisting
like explained in the last question so
remember that function declarations are
hoisted which means that they are made
available before the code even starts
running and can therefore be called
before they actually appear in the code
but the same does not happen with
function expressions because they are in
fact just variables and so therefore
they are technically also hoisted but
they are set to undefined which means
that we cannot call him before they
appear in the code and that's it that's
the main difference between function
declarations and expressions now both
ways of writing functions are perfectly
acceptable you just have to understand
that you cannot call a function
expression before you actually defined
it in the code besides that there is no
real advantage of one over the other and
here is another easy one what's the
difference between query selector and
get element by ID well let me start by
saying that it doesn't really matter
which one you use okay you can just use
the one that you like the most it really
is a matter of personal preference here
but anyway let's talk about the
differences between them as you probably
know with yet element by ID you can
simply select a Dom element with the ID
that you specify and that's it weird
query selector on the other hand you
like a dumb element based on a selector
that you pass in and that selector
parameter works the exact same way as
CSS selectors and that's a huge plus in
my opinion so you don't have to learn
anything new in order to make some
pretty complex selections with
JavaScript because it works just like
your regular CSS it's that simple now if
you want to select more than just one
element you have to use query selector
all and then loop through the results
but the selection logic is just the same
so what get element by ID you can only
select based on ID and of course only
one element
there's also get elements by class name
if you prefer that one over query
selector it's been shown that get
element by ID is actually much faster
than query selector but we're talking
about fractions of milliseconds here so
that's not relevant at all it also has
better browser support because query
selector is a bit newer but again we're
talking about very old browsers here so
that also shouldn't really be a concern
so in conclusion you can just use
whatever you prefer so whatever works
best for you I personally always use
query selector to select everything no
matter if based on class or ID question
number four and this one is also very
popular so what is the disk keyword and
how does it get its value and this is
something that confuses many JavaScript
beginners so let me try to clear this
one up once and for all so what you need
to know is this every time some
JavaScript code is executed like in a
global scope
or in the function it runs in an
execution context and each execution
context automatically gets at this
variable or keyword which points
somewhere so again the disc keyword is a
very special variable that is available
to us each time that we call a function
now where does the disk keyword actually
point to and there are really only two
different scenarios here when a regular
function call happens or when a method
call happens so whenever we just simply
call a regular function in JavaScript
it's this keyword will automatically
point to the global object simple as
that so consider this example which is
running in a global space
you see how there is a D variable both
in the outside scope and also inside the
COG aerial function these variables have
the same name but are in fact different
variables so when I use this dot D in
the next line what do you think this dot
D will actually be will it be 5 or will
it be 100 and the correct answer is
actually 5 because the disable points to
the global object and the variable D
that's in a global object is defined as
5 and so therefore this dot d will also
be 5 again because the dis keyword is
pointing to the global object now the
most logical answer was maybe 100 right
but that's now how JavaScript works and
now about the method call here things
work a bit differently so remember that
a method is simply a function attached
to an object right now whenever we call
a method the disable inside that
function points to the object to which
the method is attached so in this
example this dot D will be 5 because the
disc keyword points to the object called
shape and the D property on that object
is set to 5 and therefore this dot d has
to be 5 because again the disc keyword
now points to the object to which the
method is attached alright so that's the
way to this variable works for regular
function calls and method calls again
there's actually a lot more happening
behind the scenes here you can learn all
about that in my complete JavaScript
course if you feel like that alright and
now the last most asked question is this
one hey Jonas what is the closure and
when can it be useful and this is again
quite a difficult one because closures
are a really tough concept to grasp in
JavaScript you need a lot of theory to
really explain and understand how
closures work behind the scenes but let
me try to summarize it to the essentials
to what you really need to know in order
to get started so in summary a closure
means that an inner function has always
access to the variables and parameters
of its outer function even after the
hour
engine has already returned and that
last part is what really matters here
okay but let's look at an example so we
start by calling the shapes function
which calculates an area based on a
deeper ammeter and then returns a
function okay so far so good
now this return function is then stored
in the cylinder variable right so our
cylinder is now a function that we can
of course call so let's do that and
remember that this is what the cylinder
function actually is and now what does
this function actually do
well it just calculates the volume of
the cylinder simply by multiplying the H
parameter that we passed in by the area
but wait how can this function have
access to the area variable that area
variable was defined in the shapes
function but that function is already
finished it has already returned so
shouldn't the area variable be gone by
now well maybe it should but it's not
and this is what's called the closure so
as we said right in the beginning the
closure is when an inner function in
this case or cylinder function has
access to the variables and parameters
of its outer function in this case the
shape function even when the outer
function has returned long ago and that
is exactly what happens here right and
note that we don't create closures
manually this is something that's really
built into JavaScript so we don't have
to worry about anything we don't have to
say that we want a closure javascript
will always do this work for us
automatically now you may ask why is
this actually useful and when can we
make use of this well there are many use
cases for closures in patterns like
factory functions which is basically a
function that returns a bunch of related
functions so which have something in
common or also the module pattern which
is great for implementing data
encapsulation and data privacy in
JavaScript but that would fill an entire
new video alone so let's leave it for
another time and so that's it I hope
that you learned something new about
JavaScript here in this video
but of course as I mentioned many times
there is so much more to learn if you
want to go deeper into the topics and
