lowercase LS is not the same as capital
L capital S this really isn't much of an
issue because most commands in Linux are
all lowercase here are the commands
we're going to cover today LS lists
directory contents it can also display
detailed information about files and
directories CD is the change directory
command it does what it says it changes
the current working directory when you
log into a Linux system you're
automatically placed into your home
directory you can use the CD command to
navigate around the filesystem the PWD
command displays the present working
directory or your current directory cat
concatenates files really what cat does
is it displays the contents of files
echo displays arguments to the screen it
may not be immediately obvious how this
is helpful but in a minute when I show
you some examples it will become clear
Linux systems come with built-in
documentation you can use man to display
the documentation for a given command on
a Linux system you may hear people refer
to man pages this is the documentation
that you can view with the man command
to exit or log out of your shell use the
exit command finally clear clears the
screen let's see some of these commands
in action first let's look at LS
if you run LS without any arguments it
lists the files in the present working
directory in this example we see several
items in this directory Desktop
downloads notes etc and this example LS
output is color-coded this may not
always be the case but it is a common
thing to see on Linux distributions we
can run LS with a - L option which
displays a long listing format here we
get more information about the files and
directories that are displayed in a
later lesson we'll cover what all this
information means as you recall earlier
I said Linux commands are case sensitive
so let's see what happens if we type in
capital LS we get an error saying that
the command is not found
let's try capital L lowercase s
lowercase L capital s same thing so LS
works lowercase capital does not let's
use the CD command to change the
directory directories and files are also
case sensitive so capital T PS lowercase
reports is not the same as all lowercase
TPS reports can use LS to see what's in
this directory and we can use LS dash L
to display a long listing more detailed
information about these files cat will
display the contents of a file this file
only has one line in it echo is used to
display the contents of variables and
we'll be talking about environmental
variables later on
use the man command
learn more information about how to use
a particular command type the word man
space and the command you want to know
more about in order to display the next
page of information simply hit the
spacebar when you're done looking at the
man page type Q to quit man here's the
man page for LS you'll see how LS has a
lot of options here's one that we've
been using in this lesson - L use a long
listing format so as you can see there's
a lot of information in the man pages
we'll talk more about the man command in
the next lesson the clear command clears
the screen if you execute CD without any
arguments it takes you back to your home
directory
PWD will display your current or present
working directory in order to exit your
session type the word exit today the
commands we've talked about our LS which
displays the contents of a directory CD
which changes the current directory PWD
which displays what directory you're
currently in Kat that displays the
contents of files echo displays
arguments man displays documentation
about commands
exit exits your shell and clear clears
your screen if you found this video
