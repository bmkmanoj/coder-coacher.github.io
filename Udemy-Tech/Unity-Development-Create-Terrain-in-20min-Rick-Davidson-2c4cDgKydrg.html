gonna create a terrain with grass and
trees and textures and some mountains so
that you can use it as a quick way to
prototype your level so that you're not
just looking at grey boxes and and basic
primitive shapes so you can feel your
world but we want to do it in a quick
way so let's jump in and do that so here
we are in a new unity scene I'm gonna
start the process by right-clicking 3d
object and adding a terrain the terrain
bits plop down in the middle they're
wonderful it's nice and white not
looking that interesting just yet we
need to get some things to put on top of
our terrain now you go up into assets
import package and use one of unity
standard asset packages specifically
from environment so the environment will
have all the details we need trees and
grass and stuff I'm gonna go one step
different I was gonna say one step
better but it's just one step different
I'm gonna go into the asset store I've
searched around I found this nature
starter kit to buy shapes it's really
cool lots of great stuff in there
basically it gives me some trees and
some grass and some dirt which is what
I'm looking for and if you haven't
downloaded that already you'll need to
click to download I have so I'm just
clicking import preparing package this
might take a moment and it shows me all
the things that it will bring in I can
be a little bit judicious and pick
certain things that I want and certain
things that I don't for now I'm gonna
say yes import everything and bring it
into my project because it's an old
asset pack it's asking me if I'm cool
with that and I'm like yeah I've made a
backup of my new empty project with
nothing in it no worries full steam
ahead and so after a little bit more
waiting time took me about 30 seconds I
spared you guys their waiting that 30
seconds for me it is now imported nature
starter kit to into my project fantastic
back over here in my scene we can see my
terrain here sitting here with not much
going on I'm going to start by giving it
some texture and if we have a look once
clicked on terrain in the inspector you
can see there's a whole bunch of buttons
along the top here these are our
controls to bring magic to the terrain
the middle one here paint texture
clicking on that we need to come down to
edit textures click on edit textures add
texture a couple of ways we can select
it by finding the texture from in here
and dragging it in or clicking select
and these are just the textures that
have come in from this
nature starter kit - and I have a look
around see what I want our ground a nice
grassy ground anything looks pretty good
I'm gonna add that and because there was
nothing on my terrain already the first
texture that's added gets added to the
entire terrain so it's not looking so
white and boring anymore
and add another texture or two while I'm
here I'll add this ground to add and
then add this ground number three I
might need to tweak it a little bit
later on but for now I just want to get
these things in there let's just make
sure they work paint paint paint yes and
undo okay so the way you go and paint a
specific texture as I was doing just now
I've got the brush size make sure you
clicked on the brush that you want this
brush is going to be a little bit hazy
around the edges this is going to have a
sharper look to it how you select the
brush size you're looking for and then
paint a texture straight onto your
terrain which is really cool that you
can do that straight onto there I love
that I'm gonna undo all this because
it's a little bit of craziness at the
moment and go to the next stage of the
process which is to actually put in a
character so as I'm running around I can
see what I'm creating so the purpose
here is to create something prototype II
I need to actually be flying around like
this by hitting my right mouse button
and the WASD Keys and pretending I'm a
character or actually getting a
character in there for this I'm going to
go to assets import package go down to
characters and again wait for that to do
its magic there we are here it's got a
whole bunch of stuff I'll just import
that straight in we're going for speed
here not worrying about whether we need
everything we will use it or not and
again after a little bit of a weight
that has been imported you can see
standard assets now we have characters
in here and a bunch of other stuff that
I didn't need but I wanted to go nice
and fast here we're looking for the
first person character and in here
you'll see some prefabs and we are going
to drop the FPS controller where shall I
put it I'm gonna put it right in the
middle of my world now drag that just in
there it's a prefab you can see it in
there it's got these white lines which
we know is going to be the camera and
how it looks if I click play and then I
can use my WASD keys to move around in
my mouse to look there we go we've got a
character running around in our world in
our terrain but it's pretty boring at
the moment hit escape turn
off play let's go in there and give this
a little bit of magic I'm going for now
to turn off my controller saw the gizmos
and stuff don't get in the way of what
we're trying to do because we want to
make a little map and depending upon the
sort of gain that you're looking to
create you'll make a different map you
might have something that is for a
role-playing game where you want it to
feel like a forest you might have
something which is a space shooter game
a rail shooter you want to have it to
look like a alien planet for me I'm
gonna go for a forestry kind of look for
a I don't know an RPG type running
around in the world game as a
first-person RPG so what I need to do is
just map that out briefly and I'm gonna
do that by drawing on top of my terrain
so we've got our textures here I'm gonna
go to the brown and select a kind of
make a path through the world here not
exactly sure on the scale yet but I'm
gonna say the play is going to start
down the right curve around a little bit
go around a hill and around the back of
the hill and then perhaps we'll do a
loop there we go it's gonna be a loop
around a mountain now I like that idea
and perhaps over on this side there will
be so I'm gonna click on a different
texture here over here there will be
some some more mountains over there some
more mountains over there and maybe some
water or stuff somewhere haven't decided
that just yet okay so that's pretty
basic but that's going to be the the
construction of what we're doing you
guys can take a little bit more time put
a little bit more love into it but for
now we're just going fast and loose here
the next thing we need to do is raise
and lower our terrain at the murmurs
flat and flat is boring in video games
so let's well you know not all video
games but in this one that we're trying
to visualize we want to raise the
terrain if you click on raise lower and
get the brush size as large as you want
those oom in a little bit then I can
click and raise up the terrain by
holding down my left mouse button and
moving around you can see it's going
really fast and that's making jaggedy
edges if I move down the opacity then
everything will go a lot slower as I
move around and I can have a lot more
control over it
and make my brush size bigger then I can
increase larger kind of clumps at the
one point in time let me go and make
this mountain that I was talking about
before actually you know before I do
that you guys I'm gonna have a problem
if I want to create a valley or a river
because you can raise
lower let me lower holding shift and
moving around I'm lowering my terrain
but only back down to the ground level
so if I wanted to make some sort of
valley I can't the way that I get around
that is by clicking on the second button
which is paint height and that will
allow me to say a specific height I want
everything to go up - so if I say 100
and I in turn the opacity up so it goes
fast and then paint that scroll that a
little bit then you can see it plateaus
at a certain height and I go go around
and paint everything to 100 or I can
click the flatten button and blink
everything gets moved up to 100 and now
if I go back to the raise lower and make
it a little bit smaller on my brush hold
down shift oh and I'm going way too fast
with the opacity here I can make myself
some valleys by doing these indentation
type things here okay so you can see
that's indented into the world now a
terrain is a height map so basically
it's saying this point on the map just
here how high is it or how low is it you
can't have something that overhangs
something else each point is just a
specific height up and down in the world
and do a few of those things and let me
go and put a little bit of effort into
my mountain not a lot we're doing this
fast and loose while you guys are
watching I don't want you to have to sit
there for too long I play around with
this but I'm going to make a little bit
of mount any kind of things and you can
see what I've got this hard brush on you
can actually see the brush circle marks
that doesn't look too good so I'm going
to put a softer brush on and increase it
a little bit move around here probably
need it to be a little bit more opaque
there we go and I'm gonna go one level
up on my brush just so I'm not here too
long lift all this stuff up here okay
we've got our Mountain starting to take
shape
not yet amazing but it will be very soon
okay there we go and around here I was
going to do some more mountains and
stuff so quickly just plonk those in
it's a good idea to put mountains all
the way around the edge of your map
let's just play so I can show you why
that is move my guy so he's not in a
mountain just there good now you can see
ok I've still got him at ground level at
zero and I
my train up to where I'm moving up to
100 so he's way underground so on the Y
I'll move that to 100
oh yes and of course I turned him off so
it wasn't getting in the way now I can
click play he's at 100 if I run around
here I can see the world now that was
all looking pretty good the mountains
are blocking my view I like it if those
mountains weren't there I could see way
off into the horizon which for this type
of games not too bad but if I ran all
the way over to the edge of the map I
could see the end of the map so I want
to say don't go over there as just a way
of saying to the player you're not
supposed to be looking off the edge of
the map he's a good thing to do so let
us continue on that journey we are
painting raising our terrain just gonna
raise around the outside here already I
think it's looking pretty cool with this
I like I'm a fan of green I'm a green
grass kind of guy so that's why I'm
liking this at the moment let me just
scroll over here a little bit
if you accidentally click off you'll
lose all your tools you have to come
back over here to your tools again and
it's just make something fast fast and
loose nice pretty mountains happy happy
mouths I'm gonna do happy trees in a
moment I'm gonna do a bit of a Bob Ross
moment I'm very excited about that okay
there we go so there we have our raised
and lowered we've got a little bit of a
path going around a little bit of detail
and I'll put some more mountains up
closer to the path so that we say to the
player you're not really supposed to go
running off front of the path it's there
we go okay next we're gonna add some
details to our terrain and we're gonna
do that by clicking over here on the
tree
pink trees we need to add some trees add
a tree click on the selector that came
in pretty fast okay now we've got some
trees that have come in from the pack
we've got 301 I'll add that very quickly
then we'll edit trees add a tree and
we'll add 302 click Add add another tree
this time we're gonna add one of those
bushes will do Bush 3 how's that and add
that one there great now we've got three
trees to choose from trees are pretty
similar you paint them onto the world
let's have a think about where we want
to paint them probably over here I make
my brush a lot smaller if you make it
all the way down to one click on
three that will place one solitary tree
in the world which is really cool now
something to note is these aren't game
objects so everything else if we were to
go and create a 3d object cube and find
that cube in the world there it is I can
click on that cube I can move that cube
around I can change the scale of that
cube etc but this cube is a game object
whereas these trees are not these trees
are part of the terrain so I'm just
going to delete my cube there so I can't
click on them I can only go and edit
them by going back into the terrain
clicking on trees if I wish to remove
them I hold down shift and then paint
where the trees are so I place the trees
the same way as I place the textures by
clicking and placing very cool
I can increase the tree density so if I
increase my brush size and have a super
high density then wherever I paint my
brush but it always be full of trees if
I have my density lower then I'm going
to have a lot less trees in that spot ok
and you can get some variation by adding
some different sorts of trees I'm going
to just increase the density you can
change the height by saying tree height
random between this lower point and this
upper point is what I'm going to do to
get a little bit variation of my look in
my trees there and I'm generally putting
it around the path where I think my
player would be running on my mountain
here and so on
I'm gonna go a little bit more dense go
back to tree number one just go plump
plump plump put a ton of trees down
because I want to have this a very
Foresti interesting look to it I want to
say player you cannot go through there
and this is all simulation at the moment
right that's not really gonna look
amazing I think on the hills there but
there we go I've got a bunch of trees
let's once again jump into the game play
it see how it looks ok now we've got a
bunch of trees already it's looking
mountains and trees and you know that
tree doesn't look so good you can go in
and touch those things up if you want
I'm doing this very fast and loose at
the moment just to get the feel for it
and now I will put throwing a couple of
these little bushes along the edge of
the road you want to have a think about
logically where would these things be
placed these look pretty tiny my little
clumps of grass I'm gonna make them
bigger all the way up here
that's great brush size a little bit
and paint some of these guys along the
edge of where I think my player is going
to be bushes on the side of the road
okay that is adding trees the next thing
we're gonna do is add some grass and
click on the paint details edit details
down here and add grass texture
magnificent if we click on detailed
texture click our selector there and I'm
going to look for grass oh one add grass
oh one and then again I'm going to edit
details add grass texture and we will
add by selecting we will add grass Oh to
grass oh one and grass Oh to are also in
the standard assets named exactly the
same thing okay now the grass free some
of these bushes we just add there but
they're not trees as such if I click on
grass make my brush size a little bit
smaller and go plunk then I have a whole
bunch of grass in my world and I can
just paint them the same sort of way
lots of detail there now it looks kind
of a little bit fluorescent in my
opinion a little bit bright green if I
double click on the grass again so I can
edit it the healthy color here is at the
moment a very bright green I'm going to
change that to more of a more of a
sombre green I think of a sensible
grassy green and then for the dry color
so it's healthy color and dry color I'm
going to change that to something that's
a little bit too crazy again something
darker as well there we go okay now it's
very dense you can see the grass here
I'm going to hop into my player again
and see how it looks at the player level
you've always got to keep coming back to
how this looks for the player as you're
running around to make sure it makes
sense right down there at ground level
okay running along here my frame rates
chugging a little bit I've got 18 things
going on for you guys here at the moment
and oh okay you know what if we have
framerate issues often that's because
you can see down here it's trying to do
a lot of calculation of baking and
lighting jump over the lighting tab what
I find works really well is clicking off
auto-generate lighting that frees up my
computer it's not sitting there trying
to generate the lighting in a perfect
sense for everything that's
going on and then we can play around
with a little bit easier so back into
the game and as I run around okay we can
see there's a world there's trees
there's grass that I'm running through
okay the grass all looks pretty uniform
if you want to get a little bit of
variety into the grass I can come back
over here and click on my terrain click
on the paint details find the grass in
question we've got a couple of details
here we've got the max width so if I
increase it makes everything wider so
that's a minimum width and then the
maximum width so it's going to be
between this value and that value for
the width some of them would be why does
some going to be less wide and then the
minimum height the maximum height make a
little bit higher so the players feeling
like they're running through the grass
and then the noise spread just to get
that variation in there that I was
looking for that looks a lot more
undulating and different now I think
very cool and then if you want to get
some variety grab grass too and
intersperse that it's super bright at
the moment so we need to go in and
change the brightness on that a little
bit itself I'll just do this very
quickly okay a little bit more of a
brownie look at that I'm going to turn
the noise up on this as well and then
you can add a little bit of extra detail
in terms of your grass and your
environment plop some more under the
trees so you've got two types of grass
there's this flat grass texture that is
painted onto the ground and then you've
got this extra grass you can put in
there and you can put a bunch of whoops
right in front of the camera you can put
a bunch of this in your world to give it
that look now see how I'm painting down
here but I can't see it that's because
we can say the distance with which we
can see the grass that's to help us with
rendering so we're not seeing things way
off in the distance that we might not
need to see it popping in and out if you
go over to the COG down the right here
we can change the detail distance it's
80 at the moment we can make it smaller
so you'll see less or we can make it
super huge so you can see grass way off
in the distance if it's painted in there
and we paint something way off in the
distance and see if we can see it down
there yeah there we go way down the end
there wonderful so as the last little
touch I'm going to go and paint a little
bit more detail through here put some
more stuff in my world just so the
players running through something nice
and full click play see how it looks now
that we've created a terrain we've got
some undulation ups and downs we've got
some textures in there
okay and some grass and just our
first-person controller running through
the grass there's lots we can tweak
there's lots we need to do with lighting
and lots we need to do with the
character itself and actually making a
game what are we doing in the game but
this method of creating a quick terrain
allows us to visualize a game in a lot
more detail than just having a gray box
now grey box is a great way so just
having white things and and not having
textures and details it's great if you
want to quickly prototype your mechanics
and and focus just on mechanics but I
think having this sort of mechanism
where you actually put some detail in
there you can make better decisions
about your character and your story in
your world and and which features would
make sense if you're running around here
saying oh this is just kind of Pleasant
I like that then the sort of game
mechanics you might make might be
Pleasant mechanics rather than if you're
just looking at grey and white game
objects that don't have much meaning
then you're gonna change the game that
you make as a result and the very last
thing I'll do in here because I'm a
little bit OCD about these things is I
am going to find the skybox that came
with this asset pack and just drag that
up into the sky and say there we go look
how nice that looks when I click play as
a final look this is the quick terrain
world that we've made with trees and
mountains only two two textures in there
we could put a bunch more nice scarf in
the distance and already I'm thinking
about oh what cool kind of creatures
could be jumping out of here and what
sort of combat could I have what sort of
encounters what sort of RPG type game
might I be making in this instance or
what sort of FPS shooter okay I hope
that's been useful for you guys as
always I'd love to see what you come up
with so let us know if you've created a
game or you're working on a prototype
and you're using these techniques in
your game remember fast and loose is
sometimes an amazing way to get to the
point where you find that nugget of
inspiration and that nugget of
amazingness for your game so if you like
this video leave a like I'd love to hear
from you guys and I look forward to
seeing you in one of our courses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
