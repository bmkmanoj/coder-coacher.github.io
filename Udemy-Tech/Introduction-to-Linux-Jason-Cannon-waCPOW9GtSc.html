Linux they're referring to the Linux
operating system as a whole an operating
system is a collection of software that
manages hardware resources and provides
an environment where applications run
the operating system allows applications
to store information send documents to a
printer and interact with users for
example a Linux distribution is simply a
collection of software and applications
bundled together and distributed as a
single operating system for example one
Linux distribution might come with one
particular web browser installed while
another Linux distribution will come
with another web browser installed by
default you'll be able to browse the web
on either distribution but the specific
piece of software used to do that might
be different it's important to point out
here that the software that comes
installed by default can be changed if
you don't like the web browser that
shipped with the Linux distribution
you're using you can install another one
and use that one you can think of a
Linux distribution as a curated
collection of software that works well
together but you're more than free to
use the software and applications that
you like best before we continue I'd
like to point out that you'll often hear
the term distribution shortened to
distro also some people refer to the
various distributions as flavors what
every Linux distribution has in common
though is the Linux kernel again
typically when the term Linux is used it
refers to the Linux operating system as
a whole however it can refer to just the
Linux kernel as well the Linux kernel is
the core or the heart of the operating
system it's the layer that sits between
the hardware and applications said
another way it's the intermediary
between software and hardware however to
have a useful operating system you need
other components in addition to the
kernel these components can include
system libraries graphical user
interfaces email utilities web browsers
and other programs to summarize a Linux
distribution is the Linux kernel and a
collection of software that together
create an operating system by far the
two mo
popular Linux distributions used in
information technology departments and
by Linux professionals our Red Hat
Enterprise Linux and a bun too so if you
plan to use Linux in your current or
future career as a Linux system
administrator Linux systems engineer or
even a database administrator or
software developer then I highly
recommend focusing on these two Linux
distributions you can forget about the
literally hundreds and hundreds of Linux
distributions and choose between Red Hat
Enterprise Linux and a bun two if you
want to work for large traditional
organizations like financial
institutions transportation companies
telecommunication corporations large
retailers and healthcare organizations
then you should choose Red Hat by the
way to run Red Hat you need to pay for a
license however if there's really no
need to pay for a license if you're
going to be running Linux at home or
want something to practice on instead
use CentOS which is a Red Hat Enterprise
Linux derivative that's completely free
it's really red hat with the branding
and logos replaced with CentOS branding
if on the other hand you want to work
for a start-up or smaller more nimble
web-based companies like software as a
service type businesses social
networking sites smaller ecommerce
stores or practically any company that
relies heavily on cloud computing then a
bun - is the distribution for you if
you're using Linux strictly for Fon for
personal projects or just want to see
what other distributions have to offer
feel free to try out some other popular
distros like Linux Mint Debian magia
fedora
openSUSE Arch Linux and Slackware when
choosing a Linux distro for personal use
it mainly comes down to personal
preference and if you like most of the
software that comes installed by default
of course don't forget about CentOS and
a bun - they make great distros even for
personal use ultimately Linux is Linux
at the core no matter which choice you
make the Linux concepts are going to be
the same sure each distribution is going
to be a little different but if you can
do something on one distribution you'll
most likely be able to figure out how to
do it on another
what this really means is that you can't
make a wrong decision know that by
simply choosing a Linux distribution any
distribution you've already made the
right choice to recap a Linux
distribution is the Linux kernel and a
collection of software that together
create an operating system the two most
popular Linux distributions used in the
industry today are Red Hat Enterprise
Linux and a bun two if you want to gain
Red Hat experience without paying a
licensing fee then use CentOS as it's
really red hat with a branding and logos
replaced with CentOS branding if you
