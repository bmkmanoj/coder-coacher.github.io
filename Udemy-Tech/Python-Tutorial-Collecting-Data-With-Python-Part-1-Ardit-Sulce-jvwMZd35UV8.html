the course and this is one of the last
sections that we were having and in this
section we're going to dive into the
world of web applications with Python
and you have a website that you're
looking at is a web application built
with Python so this is what you're going
to build in this section now this was
built with Python and flask and also
we're using a PostgreSQL database in
here to store data and then we use
Heroku to deploy the application online
and as you see this is online now and it
can be accessed through this URL now
what is that well it's simple
but you can modify it and do whatever
you want to that in my case what I did
is you know I'm asking the users or
visitors to enter their email address
and their height and what the
application will do is one one once it
gets this pair of data from the user
it says the data to the database to the
server and then it calculates the
average height of all the users that
have been submitted data so forth and
then it sends the average to the user
that just submitted their email address
so it sends the average height by email
to the user so all this is automatic and
you know let me test this so you may
want to pass your email Dresden and your
height you know this also has some
restrictions you can not pass a height
of more than let's say 3 meters and you
press submit any once that is successful
the user will be sent to success page so
they get the confirmation that player
submission was successful and that the
user will get an email to their email
address email comes to sue so I send my
heart using my hotmail address and here
is the email that I got
and I'm using my gmail address to send
emails to the users and I used my
hotmail address as a visitor oh yeah you
gave this email automatically so the
height that I entered there was while 76
and this is a average height I know
that's some sort of confirmation email
and it also gives you the number of
people that have been registered this
far so yeah that's the application that
you're going to build I encourage you to
really learn how to do this this is
quite interesting and you learn a lot
from this you learn how to store data in
a database from your web application and
send data or via email to users and so
on so let's keep going and I'll talk to
you in the next lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
