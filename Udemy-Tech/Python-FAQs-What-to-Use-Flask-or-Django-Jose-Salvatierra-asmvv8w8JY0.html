my students is should I use flask or
Django and the answer there isn't a
right and wrong answer but of course
there are some things that you should be
aware of before you start with either of
those frameworks the first thing of
course is what do they do so normally
when my students have come to me and
they ask me this question they already
know what flasks in general do more or
less but in simple terms flask and
Django map URLs things that users type
in their browsers they map those two
functions in Python that can run so
whenever a user visits a particular site
the function will run and it will do
things I will then return some data and
it can return for example web sites and
pages and things like that so why would
you use one over the other
well flask is much simpler Django is
more complicated flask does a lot less
for you Django does a lot more for you
so when you start Django up you can ask
it to give you a website with a database
connection user administration and so
forth whereas flask just won't won't do
that and now you may be thinking of
course Django is the right choice right
it gives you more stuff why not go for
that well there is a problem with
getting stuff for free which is that you
didn't write that code and that means
that particularly for somebody who
doesn't have as much experience with
Python having there a bunch of code that
you're meant to use and extend but
you've not written can be quite
confusing you don't know what that code
maybe means exactly you don't know how
to change things that code already comes
with some structure that you're meant to
then follow on your subsequent code and
that can be quite confusing there's a
there's a big learning curve there on
Django as you learn about Python you
also have to learn but how Django does
things because it does things in a very
particular way so here comes the summary
on when I would use flask and jangle use
flask if you are a Python beginner or
somebody who doesn't have a tremendous
of web experience and Python experience
useful ask if you want complete freedom
over what you do in your code and you
want to know everything about how your
code is working and operating and what's
inside your code and also use flask if
you want to build simple web apps like a
REST API is Internet of Things apps
small websites and so forth naturally
I'll also say when I think you should
use Django which is when you meet the
following criteria if you have Python
experience and ideally you also have
some web development experience because
Django is gonna give you a bunch of
stuff you have to be able to understand
what it gives you and the second is when
you want to build a web app that is
slightly more complicated than your sort
of average web app when you want things
like user administration panels when you
want your administrator users to be able
to go in there and change user
permissions and things like that
Django gives you that right off the bat
and when you want to do things like
database connectivity built in a very
sound way which can be more complicated
overall when you want a web app that's
maybe in a in a higher level so if you
have experience and you want something
like that I would definitely use Django
although it means learning a bit more
about
if you're keen to use flasks here comes
the shameless plug if you continue to
learn flasks and you want me to teach
you that then use the link in the
description below and I shall gladly
guide you through flask I've got a bunch
of courses on udemy and they one link
below will guide you through beginning
Python all the way up to creating web
applications using flask and that means
serving they have content pages websites
to your users storing things in a
MongoDB database and a lot more stuff so
that's a great course that you can take
if you're interested in learning flask
but if not hopefully answering this
question was useful for you and I'll see
you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
