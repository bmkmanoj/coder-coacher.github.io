an iOS and watch OS developer and I'm
also one of the cofounders of the app
brewery and today I'm gonna take you
through the entire journey of building
an app from beginning to end now through
my time working as an iOS developer I've
worked in teams large and small and also
been at the helm as a CTO for one of my
own app based companies and I'm very
fortunate to have been recognized for
some of the work that I've done
throughout the years today I'm going to
teach you how to make an app from
beginning to end
going from idea validation through to
how you would design the app through to
how you would monetize your app as well
as development and marketing your app in
order to get downloads on the App Store
so it's gonna be a whirlwind tour of the
entire process and I hope you're ready
because we're gonna get started so it
doesn't matter if you have an idea
already or if you're still in the
process of brewing one this is one of
the most important parts of your app
development journey how do you figure
out if your app idea is a good one how
do you know if it's worth spending your
time and your money and your energy to
build this app how do you know if it's
gonna be a good one so one of the first
pieces of advice that I give to students
is to talk to absolutely everybody if
you're on a plane
talk to your air hostess about your app
idea if you're in a supermarket talk to
your checkout cashier about your idea
everybody has a valid opinion and by
doing this you might just come across
somebody who has a unique insight or who
might be one of your apps customers in
the future and people who will give you
advice along the way now whenever I tell
people this the first question I always
get is should I ask for an NDA or what's
known as a nondisclosure agreement now
this for those you guys who don't know
is basically a piece of legal
that sort of prevents anybody from
stealing your idea but of course you
would need the legal console to be able
to back up that piece of paper and it's
rarely done and one of my friends who
works on Sand Hill Road so where a lot
of the venture capitalists are based in
Silicon Valley you know he said that if
a founder comes to him and the first
thing they do is to slide an NDA across
the table many knows almost instantly
that this guy is a newbie because
anybody who's built anything worthwhile
will know that the idea is only such a
small part of the success of the product
and there's so much more to it including
a lot of blood sweat and tears and a lot
of hard work so my answer to this
question is emphatically no try and get
advice from as many people as you can
without putting them off by having to
sign an NDA in most cases if it's a
really good idea you can bet that
probably five or six people across the
world already have the same idea and
some of them are working on it and some
of them are trying to get people to sign
NDA's now the next thing that you need
to do is a little bit of market research
so what go on to Google go on to the App
Store search for variations of your idea
and see if anybody's already created it
now the important thing to remember is
that if somebody has already created
your idea that doesn't necessarily mean
that you can't make it because you might
have unique domain knowledge you might
know more about the topic than the other
people who are making it but there are
also other things like you might create
an app with a better user experience you
might create one that's far better
designed than the existing products
there are unique angles that you can
approach in every single idea and
remember that Facebook wasn't the first
social network and Google wasn't the
first search engine so don't let it put
you off but let it inform you
you need to be aware of who your
competitors are what stage they are at
and what is their development process
and you can do a little bit of online
sleuthing to find out all of this now if
you don't yet have an app idea that you
want to work on then I want you to keep
in mind this phrase now I first came
across this phrase when I was at
Stanford and I came across this talk by
Guy Kawasaki now for those who guys who
don't know who he is he's probably one
of the first employees at Apple and his
official title was something like chief
evangelist whatever that means right but
he said something that really stuck with
me and he said that as a start-up
founder or as any sort of product maker
when you're going about your day to day
life you should always keep this phrase
in mind and it's if this then what now
what does that mean let me illustrate
this with an example
now back in 2016 there was this article
in The New York Times and it had a title
of something like how to make anybody
fall in love with you or something like
that and it was an article if that
described the research of a sociologist
who found that if you get two strangers
to ask each other intimate questions
that you might not ask a stranger or
tell a stranger you know there were
questions like if your mom and dad were
both drowning in the sea who would you
say first and really intimate questions
that you probably wouldn't ask a tinder
date right but he found that if you got
strangers to do this it would accelerate
their feelings of intimacy towards each
other and I found that article
completely fascinating and I remember
seeing it all over my social media it
came up on Twitter on Facebook again and
again people were sharing it they were
liking it and there was a lot of
interest around it so I thought to
myself if this then what and I thought
if people were interested in it then
they
probably want to give it a go right
maybe on their next tinder date but
looking at a dense article on a phone is
a terrible user experience you would
have to zoom in zoom out pan around to
try and find the right questions it's
really not that fun so I thought what if
I spent two hours building an app that
made the process a lot easier so I
created an app that would split the
screen into two and you could lay your
phone onto the table and both people can
read the questions the right way round
and the app would tell them whose turn
it is and who should go next and to
complete the experiment the sociologists
made these two strangers stare into each
other's eyes for four minutes straight
so I implemented that as well into the
app even though it seemed kind of creepy
I was trying to stay true to the
original research so then I uploaded it
to the app store didn't really think
anything of it went to sleep and then a
few days later the app went viral it was
shared on product hunt and there were
thousands upon thousands of downloads
all because of this one phrase if this
then what so I urge you as you go about
your day when you come across something
that's slightly strange or makes you
think then keep this phrase in mind and
you might just stumble across some
really good app ideas or even business
ideas now the next thing that works
really well for app ideas is when you
scratch your own itch so when you come
across a problem during your day-to-day
life
it could be during your commute it could
be at your workplace it could be when
you're studying something that just
completely frustrates you and you think
why why does this problem exist
well those problems if you come up with
a good solution tend to be really good
app ideas because you know as much as
we'd like to thing that we're unique if
you have a problem you can bet that's
somebody else across the world probably
experiences the same
pain with the same problem and if you
can create an app that addresses that
problem and create a solution that you
love then you can be sure that other
people would love it as well so the next
time you come across a problem
don't just resolve the complaining about
it think if you come up with an idea
that might solve that problem for
yourself and others now the next type of
app ideas are what you might call der
app ideas so this is when you go to your
supermarket cashier or you go to your
airhostess and you tell them about your
app idea and they say well duh of course
it should exist it should have existed
yesterday here's my money please take it
from me so I can buy this app that you
are going to build well this is the dirt
type of app and in order to achieve this
kind of reaction there's two important
things in the mix one is of course
having an idea that generates that kind
of reaction something's so obvious
something that they really see the
appeal of but to also being able to
express your idea in a way that anybody
can instantly just get it so let's look
at some of these der statements from
successful companies that we know and
love
for example Evernote remember everything
who wouldn't want a second brain where
you can stash all the bits of knowledge
that you can't remember well duh right
or nest saving energy is a beautiful
thing who can argue with that saving
energy is a beautiful thing or github
build software better together so when
you come up with an idea think about how
you can express the core concept of it
in a single der like statement that
generates interest and when you talk to
people it seems entirely obvious why
your app should exist now the next type
of app idea I want to talk about are
apps that fulfill a market vacuum so a
market vacuum is when there is a
customer demand or a customer
that is as of yet unmet by any existing
product or service so for example back
when the iPhone 4s came out and the S
stood for Siri by the way so the iPhone
4 with Siri Apple did a really good job
of marketing Siri now we know today
after you know series been alive and
well for many years that she's not that
bright and she's probably only really
good for reminders and timers as far as
I can tell but people didn't know that
back then they were sold on this idea of
the virtual assistant the PA who you
didn't have to pay and a whole bunch of
really awesome sounding taglines
that came from Apple and various
journalists so people were really
excited but the problem was that not
everybody could upgrade to an iPhone 4s
right you might be on the Android
ecosystem or you might have just bought
a brand new phone and you didn't want to
upgrade so that was a market vacuum and
there was a company that spotted that
market vacuum and they created say hi
translate and what this app does is that
you could press on one of the buttons to
speak to the phone as if it were a real
human and it would talk back at you in
your language of choice and it's like as
if there's a little translator that
lives inside your phone and it simulates
that whole Syria experience that you're
lusting after and by filling that market
vacuum the people who made this app went
on to do really really well because they
filled the vacuum now let's look at
another example if you haven't heard a
flappy bird then I have to be incredibly
jealous of you because I think that
means that you spent the last two years
on a Caribbean island with low Wi-Fi
signals because this was an inch
net sensation everybody wanted to flap
their birds now for those guys who don't
know it's basically this game where you
get a slightly chubby bird who has to
flap its wings to navigate through a
whole bunch of pipes in order to get as
far as possible and everybody got
obsessed with this app because of how
difficult it was and you could see
Twitter light up with people angry about
how infuriating this app was and yet how
addictive they were to it but the drama
came when one day the developer released
a statement and said flappy bird was
designed to play in a few minutes when
you are relaxed but it happened to
become an addictive product I think it's
become a problem to solve that problem
it's best to take down flappy bird it's
gone forever
I mean life doesn't get much more
dramatic than this in the developer
world this was it so he pulled the app
overnight off the App Store and it was
gone forever literally and people
couldn't flap their Birds anymore and
you have no idea how much anxiety are
created in everybody that they could no
longer flap their little chubby bird so
by now you might recognize that this has
opened up a market vacuum literally
overnight and the developers who saw it
as that the first ones who try to fill
that vacuum stood to gain the most and
today you couldn't literally flap
anything you want you can flap a troll
you could flap a chicken you could even
flap a turd if you so wished and the
developers who were the first to
recognize this market vacuum stood to
gain the most so look around you for
market vacuum
opening up everyday and see how you can
target them and close off that vacuum
using your app so now that you're
certain that you've got a good app idea
something that's gonna be a real big
hitter it closes off a market vacuum or
it scratches your own it whatever it may
be the next step you need to take with
that idea is to design it and very often
you hear people ask well why do I care
about design isn't it enough that it's a
really good idea or that I coded up
really well I think about this currently
there's around 2 million apps on the iOS
App Store and about 2.5 million on the
Android App Store that is a lot of apps
and when you release your app to those
app stores it's literally like a drop in
the ocean
so in order to differentiate yourself
you have to be able to appeal to
people's emotions as well as their logic
you have to make people love your app
and we know that loving an app doesn't
come from how well it works or how it
doesn't crash or how you know it saves
all your data every single time but it
comes from the design plus if you think
about it it only takes three taps for
all of your blood sweat and tears to be
completely wiped off their phone that's
all it takes
and the scary statistics are that
apparently out of a hundred apps that
gets downloaded off the App Store 50 of
them gets deleted after the first time
they're opened so you don't want that to
happen to your baby right so that's why
we have to think about design now that's
a good question
what exactly is good design so it's a
little bit like a mythical beast right
like a unicorn you'll probably know it
when you see it but actually both apple
and
Google provide guidance on this so apple
produces a delightful piece of bedtime
reading it's a little bit thicker than
what you're used to and it's got a
fantastic title called iOS human
interface guidelines if any book ever
flew off the shelves it's not this one
but it does describe how you should lay
out your app how you should design the
animations or the interactions in order
for it to feel like it fits in with the
iOS environment and Google has something
similar called the material design
principles that shows you how to make
the best Android looking and feeling
apps out there so these are great things
to take a look at and if you have a look
in the description box below I've got a
whole bunch of links for you that link
towards all of these resources that I
mentioned during this talk now once
you've got a good grounding of what
Apple and Google think is good design
the next thing to do is take a look at
some of these mobile pattern websites so
one is patterns without the vowels
obviously because startups don't have
vowels and another one is mobile -
patterns and what they do is they
collect and categorize screenshots from
some of the best designed apps out there
so that means when you're designing a
particular part of your interface for
example you're looking to create a news
feed for your app then why not take a
look at how Twitter does it how Facebook
does it and I'm not saying you know
steal these ideas from these incredibly
well-paid designers but I'm saying more
like be inspired by their designs so
once you know roughly what your designs
are going to look like the next step is
to choose a color palette and one of my
favorite tools is something called color
hunter Yuu and here you have a bunch of
professional designers who have cure
didn't collected some of their favorite
palettes so you can search by hot or
popular and you can copy down the hex
codes of some beautiful palettes for
your project as well
now if you're even lazier than that then
there's a website called flat UI colors
which is a 15 color color palette that
was specially formulated for the iOS
environment so for example you might
notice that this shade of wisteria is
the exact shade of purple that the yo
app uses for their app icon or if you've
ever used any of the seven minute
workout apps you'll notice that they've
basically just taken all of these colors
and used it to color their app now if
you're an Android developer then there's
a website called material palette comm
and here you can select two colors that
you like and it will automatically
generate an aid color color palette
complete with an accent tone so once
you've seen some mobile patterns and
you've got your color palette the next
step is to create what's called a user
flow diagram and use a flow diagram maps
out the journey that a user might take
through your app for a specific task so
how they go about checking out an item
or how might they create a recipe in
your app and the beauty of this is that
it's drawn pencil on paper it takes
maybe a few seconds to change and rub
out and modify until you're happy with
the flow and once you are then the next
step is to create what's called a
wireframe so wireframes are low-fidelity
representations of your apps design so
they're usually drawn pencil on paper
and it shouldn't take you more than half
an hour to do a quick wireframe for an
idea that you have and once you've
created your wireframes you can even
link them together using something
called pop
now pop allows you to take pictures of
your wireframes link them together
through interaction buttons and then you
end up with a working app that you've
just drawn up 15 minutes ago so it's a
really really cool tool and will teach
you how to use that within the course as
well now the next step up from
wireframes are what designers call
mock-ups so mock-ups
unlike wireframes are high fidelity
representations of your design so it's
almost like you've gone into the future
and you've taken a screenshot of this
app that doesn't yet exist and you
captured it to show venture capitalists
or your developer team in order to get
the end product the app that you create
looking exactly the way that you wanted
to and this is really the beauty of
mock-ups
if you tell a developer you know I want
a news feed then you might not get the
nicest news but if you were to create a
mock-up then they would try to keep to
the design that you've made
now mock-ups can be made in lots of
different design software anywhere from
Photoshop with illustrator or sketch or
Marvel there's a whole bunch of tools
out there that you can use but if you
are the designer developer if you're
going to code up the app and build it
yourself you don't always need to create
mock-ups because when you're creating
your app in Xcode you have the
opportunity of creating the designs
within the software itself so you
wouldn't have to duplicate your work
inside a design software as well as
inside your programming software so
that's what I tend to do if I'm building
an app just for myself
now if you want to design a mock-up
without having to learn how to use
Photoshop or sketch you can actually use
a website called UX pin to simply drag
and drop different elements onto your
iPhone screen so for example you can
drag on a calendar or you can drag on
buttons to make it look the way that you
want it to now while you're creating
your designs if you are the disc
then you might need some other assets as
well and it's really important that you
can't just take images off google search
because some images are copyrighted so
you could potentially be getting a
letter from their lawyer sometime down
the line and it would be terrible if you
have this huge hit of an app only to
have to pay compensation to somebody so
be really careful when you find designs
that you want to put into your app now a
safer bet is the look for design assets
that are Creative Commons or websites
allow you to use their icons for free
and the key phrase here is free for
commercial use now here are some of my
favorite resources one is a website
called icon store where professional
designers have designed these beautiful
packages of icons so they have the same
look and feel as each other and the best
part is that they're free for commercial
use now if you needed HD images to use
as the background of your apps then you
can find huge collections of beautiful
hipstery
HD images from reese lashed and unsplash
and remember that if you want to look at
any of the resources just head into the
description box and I've included all of
the links there for you now I can't
stress enough how important it is to
design your app a lot of people make the
mistake of jumping headfirst into
programming it only to realize a month
down the line that ah I should really
change you know screen to should become
screen 3 or this button should go to
that screen instead and the problem is
that when you want to make those kind of
changes and you've really got the code
written down then ripping bits of code
out or trying to implement different
functionality can be extremely time
consuming and difficult and that's why
the process that I'm describing to you
and the one that I'll teach you inside
the course is all about taking it step
by step going from use a flow diagram to
wireframe to may be mock-up and then
prototyping and only then do you go into
Xcode or Android studio to build your
because something that might take you a
few seconds to rub out on your user flow
diagram will end up taking you a month
of development time when you need to
change it inside Xcode but what do you
do after you've designed your app so you
know your app idea is a great one you've
designed it to look and feel and behave
exactly the way you want it to what's
the next step well you might think it's
getting into the programming and
developing it but it's actually thinking
about the monetization strategy and this
is something that you should bear in
mind before you start developing your
app and not as an afterthought so I'm
going to talk through some of the most
common monetization strategies for apps
and the cases in which you might use
each one so the first one that a lot of
people would have heard of because this
term is brandished about a lot is the
freemium model so this is where you
download the app for free and you get
around maybe 60 to 80% of all the
features of the app but then in order to
get the premium features you would have
to pay in order to unlock the paywall
and this can be a one-time payment for
example removing ads or it could be a
recurring payment now this type of model
works really well if you have an app
that has frequent daily usage and it has
a high perceived value to the user so
these are services almost like for
example your Dropbox or your Spotify and
the reason is because only if the user
has integrated it into their workflow or
into their daily life does this model
start making more money rather than if
it was an outright paid for app so think
about what type of app that you have or
you're building then try to fit the
monetization model to it the next model
I want to talk about are in-app
purchases so this can be real say if
you're selling t-shirts or if you're
taking people around in uber cars but it
can also be virtual so things like
gems or energy or time or lightning
bolts whatever it may be now the
important distinction is that if your
in-app purchases are virtual then they
need to go through the Apple payment
gateway and during that process both
Apple and Google will take off 30% of
whatever it is that be in app purchase
cost so of course that kind of margin is
not sustainable if you're selling
t-shirts right so that's why they allow
you to use alternative payment gateways
if you are indeed providing the user
with real-life goods and that is
something you should think about ahead
of time now there's a few more types of
monetization models that I want to run
through one is white labeling so for
example if you were a gym and you wanted
an app built and the features that you
might want include maybe allowing users
to book the classes maybe the users
should be able to update their
membership details or update their
payment methods and but the thing is
these features aren't unique to your gym
every gym if they wanted an app would
need these sorts of features so you find
one gym that wants to have this app and
then you reskin the app in order to have
their custom branding and color palette
and then you sell it to another gym and
another gym and another gym and so on so
that means that you develop once and you
sell many many times now that works well
if you have contacts or domain knowledge
in a particular niche and you want to
build apps almost as templates that you
can resell again and again now the next
monetization strategy I want to talk
about that's becoming increasingly more
and more important is ads now perhaps
more on the Android system than the iOS
system people are becoming more and more
reluctant to pave apps instead they're
willing to suffer through interstitial
ads and banner ads and having the screen
taken up by a lot of advertising but
this is the truth and
we as app developers have to deal with
it somehow now personally I'm not a huge
fan of ads because as we spoke about
before you know I've spent weeks even
months just tweaking the designs
redesigning making new prototypes
sketching it out again just to get it
pixel perfect and make it look beautiful
and then a fifth of the app screen is
taken up by clash of clans and that
somehow just really hurts me inside and
having the iOS ecosystem being my
predominant market you can almost get
away without having to use ads as long
as you can create good enough apps but
for clients or for Android then this is
a really important monetization strategy
that you need to get to grips with
now another monetization strategy that's
relatively new is the partnership model
and this is usually when you involve one
large advertiser and incorporate them
into your app so as an example one of
the first apps that implemented this
we'd RunKeeper where if you ran a
challenge say 5,000 meters like say a 5k
or a 10k run then you would be rewarded
with things that had real-life value for
example 10% of Nike shoes or 20% off
added US shorts whatever it may be but
it would reward your behavior in the app
with real-life goods now if you think
about it all three parties who are
involved in this process they all
benefit so your developer benefits
because they get paid by the advertiser
the advertiser benefits because they get
to show their products and they get to
be in front of their target audience and
your users benefit too because not only
is encouraging them to run more it's
also giving them some real life benefits
so if there is any way that you have
links with maybe retail or real life
companies that you can get to sponsor
your app and you in turn
precise them to their target audience
then this tends to work really really
well now the last monetization strategy
that I'm going to talk about that
nobody likes talking about because it's
a bit of a problem child in the world of
app monetization and this is selling
your users data for money now you might
not believe this but if you look inside
your health and fitness apps especially
inside the privacy policy hidden beneath
layers and layers of legal jargon is the
right to sell your in-app data
associated with your account be it your
name your date of birth whatever it may
be and you can see that ethically it has
some issues because you probably don't
want this data getting into the hands of
health insurance companies or life
insurance companies without your
explicit agreement so this is not a
strategy that I encourage not only
because it's kind of unethical but also
because the big app stores Apple and
Google are cracking down on this and if
you do end up getting banned by Apple or
Google then they remove all of your apps
from the App Store and prevent you from
uploading any more to these markets so
it's something that is good to be aware
of as an app user yourself but it's
something that I don't encourage using
as a monetization strategy as an aside
if you are really keen and you didn't
mind giving your data away without your
way where you can sell your own data so
your browsing history or your app usage
data or your health and fitness data for
something like 40 pounds a year so
something like maybe $60 a year if
you're interested there are these
opportunities out there now finally
we've showed ourselves that we have a
great app idea we've designed our app to
look and feel beautiful we know exactly
how we're gonna make money from our app
once it's on the App Store
and now it comes to the main event how
do you develop your app how do you turn
it from these ideas and designs on paper
into something that you can hold and use
in your own hands well that is where the
programming part and the app development
part comes in now there's many ways of
developing an app and I'm gonna go from
most expensive way to least expensive
way of doing this so the most expensive
way is going to a physical shop so I
live in London there's a lot of great
app development boutiques and you get to
sit down with a designer a developer the
people who'll be working on your project
you get to talk to them about your ideas
and you know flesh out what it is that
you want made and you can be close to
the development process of your app
every step of the way
now the reason why most people can't
afford to do this is because you're
gonna need to budget anywhere between
80,000 and 150,000 per app so Android or
iOS in order to get this kind of service
now part of that is because you're
paying for the expertise and advice and
guidance of designers developers but
another part of that is that rent in
London is extremely expensive I would
know so if it's so instead of paying
somebody who's based in the UK you can
also find a freelancer who's based
elsewhere maybe somewhere where it's
cheaper to rent an office mostly in use
Eastern Europe or parts of Asia and the
really important thing here is to make
sure that you select your freelance
developer or development team really
carefully and make sure that you vet
them properly now here's a bit of a
horror story from one of our students on
one of our a perera programming boot
camps so she had this idea to develop an
app and she approached a team that were
based in China over one of these online
websites like Elance or oDesk where you
can find freelance development teams and
you may or may not know but there's
two ways of paying freelance developers
you can either pay per hour of work they
do or you can pay a per milestone so you
pay them a set amount once they've
reached 20 percent completion 40 percent
completion 60 percent etc now she was at
80 percent completion the app was so
close to being done and they'd shown her
the intermediate apps and she'd been
testing them on her own phone and it was
all going so well but then when it did
reach 80 percent she got a call from
them over Skype and they said to her
that something terrible has happened
their company had been raided by the
police in China they had all of the
computers taken along with all of the
work that included her app and they said
that one solution might be that if she
was willing to pay an extra ten thousand
pounds then they could bribe the Chinese
police and try to get their stuff back
now at this point she rightly started
getting very suspicious of this team and
actually ended up walking away without
having her app completed because she was
scared that she couldn't trust this team
so what if they put down some code that
would end up stealing her customers
credit card details or something dodgy
like that and this is one of the reasons
why when you work with a freelance
development team abroad where you can't
meet up with them regularly you have to
make sure that you interview them more
than once so face the face or over scope
and you also have to make sure that you
speak to some of their past clients and
see some of their past projects that
they've built this way you can try and
figure out what the work what the
experience is like working with them and
most of these teams if they are
legitimate should be able to give you a
contact of somebody who's based in the
same country as you are who have worked
with them before and you can talk to
them about what it was like working with
that team now this still carries a
pretty high price tag you're looking at
anywhere between thirty thousand and
fifty
thousand to develop an app through a
freelance team so now we've come to the
cheapest solution and the most
customizable and that is building the
app yourself now at the out brewing
we've run in person program boot camps
for over three years and we've seen
hundreds of students come through who
have been able to build their own apps
and become app entrepreneurs now even if
you don't want to be a developer
yourself it would still be a huge
benefit to be able to look at code and
understand what's roughly going on and
also to be able to estimate how long
would it take to build a particular
feature or how much it should cost to
build it and these are all valuable
skills that will stay with you and that
benefit will appreciate over time as
well and it's a lot easier than you
think it is at the a brewery we've
taught over a thousand students in
person and over fifty thousand students
online and we know that a lot of people
have come from different backgrounds
with no programming knowledge at all and
they've been able to build crazy
wonderful apps after completing the
course going on to develop a company or
continue to work as a developer so it's
very much within your capabilities but
once you've developed the app what is
the next step well you need to get
downloads right you need to be able to
market your app so people will hear
about it and will be able to download it
and there's some skills involved in that
now back in the days when the App Store
first came about it was really the
golden era because you can make any old
app and somebody would download him
because there wasn't much choice and I'm
convinced that if I time-traveled back
and I took a picture of my own face and
made it an app that is called take a
look at Angela's face app and it did
nothing other than to display a selfie
of me then people would still download
it and probably even buy it that was
just the world back then but today it's
a
very different place there's a lot of
other apps that you have to compete with
so when you search for something like
ninja games on the App Store there are
hundreds if not thousands of apps are
targeting that keyword so you need to
learn various skills and tricks in order
to be able to rank highly and also to
get people to know about your app and
get downloads for your app but before
you do any marketing you don't want to
market a bad app and buy bad I mean a
buggy app so if something wasn't working
so you have to make sure that you test
your app extensively before you put it
onto the App Store and put a lot of
effort into marketing it because if you
market a really buggy app you're just
gonna end up with lots and lots of bad
reviews which is not what you want now
here's a trick that I like to do for
some types for certain types of a
plancha z' say that my target market is
the US and the UK what I can do is I can
release the app to smaller countries
that match the demographics of my target
audience so for the US and UK the
smaller mirroring demographic tends to
be Canada New Zealand for me and what
you do is that three months ahead of the
main release you release your app only
to Canada and New Zealand and then you
watch the reviews and the feedback that
you're getting from these real users
because some of them will have feature
requests some of them will discover bugs
and they'll give you a lot of really
useful feedback which you can act on to
improve your app and once these users
are loving your app then you can be
pretty sure that your main markets will
love it as well so that's just a quick
tip for beta testing for free
essentially now what happens on launch
day now it's really important to think
about your launch day so that's the day
when your app goes live on the App Store
ideally what you want is to have a large
list of people ideally their email
people who have signed up before saying
that they want to download your app once
it's available and you can achieve this
by building a landing page for your app
so what we tend to say is that before
you design your app before you develop
your app before you'd lay down a single
line of code the first thing you need to
do is to create a landing page for your
app it doesn't have to be very it
doesn't have to be fancy it can just be
a one pager that briefly describes what
your app is about but most importantly
it has an email collection box and this
will allow the people who are interested
in downloading your app to put their
email down and that means that on launch
day you'll be able to hit up 10,000 or
20,000 of these potential users who will
download your app on your launch day and
both app stores Apple and Google look at
your metrics over the first 24 hours 7
days and 30 days to see how you perform
on a range of things like how many app
downloads how many times your app will
oak was opened how many people how many
people left a review how good the
reviews were etc and that first 24 hours
is really really important to get your
app noticed and possibly start ranking
on the App Store's now if you're a web
developer then you'll know how easy it
would be to create this landing page but
if you're not a web developer then
there's a whole bunch of tools such as
WordPress or Squarespace and even
something called app stop which allows
you to put in the URL of your app on
iTunes and it will automatically
generate a landing page for you grabbing
the data from your iTunes listing so
it's another resource that's worth
looking at now AB marketing is not just
about bringing in new users or your
existing user base download your app
it's also trying to target people who
are already searching on the App Store
for something that they're looking for
and the scary statistic is that the top
5 apps for a particular search term so
for example if I searched for
ninja games on the App Store and the top
five apps that show up account for 72%
of all the downloads and that's pretty
scary and the top app alone takes 35% so
that's why you also need to learn about
App Store optimization now some of you
might have heard of search engine
optimization or SEO and that's when you
try to get your website to rank highly
on Google because we all know that
nobody looks at page three or page four
of Google right so App Store
optimization is about how do you get
your app as close to the top of the
search screen as possible and the real
secret to this is knowing which keywords
to target what are the words what are
the things that a lot of people are
searching for but not many apps are
targeting and a process that you can
follow to do this is by using a reverse
dictionary now a reverse dictionary is
not is not as a source because the
thoris has give you synonyms so if I
search for happy I might get the word
joy but reverse dictionaries give you
all the words that are used in the same
context or or in conjunction with the
word that you're searching for so for
example if you searched for coffee you
might get Java you might get beans you
might get espresso and what you'll
realize is that a reverse dictionary
gives you a whole bunch of words that
make really good keywords and then you
stick all of these keywords through a
service like sense a tower or a penny
which can give you some analytics and
insights into each of these words and
you look at how much traffic each of
these words get so the higher the
traffic the better and you also look at
how much competition each of these words
have and the lower the competition the
better
that means there's less apps that are
trying to target those words and for
sensor tower at least
the sweet spot is when the traffic index
is above three and the difficulty index
is below three those tend to be good
keywords to target now when you upload
your app to the App Store on the iOS App
Store you'll actually get a box where
you get to put in the keywords you want
to target but with the Android App Store
so the Google Play Store you actually
have to you actually have to sprinkle
your keywords inside your description
and inside your title much like SEO in
websites now there's only so much that I
can cover in an hour and I could
probably talk about all of these topics
for days and days on end
so if you're interested in learning more
then be sure to take a look at the link
below where for a limited time you'll be
able to get 95% off of my gigantic 43
hour course which is normally priced at
200 pounds but you'll be able to get it
today at $15 now before I leave you
there's just three final tips that I
want to give you if you're going to
start the journey of creating your very
own app the first thing is keep your
apps simple as simple as you can manage
don't try and build every single feature
that you could possibly want into your
app in the first instance just as if you
were learning mechanics
you wouldn't first start by building a
car because you might get stuck you
might end up with just one wheel so you
would start by making maybe a skateboard
right keep your app simple make it a
Minimum Viable Product with only the
core feature that you want to have and
then once you've got that and once
you've uploaded to the App Store you can
listen to user feedback you can see what
other features are people willing to pay
for and from there then build your
product up give it more features and
flesh it out more and make it more
capable the next tip is if you do any
marketing at all you're already above
ninety five percent of all the
independent developers and it gives you
a real leg up in the app stores so it's
well worth doing
and finally just do it it's a lot easier
than you imagined it to be right now and
I will be there teaching you every step
