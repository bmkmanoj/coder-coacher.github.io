now we've been told in this topology
that PC 1 is not able to ping PC 2 so
let's do some investigation in this
example PC 1 is actually an iOS router
some running iOS v within gns3 show up
here after shows us that they are no
rats on this rada acting as a pc if you
see outputs such as this default gateway
is something and the IP routing table
isn't displayed but you see something
such as ICMP redirect cache is empty
it's probably because routing has been
disabled on this router so notice this
command no IP routing that simply turns
to this router into an expensive a very
basic PC so if it was a physical router
you essentially disabling the
functionality of the Rotter 10 PC 1 ping
PC 2 based on the information that we've
been given as you can see in the output
it's not able to ping PC to notice we're
getting u dot u dot u u means
unreachable that means that PC 1 is
forwarding traffic to a router which
could be router 1 and that router
doesn't have a route to the remote
network that this host resigns on
now to speed things up I'm going to use
the command know IP domain lookup and
then I'm going to trace route 210 at 103
to 2
so notice we are able to get to rod 110
1 1 1 but rod one doesn't know where to
forward the traffic so there seems to be
a problem on router one songwriter 1
show IP interface brief this looks
correct this IP address is configured on
this interface gigabit 2 0 1 this IP
address is configured on this interface
gigabit to 0 0 can write a 1 ping router
- the answer is yes it can initial ping
failed because it was doing an op for
the MAC address of routed to so let's
have a look at the writing-table show IP
brought in the output we can see that we
only have connected ruts and all local
routes no other rats have been learnt we
only see Network 10110 and network 10 1
- 0 / 24 and the local host addresses on
the interfaces of the router we don't
see a network 10 1 2 3 0
are we running a routing protocol on
this router so show IP protocols shows
us that we are running a routing
protocol in this case it's OSPF process
of one router ID of the router is this
it's an area border router it has an
interface gigabit - 0 0 in area 0 in
other words that this network here is an
area 0 and this interface gigabit - 0 1
is an area 1
show IP ospf interface brief is another
useful command this gives us brief
information so we can see that gigabit
is 0 0 with OSPF process 1 is in area 0
we can also see the IP address and
subnet mask used on that interface
subnet masks need to be the same in IP
version 4 for routers to form a neighbor
relationship gigabit is 0 1 is in area 1
of oh s PF process 1 and it's got this
IP address show IP ospf neighbor no
neighbor relationships have been formed
so s PF is running on gigabit as 0 0 of
router 1 but is not forming a neighbor
relationship with Radha too so let's
have a look at router to you and see if
we can find a problem show IP protocols
OSPF process 1 is running on this router
and in the output can you see the
problem you should already be able to
determine the problem by that output but
I'll also use this command show IP ospf
interface brief to help you can you see
the problem notice on router 1 this
interface gigabit 2 0 0 is an OSPF area
0 on router to gigabit 2 0 0 is an area
2
it's a requirement in OSPF that both
sides of the link be configured in the
same area so show run interface gigabit
0/0 shows us that this interface has
been configured in OSPF process 1 but in
area 2 whereas on the side show run
interface gigabit 0/0 shows us that 2
that interfaces in area 0 so to fix this
we need to change the area to area 0 so
do show run interface gigabit 0 0 notice
the OSPF area has changed show IP ospf
interface brief
the area has now been set to properly
show IP protocols shows us now that this
interface is an area zero whereas
gigabit to zero one is in area to show
IP ospf neighbor a neighbor relationship
has been established now why were we not
seeing output on the screen one of the
reasons for that is that a logging could
be disabled so do show run type include
log notice this command has been added
to the running config no logging console
I added that on purpose so that you
didn't see warning messages on the
screen to help you determine what the
problem was so now as an example if I
shut down gigabit a zero zero well
rather should remove the no logging
console and enable logging and now go on
to the interface and shut it and then no
shut it we should see output as in we
should see that the interface comes up
and there you go and we should see that
OSPF relationships are formed and there
you go be careful of your logging if you
tell NIT or SSH to errata don't forget
to use the command term on so that you
see logging on the vty lines logging is
enabled by default on the console but I
had purposely disabled it so things are
looking better we have a neighbor
relationship show IP ospf neighbor shows
us that on the side show IP who is oh s
PF neighbor neighbor relationship is
there show IP rot notice we now see an
inter area OSPF rot to ten one three
zero of via ten one two two so can this
router ping the remote PC yes it can can
PC one ping the remote PC yes it can and
when we do a trace
that's also successful let's test in the
reverse direction just to make sure
everything is good that looks fine
notice the problem with trace rot if you
don't disable IP domain lookup the trace
rod is going to take a long time while
it tries to resolve the names
so I've disabled the trace no IP domain
lookup do the trace again notice it's a
lot quicker now because it's not doing a
domain lookup I'll do that again
there you go so PC one sends traffic to
routed to and then it sends traffic to
write a one and it then hits the
destination so that was an example of
troubleshooting OSPF don't forget that
with OSPF you can configure it one of
two ways you can configure it on an
interface as I've done in this example
or you can use the network command under
the writing process
I'll leave the troubleshooting of that
to a separate video so if you get a
simulation in the exam make sure that
you check that OSPF areas have been
configured properly thanks for watching
let me know which videos you want me to
record and don't forget to subscribe all
