creator of one of the most popular
Android and Java developer courses on
udemy so in this video I'm going to give
you a free preview of a lesson from my
Android angel developer course on
udemy.com in this lesson I'll show you
how to set up Android studio and build
your very first Android application
alright so let's get to it
alright see this video we will talk
about manifest file another very
important Android component so it's
under the manifests folder here you
should see Android manifest here so that
will click that should open another
thing you will notice right away is that
it's all XML by now you should
understand that everything here is XML
driven and with Android here alright so
we have the same thing here we have this
manifest node here which is the parent
node so the manifest file it does a lot
of great things that means the manifest
file lets us define our Android app
structure and metadata along with other
things ok so this is where we can define
what our application does and what it
doesn't and so forth for instance you
can see in this inner node here we have
this application so inside of here we
have this allow backup to be true which
means this application will allow to be
backed up once it's live and on
customers phone you notice here we can
also assign the icon we're gonna be
using as our launcher okay so the the
icon that you see on your phone once you
install the application and look at this
we have to label here but notice
something very interesting
this label if you hover over you see it
says here a string app name remember we
talked about string that means from here
it's not written first look it's
actually getting it from add string
that's notation right to get from to get
a string a resource string you say add
string
forward slash and then the name in this
case they took the app name here and
next you have here this activity note
here we haven't talked about activity
but activity is the visible user
interface so if we look at this main
activity here what are we talking about
this represents a screen write a user
interface so what the user sees this is
an activity okay so an activity is just
a
screen in Android app screen this is our
activity okay because everything here
you know code is being represented
obviously here alright perfect so that's
what an activity is so that also means
that we are here what's happening is
that we are registering our main
activity from our Java file here and
that's one thing that we'll see more and
more as we build more applications as
we'll learn more about building Android
applications that activities must be
registered in our manifest file so that
they are recognized as activities there
are a few exceptions but this is very
important to understand of course with
the evolution of Android studio very
seldom we you actually have to come here
and add it yourself but it's good
important to understand that you will at
one point or the other you'll be able
you will need to come here and change a
few things properties that you want to
attach to activity as you can see here
we have this few actions right the what
this means here that means that this
activity main that activity is actually
our first action that will pop up okay
that's the first thing that's going to
show and the other thing that Android
manifests allows us to do is that it
allows us to add permissions to our
application so the Android ecosystem in
order for us to tap into certain api's
or certain functionalities on the phone
for instance like if we want our
application to connected Internet if you
want our application to open up maps or
GPS or even to do phone call phone calls
we need to ask for permission right so
it would be something like this we will
say use this C permission and look at
all these different permission
permissions that we can use we can let
our application know in this case the
user when they install they'll be able
to accept these applications
these permissions here and I'm sure
you've seen you've downloaded
applications before where it asks you
for certain permissions okay and if you
say yes then the application continues
so this is where all of that we is set
up okay it says here a fine location
course location account manager battery
status Azure all permissions that are
not just available for us as we develop
we have to specifically ask for those ok
so that's a very important thing and all
of that is done here in our manifest
file ok all right so I'll see you in the
next video thanks for watching and I
