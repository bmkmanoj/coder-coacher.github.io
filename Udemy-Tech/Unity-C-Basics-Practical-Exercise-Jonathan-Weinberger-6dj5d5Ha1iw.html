the practical for the fundamental series
that I just released basically what I'm
going to do is I'm gonna go ahead and
create real-world problems that are
gonna show practical exercises and uses
for implementing what we learned with
variables if statement switch statements
for loops and arrays we're gonna go
ahead and create three programs in this
session and what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna create a quiz calculator which is
gonna basically take quiz grades
calculate the average and then it's
gonna return a grade whether you have an
ABC or an F and then we're also gonna
create a level selector maybe a lot like
then you guys can create your own level
selector and make it as advanced as you
want but um we're definitely gonna
create a temperature converter and then
we are also going to create a what we're
gonna create a tip calculator it's like
when you go to a restaurant and you tip
so we'll be able to tip ten fifteen or
twenty percent I know all these programs
are gonna be able to be used in the
inspector and it's going to use every
type of concept that we've covered up
until now I would try and make this as
interactive as possible but really it's
gonna just give you the opportunity to
watch me go through the thought process
and think logically how to solve these
problems now when it comes to
programming only about ten percent of it
is the is a battle with the syntax the
other 90% is logic the syntax of what
the you know the videos I just showed
you are for the syntax without the
syntax the logic is useless however with
that syntax now you can focus entirely
on the logic so once you get the syntax
you know this will eventually become
second nature you can focus entirely on
the logic so what I'm gonna do here is
we're gonna go and get started I'm gonna
go ahead and create the quiz grade
calculator first so I'm gonna go inside
quiz grade quiz grade calculator all
righty
and I'm gonna go ahead and I don't know
if in my previous videos my IDE here is
the fonts too small so just gonna view
zoom in a bit okay
who's even going like three all right so
I want to create a quiz calculator so
the program with three so we're gonna
say here create a program that takes
five quiz grades five quiz grades prints
the average and determines the grade
alright so the way it works here in the
states I don't know if you're watching
this wherever you're from but here we
have a B or at least in Atlanta where I
am we have a B C and F so an a is
anything above a nine D is an a anything
between eighty and ninety s of B seventy
to eighty s see anything below seventy s
and F alright so we're gonna go and
create that so right away I know I need
some variables that are gonna hold my
quiz grades right I can use an array or
I can just create five quiz variables
for simplicity reasons it might be
better for me because I need to
calculate the average so instead of
having to write quiz 0 plus quiz zero
quiz 1 plus quiz 2 and like an array for
me I'm just gonna create five variables
for it so I'm gonna say here public
float and I'm gonna say float because
quizzes you know you can have like an
eighty nine point five whatever we're
gonna have here public float quiz one
quiz two quiz three quiz 4 and quiz five
all right so these are quiz grades now I
need a variable that's going to hold the
average right we need to calculate the
average so we need a variable for that
so we're gonna say public float average
all right now we can still get into our
function here boy starts around we hit
the right when we've run the game starts
gonna get called and what we want to do
is we want to calculate the average all
right so we're gonna take the variable
which currently is zero the value for
average is zero but it can vary member
variables vary we're gonna say here it
equals zero now but where you can you
start the game it's gonna equal the
average so we're gonna say in
parentheses quiz 1 plus quiz 2 plus quiz
3 plus quiz 4 plus quiz 5 and then we're
gonna divide by how many elements we
have or how many variable I'm
so we have one two three four five so
you just divide by five now instead of
me having to actually assign these in
the inspector anything like our assign
them here I'm gonna I want them to be
random values between zero and a hundred
so I'm gonna go ahead and just say here
quiz 1 equals random range that's gonna
allow us to randomize the value random
range is a unity function which takes a
min and Max so the min you can have on a
quiz is zero and the max the max that
you can have is 100 now in unity when
using random dot range the max is never
called so I want it to be with to a
float value between 0 and 100 so I say 0
F and then you'll notice here I have two
options I can do integers or floats I'm
gonna go in and say 100 point 1 F that
way because 100 will never actually be
called your Max is never called which
means now it's between 0 and 100 100 and
point 1 would never get called all right
so that's for quiz 1 and base I'm just
gonna go ahead and do that for each quiz
grade and that's gonna give them random
values at the start quiz 4 and quiz 5
all right so now that they have random
values we can go ahead and calculate the
average all right now the average is
calculated so if we just go ahead and
run this we're gonna have an average but
let's actually do something with it so
on the main camera here we can put our
quiz grade calculator and you'll see
here that they're not even populated but
once I run the game boid start gets
called another random values and the
average is twenty three point eight nine
five six four now the problem with that
is you'll never see that on a quiz grade
so let's round it down to say two
decimal numbers now what if you don't
know how to do that well you have Google
so let's go ahead and open up Google all
right and let's go ahead and just search
for it let's search for there you go how
do I here let's say convert to
decimal places and then unity see shock
anytime you need to search for something
all we just add unity see Chuck at the N
so check this out how to round afloat to
two decimal places - is unity answer
does anyone want that actually want
something else
hold on convert to two decimal places
unity let's remove the sea Shepherd all
right here we go
so round floats okay not what I was
hoping for I wasn't very better particle
but I know exists
okay
okay now I took me to this I guess okay
I guess the unity answers loaded weirdly
okay so check this out how to round
afloat to two decimal places I here's
the question here's the answer so you
can do your float which is the average
equals mass F dot round so there's a
function to round whatever you want and
then this hundred here where you're
multiplying 100 dividing round have so
many decimal places so you have tens
hundreds thousands and so forth okay so
how many decimal places do you want you
want to sow if you want three decimal
places you have ten hundred thousand so
you have three oh you have ten thousands
and hundred thousands if you want more
than that so let's go ahead and use that
example here so we say average equals
and then we say here math F dot round
and the syntax here that's looking for a
float so I'm gonna go and say float that
I want to round is the average
multiplied by a hundred so I have two
decimal points then divide it by 100 at
the end that's gonna give us two decimal
places so if we go in test it out now
and there you go forty seven point 25 is
the average alright good so that's a
failing grade okay so and now we got a
success so it looks like we're failing
quite a bit so what we can do here is
let's go ahead and figure out if we
passed or not so basically now is where
we use our switch our if statement
syntax so for instance I need to know if
the range is between if it's greater
than ninety that's greater than ninety
the average then I want to print out to
the user you have an a so it's really
in pseudocode that looks like this if
average is greater than 90 then what
then print you have an a all right so an
actual code that would look like if and
then here you have average greater than
equal to 90 could be 90 and above so if
average is greater than equal to 90
we're gonna go in st. debug that long
you have an a already the next one would
be an else if statement and now we're
checking for two now so we're checking
between which I can see if it's greater
than or equal to 80 but less than 90 so
this is where we have an another logical
operator that I didn't quite cover in
the last one it's the and operator so
the and operator looks like this you
first check your condition so we're
checking to see if it's greater than or
equal to 80
so if average is greater than or equal
to 80 and then you say and and average
is less than 90 so those two conditions
have to be true in order for this
function here in order for this been
statement to get called we're gonna say
debug that log you have a B and then
really simple here same thing for the
next one
so you have your Elsa and you're
checking the average in if average is
greater than equal to 70 and average is
less than 80 you have a see all right
and then if it's none of those what does
that mean you have an else clause that
means you have an F and there you go
now there's also another important
logical operator it's called the or
operator so what if I was checking for
the average is greater than equal to 80
or less than 90
I couldn't replace the and and use two
of those you know vertical lines and
that's saying or I see you have your an
logic which is the ampersands and then
you have
or which is the vertical lines two of
them I'm very important to know with
creating logic problems all right so if
we go ahead and test this out it's going
running a few times and our program
should be completed here
all right so and it printed out you have
an F the average was a forty two point
eight five let's go and run it again
forty four point six nine now here's an
exercise for you go ahead and make it to
where when I hit the space key it will
recalculate the average and it will give
these guys new random values alright if
you're watching this in your new if you
want to know how to do hit the space key
also you need to use void update Boyd
Start is called once void update is
called about sixty times per second so
when you're checking for user input you
want to make sure you're in void update
so you avoid update if you want to check
for the space key or any key you do if
and then because we're checking to see
if either key right if you hit this key
you say input get key down get key get
key means you're holding get key down is
when you press it down get key up is
when you left your finger up so I want
to get key down and then parentheses and
you'll see here it says in the tooltip
get key down and then a key code so it's
looking for a key code so you type key
code dot and then any key you want every
key that's on your keyboard is listed
here so pick whichever one you want if
you want the space use the space key and
then here recalculate average with new
quiz grades and then you'll have to
recall the start function so that oh you
can even do that probably go ahead and
just recall start right here you could
technically just do this and that would
work alright so that wraps up our first
program all right that's our quiz
calculator now we're just going to
create actually says we have time let's
go and create a level selector and I'm
just go ahead we're gonna do it the same
way we did here and then we're gonna
convert it to a switch statement so
let's go ahead here I'm gonna save this
one I'll save that one out
all righty let's go and create our next
one which is gonna be a level selector
it's going to remove that so we're gonna
create C subscript here level selector
I'm sorry you know it's not level sector
it's a difficulty level okay so we have
a difficulty level selector script
alright so first thing we need to do is
what is the level what is it difficulty
selector it's something that allows you
to pick easy medium or hard in a game
right so right there you know you need
three variables you need a variable that
holds your currently selected difficulty
and then you also need available for
your three difficulties you can do this
with strings you can also do this
through intz and my opinion doing it
through INSAS a lot easier so I'm going
to have three valuables I have public
int curtain difficulty difficulty and
then here I have public int easy equals
0
medium equals 1 and hard equals 2 and
I'm gonna actually change this to normal
so in normal equals 1 it's hard is 2 so
we have three difficulty levels alright
so we have our three variables here in
two easy not sure what happened with
East there
okay so we have posting easy with 0 we
have normal equals one and hard equals
two remember if I separated by a comma
it just takes the same data type the
last one must end with a semicolon if
you're gonna create your variables like
this alright so we have a variable for
our current selected difficulty and then
we have three difficulties what I want
to know is which one I selected so when
the game starts I need to check which
one it is so I'm gonna say if current
difficulty equals easy then I want to
debug that log you select it easy and I
wanna do the same thing for if it's
normal heart I just want to print out
you selected that one so I'm gonna say
else it
the current difficulty equals normal the
other odd is selected normal and then if
he's obviously selected neither of those
then that means you selected Hart
all right now this is an if-else
statement a more efficient way to do
this would be using a switch statement
you selected okay so let's go ahead and
convert this to a switch statement so
remember a switch statement it means in
order to use especially needs a switch
key word and we need to switch through a
variable so what what are we switching
through we're switching through the
current difficulty right so we say
switch card difficulty now we need case
values what are the values we're looking
for for current difficulty we're looking
for case what case zero right so
difficulty mean case is zero for easy
pace one for normal in case two for hard
alright and let's go ahead and say here
it one-zip the value of current
difficulty is zero debug that log you
select it easy alright and then don't
forget you have to break and then here
you selected normal for case one don't
forget to break your case so it knows
when you're done and in case two you
selected heart all right and don't get
the dragon again now what if the values
aren't here what if you didn't pick zero
one or two well then you have an invalid
one so we need to use our default case
which is just default then we go ahead
and say here debug that log invalid
selection and don't forget the break so
there's our switch statement so this
does the exact same thing as this so we
can delete the if elseís and now we're
stuck with the switch statement which
looks a lot nicer so let's go ahead and
test that out on our main camera here
you can add our difficulty can't add it
because it's not the same name
already it's going to add that all right
here we go so current difficulty is zero
and then we have easy normal and hard so
if I run it it should print out you on
easy which it does alright so let's go
and change it now so let's go and make
it like two and you'll see here you
selected hard and if it's a value that
doesn't exist like a hundred it's gonna
say it's gonna default on the default
case invalid selection alright good
stuff so pretty simple to use that with
the switch statement if else it's and
variables let's go ahead and do
something uh let's go and create real
quickly let's go ahead and create and
I'm actually not gonna do the
temperature converter you guys can do
that one on your own I might not do the
I might not do I don't think we do the
tool to be there the tour tip I mean the
tip the tip calculate one is the same
thing you guys can do the typical error
on your own it's basically just using in
false statements and switch statements
basically you know you have a bill ID so
you need a variable it holds the bill
and then you will you'll calculate the
tip so you'll calculate it by
multiplying your percentage of tip based
on the bill now that's your total find
that gives you the tip and you just add
it so you guys increase that you can use
your if else name as a check for what
you know what the value is if your tip
is like ten percent or 20 percent stuff
like that so I'm actually not going to
include that in this video what I'm
gonna do is I want to move on to a raise
on how to really use them with our loops
so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna
go ahead and create and I might still do
the tip calculator if there's time but
I'd rather do the arrays because they're
more a little bit more important so
let's go ahead and create a new C
subscript here and this is going to be a
ray example - alright let's say I have a
list of names and array of names okay
I'm gonna go and create five names here
we're gonna say public string right
because its names and the array brackets
then names equals let's go and say John
oops I need the brackets don't forget
those will say John Julie
mark will say Harrison I don't know if
that's two R's or not and we'll say
George okay so we have John Julie mark
Harrison George five names now what I
want to do is I want to have five in
them five numbers so five ages so I'm
going to say public int and then we have
here an array of Ages and we have five
of them so we're gonna go ahead and say
here 22 22 will say like 38 40 and 18
all right so we have names and ages now
at start if I want to print out each of
these names how can I do that well I
could simply create five debug logs and
I could say this names and then the
first element right but that's five
debug that logs instead I could use a
for loop to iterate through this array
and print out each element using I
because I gets incremented so I'm gonna
do that I'm gonna create a for loop I'm
gonna say for int I equals zero and this
is a variable could be anything could be
James I mean whatever you want the
standard first c-sharp is I so friend I
equals zero semicolon
well I is less than some max value I
want the length of the array so how do I
do that I type the name of the array dot
length and that's gonna return how many
elements on the array which is five all
right so I would say here names dot
length and then increment I and what I'm
gonna do here is I'm gonna say debug
that log and I'm gonna say here names
and then the index which is gonna be I
so what's gonna happen here is it's
gonna go through the array so I is zero
and it's gonna look through this is zero
less than five yes so it's gonna say
names
it's gonna say print out names element I
by equal zero so it prints on 0 then I
gets incremented now I is 1 so as I is 1
less than 5 yes so it prints out names
and then I which is 1 so it's
print up Julie then it's gonna print out
mark Harrison George so let's go and
test that out we put this on the main
camera here
alright see we have two arrays we have
our names and ages and let's go into
cell and there we go so we have John
Julie mark Harrison and George pretty
cool right
so let's go in add their innate ages now
I would say here so what if I wanted to
say what if I wanted to print out a
message my name is my name is John and
I'm 22 and I wanted to be
my name is insert name my name is insert
and I am insert age for each one right I
would say here debug that log I'd have a
string that says my name is and then a
space and then I add on to the string
the variable so I would say my name is
and then I would say names I the current
index that were on so my name is and
then plus I would say space my name is
John and I am and I'm 22 so I need to
print that out so I need to say plus
ages and then I all right so it's gonna
go through it's gonna loop through so
it's gonna print out it's gonna say my
name is John and I'm 22 my name is
Julian 22 mark 38 Harrison 40 George 18
it's going test it out and there you go
my name is John I'm 22 Julie 22 mark 38
Harrison 40 George 18 pretty cool stuff
now what if I wanted to add some more
logic to this for instance what if I
wanted to find a name what if I so right
now I have John Julie mark Harrison what
if this was a hundred names in here like
what if the length of this array was a
hundred elements a hundred names here
and I need to know if that array
contains the name John well what I can
do is I can use a for loop to iterate
through it and check for that name so
I'm right here I'm saying for int I
equals zero I less than and
array length and then I plus plus and
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create
logic I'm checking to see if the current
name so I'm checking to see if names the
current index were on so John and I'm
checking to see if that current index
equals what I'm looking for what's the
name I'm looking for it could be John
right so if it is I'm gonna say debug
that log debug log found and then let's
see which names hi
so if I'm looking for John in the array
this is how you would do it I would say
if the current names equals the name I
want debug log found and it should print
out John let's go and run it and there
you go found John I could do the same
thing with a number what if I was as
changed this to ages dot length and what
if I was searching for 38 in that array
well I would say here if ages the
current element were in the current age
were in if that element equals say 38
debug that log found and you would say
here ages 38 sorry ages I and I should
print out 38 so it's going to set out
and there you go down 38 so you can do
some pretty cool stuff with this
something also really neat is what if I
want to print out let's go and print out
just 1 through 10 we don't even need a
raise to do that
it's going to create a for loop here and
I'm gonna go and say here for int I
equals 0 I less than 10 and then I plus
plus it's gonna print out 0 through 9
because numbers start at 0 I'm just
gonna say debug dot log hi now it's
gonna print out 0 through 9
all right see that 0 through 9 and to
fix that all we have to do is we just
have to say well I equals 1 and it's
less than equal to 10 all right it's
gonna print out 1 through 10 and what I
want this program to do now is it's
putting out 1 through 10 but I want it
to print out 1 through 10 but skip 6
so right now prints out 6 how do I make
a skip 6 well I need to check if 6 is
even an option here
so what I can do here is add logic if I
equals six which it eventually will
right because six is still less than
equal to 10 so it's gonna continue
looping and then what do I want to do I
don't want to call this function here
which is gonna print out the current
value I want to skip it how do I tell it
to skip well we have what's called the
continued keyword so I can write
continue and the continue keyword is
gonna allow me to basically what's gonna
happen is it's gonna say I equals six
continue it's gonna stop right here and
it's gonna increment I sorry it is going
to increment I and it's gonna start back
up so it's gonna skip six continue to
seven so now is seven it's not ever
gonna get here so if I run this you'll
see here it's gonna print out one two
five skip six seven eight nine see that
one two three four five skip six seven
eight nine ten so there's no six to be
found now what if I also not only wanted
it to skip six but what if I wanted it
to stop at seven well I could do the
same thing that's going to create
another if so I just create I can create
elsif here so I can go ahead and say or
I could even do it so a switch statement
buffer - you don't need to so I'm gonna
say else if I equal 7 and what happens I
need to stop I want it to stop looping I
don't want it to print out I don't want
it to print out eight or nine but I do
want it to print out seven so I'm gonna
put that there
I'm gonna keep this one here now after
it prints out seven I want to stop I
want to break out of the loop so guess
what we have a break keyword you're
familiar with that with the switch
statement that's gonna basically say if
I equals seven print I which is seven
and then break so now this line of code
here will finally get called when you
break out of the loop or if you wait
till it's done looping at 10 and will
still get called but we're telling it to
break which means it's no longer gonna
loop and now we're moving on with the
rest of our code so you broke the loop
early then let's go and test that
all right there you go 1 2 3 4 skip 6 so
you have 1 2 3 4 5 skip 6 7 and then you
broke through Berlin so this is some
pretty cool things you can do now what I
want to do is I want to get a little bit
more game object really related here so
what I'm gonna do now is let's go ahead
and create three cubes so we're gonna
have a cube here and we're gonna just
duplicate it all right so we got cute
one two and three right and they're all
right here in our scene I'm gonna go
ahead and say here this is zero zero all
right no matter you space them out a bit
so we can see them so zero let's go and
say one point five zero and then here
negative one point five so we have three
cubes right I'm gonna create a tag for
them and I'm gonna name it cube where is
a cube all right let's go and give them
all the tag of cube okay so I have three
cubes here what I want to do is through
script with this array example two
scripts when I hit the space key I want
to grab each of those cubes and I want
to turn their color red how do I do that
well I can use I can basically use an
array of game objects populated with
those three cubes and then using a for
loop or for each loop I can grab each
each cube in the array I can grab its
material and I can change the color so
check this out if I wanted to do that
here's how it would work let's delete
this basically what I would say here is
I would have I would have an array right
over an array of game objects so I would
basically have here
and what I'm gonna do this almond start
it's gonna be a local race so I'm gonna
basically say here game object array and
then we're gonna say cube array cube
array all right it's gonna equal the
element so how do i how do I populate
this array now I can't go in the
inspector because it
local variable so what I can do is I can
say game object op find and check this
out game logic that find game objects so
plural with tag well the tag I'm looking
for is Q so it's gonna take all the
cubes in our seen any cube that has a
tag of cube and it's gonna put it inside
this array and let me make sure that's
capital C and it is cube okay good so
now that our array is populated what I
can do is I can use a for loop to
iterate through the array and change
each cubes color so I can say for inside
equals zero I less than the cube array
dot length how many times do you want
the loop so we have three cubes so we
need to go at least three times around
and then we're gonna increment the I and
I need to grab the current cube so how
do I do that cube array I and then I
want the what I need the material off it
right so I need the renderer component
first so I need to say get component and
I want the renderer and if you're not
familiar with get component I have a
video on get component you can go watch
we have get component renderer dot
material dot color equals colored dot
red and what that's gonna do it's gonna
loop through each cube and set the
material to red so if we go ahead and
run it there you go
the red now if I want to do that like I
said when you hit space key you just
basically come in here if then you put
dot get key down key code out space and
then here we have this logic so it's
pretty cool all right so that's doing it
with a for loop what if you wanted to
use a for each loop well send the guy
hits base so if we want to do with a
forage so it's the exact same process
just with the different wording so let's
go ahead and comment out this for loop
here let's do it using the cube array so
I'm going to say for each and what am i
doing I'm gonna say for each cube this
can be named anything convenient James
alright so basically I'm gonna say for
each and I use bar which is the data
type
Universal data type so I say for each
cube in in water array we have a cube
array I want to take the current queue I
want to get the renderer component I
want to get the material the color and
then I want to assign it a new color
all right so for each cube and when I
hit space key they're still all gonna go
red and they're yeah so for loop and for
a chip are no different they're the
exact same things just different wording
and preference all right guys we are
hitting the 30 minute mark so I'm gonna
start wrapping this up I hope you guys
got a little bit better understanding on
how to use these and when to use these
you can think of some interesting
scenarios I'm sure but yeah I'm gonna go
ahead and start work on the intermediate
series which is gonna cover lists we're
gonna cover lists properties probably
dictionaries I'm not sure what else will
be in that one just yet but then when we
get to advanced stuff that's gonna be
fun because we're gonna do events and
delegates event actions which are
amazing and lambda expressions which are
very cool so thanks for watching guys
and make sure you are subscribing sure
you are on digital gaming Institute the
Facebook page you'll get up-to-date info
before anyone else does
pretty cool stuff and yeah thanks guys
