I'm sure you know me from my Cisco
classes on udemy now I've been getting a
lot of questions or a lot of emails on
what simulator or emulator you should
use as you see behind me there's various
simulators and emulators and I speak a
little bit about all the first one is
the cisco packet tracer that is a
simulator it simulates the environment
that you're in so for the CCNA
certification is good enough it gives
you all the tools that you need for that
particular certification and it's very
easy to use a very low learning curve
now you also buy Cisco have the verb now
the verle is an actual emulator okay
emulator it emulates the actual real
world environment and it already comes
with its own iOS there's a lot of work
to do up front it is complex it does
take a higher learning curve but once
you get used to working with rural and
they do have a new version of rural
you'll be able to go from the CCENT all
the way up to the CCIE it does
everything it has all the tools you
think you would ever need now another
simulator that's been around just as
long as a cisco packet tracer is the
gns3 gns3 is an emulator as well gns3
has everything now the only thing with
gns3 you need to provide the iOS which
means you need to go to Cisco and
purchase the iOS that you require and
then you would load it onto gns3 and
that videos for you to do that if you go
to their website and we'll show you
exactly what you can do once you get it
up and running
it is a beefy emulator so it will take
up a lot of space a lot of RAM in your
computer so make sure that G&amp;amp;S
throughout in your computer to run gns3
you do have a lot ram allow processing
power
the other one is the boss on simulator
okay
I've used very little very little I'll
use them many many many years ago they
were good they were okay I honestly can
tell you it's a simulator but a lot of
people like it it really just depends on
what you like to use but that's another
one you use as well and now I've
actually been told that this one Eve
next generation Eve's - ng you google
that and you'll get to this and
apparently people are even using it in
their live network so I have not tried
this yet I'll be quite honest with you
but I have looked at it I've seen the
features that it can do and it pretty
much can do a lot of things so make sure
is and see if you like this one so you
can see you have various simulators and
emulators that you use the question is
how deep by your pockets do you want to
pay what it costs and the yearly basis
with the viral emulator do you want to
purchase an iOS from Cisco I do not
believe this costs anything but it may I
did not look into it so you need to do
your research and this neural simulator
does have a price tag to it so it really
all depends how much are you willing to
spend remember this is your education
this is your career this is your future
so it's really up to you which one are
the simulators fits your needs I'll see
you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
