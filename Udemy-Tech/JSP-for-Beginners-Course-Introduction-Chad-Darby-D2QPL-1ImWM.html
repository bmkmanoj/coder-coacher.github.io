koat.com and welcome to my tutorial on
JSP in this tutorial series we're gonna
cover a lot of good topics we're gonna
start off with a tutorial intro which is
of course this video then we'll get an
overview of JSP next you'll learn how to
set up your development environment and
then we'll learn about installing Tomcat
installing eclipse and also connecting
Eclipse and Tomcat together so that'll
take care of all the basic housekeeping
that we'll need to do for setting up our
development environment
then next we'll move forward and we'll
start coding so adore JSP HelloWorld
program then we'll learn about some
different aspects of JSP we'll discuss
JSP expressions scriptlets and also JSP
declarations then we'll look at some of
the JSP built-in objects will learn
about including files and finally we'll
learn how to import Java classes so this
is a good start to get us going with JSP
now granted there's a whole lot of more
topics out there on JSP this is enough
to give us a quick start with JSP so we
can start with JSP development
all right so we have a lot of good
things in store I stay tuned for all the
follow-on videos
welcome back in this video I'm gonna
give you an overview of JSP and servlets
we'll cover the following topics will
first find out what is a web application
then we'll learn about JSP and servlets
and finally I'll show you different
types of apps you can create with JSP
and servlets
so what we're gonna do in this course is
we're gonna build web applications so
you may wonder well what is the web
application well you've used these
before if you've gone to any e-commerce
site like Amazon or any travel site
you've used a web app and it's basically
a site that builds HTML pages on the fly
based on your user actions so I'll
actually show you an example of this
using one of the travel sites
so here's expedia.com I use his site a
lot for travel I travel a lot from
Philadelphia to India
so here I'll enter my where I'm flying
from where I'm flying to i'll there are
some dates here for my travel and then
the key here is that once I hit Search
it's actually gonna generate HTML pages
for me based on my request all right so
these pages that you see here um it's
not a hard coded page it's actually
generated on the fly based on my input
Philadelphia going to Bangalore
all right so you may wonder what happens
behind the scenes while behind the
scenes is in a web browser you come you
select search flights then it goes to
the web server what the web server will
do is it will actually submit a request
to the database using SQL and then once
it has results then it'll take that
information and then send back an HTML
page on the fly and that's the idea of a
web application and this is actually
very generic you can build web apps
using any type of technology such as JSP
or servlets or dotnet technologies or
PHP technologies and so on but that's
the basic idea and what I'll do in this
course is I'll show you a very high
level on how to get started with JSP for
building pages so that's the next
question here what RJ's piece and
servlets well a JSP and servlets on the
web server so they can read user input
normally from an HTML form and then they
can perform the work maybe I'm talking
to a database talking to a web service
or whatever and finally it'll return an
HTML page that's generated dynamically
on the fly so kind of pulling it
together with this big picture our
servlets and jsps could actually run on
the web server so they could read
information for flight information send
information over to the database get the
results and then send back in HTML page
so that's kind of the area of where
servlets and jsps can fit in your web
application architecture all right so
here's another frequently asked question
well what types of apps can we create
well I always like to say that you can
create apps for any industry so you can
build ecommerce apps you could build
maybe a student or employee tracking
application if you're building like a
hotel or restaurant and reservation app
or a social media app like Twitter or
Facebook really any type of app there's
really no limit on the apps you can
create
JSP and servlets are the key components
of the Java Enterprise Edition they're
the most popular pieces of technology
and I'll always like to say they're the
bread-and-butter because a lot of
popular MVC frameworks actually use JSP
and servlets so for example spring JSF
and struts they all use JSP and servlets
at the low level now when you're using
these technologies you may not see it
directly at the high level but behind
the scenes spring Jayceon struts
they all make use of JSP and servlets so
they're the key components of the Java
Enterprise Edition so by you
understanding JSP this will help you
when you move forward if you use some of
those frameworks later on in your career
all right so let's go ahead and wrap up
this video so we defined what our web
applications we saw a demo of a web app
we also discussed JSP and servlets and
then finally we discussed the various
types of apps you can create with this
technology
hey in this video I'm gonna give you an
overview of setting up your development
environment
so we'll cover the following topics I'll
discuss the required software and we'll
also go through the high-level steps
all right so one prerequisite is that
you must have the Java development kit
installed
that's the JDK not the JRE but the JDK
now in regards to the required software
to build these web applications you need
to have the following you need to have a
Java app server and an IDE now regarding
Java app server there's a lot of
different options like GlassFish JBoss
web logic and so on but we're gonna keep
it simple and make use of the Tomcat
server next for the IDE again a lot of
different options and we'll simply focus
on using the Eclipse IDE
now what I'll do is I'll actually break
these videos up so I'll have a separate
video installing the Tomcat Java app
server and then I'll have a separate
video on installing the Eclipse IDE
all right so this wraps up the video we
cover the required software we also
discussed the high-level steps so let's
go ahead and the following videos will
actually go through and install our Java
app server and we'll install the Eclipse
IDE alright I'll see you in the next
video
hey welcome back so let's go ahead and
get our hands dirty so in this video I'm
gonna show you how to install Tomcat on
Microsoft Windows
all right so the first thing we need to
do is we need to download Tomcat so in
my browser I'm gonna visit Tomcat dot
Apache org
and so this will take me to the Tomcat
website over on the left hand side is a
download section where we can actually
download some of the software
I'll move down to the section for binary
distributions and I'll choose this
32-bit 64-bit windows service installer
so this is the normal MSI file it'll
install Tomcat as a Windows service so
I'll go ahead and select this link
and right now my browser will start
downloading it to my filesystem
all right great so now we have it
downloaded let's go ahead and open up a
Windows Explorer and I move I'll move
into this downloads folder and there's
the file that was just downloaded Apache
Tomcat so that's the actual installer so
let's go ahead and run this installer
just by double clicking it
so this will start up the Installer I'll
hit yes
and here I'm at the first step of the
wizard I'll go ahead and click Next
I'll agree and then here we choose our
components for the components I'd like
to choose full just let all the examples
in the host manager again a nice thing
about this Tomcat installers that it
installs it as a service so I'll make
sure that the service thing is enabled
or check there I'll go ahead and hit
next
by default Tomcat listens on port 8080
feel free to change that but I like to
keep the defaults and then you can set
up a administrator login so for now I'll
just say admin admin again you can give
any username and password that you want
and then I'll hit next
I'll accept the default installation
here from my JRE
I'll hit next and also accept the a
default installation directory you can
feel free to change this but I'll go
ahead and keep the default installation
directory for Tomcat and then I'll hit
install and so at this point we'll go
through the process of installing the
software and now it says hey where the
software is installed I'll turn off the
option that show the readme I'll hit
finish
and now it'll actually start Tomcat as a
Windows service
all right great so Tomcat has started
let's go ahead and verify our
installation and we can verify it by
viewing a web site localhost 8080 that's
where our local Tomcat server is running
right now
should bring up this page that you see
here so let's say Apache Tomcat
and then also they even give you a
message if you're seeing this you've
successfully installed Tomcat
congratulations so we know that we're
okay so Tomcat was installed
successfully and Tomcat is up and
running so good job so far
now I'm going to show you one other
thing you can do is you can actually
configure Tomcat so you can just right
click on the little Tomcat icon in the
bottom right
and say right click and hit configure
and this will bring up the configuration
window for Tomcat so you can change like
the display name for the service you
could change the actual description at
the bottom and shows you if the status
if it's running or stopped you can play
around some logging stuff a lot of other
things you can play around with but for
right now I'll just go ahead and keep
everything is their defaults and I'll
just hit cancel right now
another nice thing is that you can
actually administer Tomcat via the
services control panel
so I'll go ahead and click on services
here
and we'll see in the list we have Apache
Tomcat that's listed as a service and
it's currently running
just like any standard service you can
just right-click you can stop it pause
it resume it restart it you can do all
the normal things you can do with the
service
what I'd like to do now is actually stop
Tomcat because we're gonna run it later
via eclipse so I'll go ahead and stop
this service I'll just do a right-click
I'll hit stop
go through the process of stopping the
Tomcat server so right now it's not
running but don't worry
later on we'll actually hook up Tomcat
an Eclipse to run together and we'll
cover that in one of the following
videos
now we were successful we were able to
download Tomcat and install it and then
also go through the process of verifying
our installation and then finally we
went around and took a look at some of
the configs and also looked at the
services control panel so good job so
far
Hey welcome back in this video I'm gonna
show you how to install eclipse on a
Microsoft Windows
so the first thing we need to do is
download eclipse so we can go to the
Eclipse website Eclipse org
we have a little shortcut setup that'll
take us to eclipse.org
now once we're here this is the main
Eclipse website or the main Eclipse
homepage
and what I'd like to do is move over to
the right hand side there's a download
button I like to go ahead and click this
download button so it can take me to the
downloads page
you
all right cool so now at the downloads
page they have a lot of different
distributions of Eclipse
you want to make sure that you choose
the right one so if we scroll down the
page here I'll show you that we want to
make use of the Java EE package
all right so that's the one it's listed
here Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers
that's the one that we want it's very
important that you select this
distribution because it has built-in
support for Java web applications
all right so over on the far right you
can go ahead and download it so I have a
64-bit Windows operating system here
I'll go ahead and select the link and
it'll take me to the list of download
options here so again this is one
intermediate step but you basically just
go over to the left-hand side and choose
that download link and this one likes
you start downloading Eclipse to your
computer
so they'll prompt us we'll say save
and this will actually kind of start the
download process
and then at the bottom you'll see your
browser will start downloading it this
will take a while to download depending
on your internet speed I'll come back
once the download is complete
all right so the Downloads complete now
we need to unzip eclipse so I'm gonna
open up my Windows Explorer I'm gonna
move into the Downloads directory this
is where the file was actually
downloaded some downloads there's a file
here called Eclipse je e depending on
the version number that you have so
that's the file that was just downloaded
from the Eclipse website and what I'd
like to do is unzip this file so I can
do a right-click I'll say extract all
and now I need to tell it where to
extract Eclipse or install eclipse so
here I'm just gonna use the C Drive so C
colon backslash so it's gonna install it
to the root of the C Drive and it's
gonna install it in a folder called
Eclipse so once you're happy with the C
colon backslash you can click extract
and actually you can install it wherever
you'd like but here just to keep things
simple I'll put it at the C Drive
all right great so now we've extracted
it to the C Drive so I'll go over to
local disk C Drive and there's a new
folder here called Eclipse that's where
the code was placed
and I can move in here and there and
there's an eclipse application with the
little icon there and I can double click
this no this will actually run Eclipse
and it'll start up Eclipse and it'll
start running for us
oh and I forgot there's one thing
eclipse will always prompt you to select
the workspace so the workspace is
basically a folder where you'll store
your actual source code our projects you
can give it any name you want and you
can place it at any location that you
want on your file system
okay great now eclipse a really started
running and now we should see the
welcome screen real soon now
right so here's our welcome screen so
they have an overview samples tutorials
what's new so on at this point I always
like to make sure that I'm using the
correct version or a download with the
right version the Eclipse Java EE IDE
again we need to make sure we have the
Java EE version because it has built-in
support for Java web applications
all right great so you can go ahead and
close this welcome window here just
click the X at the top left and there it
is so this is the basic Eclipse right
now there's no projects no servers it's
pretty plain vanila right now and don't
worry as we go through the course we'll
create projects we'll create web
applications and deploy them to our
servers great job
hey welcome back in this video I'm going
to show you how to connect Eclipse and
Tomcat
now the main benefit is that we can
start Tomcat from Eclipse also it'll
make it very easy for us to deploy our
web applications directly to Tomcat
go ahead and move into eclipse what I'd
like to do is move down to the bottom
section there's a tab called servers I'd
like to click on that tab
now at this point we don't have any
servers associated with our Eclipse
environment at the time so what we need
to do is click on this link and we're
going to add a new server and when an
add a new server that points to our
Tomcat that we installed previously
all right so here's the defining server
what I need to do is move up to the
Apache Tomcat folder and expand it
you
now I'd like to do is go ahead and click
the next button here on the screen
and then at this point I need to browse
and tell eclipse where Tomcat is
installed all right so where ever you
have Tomcat install you need to point to
that directory I'm gonna make use of the
default directory where Tomcat is
installed it's on the Program Files
Apache Software Tomcat 8 so that's this
is the actual default directory where
Tomcat was installed
all right great so once I have that
selected I'll go ahead and click on okay
the full path therefore the Tomcat
installation directory so again I'm just
using the default once I'm happy with
this I'll go ahead and click on next the
screen here just talks about some other
apps don't worry about it just go ahead
and click on finish and this will
associate Tomcat with the Eclipse
environment so if everything is
successful down in the bottom center you
should see a reference for Tom Kent now
at this point it stopped we haven't
started it yet we'll actually start it
in some of the following videos when we
start creating our web applications
okay great so if your Eclipse screen
looks similar to this that means you're
successful in setting up Tomcat within
Eclipse good job
hey in this video I'm gonna show you how
to create a hello world program with JSP
so the common question is well what is a
JSP file well a Chauncey file is simply
an HTML page with some Java code
sprinkled in and it basically gives you
dynamic content that you can include in
your page so in this diagram here this
is a basic JSP file it's has some HTML
code some Java code you can make some
more HTML code and so on the end result
is that you'll have an HTML page with
content that's generated by some Java
code
all right so the next question is well
where's a JSP processed well a JSP file
is actually processed on the server so
it's processed on your tomcat server
your GlassFish a JBoss server the
results of the java code is actually
included in the HTML return to the
browser so here's an example we have a
web browser we make a request for a JSP
page it goes across the JSP page is
processed by your server and then the
results of that java code will generate
HTML and that those results are actually
returned back to the web browser and is
returned back to the browser's just
plain HTML
so in effect the Java code can generate
HTML that goes back to the web browser
all righty so next well where should we
place the JSP file
well the JSP file goes into your web
content folder so you create a new
Eclipse project they have a web content
folder you place the file there then one
requirement is that the JSP file must
have a dot JSP extension so here's an
example here we have on a slide web
content hello world at JSP now it's just
like any other normal HTML file that you
place out there like building a normal
web site you can have multiple JSP files
you can place your JSP files and sub
directories and so on so it's almost
like building a website with multiple
HTML pages except for here we'll have
dot JSP files with that JSP extension
all right so you're probably wondering
hey show me the code so here's an
example of a code very basic hello world
program again remember a JSP file is
simply an HTML page with a small bit of
Java code sprinkled in so here we have
our body h3 hello world of Java and then
the time on the server is and right here
this is what we have Java code
so with JSP you make usually angle
bracket percent and inside of there you
can put a JSP element so in this case
we're gonna put in what we call a JSP
expression so we use the equal symbol so
angle bracket percent equal and then we
creep put in some Java code so this
example we create a new date object this
will give us a current timestamp and
then we include the output of the state
object in the page so in effect it will
call the two string method on this date
object and include the result of that in
this page that goes back to the browser
so I know I gave you a lot of
information there let's go ahead and
switch over and look at Eclipse and
we'll write this code and then we'll run
it within eclipse
all right so we're in Eclipse so the
first thing we need to do is we need to
create a new web project
so I'll go to my file menu I'll say new
and then I'll choose dynamic web project
and this will bring up the dialogue we
can enter our project name here I'll
call it JSP demo you can give any name
for the project but here I'm just
keeping it simple
make sure the target runtime is
Pachi Tomcat aid and you can keep all
the other defaults with no problem and
then simply hit the finish button
so what this'll do is they'll secrete a
new project for us so we have JSP demo
and if we expand this directory we'll
see that we have a web content folder
and right now our web content folders
empty there's no there are no pages that
are created so here I'm going to create
a new file so in the web content I'll
right-click I'll say new file and I'll
call this hello world dot JSP
and once I'm happy with the filename
I'll hit the finish button
all right so here's our file it's empty
right now so I'll just go ahead and
create a very basic HTML page and
eclipse will help me out with some of
the tags here
they'll set up a body
a ch3 hello world of Java
and then I'll say the time on the server
is and this is where we'll drop in some
Java code so use that angle bracket
percent with an equals symbol and I say
new Java util date so again it's gonna
create a new data object with the
current timestamp and then the result of
that timestamp will be included right
here in this page that'll go back to the
browser so that's basically my hello
world
JSP right now
all right so let's go ahead and run this
example so I'll do is I'll move over
here to that file hello world KSP I'll
simply right-click the file and I'll say
run as and I'll choose run on server
so eclipse will prompt me first it'll
say choose your server we're gonna use
the existing Tomcat 8 server and in the
bottom left we'll check the box here to
always use this server when running this
project
and from there I can go ahead and hit
the finish button so this all actually
started my Tomcat server if it's not
running and then it should execute this
JSP page so great you're the results
hello world of Java time when a server
is and they drop in a timestamp so this
is the actual current timestamp that I
have on my server at the time of this
recording
so note here it created that new date
object and then the results of that data
object were included in that page
now what I'd like to do is copy this URL
and just drop into a regular web browser
so I'll just right click I'll say copy
and then I'll switch over to a web
browser like Firefox and I'll just drop
in that URL so just do a right-click and
I'll choose paste then I'll hit enter
and there's the JSP page inside of the
browser so hello world of Java and the
time when the server is and so then I
can right click and take a look at the
source and so here's the source so this
is what this is kind of like a
behind-the-scenes tour here so this is
the source that came back to the browser
so the time on the server is and it has
its information so the web browser
really doesn't know how this code was
generated it simply renders the response
so that's JSP in a nutshell alright so
we covered a very basic JSP hello world
example we're gonna dig deeper or dive
deeper into JSP as we go through in the
following videos but that's enough just
to kind of get us started we can see the
basics and we can check the box for
hello world
alright so stay tuned a lot of good
things in store in the following videos
hello in this video we're gonna learn
how to use JSP expressions
so in JSP there's actually different
types of scripting elements there's
three actually JSP expressions JSP
scriptlets and declarations now what
we'll do is we'll actually have a deep
dive on each one of these topics in
separate videos but I wanted to give you
just an overview real quick so a JSP
expression is basically a small java
expression that you can include in the
page the syntax is angle bracket percent
with an equal symbol and we'll see a lot
of that in this video there's also what
we call a JSP scriptlet so JSP scriptlet
is simply an angle bracket percent and
then you add some Java code you can add
one too many lines of Java code and
we'll see that in a following video and
then finally there's a JSP declaration
so this is angle bracket percent with an
exclamation point and so here you can
define a Java variable or method and
again we'll do a deep dive on that so
this next slide here is on JSP
expressions so basically you can compute
some type of expression and the result
of that is included in the HTML page
that's returned to the browser
and so here's an example and we saw this
from one of our previous videos actually
the previous hello world video in your
JSP file you can say the time on the
server is and then you can add an
expression so again remember angle
bracket percent with an equal symbol and
we can place a Java object there once
this is processed by the server then the
generated HTML is simply the two string
version of that given date object
but let's take a look at some more
examples of using JSP expressions
so in this next example I'm gonna show
you how we can convert a string so here
I have this new string hello world and
then I can say dot to uppercase some
gonna basically convert this string to
all caps or to all uppercase and the
result of that will be included right
here in the page so that's four like
strings and objects you can also make
use of mathematical expressions so here
I can multiply a value 25 times 4 equals
and you can put any math expression in
there that you'd like you can also have
boolean expressions so here I could say
is 75 less than 69 and only give me a
value of true or false and that's an
example here of using JSP expressions so
we saw objects mathematical expressions
and also boolean expressions
okay great so let's move into the clips
and let's try this stuff out
I like to continue to use the same
project from a previous video
JSP demo I'd like to move down to my web
content folder and what I want to do
here is actually create a new file so
I'll just right click I'll say new file
and for the name of this file I'll
simply call it expression test dot JSP
and once you're happy with that filename
you can go ahead and click the finish
button
a very basic file here actually an empty
file and we need to add something in it
so let's go ahead and start off with our
basic HTML I'll set up my body tag
and now I'll go ahead and type out that
first bit of converting a string to
uppercase
and now I like to do is add a JSP
expression so again
angle bracket percent and so here I say
new string hello world
and I do it dot and I get the code
completion here and I'll say dot to
uppercase I'll select that item there
it's kind of cool Eclipse can kind of
help you out with some of the code
completion there when the energy ASP
file alright so that's it so that's the
file I can go ahead and save it
I'd like to do is go ahead and run this
file so I'll just do a right-click
I'll say run as and then I'll choose run
on server
all right so this will start up my
Tomcat service if it's not running
already
and then in right here in the browser
it'll give us the result converting a
string to uppercase and remember we had
hello world as normal case and now this
basically converted hello world to all
uppercase so that's the result of our
JSP expression running which is really
cool
all right so let's take this a little
bit further
I'm just going to add some line breaks
in here
and now I want to do an example using a
mathematical expression here so here
I'll say 25 multiplied by 4
equals
and now again I'll make use of my JSP
expression angle bracket percent with an
equal symbol 25 times 4 so the result of
this of course is a hundred right and
the value of a hundred will be included
right there so I simply save the file
so now here I can simply go back to my
browser I don't have to run it again
I'll have to do is simply reload this
page and the results will show up so
I'll simply hit the reload or the
refresh button here and there it is 25 x
4 equals 100
mission accomplished very good so again
a nice thing here with JSP if you make
any changes to the file you don't have
to rerun it or redeployed you simply
just reload that page and you're ready
to go
okay let's do one more thing let's play
around with boolean expressions so let
me just move down here add a line break
let me just add some extra whitespace
here just so we can see everything
and I'll just have a very basic boolean
expression example
is 75 less than 69
and now let Java compute this for me
again very trivial right but we're just
showing you an example here of a boolean
expression
so 75 less than 69 this will evaluate is
true or false of course we know this
will return false right but we'll see
how the JSP program will help us out
with this
all right so I'll save the file here
browser and again all I have to do is
just reload or refresh
and then there it is is 75 less than 69
false so very good so we saw a really
good example there of using JSP
expressions for boolean x' also for math
and also for string objects
all right so let's go ahead and wrap up
this video we did a deep dive on JSP
expressions I showed you different types
of expressions using objects math
expressions and also boolean expressions
in the following videos we'll dive into
JSP scriptlets and we'll also dive into
JSP declarations so stay tuned I'll see
you there
hello in this video we're gonna learn
about JSP scriptlets
so what exactly is a scriptlet well a
script that is a JSP construct it allows
you to add one to many lines of Java
code and once you have this set up then
you can also include content in the page
by making use of out dot print line so
the basic syntax is angle bracket
percent you write your x number of lines
of code and in percent angle bracket and
that code will be executed top-down when
the page is processed
all right so that's the background let's
look at a code example so very basic
example here hello world of Java and
then I'll add a script let again angle
bracket percent once inside of the angle
bracket percent then you can start
writing real Java code so what I'd like
to do here is set up a for loop for int
I equals 1 is less than equal to 5 I
plus plus and I'd like to print out I
really love to code now instead of doing
a system out print line I'll make use of
out dot print lines so this content will
be included in the HTML page that's
returned so here I say out dot print
line I really love the code and I can
add in the value of I now here's the
output at the bottom of what we'll see
once we run this JSP we'll have our
header hello world of Java so here we'll
have our statement printed five times
along with the actual loop index and
that's the basics there on setting up a
JSP scriptlet so angle bracket percent
and then you go ahead and you write your
Java code
all right now before we move into the
actual coding demo I want to just let
you know about the best practice you
want to minimize the amount of scriptlet
code in a JSP so don't go overboard
avoid dumping thousands of lines of java
code in a JSP because it makes it hard
to maintain it's poor design and it's
poor architecture what you want to do if
you have a lot of code that you need to
use under JSP I recommend that you
refactor this into a separate Java class
or make use of MVC and I'll show you how
to do both of those later in the course
I'll show you how to make use of a
separate Java class I'll also show you
how to make use of an MVC framework
where we have servlets and jsps working
together but anyway I just had to say
this upfront as the best practice so you
don't go off and do things the wrong way
all right so let's go ahead and move it
to eclipse and let's write some code so
what I like to do is I like to continue
to use the previous project JSP demo and
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
actually move into our web content
directory and we're gonna create a new
file so I'll just right click on web
content and I'll say new
and I'll choose file
so the actual name of the file that I'm
gonna set up here is called scriptlet
test dot JSP
like so that's the filename and once
you're happy with this filename you can
go ahead and click the finish button
all right great so we had this blank
file and we need to start writing some
code so first off let me expand the
window here
and I'll set up the basic HTML and I'll
go through and set up the basic body
all right so
header 3 hello world of Java
okay great now I'm gonna make use of a
scriptlet so again angle bracket percent
and then we can write our java code here
so I'm gonna do something very similar
to what we had on the slide I'll simply
set up a for loop for I equals 1 is less
than equal to 5 I plus plus
run out some information included in the
page so I'll make use of out that front
line
and then again we're having fun here I
really love to code woohoo and I'll add
the little loop parameter here so there
we go so that's our scriptlet code here
so we have a for loop we need to print
out some information we make use of that
out dot print line and I know there it
is pretty simple
so let's go ahead and save this file and
let's move over here let's run it
so let's right-click on this file
scriptlet esta JSP right-click choose
run as run on server
and great here's our output we have our
hello world of Java and then we have
this code that was generated by our for
loop I really love to code and we have
the loop parameters going 1 through 5 as
you can see I'm having a lot of fun here
with this really love to code but that's
it
okay so this wraps up the video I showed
you how to make use of JSP scriptlets
you can add some Java code to generate
content dynamically on the fly the
following videos we'll talk about JSP
declarations so stay tuned a lot of good
stuff coming up
hey in this video I'm gonna show you how
to use JSP declarations
JSP declarations basically allow you to
declare a method in the JSP page and
then you can call the method from the
same JSP page so it's very useful like
any normal code that you create if you
need to execute some code over and over
again you simply encapsulate it in a
method declaration and you can do a
similar thing here with JSP and the
syntax is basically an angle bracket
percent with an exclamation point and
then you declare your method like any
normal java method
all right so let's take a look at an
example here of a JSP declaration up top
I'm gonna declare a method so again
declarations angle bracket percent with
an exclamation point so once you're
inside of here this is just like a
normal Java method declaration you have
a return type of string the name of the
method make it lower any input
parameters in this case I have string
data and then internally inside the body
you write your actual implementation
code so in this example my
implementation code can be real simple
from make it lower I'll simply take the
data and call dot to lowercase and again
very trivial method here I'm just wanted
to show you how to declare a method in a
JSP page
and then at the bottom I can make use of
that method so here I'll have make use
of a JSP expression I'll do an angle
bracket percent with an equal symbol and
I say make it lower and I pass in the
string that I wanted to convert and
that's it
so at the bottom here this is what the
output will look like so lower case
hello world and then : and then I have
the actual hello world so the result of
making that expression or that method
call the results will be displayed right
here in that JSP page and that's
basically yet
let's talk about some best practices
this follows what I discussed earlier
with scriptlets similar thing here you
want to minimize the number of
declarations in a JSP page and also
avoid dumping thousands of lines of code
in the JSP also you wanna refactor this
into separate Java classes or make use
of MVC and I'll cover all of that later
in the course
so in general don't overdo it with JSP
declarations
let's move into eclipse and I want to
continue to use the existing project JSP
demo
and what I'd like to do is move down to
this web content folder and I'm going to
add a new file so I'll simply do a
right-click I'll say new file
so I'm going to create this new file the
name of the file I'll call it
declaration test JSP
and once you're happy with the file main
you can go ahead and click finish
our file it's empty we need to add some
code here so I'll start off with my
normal HTML and body and now what I like
to do is actually declare a method so I
use the JSP syntax the angle bracket
percent with the exclamation point so at
this point I can actually start writing
normal Java code so I'm gonna write a
java method so here the return type of
string method name of make it lower
input data of string and inside I'll
actually write the real implementation
code and again this very trivial example
I'll just say data dot to lowercase and
that's really it for this method
declaration so again with JSP you make a
declaration by using the angle bracket
percent with the exclamation point
okay great so we have the method Eclair
now let's use this method so here I'll
just have some text lowercase
a lowercase hello world and then I'll
make use of that JSP expression so I can
call that method declaration so I say
make it lower and I pass in some data
call it hello world and then there we go
so that's an example here of making a
call to that method and I call it by
making use of a JSP expression so the
result of this method call here will be
included right here in this page all
right so let's go ahead and run the
application so I move over here to this
file declaration JSP I'll do a right
click and I'll say run as run on server
and then the browser will come up with
our result so we have lower case hello
world and then we have of course the
lowercase version of the hello world
string and that's it and that's the
result of our JSP expression making a
call to our method that we declared
using a JSP declaration good so we kind
of pulled it all together with a nice
little example good job
all right so let's go ahead and wrap up
this video so in this video I showed you
how to use JSP declarations we created a
declaration and then we call that
declaration from a JSP page
hey in this video I'm gonna show you how
to call a Java class from JSP now in the
previous videos I mentioned that you
wanted to minimize the scriptlets and
declarations in an JSP you want to avoid
dumping thousands of lines of code in
your JSP now it's okay to add small bits
of scriptlet small bits of declarations
but don't overdo it so in order to kind
of help with this problem you can
refactor your code into a separate Java
class or make use of MVC so in this
video I'm actually going to show you how
to refactor that into a separate Java
class
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
have a JSP file and this JSP file is
gonna actually call a separate Java
class so the Java class will have all of
our code all of our business logic and
so on and a JSP can simply make a call
let the Java code or the Java class do
the heavy lifting and then the JSP can
get the results and continue on with its
processing
I build videos like this I always like
to put together a to-do list so the
first thing we need to do is create the
Java class once we have the class
created we're going to call our Java
class from the JSP page all right so a
lot of good things in store here let's
go ahead and dig in and start coding
right so what I'd like to do is move
into eclipse and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna continue to use an existing
project JSP demo
and the first step here is creating a
java class so I'll move into Java
resources source and actually I'll
create a package first so I'll create a
package
just a location to place our java class
so the name of our package will be comm
love to code dot JSP
and then you can go ahead and hit the
finish button
so this creates the package now I'm
going to actually create my java class
in this package so I'll simply do a
right-click and I'll say new class
and for the name of the class I'm gonna
call it fun utils
and I'll keep all of the other defaults
and once I'm happy with this I'll go
ahead and click the finish button
okay great so we have our basic class
here that's lined up
so what I want to do is a create a
method in this class and it's the actual
method make it lower so I'll make this
method static so public static string
make it lower we pass in a string
parameter and then again again very
trivial method here return data to
lowercase so again this is the same
method we use in our declarations
example here I'm simply going to
refactor it and put it into this Java
class so I'll save my file up top and so
I have this method here make it lower
that's part of this class fun utils
okay great so now what I like to do is
create a JSP file that's gonna actually
call this class so I'll move down to my
web content directory and I'll do a
right-click and I'll say new file
now the name of this file I'll actually
call it fun test JSP because we're
testing out the fun you tools and once
I'm happy with its name here I'll go
ahead and click the finish button
so I'll go ahead and
take care of my basic tags here for HTML
and body
and let's have some fun here I'm gonna
make a call using Yan a JSP expression
and I'll call that method that's defined
in that class but I have to give the
fully qualified class name so I need to
give the package name dot the class name
dot the method name
and so I'll call make it lower and I'll
pass in fun funfun
because we're having a lot of fun here
all right so this looks okay well not
really there's a lot of stuff going on
here
I'll break it down for you so we have
this JSP expression
package call come love to coach ASP
that's the package name and then the
actual class name is fun details and
then the method name is make it lower
yeah a lot of stuff we can actually
clean this up a bit by making use of an
import statement
so what I'll do up top is in in the JSP
page you can actually import a class so
use the angle bracket percent with an @
symbol and you say page import and then
you give the name of the package or the
class that you want to import
so here I'm gonna do an import on Comm
not love to coat JSP dot fun utils and
now I can clean up the reference here in
the JSP expression so here's my page
import com love to coach ASP doubt fun
utils so the class is fun utils I could
also make use of the wild card if I like
just using a star if I had more items in
there and then also the other common
question is well what about importing
additional packages well you simply give
a comma delimited list of packages or
classes that you want to import and
that's it so if we wanted to use
ArrayList that's how we go about it but
we're not using ArrayList here so I'll
just go ahead and take it out but again
just a comma delimited list
so that's my fun test I JSP save the
file now I can go ahead and run this fun
test so I can I can do a right-click
I'll say run on server
it'll prompt me to restart the server
that's because I added a new class and
it needs to do some class loading just
go ahead and hit OK it'll go through it
slow process but at the end here we'll
have our output so there it is let's
have some fun and we have fun fun fun
all lowercase remember the code example
it was in all caps now it's in all
lowercase so we know that we are
actually calling that method that's
defined in that Java class so great so
this is really good so we were
successful in having a JSP make a call
to a Java class
all right so let's go ahead and wrap up
this video so we went through the
development process of calling a java
class from a JSP good job
hey in this video I'm gonna show you how
to make use of JSP built-in server
objects
so what built-in server objects these
are given to you for free so there's no
need to create them you can simply use
them directly in your JSP page and
you've actually played around with some
of this earlier and I'll show you this
on the next slide
so here's a list of the commonly used
JSP server objects so starting here at
the top with the request um it contains
information about the HTTP requests
headers and also form data we're gonna
use this a lot in some of the following
videos for reading form data there's
also the response object for sending
back http specific information and we'll
use this also in a following video on
making use of cookies now this one
server object you used already the out
object and we use that for our out dot
print line in one of the previous videos
so again a built in server object and
given to you for free
now there's two others here session it's
a unique session for each user you can
kind of think of a session object it's
kind of like a shopping cart you know
each user has their own unique shopping
cart
we'll use this on a following video and
finally there's the application object
so this is shared for all users of a
given web app and I'll discuss various
use cases on how to use the application
object now just a for disclaimer this is
not an exhaustive list there are other
server objects out there but these are
the ones that are most commonly used for
JSP web apps
all right so here's the idea you have a
browser communicating with the JSP
behind the scenes the HTTP protocol they
actually send over a request object this
request object contains header
information and body information the JSP
can perform some work on that
information and then send back a
response so we have the whole request
response protocol going
in the demo I'll actually show you how
to make use of the request object
all right so let's go ahead and move
into eclipse
what I'd like to do is continue to use
the existing project JSP demo
and I like to move down to the folder
here web content because we're actually
gonna create a new file so I just do a
right-click I say new file now the name
I'll give here I'll call it built-in
test JSP because we're of course testing
some of the built-in objects and once
you're happy with the name we'll go
ahead and click finish
okay great so let's expand the window
here for a second and that we have a
blank file when you start writing some
code so again I start off with my um
HTML and my body information
a header 3
to give us a little name here for the
page and now I want to do is I actually
want to read some information about the
request so I want to find out what type
of browser the user is using to access
my JSP page
so you can access this information using
the request object so I can say request
get header and he can give the header
name of user agent so this will tell you
the actual browser that the client is
using also to tell you the operating
system that they're running on
let me go ahead and add some line breaks
here
and now I also want to find out what
language the client is making use of in
their browser so if they're using
English Spanish German French so here I
say request get locale and this will
give me the actual locale that the user
has set up on their system
so we could use this to customize the
type of pages we send the user based on
their actual locale like English a
German or Spanish and that's basically
it for this very basic demo here so go
ahead and save your file and now let's
go ahead and run this program so I move
to the file built in test dot JSP I'll
do a right-click and I'll say run as and
then run on server
okay great so the application runs a
note here requests user agent so they'll
tell us a type of browser that's coming
through so here we're using this
internal browser that's built in as part
of this Eclipse tool but note it also
says that we're using a Mac OSX so we
know the operating system and the
browser that the user is running on let
me copy this information and put it into
a different browser I'll drop it in the
chrome and I'll just paste it
and so now we get the same
here it says Chrome so they give us the
actual Chrome browser that we're using
an aversion Mac OS and also the request
language is English so again you could
possibly use this to customize the
different pages you want to send back to
the user based on their browser type OS
type or their language type so good job
an example of using that built in a
request object
okay great let's go ahead and wrap up
this video in this video I showed you
how to use some of the built-in server
objects we may use the request object to
find out the users operating system and
browser and the following videos will
drill down into some of the other
objects and you can kind of see them
working out real world for various use
cases
hello in this video I'm going to show
you how to use JSP for including other
files
so the common use case for including
files is including standard headers and
footers so say for example you're
building a website anyone have the same
header and footer information displayed
on every page so you can simply create
the header and footer and separate files
and include them in your JSP files
alright so when you include a file you
can include either HTML files or JSP
files it's totally up to you so at the
top here I do a JSP include and page
equals my header dot HTML a similar
thing here at the bottom I can do a JSP
include page equals my footer dot JSP
and that's it very simple very
straightforward
all right so let's go ahead and try this
out so let's move into eclipse what I'd
like to do is to continue to use that
existing project JSP demo
and let's move down to the web content
folder and what I want to do first is
create those files I'm going to include
so first I want to create the header
file so I'll say new file
give the filename of my header HTML so
that's the header that we're going to
include
and when you happen with the file name
here click finish
so for the header I simply want to give
the name JSP tutorial so I'm gonna set
up h1 and mommy the alignment for to be
Center and then inside the tag here I'll
just say JSP tutorial so this will be
included on all pages for you know my
given website that I'm just making up
right now
so I'll go ahead and save this file so
this is our header file that we have set
up right now
now let's move over let's
in our footer so again on web content
I'll do a right-click I'll say new file
I'll call it my footer JSP so in the
footer we actually want to add some JSP
coding so once we're happy with the file
name go ahead and click finish
so for here for the footer for every
page I want to give the time the page
was last modified or just we're just
gonna kind of make this up actually so
here I'll just say last modified or last
updated and then I'll just drop in the
actual date/time stamp so that way that
all of our pages look fresh every time a
user will visit our website
now just hit the Save button okay great
so now at this point we have our header
complete and we also have our footer
complete so now we can go ahead and
create our main page that's actually
going to include these files
so I'll move over to the web content
folder I'll do a right-click I'll say
new file
I'll call this homepage JSP and once
we're happy with the name here we'll
click finish
sona's homepage what we're gonna do is
we're actually going to include
information from the headers and the
footers and also we'll put some our
regular content here side to the
standard work here for our HTML in our
body and now I want to do is import or
include the header so I'll say JSP
include I give page equals my header dot
HTML
and now I can enter some regular content
that I'll have on my home page here I'm
just gonna put in some filler stuff just
some blah blah blah just to you know
placeholders here
and then I'll copy this line X number of
times just to kind of fill it up a
little bit
so that's our content let's go ahead and
include our footer so I'll say JSP
include page equals my footer dot JSP
because our foot is a JSP file and again
you can go either way HTML or JSP
depending on how you want to build out
your pages
and that's it so I go ahead and save
this file and then I can go ahead and
run it
all right so I can move over to this
file home patient on jasp I can do a
right-click and then I can say run as
and then run on server
okay great this looks really good so up
top we have our header file that we
included JSP tutorial then we have all
of our body or blah blah blah stuff and
then we have the actual footer and
notice how the footer is a JSP and it
included the current timestamp when this
page was accessed
so our site will always look fresh as
far as our fresh content which is a good
thing right
so good job in this video I showed you
how to build JSP pages by including
other files
