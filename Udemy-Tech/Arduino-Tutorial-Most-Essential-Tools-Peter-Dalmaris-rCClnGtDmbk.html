auto electronics' ask me what are the
very basic tools of the need in order to
get started and by then that don't
really mean tools that they allow them
to do everything but to play around with
arduino kids for example and put
together the first are doing experiments
things of that kind of course i've got a
whole other course that explains how to
equip your electronics workbench and i
go into a lot of details about the
different kinds of tools that you can
have on or around your workbench but for
somebody that is studying right now and
this is the first entry into the world
of the other we know and electronics
this is really all that you need these
tools will get you very far
i start from the left screwdrivers in it
a small set of precision screwdrivers
the reason for that is that a lot of the
components that you'll be working in
with for example like this potentiometer
or this sound sensor of god
lectures for these things coming up
later on in this course they have little
components they've got little things in
the on on them that allow you to
calibrate them in some way so for
example this sound sensor just bring it
a bit closer to the camera you can see
that it has a tiny potentiometer here
and by using a precision screwdriver
well you are able to change the
sensitivity of this microphone similarly
with this potentiometer you can see that
it's got a provision for a flathead
screwdriver so to change the setting the
potentiometer you would need screwdriver
with a flat head like that this would
allow you to turn the knob even this one
here this is an
for red motion detector it's a sensor
they can see that it's got more
potentiometers that allow you to
calibrate various settings on this
sensor and again for this particular
sensor I've got a lecture coming up
later in this course so for things like
that a precision set of screwdrivers is
absolutely necessary and you don't need
anything fancier than what I'm showing
you here like later on for example you
can go for something like this that
allows you to use all of the different
types and sizes of tips that you get
with your six piece set plus a lot more
types and even with flexible neck if you
need to reach hard to get to places or
this one also has an extension but
something like this is really not
necessary and I really doubt that anyone
beginning with the addendum now will
ever need to get to that level another
set of tools that I believe is necessary
it's a bunch of tweezers and get
tweezers come in a variety of types
shapes and types and these are some of
the tweezers that I have now tweezers
are really good if you need to
manipulate small things so for example
let's say that I'm working on a
breadboard here and I've got a a little
resistant a few flat straight jumper
wires and I can use my big thumbs and
fat fingers to try and get the parts in
the right place on the breadboard and
perhaps you can do that if you've got
small fingers but for me it seems to be
a lot easier to just use tweezers so I
can I can use a tweezer like this to
pick up a part from a box and just
easily insert it onto the breadboard go
done you can
the same thing with any other component
pretty much it's just mixing it making
it so much easier and clean to use
tweezers to do the job
Twitter's come again as I said in
different shapes so I use the one with
the rounded and quite a lot when I work
with breadboards but this also straight
tweezers different kinds it actually
looks like this now there's another same
it's just different size of the tip and
one with flatter around that head as
well you could use pretty much any
Twitter you like if you are working with
parts like this that are not active if
you start working with microchips for
example and if you want to manipulate a
chip to put it on a breadboard or on a
PCB
then the nice thing about this
particular set of Twitter's are of God
is that there is the electrostatic or
anti-static tweezers so they don't
accumulate electrical charge on them
which means that you can protect the
part that you're working on from static
electricity
and you don't zap them so if you don't
have any tweezers lying around
then go on eBay and look for something
like this or electrostatic tweezers
tweezers that are made specifically for
work with marker electronics and
sensitive electronics so that's a few
things about Twitter's and finally of
course you can't really do much without
I said of wire cutters with wire cutters
you can do obviously cutting voids very
easy and you can also you will also need
to do things like like trim pins of
parts like resistors and transistor
absolutely necessary since those things
come with very long pins you can also
use them to trim pins of soldering work
so for example let's say that you just
finished soldering a new part and you
break out and you want to trim it so you
can see for example in this case the the
soda is forming a slightly pointy end
and I'd like to trim it so that it's at
the same level that's the rest so it
doesn't get caught like it doesn't get
caught in anything so I will just use my
wire cutter and trim the top so there is
not as point anymore okay well done so a
set of wire cut is like this absolutely
essential and that's about it really you
don't need that many tools you need a
couple of tweezers
perhaps one with a bent tip one with a
straight tip either flat or pointy like
this one just for precision manipulation
of parts your Carris and a small set of
precision screwdrivers and that's about
it thanks for watching if you'd like to
