that JavaScript is rather important as a
web development language nowadays that's
why I decided to make the first module
of my JavaScript bootcamp as well as my
es6 bootcamp available for free on this
channel that should give you the very
basics or changes with es6 you will need
to well work with javascript if you then
want to type into javascript deeper feel
free to take the full courses I feel
very happy to welcome you there but if
you don't want you that's fine these
free videos or this free video here
should get you started and give you the
very basics you need
before we actually start let's talk
about one very important thing
where does javascript actually run now
you might notice in this case just feel
free to skip ahead but if you're not
100% sure about this here you go
javascript typically runs in the browser
which means when you load a webpage
javascript is not executed on a server
from which the webpage comes but instead
in your browser
that's why javascript is so popular
these days because it allows you to
create very good and reactive user
experiences since it doesn't depend on
some kind of server responding in time
but well it runs in the browser there
where the user is using it there is no
closer way or new closer place to
execute code and therefore javascript is
very powerful but there also is the
chance to run it on a server with no GS
which is a server-side language based on
JavaScript now in this course I'll
clearly focus on the browser part but
many many many of the concepts you
learned here indeed all of the very
basics of JavaScript and how it works
will of course also apply to the server
and know chess noce as extends the
language and offers other features as
well but the core language of course is
JavaScript and therefore the things you
learn in this course are relevant for
this as well
before we actually get started with the
course let's talk about es5 raises es6
or let's talk about es 5 + es 6 means to
begin with
es stands for ACMA script and now you
might be confused because a few seconds
ago I was talking about JavaScript
now what's ACMA script equi script kind
of is the overarching language which has
its own well committee if you want to
put it like this which develops language
implements new features were at least
well decides which new features should
be implemented in the next version and
so on and Charma script therefore is
kind of a dialect of ACMA script though
you think you can safely say it's the
most important one and therefore the two
terms are often used interchangeably and
as a dialect it follows the
specifications of ACMA script so when I
talk about is 5 and es6 I talk about
versions of this language and currently
yes 5 is the most recent version which
means it's supported by all major
browsers even for off a bit older words
off there's browsers es6 will be the
next big thing it will be the next
version of JavaScript if you want to put
it like this and implements many cool
features and indeed you can check out my
ear 6 boot camp to learn about those new
features however ESX is not supported by
all browsers yet and often times you
need some holy faults or transparence
which actually transpile your code back
to use 5 versions which then would work
again so it's not natively supported and
therefore in this course I'm focusing on
es 5 the code which will actually run
for sure and you may check out my es6
boot camp for all the new cool features
which you will be able to use in the
future
this course follows a special approach I
believe that you learn the most if I'm
able to focus on one part of language at
a time now sometimes you see courses
where you learn certain features but you
want to implement them in a webpage and
therefore you need to write some Unruh
code which it's not really connected to
the topic you want to focus on right now
I think that's a problem because it
deters you from really deeply diving
into the topic at hand therefore the
format I chose for this course is the
following we'll be using a web page
named jsbin comm so if you navigate over
there in your browser you see that it
should look something like this now it
might look a bit different if you open
up for the first time you might close
this thick blue thing you got at the top
when opening it for the first time and
that make sure to only check javascript
and console here so that only these two
items are highlighted now from time to
time I'll also use some HTML code and
possibly the output but what this page
allows you to do basically is to write a
simple JavaScript HTML program and see
it run immediately therefore we don't
have any problems with setting up our
workspace or having to write redundant
code which isn't really the topic at
hand
that being said of course I have a
separate module about setting up a
workflow and setting up a real project
because in the end of course you won't
be writing applications in this tool but
it's great for learning and that's why
I'm using it for the maturity of the
course we won't even see the HTML code
we'll just we use JavaScript and see
what happens in the JavaScript console
which is a convenient way to output
values now you might argue while my
programs won't output it to the console
I need knowledge how to work with HTML
code and you would be right but that is
why I have a complete module or two
actually about interacting with the HTML
document but it's very important to
understand all the other parts of the
language first and for dad you won't
need HTML since it's only one part
language and it's only about while
actually displaying it in the HTML code
but not enlarging you write the logic
you write depends on functions objects
and datatypes and that can be perfectly
output in the console like this so for
example you will see Misa type something
like assignment assigning a variable and
of course I'll come back to variables
very soon and then logging that variable
to well D console.log and if you then
hit command enter here or click this Run
button you see that it gets executed and
gets printed to the console on the right
which is a very convenient way to see
what actually happened and what do you
result of a certain calculation might be
welcome to this basics module in this
module we'll have a look at the well
very basics of JavaScript how the
language works and what are the key
parts of the language which allow you to
write awesome applications we'll have a
look at how javascript is actually
executed and how you can implement it in
your webpage then we'll have a look at
what variables are and how we can use
them which types javascript knows what
functions are and how functions work
we'll have a look at control structures
such as if or loops and finally at some
operators you can use for well during
your program for calculations or for
comparisions
so let's start with the very first
important step even though we're able to
execute it here is simply while typing
code on the left and seeing it in the
console on the right technically you
would need to implement your code in
your HTML document to have anything to
run so if I open up by HTML document
here you see this is our normal HTML 5
skeleton and I won't go into HTML basics
in this course I will create a new
header here and you can quickly do this
by simply typing h1 and then hitting tab
well just say the JavaScript bootcamp
now and this will appear in the output
here but we won't need the output for
now so I'll close it let's see how can
we execute code in such a HTML document
well if I go below the title here I can
type script and hit tab and this will
create script tags for me if I type
console.log hello there and close this
with brackets or with parentheses here
and then I click run you see hello there
in the console even though I didn't
write anything here in the middle right
well the reason for this is this middle
column here is just a service or a
convenience offered by this website
where I can execute JavaScript right
away and indeed we will heavily use this
throughout the course but in reality you
will have to include but in reality you
will have to include your scripts like
this with such a script tag in your HTML
document now when the browser renders
your page it basically runs through your
HTML code from top to bottom and when it
hits this script code it will
immediately execute all the code it
finds between the opening and closing
tag here this is why hello there
gets printed to the console because
that's all the code I have here and as I
said is immediately executed
now the script tag also has some
attributes you can specify for example
the type attribute I can set this
appear to text slash JavaScript and if I
click random what will happen
I still see hello there because this is
an optional attribute I can pass to
specify well that this is indeed
JavaScript code but I may also leave it
out and indeed you would leave it out
typically so there is no difference
between both ways of executing this code
notice that currently I'm executing this
code where I have the script tag right
here in the head section now imagine I
take this code here remove it from the
hat section and put it right before my
closing body tag here so at the end of
the body section what do you think will
happen now well if I click run
we still see hello there because as I
said the browser runs over your file
from top to bottom and will execute any
JavaScript code it finds therefore the
position of the code doesn't really
matter it doesn't have to be inside the
Hat section to be executed indeed it's
best practice to put it right here where
it currently is right before the closing
body tag why is this the best practice
well as I said the browser goes from top
to bottom for your file and pulls up
your web page now imagine you have a
Chava Script code here which triggers
some long-running operation in this case
the browser would be occupied and
couldn't continue loading your web page
below this script tag here now that
would of course mean that you might not
see your web page even though
technically it could be loaded even with
your script not being finished
therefore by putting your scripts at the
end of the page you make sure that the
HTML document actually gets loaded
before the script is executed which of
course first results in a performance
increase and second it makes sure that
if your script is trying to access some
HTML elements in your page those
elements are actually there because the
browser already ran over the specific
code now as you might be aware you also
have the chance of turning off
JavaScript in your bra
how can you handle this case that a user
visits your page which has JavaScript
turned off well that of course depends
on your page if your page depends
heavily on JavaScript you might just
want to show him a message telling him
that well he should turn off JavaScript
or well leave the page because you're
not able to provide a well browsing
experience
Averell cases it might not really matter
but if you want to display such a
message or any message you can use the
no script tags with any message between
them and this message here will only be
displayed of course in the normal page
here not on any console any normal page
if a user visits the page with
JavaScript being turned off
so until now we had a look at how we
could place javascript code in our HTML
document and executed now imagine you
have a more complex application with a
lot more code than one single line like
we currently do in this case it would
not be that great if all of that code
would be in your HTML document why
wouldn't that be great well first of all
because it would be very hard for you
yourself as a developer to work with
that bake bake bake file off JavaScript
code therefore it's very common and
indeed best practice of course to
actually outsource your JavaScript code
in separate files which then import into
your HTML document so that you don't
have the JavaScript code in the HTML
document itself an easy way to outsource
this is to simply import another file
where you hold your code now
unfortunately I can't really demonstrate
this here with jsbin therefore for this
example we're heading to another page
plunker without an you dot Co which is
kind of a similar tool but follows a
different approach in some places and
here as you can see it looks a bit
similar here but it doesn't have that
extra consul indeed here instead we just
see the web page here being loaded here
you can already see if we got such an
import here and we're importing as it
looks like this script ojs file now as
you see for the import we still use
script tags and notice that we have an
opening and closing tag even though
there is no code between the tags and we
have this source or a SRC attribute on
the opening script tag where we specify
the path to the file we want to import
script is in this case now script ojs
can hold any code we might want to have
so if I enter console.log hello there
here what do you think we will see in
the console well first we need
have a console to begin with so I'll
open my developer tools here in chrome
which I can do with hitting command alt
and an eye or ctrl alt and I on Windows
or of course open them from the menu by
going to view developer developer tools
or just a JavaScript console here and
there you can see we can also get this
hello there
text even though of course in the
index.html file we don't have that hello
there anywhere but we're importing this
file which again will be executed
immediately so the behavior does not
change if you have code in an external
file this code will be executed as soon
as JavaScript finds this file and
therefore it's really just a way to
restructure your code and get rid of the
code in your HTML file now of course you
might not only import this at the head
section but in the body section as well
which as it was before is a good
practice to make sure that your code
actually gets executed last as you see
we have this opening and closing tag
enough in between
can't we just write this well let's test
this I clear my console here and make
this a bit bigger and let's see what
happens if I click this refresh button
nothing happens we don't see hello there
so the code is not getting executed and
the reason for this is that the script
tag always has to have opening a closing
tag that's kind of a historic thing that
it will used to be written like this
with code between the opening and
closing tag and it's still the case as
you see it now prints again and we have
to provide the opening and closing tag
when referencing external files even
though there is no code between the boat
to tax that being said what does happen
if we put code between the opening and
closing tag so let's say I write hallo
from between here and I save this well
as you see we still only got hello there
here we're not seeing hello from between
even though it has a typo so why is this
the case why don't we see this code
being executed because the browser won't
do that the browser sees that we import
a file here and therefore it will still
execute that file it doesn't care what
we write between the opening and closing
TX it will indeed just ignore everything
between the opening and closing tag and
only execute the code in the imported
file so this code would only run if you
would get rid of the import here like
this now you see we're getting hello
from between so I'll get back to
importing from script chess and I'll get
rid of this code between the opening and
closing tag now can we also import
multiple files let's try it I'm going to
copy this import and I'll name of this
file script 2 now as you see I'm
currently getting an error that there is
no script to J's file and if I click on
on new file here and create a script -
yes file and then here I write
console.log script - and I save this
you see we got hello there and script -
and I'll clear my console to see this a
bit better hello there and script 2 so
both scripts are getting executed and
they get executed in the order we
specify the imports here that of course
is important if you have one file
depending on the other code being run
then you need to put the file depending
on that after the first file otherwise
this code would not be executed yet so
this ordering here is pretty clear and
pretty important also oftentimes you
might use third-party libraries like for
example jQuery and if you want to use
function
from jQuery you have to make sure that
the check we import comes first before
you import your code depending on it now
you can change this behavior there is
another attribute you can use I can put
the defer attribute on this first script
here and as you see now script u gets
executed first before hello there
so the ferb asically tells the browser
wait with this script and only lowered
it offer all the other scripts which
don't have defer on them were executed
now you can use this but honestly it's
really better to just change the
ordering because that is just confusing
and if you're working together with
other developers or you yourself forget
that you put the fur on such an import
you might be wondering why this isn't
working the way it should and therefore
well I would strongly recommend not
using before and instead just placing
the imports and the order they should be
placed
so now that you know how to run the code
how to embed it in your HTML document
and use it there let's actually dive
into JavaScript itself into the
fundamentals of the language and how it
works I'll start with the fundamental
thing existing variables variables are
very very basic thing in each language
and without them probably no code would
work so what are variables variables
basically are little data structures or
storages which allow you to store values
to a store data if you want to put it
like this you create a variable in
javascript by using the VAR keyword and
then give this a name following the VAR
keyword like variable and there are some
reserved names but most of em the names
are free and you will get errors if you
try to use reserved names and then you
assign a value by typing equals and then
the value you want to assign for example
5 now what's the benefit of doing this I
can use this variable throughout my code
so for example I can use console.log and
write variable here and now if I hit
command enter you see 5 in the console
which of course happens because we're
printing the value of the variable by
using the variable here in this function
I'll come back to functions in a later
point of course - so variables are
places to store data
this of course froze the question which
data can be stored here you see a number
5 notice that we just typed a number
like this imagine I wanted to store some
text let's say text what do you think
will happen what will I see in the
console if I click run I get an error
the text is not defined because by using
text or characters like this javascript
expects this to be a variable like we
defined variable here this also is just
some text we enter here
javascript would expect a variable of
name text to be set equal to variable
and of course we don't have such a
variable here
we didn't initialize a variable named
text so this won't work if we want to
print actual text so a string of
characters here in the console we would
have to put quotation marks around text
if I now clear the console and click run
again you see that we print text here
instead
so the real text we wanted to print and
this of course is important to know and
understand that if you don't have
quotation marks and it's not a number
JavaScript expects a variable with this
name or a function or something like
that and therefore we would get an error
if this variable doesn't exist so we saw
numbers and now we see text which other
types do we have well we also have
boolean s-- which means true or false
and we can easily set this like this
true now wait a second a minute ago I
said that you have to put quotation
marks around text if you want to use it
and that now a JavaScript would look for
a variable named true theoretically yes
practically no I also said that there
are some keywords which are reserved and
can't be used for variable names true is
such a keyword and therefore true here
will not resolve to a variable or
JavaScript won't look for a variable
named true instead true is a value like
5 is a value and if I clear this what do
you think we'll see in the console we
see true notice that we don't have any
quotation marks here or something like
this because true is a value like 5 is a
number or the text you saw a few seconds
ago was a string this is a boolean and
this is its own data type we can use and
of course we not only have true we also
have false now with all that being
explained will it work if I
renamed variable to my number one var
like this one var now this won't work I
must not have a number at the beginning
of a variable name that will not work I
may have a number in my variable name
but not at the beginning of it and var
is also a reserved keyword though var
one would work because now I have a new
variable name it's not just var and the
number is not at the beginning therefore
if I clear this and hit run this would
work since now we're again having a
valid variable name but back to the
basic types we have we saw a number text
and boolean what about the following if
I have 6.5 here what do you think I'll
see in the console while I see you 6.5
but the question is what is this this is
also a number or is it a float like in
some other languages was the first
number 5 and integer because if you're
coming from an avid program in language
you might know the concept of having
integers and floating point numbers and
there is a difference between both well
let's see what does this we cannot only
print the value we can also print type
off and if I print this well we see this
is off type number no since we're at it
let's see what 5 is it's also a number
so a floating-point number like 6 point
5 and 5 both have the same type
javascript doesn't know integers and
floating point numbers it's all just a
number and by the way since I didn't
check this earlier what was the type of
text string so this is of type string
and just to finish the line here if I
check true
you see this is boolean as I explained
so we had a look at the very basic data
structures numbers strings boolean z'
but javascript offers as more data
structures in these let's have a look at
the following if I have square brackets
and then 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 what do you think I'll
see in a console if I hit run now while
I get it printed like this but what is
this well let's check it with type off
it's not checked but actually yes it's
not object but specifically adds an
array an array is a collection of values
and this clearly is a collection of
numbers here so we have three numbers in
this array and the cool thing about an
array is that it allows us to store
multiple values in one variable as you
see here we have three numbers in one
variable we also may mix different data
types so I may add four but notice that
four is in quotation marks so four
actually is a string here so if I run
this you see we still get it printed out
but now we have an array of mixed data
types which might have its uses in your
program tube now while it's certainly
cool to have such a collection you most
of the time won't need a complete
collection but you want to store several
values there but then want to be able to
access the different values you can
easily access values by putting square
brackets after your variable name when
you're accessing it and between the
square brackets you put the index of the
value you want to access now here's an
important thing and I will come back to
arrays in a later stage of this course
Aires start with an index of zero so the
first element one here has an index of
zero so if I try this accessing the
first element as you might face
what do you think I'll see in a console
here too so we're actually accessing the
second element even though I typed one
here and the reason of course is that if
first index actually is zero so if I had
run now now you see we're getting one
and that's just important to keep in
mind therefore the last element is not
four and if I were to try accessing the
fourth in next year or index four here
what do you think we'll see in a console
while we're not seeing four but we're
getting undefined and undefined is a
pretty clear message we're accessing a
value which is not defined we're
accessing the last index here and you
can think of this like having an extra
comma here so now here we have a new
element but there's nothing there so
what do you think shows in a console if
I now click run still undefined because
now it just made clear what happened
before we have this extra element but
there's nothing here so it's undefined
now we also get some other types we can
use this is an array here if I get rid
of it
and then step try this undefined
that was what we just got a couple of
times right what do you think I'll see
if I now hit run while we still get
undefined so we can set a variable to
being undefined but we should not do
this because undefined really as
JavaScript error message of telling us
hey you were accessing something which
which isn't there which wasn't defined
and if we want to set a variable to
being empty and there are cases where we
want to do this where we want to reset
it where we want to clear it we should
not use undefined but instead null which
also is a keyword and tells JavaScript
hey this variable is now not set or it
is empty but it does not only find so
what do you think I'll see in a console
if I
hit run I get now because now it is set
to null and not to undefined now is now
the same as undefined
let's check this and I use an operator
which I'll explain in more depth later
on but basically I'll compare null to
undefined and I'm printing the result of
this compression now I'm comparing it
with two equal signs which means check
if the value is equal and what do you
think I'll see in the console I get true
so internally JavaScript has the same
value for null and undefined which means
it's kind of the same if we only have a
look at the value but if I add a number
equal sign here I not only check for the
values being equal but also for the
types being equal and if I now run this
code I get false so now that's not
exactly the same as an you find but
value wise it's handled in the same way
so we had undefined and now we have one
other special type I'm going back to
printing out the variable and I can also
set it to capital n lowercase a capital
N and that refers to not a number not a
number s name says is well simply just
not a number and what do you think I'll
get when I hit run now what I get not a
number but what's the sense of this type
well typically you would set a variable
equal to not a number but you might get
not a number as the result of some kind
of mathematical calculation if something
goes wrong there or for example you try
to multiply a number with a string which
doesn't work since you can't multiply
these two types then you would get not a
number as the result saying the result
isn't a number since JavaScript isn't
able to get a result so it's mostly
error message from mathematical
equations or mathematical operations now
with null undefined and not a number
what is the type of not a number what do
you think will see in a console it's
actually a number which is pretty
confusing citizens called not a number
right but as I said it's the result of a
mathematical calculation and therefore
technically it's a number but it's a
special number a kind of undefined
number if you want to put it like this
so actually a number which isn't a
number and yes this is a bit confusing
but basically think of it as error
message from a mathematical calculation
and once we're added what is the type of
null what do you think we'll see if I
hit run it's an object and what's the
type of undefined it's undefined so this
is why I was getting this error when
comparing both with three equal signs
which also checks on type equality the
types of undefined and null are not
equal and the finders of type and you
find and lots of type object the values
are equal and that's important to
understand here
now I'll go back to printing out the
variable and I want to show another and
for now the last very important value or
data structure in JavaScript an object
and I'll have a complete module on
objects in this course but I want to get
started with it right now since we're
talking about variables in general and
which you values you can assign to
variables well an object is such a value
one of the quickest ways to create an
object in JavaScript is to use curly
braces and then you may expand this to
over multiple lines this will work and
here you can create fields and methods
now fields are basically variables
inside an object if you want to put it
like this also refer to as properties
and methods are functions inside
variables and no words I'll come back to
both things soon so I could specify name
here and now I'm not assigning a value
with an equal sign but inside of an
object indicated by a call it braces
here I assign it by typing colon and
then the value for example max which is
a string here of course now what do you
think I'll see if I print var one to the
console well I see object object and
then the actual object so I see the
object I just created but the cool thing
about objects is I can also access this
name directly by typing dot then name so
the name of this field which helps to be
named here if I now click run we see max
so it is string so now I'm kind of
accessing a variable even though you
would call it property or field inside
my object here and objects are very
important data structures since you may
have multiple fields or nested fields
and functions inside them so you can
kind of
OOP different functionalities and well
you will work with objects quite a lot
in your code and we will see objects
quite a lot throughout this course as
well so what's the type of this object
if I run type off and now I hit run it's
object so that that probably wasn't too
surprising but as I just explained this
is an object and it's of type object of
course therefore
so I'll change this to a battery code
style as well and now let's have a look
at something else we have our 1 which is
5 what happens if I also create var one
set is equal to 10 whoops
add a 1 but notice that I have a capital
of V at the beginning if I now copy this
line you're at also print var 1 what do
you think I'll see in a console if I hit
run well they get 5 and 10 because these
two variables are two different
variables so JavaScript is case
sensitive we have two different
variables even though it's the same name
but the capital V does matter and
actually creates a new variable
therefore two different values are
printed to the console here now what
happens if I have var one here I'll get
rid of the second variable here and also
we'll print out it anymore but now after
printing it out I am setting war 1 equal
to 10 and then I print it out again what
do you think I'll now see in a console 5
and 10 because now here I'm reassigning
the variable notice that I don't have
d'Ivoire keyword here and I don't need
it because I'm not creating a new
variable var is only needed when
creating a new variable so for declaring
a variable but instead I'm using an
existing one and I'm reassigning it here
therefore I'm changing the value and
that is how you can do this and this of
course is also something you'll probably
do in your code that your variables
might not keep their initial value but
instead might receive new values
throughout your code what do you think
will happen if I turn this 10 here into
a string by adding quotation marks what
do you think will now see in a console
while we see 5 and then a string of 10
so even though the variable was a number
at the beginning we
can change to a string and indeed we can
see this type switch if we print the
types instead of the values so if I now
hit run you'll see that we get number
and string so the type of the variable
was actually changed because JavaScript
uses dynamic typing which means
variables may change their types that is
something most languages or many
languages don't offer there you would
create a variable of type integer and
then you would only be allowed to assign
integers or strings or whatever type is
of the variable to that variable in
JavaScript it doesn't care
therefore you're not telling it which
type this variable should be you just
set it to an initial value and then it
has the type of this value but it has no
problems of switching the type type
later on this might be useful in some
situations but generally it's also a
good practice to not do this to knots
which types constantly but instead stick
to the initial type
what is a function a function basically
is some kind of enclosed code which you
can execute whenever you want even
multiple times so remember that before
which ever code we put here was executed
immediately by the browser whenever the
browser finds this kill would be that in
an imported file or directly in the
index.html file it will directly execute
the code now we can create a function
like this with the function keyword and
then the name of the function let's name
it calc for calculate maybe then you
have parentheses and then call it braces
and now don't mistake these Kaali braces
with the ones we were using when
creating an object curly braces
generally just mean we're creating kind
of a block here which belongs to Gabrus
so we can have multi-line statements in
here which all belong to this block
that's all we do with these curly braces
so inside these Kaali braces we might
write the logic this function should
execute so I'll again write console.log
inside function here now what do you
think will happen if I click run nothing
because even though the code gets
executed instantly functions don't get
called automatically that is not really
what functions are good for instead we
have to call them like this using their
name and then with parentheses here now
if I click run you see inside function
because now the function get X gets
executed does it also get executed if
I'll leave out the parentheses here
no nothing happens so the parentheses
here are important to actually call a
function and as you later see we can
also do more with these parentheses than
just define and call it an interesting
thing is you can also use a function
if you define it after calling it so if
I hit run now you still see inside
function and here again we have hoisting
now with functions unlike with variables
it's not that uncommon to have function
definitions like this one here
after the usage so that is a fine
behavior and you might actually use this
in your code as well now I'll put it
back to the top anyways and I want to
show you another way of creating such a
function so you can use the function
keyword and then the name here but
another way to do exactly the same would
be to create a variable name it calc and
assign it to a function but notice that
now here we don't have a name we just
have function and then parentheses so
now if I run this what do you think
we'll see we still see inside function
but we also should now put a semicolon
here because now we're technically
creating a variable and we're assigning
this function to this variable we can
then still call the function with well
calc and then parentheses so that
doesn't change it's just a different
type of creating a function but we may
use both types
now speaking of this what do you think
we'll see if I lock the type of this
function and notice that I don't have
parentheses here so I'm not executing
the function I just want you refer to
this function variable so if I had run
now we see function so this is of type
function and it's the same true if I use
the other way to create a function what
do you think we'll see now this is also
of type function so it is the same and
it has this special function type in
JavaScript so it's a variable of type
function here now can I do the following
create another fun
and assign the first function to it but
without parentheses here and then I try
to execute another function which should
be this function here right I assigned
this function to this variable so if I
now hit run what do you think we'll see
well we'll see inside function because
this it works exactly in this way we
were creating a new variable and we're
just assigning it another variable and
this variable happens to be a function
now what happens if I use parentheses
here what do you think will now see if I
hit run well now we get inside function
but then we get an error and the reason
is we get inside function here because
we're executing the function here but
then we're trying to assign the return
value to this new variable now this
function doesn't return anything it just
executes some code therefore another
function is now not set to this and
therefore we correctly get the error
that another function is not a function
so we can't execute it so what is
another function if we log out another
function here it's undefined because
we're setting it to something which
isn't there we're setting it to the
return value of this function and as I
said this function doesn't return
anything therefore we're returning
nothing therefore it's undefined and
that's why we could not execute it like
a function
so what is this return value I'm talking
off well let's say I change this here to
not print something out but instead I
want you return a string and this is a
common scheme because oftentimes your
functions will just do something and
return a value for the caller of the
function to use I can return a value by
adding the return keyword so now I'm
just returning a string there is no
variable assigned to a string or
anything it's just a string so I'm
returning this string here and then I'm
assigning this returned value to another
function which now isn't a function so
maybe I should name it returned to make
this less confusing so returned is now
what this function calc returns which
again is the string so now if I print
returned what do you think we'll see
well of course we see inside function
because now I'm printing what this
function returned to me which is this
string of course I could also return
a variable T find inside calc so return
string war what do you think we'll see
now we still get inside function because
I haven't really changed anything I'm
just using a variable inside this
function which is perfectly fine and I
may do that now there is something
special about the scope of this variable
but I'll come back to this in the next
in one of the next lessons
so I'm now returning stuff inside this
function and that's cool but sometimes I
also want to pass something into a
function and not just return values I
can do this by adding arguments here
between the parentheses in my function
definition so maybe since this function
is called calc I want to calculate
something so I'll pass two numbers let's
say number one and number two now here
I'm not assigning any string variable
but instead I want to return let's say
the addition of number one and number
two and this is just the addition
operator here of course so now if I
execute this what you what you think
we'll see
while this might not have been
straightforward but we get not a number
the reason is we're still calling this
function without passing any arguments
here right but we try to add the
arguments we get and we return the
result now we did not get an error which
would be the case in some other
languages because we're calling a
function which expects arguments by not
passing arguments but what gets passed
in indirectly are two undefined
numbers so technically we were adding
undefined plus undefined which will
since we're doing a mathematical
operation here result in an error and
returned not a number because we can't
add undefined and undefined therefore we
are returning this result which is not a
number and then we're printing it this
is why we see not a number
here so to make this function call here
more useful and not get another number I
will add arguments to it let's say 10
and 8 and I do this by simply specifying
them here when I call the function
separated with commas if I now run this
what do you think we'll see well we get
18 because we're adding 10 and 8 and
Saito's function and returning the value
which we then print here so now it is
works what happens if I pass too many
arguments so if I pass one extra 10 here
what do you think we'll see now while we
still get 18 and the other argument is
just ignored we don't get an error that
we would get in other languages but it's
not getting you 0 and now what do you
think happens if I changed is a bit and
here I create my variable named
calculator and assign this to this calc
function but I'm not executing the
function here and then I log out
calculator 15 and 2 what do you think
will now get in the console here well we
get 17 because what I'm doing here is
I'm just assigning this function here to
a new variable so this variable is now
also pointing to this function and then
I'm executing this function and I pass
two arguments and therefore I get back
the addition of the two arguments and
I'm simply just executing this function
here so that were the basics about
functions and how you can use functions
now why would you use such functions
well as you already saw functions allow
you to and close some code and you can
of course call functions more than once
therefore it's a useful utility for
repetitive tasks or more complex
calculations or calculations or code you
don't want to execute right at startup
because
remember generally all your code will be
executed once the browser runs through
it
now I was speaking about the browser
executing the code immediately at the
end of the last lecture you can control
the flow of the code execution with
control structures control structures
basically allow you to tell the browser
when to execute certain code or execute
certain code more often than once so
really useful tools you have your
toolbox for creating awesome
applications a very common and wide
known control structure is the if
statement which basically allows you to
run some code conditionally so I'll
create a new variable and I'll name it
condition and I will set it to true so
this is a boolean variable here and then
I'll create an if statement by writing
if and then the condition between
parenthesis here now as you later see
when I come to operators you can also
come compare a certain values here but
here I'll just check if condition and of
condition of course I'm referring to
this variable here now an if statement
which I then create by adding curly
braces expects true or false these are
the only two values with which an if
statement can work because it's checking
if this is true then execute whatever is
between these parentheses or these curly
braces excuse me
if this is false the code between here
will not get executed so if I now lock
something here for example executed well
I think this is pretty straightforward
but what will we see if I had run while
we see executed because I'm checking if
condition is true and of course
condition is true because I'm setting it
here and on the other hand of course if
I set this to false and I hit run we see
nothing because this code is now not
executed sometimes we also want to check
if something is true but we want to
provide or execute some other code if
well
condition is not met we can therefore
add the alt keyword and then Kali braces
after it again so now we execute this
code if the condition is true but if the
condition is not true so if it is false
we'll reach this code here so what do
you think will now see if I had run more
we still see executed because it's still
set to true but if I change this to
false and hit run again you'll now see
we get not executed because now we're
reaching this else part here there's
also another thing we could specify else
if now why would you specify else if if
we only can handle true or false well
sometimes we want to check multiple
conditions for being true so for example
here we check if condition is true and
then we print this code but if condition
is false we want to check if another
condition is true and if another
condition is true and we check this here
we execute this code and if this would
be false too then we would log not
executed so now we're first checking if
this condition is true and if this is
the case you will execute this but if
this is not the case we'll check if
atleast this condition is true in which
case we would execute this code and if
all of that is not true well then we
reach the else part here so what do you
think we'll see now while it gets still
executed because we're not meeting the
first condition since this is false but
we do meet the second condition since
this is true
therefore we get still executed if I set
this to false
we'll get not executed so we're in the
else part then
so we had a look at the if statement
another control structure based on the
condition or the values of certain
variables is the switch statement I'll
create a new variable which I call lucky
number and a set is equal to 8 now I
create a switch statement by typing
switch and then in parentheses the value
or the variable on which I want to
switch so lucky number here then I also
have curly braces and inside of these
curly braces I now define several cases
I want to handle so generally with the
switch statement I look at a variable
and then I decide what to do upon
certain values this variable might have
for example I might have the case that a
variable is 1 and I do this like this
case and then the value I want to handle
and then : then I enter a new line and I
don't need curly braces here and I write
for example console.log is 1 and then I
have to type break I'll come back to
this keyword soon I also want to handle
the case that it is 8 for example and
then I will log is 8 all the break here
and then I have a special case here the
default case which I specify with the
default keyword this code here is
executed whenever this value in this
case here is something else than 1 or 8
so I'll print default then and also
break here what do you think we'll see
if I had run while we get is 8 because
we're switching this number and we're
handling the case that it is 8 what do
you think we'll see if I change this to
7 while we get default because we're
only handling the cases that it's 1 or 8
in all our cases we
run this default code here so if the
switch statement we have an easy way to
execute conditional code depending on
the value of something and this could
also be written as an if statement where
we check if lucky number equals one and
then we would print this and then we
would have else if lucky number equals
eight and then we would execute this
code and then we would have else and
then we would print default here and
this would do the same as this statement
and in this case this might even look
shorter but imagine us handling multiple
cases this year is much more structured
whereas here we have to write all these
else if else if else if statements which
quickly becomes very inconvenient and
that is why we have this switch
statement to make such cases easier
now what's up with this break keyword
here well I best show it by leaving it
out so I'll remove break in all these
places and what do you think will now
see if I execute this with a number of
one for example well we get all three
values because now the value falls
through this is how it's called it
reaches this point because we have a
case of one but then it just continuous
execution from top to bottom like
JavaScript code is executed so it's not
considering that we have case here and
that this would be a different case it's
just executing all the code and
basically ignoring this case eight and
default thing here so if I enter eight
what do you think will now see what we
got is eight and default maybe you were
expecting to also see is one but it's
still checking which case is the case so
eight here but then it continues
executing to the bottom it's not doing
it right from the beginning just we
don't have breaks here but once it found
its case it will continue and not stop
so by adding break we're basically
telling JavaScript that we wanted to
finish execution at this point and not
continue with the next lines here so we
break out of the conditional so to say
so we had a look at conditionals so
control structures which allowed us to
change the flow of code execution based
on certain conditions being true or
false
another important control structure are
loops which allow us to execute code
multiple times so more than once
I'll have a look at the for loop first
and you might know this loop from other
languages of course a for loop is
created like this we use the for keyword
and then we have parentheses here we set
up a variable which will be used inside
this loop typically I and we set it to
an initial value for example zero which
is a common case then we have a
semicolon and then we specify the
condition which defines how long the
loop should be running for example that
I the variable we just setup here should
be smaller than 5 so this loop will
execute as long as I is smaller than 5
again we have a semicolon and then we
specify what we want to deal with I up
on each iteration here I want to
increment it by 1 and we can use the
increment operator for this by simply
adding two plus signs right after I
which of course is the variable name
this will count up I by 1 upon each code
execution or each loop round here so
whenever we start a new round in this
loop or whatever we finish around to be
precise we will count up I by 1 so add 1
to it then I have curly braces again to
define the code which should get
executed inside this loop and I will
just print out I so this variable here
what do you think we'll see if I hit run
all we see is 0 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 so we're not
seeing 5 but as you can see we executed
that 5 times
and we started at zero which is the
initial value so technically what
happened here is that we set I to zero
print it out add 1 to it because that is
what we do upon each time we finish one
round of this loop and we finished
around after this killed line since we
have no additional killed coming and
then we got I equal to 1 so we continue
since it since it is still smaller than
5 and we continue as long until it is 4
then we print out this value a last time
for it and then we add 1 to it again now
it's 5 and therefore this condition is
no longer satisfied I is not smaller
than 5 anymore and therefore this loop
is now quit or we exit out of the loop
this is why we print 1 2 4 here
now an important thing to realize is you
are not only able to set I equal to zero
you of course may also start with two
and an only got T two three four
you also can specify other conditions
here like greater or smaller equal
anything like that and I will come back
to comparison operator soon and you can
also not say that you want to add
something to it you could also say that
it should be set equal to I plus free
for example what would happen now we
only get two because after the first
iteration where I is 2 we add fries that
we get 5 and this condition is no longer
satisfied we also can subtract this
value or decrement it so now we're
subtracting 1 from I upon each iteration
but if I now hit run we would have a
problem because this would be an
infinite loop we have I equal to we
subtract 1 upon each round and our exit
condition is that I gets bigger than 5
or our continued contact condition is
that I is smaller than 5 now this loop
would never get exited because since we
decrement I we will always be smaller
than 5 so here we should change this and
say only keep this running as long as I
is bigger than 1 for example if I now
hit run we only see 2 so we only make
one round because we start with 2
subtract 1 and we are 1 so this is no
longer satisfied this is how you can
play around with loops and how you can
set the variable here I and of course
you could use in our name as well up the
way you want it and needed for your
program to work correctly
now a common thing to use such loops for
is to use them in conjunction with
arrays remember an array all just grade
variable here looks like this with
brackets and contains multiple values
now since we have multiple values in one
place I think it's one of the first
things you think about that you could
loop through this and use these values
step by step or value for value you
could do that by setting I back to 0 and
going back to incrementing I'll also
change this to being smaller than
something but to something well it could
now be hard-coded free and I could then
log array and access the index with well
the variable I which of course gets
increased time on each round so now if I
had run what will we see
while we see 1 2 3 because I'm now
step-by-step accessing the value in the
area but that's not really the best way
because I hard-coded the size of the
area here if I change this to 5 because
I expect the area to have 5 elements but
it actually only has free what would i
now get well I get undefined undefined
because I'm accessing values which
aren't there so that's not really good
because rarely can I know how big an
array is and even if I could know it
because I hard-coded it I might change
this later on and then I would have to
change the size and all places in my
code where a hard-coded it so bad a way
is to use my array and access the length
property on that array because remember
an array is an object and it happens to
have this length property built-in and
as this name implies this gives me the
length of the array so now I'm looping
as long as I is smaller than the length
of the array what do you think will
happen if I now hit run well you get
once you
three again because the length is of
course free notice that it is important
to understand that since the first index
of the array is zero we have to use
these smaller assignment and not smaller
or equal because in this case we would
loop until I take some value of free
which actually tries to access the
fourth element and that is not a
behavior we would like to have so this
is how we would write it to loop through
such an array
so we had a look at the for loop but
there's another loop Bolton actually
there are two other loops but one loop
is something I'll have a look at when we
talk about object the other loop I want
to talk about right now is the while
loop the while loop works like this I
setup variable let's say number equal to
five and then I want to create a while
loop with the wild keyword and then
parentheses now between the parentheses
here I specify the condition which
defines how long this loop will keep
running so you can read this like while
this condition here is true I will
execute the code between the curly
braces so as a condition here I'll
specify that number should be smaller
than seven inside this loop all log
number and I will increase number by one
so it does kind of like this for loop I
created a couple of minutes ago but well
written in a different way what do you
think happens if I hit run I get five
and six because well currently it's five
I print five it gets incremented so it's
six which is still smaller than seven I
print six it gets incremented to seven
which is no longer smaller than seven
therefore we quit the loop so you might
think okay that's just another way to
write what we already learned well that
is just one example of course you not
only can check if something is smaller
than something else but you might check
some condition and you might set
condition inside this loop
well conditional you depending on
something else so while really is a
generic loop which you can use to check
any condition you might have to keep
running until a condition is fulfilled
or is no longer fulfill to be precise so
until this is no longer true for example
if you write while true and
execute this he would write an infinite
loop here because this will never get
changed it's always true this loop will
keep running which certainly it's not
what you want of course you can combine
multiple control structures here I'm
setting condition to true here and I'll
use condition inside here next I'll also
create another variable called I which
is a two and inside this condition here
I'll check if I equals free if this is
the case I'll set condition to false
otherwise
I'll print I and I'll increment I
thereafter what do you think will get if
I hit run well we got two and free Q is
our starting value of course and then we
incremented to free which is when we set
condition to false but we're not
instantly skipping out of this loop of
course which was setting condition to
false we still execute this code but
then when we reach the next iteration we
again checked condition and as it was
set to false now the loop is finished
now sometimes you all do you have a case
where your initial condition might be
false right from the beginning but you
would nonetheless want to execute at
least one iteration of the loop so for
example if I said condition to false and
I are rid of all the average staff here
and I write log
executed here what do you think I'll see
nothing of course because condition is
set to false but that's a condition is
not hard-coded to false but instead said
through your program and it might be
true and nonetheless not depending on
its value you want to at least execute
the code here at least once for this
case we got an average
the do-while loop and it's basically the
while loop but we add another keyword do
then curly braces and then the while
condition at the end followed by a
semicolon so we still use this a while
condition but we specify that we want to
execute this code anyways so even if it
is false right from the beginning so if
I now hit run we see executed even
though the condition is false we only
see it getting executed once but this
one time is executed at least which is
what you do keyword here allows us to do
so that have been control structures if
statement switch statement for loop and
while loop and how you can combine them
how you can control them with break and
continue and setting the conditions for
the while loop for example control
structures are very important and allow
you to change the flow of code execution
or also of course dependently execute
some code which is something you'll
probably need in most of your
applications
