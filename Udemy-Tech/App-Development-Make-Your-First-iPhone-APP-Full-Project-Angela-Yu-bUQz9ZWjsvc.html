complete iOS app development bootcamp my
name is Angela and I head up the iOS
team at the London at brewery as a part
of my job I develop iOS and watch OS
apps for our corporate clients and also
I teach on our in person app development
boot camps so I'm here to tell you about
all the awesome things that you can look
forward to as a part of this course
firstly you're gonna be learning how to
build over 20 mobile apps after which
you'll be fluently programming in Swift
and we're going to be taking you from
complete beginner to app development
professional because you will have
understood how to build your very own
cloud-based database how to develop real
time chat applications as well as using
api's and rest to grab data from the
internet and most excitingly of all
we're going to teach you how to build
intelligent apps using machine learning
and also how to build augmented reality
apps using AR kit and core ml Apple's
latest frameworks in iOS 11 these are
some of the most challenging but most
cutting-edge parts of the course and I
packed in over five hours of content on
this alone so that we can break it down
for you so that you'll be able to use it
in your own apps that you'll build in
the future so by taking this course
you're gonna find that you're saving
yourself loads of time because you don't
have to watch some guy just coding along
not understanding what he's doing in our
courses you won't just understand how to
do something but we're also gonna
explain why you're doing something so
that once you complete the course you'll
be able to build any app that you can
dream of you're also gonna be saving
yourself a lot of money because instead
of spending eight thousand to twelve
thousand dollars on an in person
programming bootcamp you're gonna get
all the benefits of an in person
programming bootcamp as well as the
curriculum that we teach for a fraction
of the price in our course is carefully
thought-out and structured so we really
get you understanding what you're doing
there's beautiful animations and
detailed explanations so that you won't
ever feel lost and you'll feel empowered
to start making your own apps and after
you complete the course you will have
over 20 apps on your portfolio that
you'll be able to show any potential
employer if you decide that you want to
work as an app developer now as if that
wasn't enough you're also gonna get over
$5,000 worth of free graphics assets
including user interface elements
including sketch files boat shop files
illustrator files a whole suite of
design assets that's gonna help you not
only develop your apps but make them
look beautiful as well now don't just
take my word for it have a read of what
our past students had to say about my
courses
I look forward to seeing you on the
course
alright so in this lecture we're going
to be covering some of the tools that
you'll need in terms of software and
hardware to start developing for iOS
first and foremost you will need a Mac
of some sort now it doesn't have to be
the latest or the greatest but it just
has to be able to run OS 10 so it's now
called Mac OS and the reason why we need
Mac OS is because we need to install a
piece of software called Xcode that will
allow us to develop our iOS app so this
means that iPads even iPad pros are out
of the question but if you had a iMac or
if you have a MacBook or even a Mac Mini
it will work just fine so if you don't
already have a Mac and you don't want to
invest a lot in you know a
brand-spanking-new top-of-the-range
MacBook then one of the cheapest ways is
probably just going on to ebay and
getting a secondhand Mac Mini for around
five hundred dollars and it's a pretty
great deal and it'll do just fine
but what do you do if you only have a PC
well the other option is that you can go
for something called Mac in cloud so if
you head over to Mac in cloud comm they
have a service where essentially they
offer you a Mac in the cloud so you can
be using your PC and you have a remote
connection to a Mac that is just for you
and it's ready got Xcode pre-downloaded
so you can just get up and go now
there's a lot of people who ask about
hackintosh or how can you run a Mac sort
of dual boot a Mac on your PC without
having to pay for a service like makng
cloud well there's a number of ways that
you can do this but one of the major
downsides is that Apple is very strict
about controlling their software and the
environment in which their software runs
so even if you're using mac and cloud
even if you're using a hackintosh
solution you won't be able to run your
app on a physical iPhone device that you
own the only way that you can do that is
by having an actual Mac but you will be
able to run it honest
simulator inside Xcode so this is a
simulated version of an iPhone and for
all intents and purposes it will work
just as well
it's just say if you're really excited
about having your app on your iPhone
then you really need to find a way of
either borrowing somebody's Mac or you
know getting one cheaply I've detailed
some resources in the text file of this
lecture that talks about how you can go
about exploring some of these ways of
turning a PC into a hackintosh but I
would still recommend try out some of
the earlier solutions rather than going
towards building a hackintosh it's just
that we've had a lot of students on the
in-person programming bootcamp who have
tried to do this and it's always given
them a lot of headaches so if you can
really try and avoid this this is almost
the last-ditch solution now the software
that you'll be using is Xcode and this
is a piece of software that's written by
Apple and allows you to write code
allows you to design your app as well as
run your app within the simulator that
it comes with and this is completely
free and in the next lecture we'll be
showing you how to download it and how
to get it set up so in order to be able
to download Xcode 9 which is the version
of Xcode that will be working with your
Mac's operating system has to be at
minimum Mac OS ceará and it has to be
ten point twelve point six or above
alternatively and what I recommend is to
simply update to Mac OS High Sierra
which is the latest version of Mac OS so
it's a free update and you can do it
quite easily inside the Mac App Store
and that's Mac OS version 10 point 13 or
above so it's quite easy to check the
version of Mac OS that you've got so if
you just head over to the Apple symbol
here and you go to about this Mac then
you can see what is the version of Mac
OS that you're running and you can click
software update in order to take you to
the App Store where you can update your
software alternatively you can just head
into the mac app store and search for
mac OS hi Sierra and it'll take you to
the download page where you'll be able
to download it for free so usually what
happens with Xcode is that they'll
support the last
version of Mac OS so in this case it'll
be Syrah for a while so maybe usually
four to six months and then the later
versions of xq 9 will no longer support
an and will require you to update to Mac
OS hi serum so Mac OS hi Sarah
is a intermediate update for Sarah and
it goes along the naming convention that
Apple tends to use so for example when
lion was updated minimally the version
was called mountain lion and similarly
with leopard and Snow Leopard so this is
sarin hi Sierra so there's no major
dramatic changes but there are some nice
little tweaks and a few things that you
might find to be quite useful so you can
have a browse on Apple's website but one
of the things that's quite cool that
I've noticed is actually their photo
editing software the latest version that
ships with High Sierra has almost
Lightroom like capabilities so if you're
an amateur photographer these might be
some cool tools that will help you so
for example adjusting levels and white
balance etc on your photos and it makes
it really easy and pretty neat and
there's a whole bunch of other things
that they've added generally I would say
are just tweaks things that make your
life marginally better I would recommend
to update to High Sierra now if you
haven't already done so we've been
testing the beta for a while and it's
quite stable and in order to use Xcode 9
in the future you'll probably need to
update at some point so I recommend
getting it now so when you're testing
your app you've got the choice of either
testing it on a physical device if you
own an iPhone or an iPad so because the
course is aimed at teaching you how to
make apps for iPhone a lot of the
designs that you'll be making and a lot
of the project stubs will have the
design and layouts optimized for iPhone
so it might look a little bit stretched
but it will work just fine if you don't
have an iPhone you don't have to run out
right away and get one this is something
that I would recommend you know once you
realize that you're really into this and
you really want to carry on making apps
for AI for if you're at the point where
you're about to release on the App Store
then you have to test your app on a
physical device it's at this point when
you would actually get an iPhone so not
straight away so as I mentioned Xcode
comes bundled with a iOS simulator and
it's sort of like a virtual phone that
runs on your computer and you can
essentially you know use the rotate
gestures the shake gestures you can zoom
in and out you can tap etc so it's just
a simulated iPhone and that works just
as well the only times when it doesn't
really work so well as when you are
starting when you are using
notifications or if you're using Apple
health or Apple home or some of those
things it can get a little bit tricky
alright so another question that we get
asked a lot is about Universal
development so this is your
cross-platform ways of developing apps
for iPhone the three that just came off
the top my head is PhoneGap
which uses HTML CSS and J's xamarin
which is user C sharp and Appcelerator
which uses again JavaScript so the
advice that we tend to give students is
that while this is while this seems
really appealing because you're
essentially developing once and
deploying it both on iOS and Android you
can do that simultaneously the problem
is that your user experience won't be as
nice you you won't be able to tap into
some of the native functionality of the
phone and in terms of design wise it's
just not as pretty and it's very obvious
to a seasoned developer looking at
something that's been done on
cross-platform so I would strongly
recommend you actually learn to use the
native tools because it is the most
powerful and allow you to build more
complex apps in the future and that's
exactly what we'll be doing in this
course we're going to be using the
professional tools so Xcode in order to
make iOS apps another thing they should
always ask yourself before you make any
app is do you actually need an app or
can you actually make do with a mobile
responsive website now because we have a
mobile app development agency as well at
the library one of the things that we
tend to recommend
we have a lot of clients who come to us
and say you know I want you to make this
app and we actually spent a lot of time
turning people away and telling them
look you can get this made much quicker
a much cheaper by just getting a web
designer to make a website for you
that's mobile responsive that scales
nicely on the phone because unless
you're tapping into some of the sensors
within the phone say if you need the
location or if you need to be able to
send people notifications something that
is inherent about the phone that you
need otherwise if you just need to
display information then making an app
is a very time and money costly way of
going about that so always think about
whether if you actually need to make an
app before you make any app and finally
we're just gonna mention that prior to
Xcode 7 so Xcode 6 in order to actually
download the app that you coded up that
you developed within Xcode onto your
physical iPhone device that you own you
actually had to pay Apple $99 a year in
order to be on the Apple Developer
Program
so as of Xcode 7 so I think that was
September 2015 when it launched you are
now able to do this on any free Apple
account so all you need is just your
normal iTunes account which you use to
download apps and will be able to get it
will be able to get your code and your
app onto your physical iPhone device now
when would you consider signing up for
Apple Developer Program this is when
you're ready to launch your app onto the
App Store and start generating revenue
so I would recommend that try to delay
signing up for the Apple Developer
Program as long as you can because
you're charged on a yearly basis
rolling essentially so if you're not yet
ready to take advantage of the Apple
Developer Program if you haven't got
your app together yet if you're not
ready to upload to the App Store then
there's actually no point paying Apple
for that privilege so build your app
test it thoroughly once you
already and about to launch it to the
app store then start paying for your
Apple Developer Program license and this
gets you access to something called
iTunes Connect this is a portal where
you can upload your apps you can check
your app analytics how many times it has
been downloaded how many people are
using it you can check your sales you
can see how much money you're making
every day etc etc so this is something
that we're going to cover in one of the
last section when we guide you through
how to actually upload an app to the App
Store so all of that is coming up
all right so those were all the tools
that you'll need in order to get started
and in the next lesson I'm going to show
you how to install and set up Xcode so
that you'll be able to get up and
running very quickly and we can get
started making our first app right so
we're now ready to download and install
Xcode 9 so this is the application that
we'll be using to write our code and
build our iOS apps it's developed by
Apple and it's free to download so you
don't have to worry about paying for it
or paying for upgrades or any of that
but before we start there's a couple of
things that you need to check to ensure
that your download and installation go
smoothly first thing is to make sure
that you have enough space on your hard
drive so even though Xcode is only about
4.5 gigabytes
you need about 10 gigabytes for the
download and installation so first check
to make sure that you have enough space
and to do that it's pretty simple just
head over to the Apple icon at the top
of your menu bar and go to about this
Mac and when you're here you can click
on the storage tab to see how much free
space you have to play with and just
make sure that that it's over 10
gigabytes so the next thing that you
need to check is to make sure that your
Mac OS your operating system is updated
to the latest version so to make sure
that you've got the right operating
system it's as simple as going to the
Apple icon and going to again about this
Mac and you can see here which version
you've got and ideally you should be on
Mac OS hi Sierra and your version should
read ten point thirteen point something
so as long as it's higher than ten point
thirteen then you'll
good to go so it could be ten point
thirteen point one point two whatever it
is after the thirteen doesn't matter now
if you want to stick with mac OS serie
and you don't want to update to the
latest version then you have to make
sure that your version is the latest
version of serie so it has to be ten
point twelve point six or above although
I would really recommend to just simply
update hi Sarah
it's simply easier and you'll have less
problems going forwards so once you've
done those two things the last thing
that you need to make sure is that don't
download a beta version of Xcode it's
actually not that easy to download it by
accident because as long as you're going
through this video and following along
with what we're doing but you can be
downloading the official release version
of Xcode and you won't have any problems
the reason why we don't like our
students to be working with beaters
because beta software is meant for
testing so it can contain bugs and it
might end up giving you more headaches
than it's worth
so no beaters stick with what we're
gonna do and you'll have a much much
better experience developing for iOS
alright so let's go ahead and do it
together so head over to the App Store
you can either use a spotlight by
holding down command and spacebar to
bring it up using the shortcut or you
can head over to the spotlight icon over
here or if you want to be really fancy
you can even get Siri to do it for you
Siri
open the App Store there we go so head
over to the search bar here and just
type in Xcode and then hit enter and you
can see it come up over here so if we
click on it we can find out the version
of it which is version 9.0 and if you
just click on this button here you'll be
able to install it onto your system now
this can take a little while and
sometimes that you'll see it just
hanging and it refuses to do anything so
have a look and see if some of those
things I mentioned earlier might be the
problem so if I'm talking too quickly or
if you want to see a written version of
all of those steps then I've included a
link in this lesson to a written version
of everything that I've gone through in
this video that you can check out
you can follow step by step and do the
installation according to the written
steps but it doesn't matter which way
you choose as long as you've got Xcode 9
installed on your system then you're
ready to go to the next lesson where we
will be walking you through the Xcode
software and showing you all the bits
and pieces that we'll be using later on
so I'll see you there
alright so now that you've successfully
downloaded and installed Xcode we're now
ready to go on a guided walk through of
the Xcode software so in this lesson I'm
gonna be showing you some of the most
common panes and sections of Xcode that
we'll be using as well as talk you
through some of the hints and tips that
will be really helpful for development
later on so once you're ready let's show
you the grand world of Xcode so the
first thing that you'll see when you
open up Xcode is this welcome screen and
here you can choose to start a new
playground or create a new Xcode project
so that's exactly what we're going to be
doing so go ahead and click on create a
new Xcode project and then it takes you
to the project creation wizard and
allows you to choose a template for your
project so we're looking at the iOS
templates at the moment and you've got
single view application or create a game
template or an AR app template as well
as things like master detail page space
or tab based app so unless you're
creating a game or AR kit app then most
professional developers will choose to
use a single view application as the
template and the reason for that is
because with things like master detail
page base or tab based app you get a lot
of extra things added in that may or may
not be useful so we tend to choose
single view application because it's the
most customizable it's the most flexible
and it will allow you to add all of
these things later on if you need them
anyways now you can see that there's
also other tabs such as creating a watch
OS app or a TV OS or Mac OS app but
since this course is all about iOS then
we're going to stick to that and make
sure that the single view app is
selected and go ahead and click Next so
this is the screen where you're going to
input some details for your app
including the product name so this is
the name for your app and in our case
we're simply going to
call our first app hello world in
accordance with traditional programming
tutorials we're going to create our
first hello world app now the team
section we're gonna leave blank so leave
it as none later on when I show you how
to download your app onto your physical
device we're going to be digging into
this and we're going to be setting it up
but for now we're just gonna leave it as
none so the next thing you have to fill
in is your organization name so if you
have a company then this is where your
company name goes if you don't have a
company then simply put down your own
full name then the next field is the
organization identifier so this is where
they expect a reverse domain name
structure so what is that so for example
our website is London a parade com so
the reverse domain name structure of
that is common and a pre so the next
thing that we see is the language we're
going to keep that selected as Swift and
the final three check boxes we're gonna
leave unchecked so in later more
advanced modules where we teach you how
to save user data locally then we're
going to be checking this box to use
core data and we teach you how to test
your app using unit and UI tests then
we'll be using these two boxes but for
now we're gonna leave all of them blank
and we're gonna go ahead and click Next
so now you're asked to save your project
somewhere and if you want you can set up
a folder to hold all of your app
development projects and you can save
everything in there so that you'll be
able to find it later on alternatively
and what I'm gonna do for now is I'm
simply gonna save this app onto my
desktop so I'm just gonna go ahead and
click create so this is the screen that
you'll see whenever you created a brand
new app so I'm gonna take you on a tour
of Xcode to show you where all the
different components are and some of the
most commonly used buttons now let's
start from the top and work our way down
so right at the top of Xcode you can see
this here which is the status bar and
the first thing that you might notice is
that it looks incredibly similar to the
other Mac
that you have for example iTunes so
right at the top here you've got a play
and pause button and you've also got the
part that shows you what is being played
and some more information about your
song and similarly with Xcode up here
we've got a play button and a stop
button so this builds and runs our code
project on to the simulator or on to a
physical iPhone device and you can also
stop the running by using the stop
button so you can determine where you
want your app to run by clicking on this
button here and that allows you to
choose either a device so a physical
iPhone if you have it connected to your
Mac or you can choose one of the many
iOS simulators that comes with Xcode so
when you choose any of these simulators
and you hit run you'll see that you get
a simulated iPhone device running inside
your Mac so you can resize this if it's
too big for your screen and it's got
this bezel around it and that allows you
to click on various buttons like the
home screen button or the volume
controls etc but I personally prefer it
without the bezel so I tend to go into
window and show device bezel I uncheck
that too just simply get my full-size
iPhone screen which you can fill your
desktop with to make it a lot bigger so
that's launching your simulator and we
can go ahead and click stop to stop the
running of our app the next part you see
is the app status so here it'll tell you
for example right now it's finished
running or before when it was building
then you get a progress bar you'll also
get your errors and warnings show up
over here as well so that's just a
general status of what's happening
inside Xcode and to your projects now
moving further along we've got these
three buttons and we're going to be
using these two quite a lot and the
third one less so so the left one is
normally selected by default because it
shows the standard editor so that means
that the middle part of your Xcode is
just a single screen and that's what the
standard editor means now if you click
on the
- circle icon this brings up the
assistant editor and this allows you to
split the middle section into two
screens and sometimes this is really
really useful for example when you're
designing your app and you've got your
canvas on the left hand side you can
have your code file showing up
simultaneously on the right-hand side so
you can flip back and forth quite easily
and we're going to be using this quite a
lot when we're designing our apps now
the third button is for the version
editor and this allows you to see
previous versions of your code so for
example if you made some big changes but
then everything broke then you can
revert back to your previous versions
and you can inspect them here and
compare and contrast and you can either
copy things over or simply roll back to
a previous version we're not going to be
using that one too much so let's go back
to the standard editor that we're going
to be really familiar with now on the
right hand side there's three more
buttons and they are for popping out the
and they are for popping out your three
main panes so the pane on the left is
called the Navigator pane and it's
composed of a number of tabs for the
majority of the time you will be working
with in this project navigator tab here
and this shows you all of the files that
together make up your app so that's the
project navigator now we're not going to
be using all of these tabs so I'm just
gonna draw your attention to some of the
more important ones for example this
find navigator which is basically like a
search bar and allows you to search
within your entire project or you can
narrow down to folders or specific files
and so that means you can find things
really easily using this paint the next
one I'll show you is this error pane and
this is the place where your errors will
show up if you make them and it helps
you to debug and figure out what's wrong
with your code so let's say for example
you know I just write some gobbledygook
somewhere you'll notice that very
quickly Xcode will pick up
on the fact that this is not real code
and it will highlight the fact that I've
made a mistake and if you have a look
you can see that the error shows up in a
number of places here here and here
so pretty much all over the place to try
and draw your attention to the fact that
there's a problem here
now if you click on this icon this error
icon in the status bar here it'll take
you automatically to the error pane and
it'll show you what the error is
and which file it spotted it in so in
this case there is something here use of
unresolved identify means it doesn't
know what on earth this is and it tells
you which file this is in when you go
inside that file it highlights the line
where it thinks the error is and it
tries to alert you to this problem so
let's go ahead and delete that now the
other thing that you might see in here
um that are not errors are warnings so
let's say I write something that's going
to trigger a warning so when you get
warnings in Xcode they show up in yellow
and they have this little yellow
triangle here and the yellow warnings
are basically things that Xcode thinks
that you might have gotten wrong now it
doesn't prevent you from running your
app so whereas if you have an error it
won't let you run your app at all it
will actually just prevent you from
trying to make a blunder and it and I'll
tell you build failed because of this
error but with warnings you will be able
to run your app and it's more like you
know Xcode trying to be helpful trying
to tell you hey I think this this
there's something funny going on here
you might want to have a look into it
and of course you being you know the
more intelligent human well at least
until the rise of the machines and they
annihilate all of us humans for now
we're still the more intelligent beings
so there are times where I'll tell you
to ignore a warning so for example right
now the warning is telling me that I've
never used this bit of code inside my
file so that's obviously because I
haven't finished typing and this is one
of the cases when you can safely ignore
warning now the rule of thumb is that
when you're uploading your app to the
App Store to clear your errors and your
warnings before you upload it to the
store but before then when you're
testing when you're debugging when
you're writing your code then just use
it as a helpful advice okay so the last
one that I want to show you in the
Navigator pane is this one which is the
breakpoint inspector and breakpoints are
incredibly easy to create accidentally
especially when you're new to Xcode so
anywhere between this left margin and
these numbers here if you click in that
margin you will create a breakpoint so
this is one of these blue arrow like
structures and what it does is that when
your app runs the code runs from top to
bottom and when it hits this breakpoint
it stops it applies the brakes and it
stops any of the code that are below it
from being executed now breakpoints are
useful when we want to stop our app at a
particular moment in time or in code and
to inspect what might be going wrong or
to debug or try to figure out something
that's going on underneath the hood I'll
be showing you exactly how to do that
later on as well but if you've created a
breakpoint by accident you can get rid
of it by either clicking on it to
disable it so it becomes this light blue
color alternatively you can simply click
and drag it away and it gets rid of that
breakpoint completely so that's just
something to know and have a look inside
your code when you have any bugs or
crashes to make sure that you haven't
accidentally just simply put in a
breakpoint all right so that's the left
pane the next button controls the bottom
pane which is also called the debug area
and this is the part where you're gonna
get error messages when your app crashes
and when your app does crash and you
can't figure out after trying for a
while why on earth it happened then it
makes sense to copy what it says in here
and post it into the question answers
forum so that myself or other students
will be able to help
you and other times will be printing
things into here to figure out what's
going on in our app so it's mostly used
for debugging so figuring out what's
going on in our app so let's move that
away very often when you're coding and
especially if you're working on you know
a 13-inch laptop there's not a whole lot
of space so you might want to get rid of
some of these panes if you're just going
to be coding for a while and it's always
good practice to try and maximize your
code file so that your code doesn't wrap
then what happens is that your code is
displayed on two lines because of the
space constraint but actually they
belong on the same line so it's good
idea to try and give yourself as much
space as you can when you're coding and
that makes everything so much easier
when you can see exactly what's going on
now the last pane that I'm gonna show
you is this one on the right and when
you're working inside the code file you
won't find yourself using this right
pane very much so it makes sense to pop
it out but when you're designing your
app you're gonna find this right sided
pane or what's known as the utilities
pane it's going to be really really
useful so let's go ahead and create our
hello world app now the first thing I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go inside the main
dot storyboard so this is the place
where it holds our canvas and this is
where we can design our app to make it
look nice so we can go into what's
called the object library down here so
again there's four tabs here but 99% of
time you'll find yourself using only
this one which is the object library and
it's selected by default
now I'm gonna go and go to the bottom
here and search for a label to put into
my app now labels are used for
displaying various bits of text and in
this case I'm just going to display the
words hello world so in order to change
the text in that label I can either
double click on it to retype it
alternatively I can use the utilities
pane so if you select the label and then
go into the attributes inspector which
is this little shield symbol here then
you can see that you can also change the
text here now once I hit enter you'll
see that my text is now truncated and
the reason is because in order for my
text to be 17 points and also this long
it's actually too big to fit inside this
small label so you're gonna have to
toggle it out using the side toggles now
let's go ahead and Center our hello
world so let's go ahead and change the
background so in order to do that I'm
going to select the view and in the
attributes inspector again I can change
any of its properties including things
like how see-through this background
view is or what is the color I want for
the background so in this case I'm gonna
click on the color and I'm going to
select one of these colored crayons to
give my view a background color now
wouldn't it be nice if our label was a
little bit bigger well let's go ahead
and change the font here we can make it
maybe a 50-point font so you can see
again my text has gone over the limit so
I want to resize this label now I showed
you earlier on how you can do it by eye
by simply toggling these edges but you
can also go into the size inspector here
which is which has the little ruler
symbol and here you can enter a very
precise position and width and height
for your object so in this case it's the
label that's selected so if I change
that width to maybe 300 then you can see
that it fits my label perfectly so if
you have a designer on board and they
can specify the positions and sizes of
their design then you can enter them in
here and you'll get a very precise
location and size so this brings us on
to another good point which is the fact
that this canvas its dimensions are
actually an iPhone 7 sized screen so
that's a 4.7
inch screen and if you have a look down
here you have a way of changing the
canvas size by default the canvas is an
iPhone 7 but if you want to change its
dimensions to maybe say an iPhone se
which is the same as an iPhone 5 screen
size then you can do that down here and
you can also change the orientation of
your canvas now remember this is about
the canvas whereas up here
it's about your simulator so that's your
device and that's your canvas for your
design so now the last payment we've got
is this one here and some of you may or
may not see it the toggle for it is a
little bit hidden because it's this tiny
tiny little button down here but if you
press it then you can toggle this pane
here which is called the document
outline and the reason why it's really
useful is because say if I have two of
these labels which are really close to
each other and I want to select one of
them then I can actually see both of
these labels inside the document outline
and I can also click on it to rename it
so let's call this label one and let's
call this one label two now I can double
click to select label one and move it up
or double click label two to move it
down or I can select label one and only
change its color to white so that's
basically an easier way of selecting
what's on screen when they are
geometrically overlapping so one last
trick to show you before we wrap up is
that you can increase and decrease the
size of the canvas by using this toggle
here plus and minus alternatively and
what I find to be a lot easier is to use
the trackpad so if you pinch in then it
zooms out if you pinch out then it zooms
in and if you use two fingers on your
trackpad then you can pan and move your
canvas around where you want it to be
alright so now that we've created our
hello world app we're going to go ahead
and run it on our simulator so simply
clicking play
you can see that the progress is going
and it's signing our project building
our project launching our project and
putting it onto the simulator so that
was our first hello world app completed
if you follow along then perfect if you
haven't then don't worry it's mostly
just to show you what the Xcode
interface looks like in the next module
we're going to be creating our very
first tutorial app and you'll want to
follow along with me because we're going
to show you how to make a really awesome
I am rich app that's sold for nine
hundred and ninety nine dollars on the
App Store and I'm also gonna show you
how to sideload or rather download your
app onto your physical iPhone so all of
that is yet to come and just before you
go over to the next lesson the last
thing I wanted to show you is that I've
created a map of Xcode for you
so that you'll be able to refer to it if
any of those names sounded confusing
like where is the status bar where is
the navigator pane where is the file
inspector where do you run your app or
where do you change your panes and
especially in the beginning it might be
quite helpful for you to download that
so I'll include a link to that in this
lesson as well so that's all from me for
this lesson I will see you on the next
lesson where we are going to create our
very first I am rich app so see you
there
before we start making our app we should
first understand what it is that we're
making so let's break down all the
components that make up an iPhone app
and talk about the anatomy of an app
there's three main components that you
should think about one is the view which
is what you see on screen or what
appears on screen these are buttons and
labels text or images then there's the
view controller so this goes on behind
the scenes and this is the code that
controls what should happen when a user
taps a button or what should happen when
you have a piece of data to display on
screen then finally there's the model
the model is what controls
the data it manipulates the data and
prepares the data to be served up to the
viewcontroller
so let's take a simple app such as a
contact app so it just manages all of
your contacts and when you open up your
app the first thing that would happen is
that the viewcontroller will ask the
model for the data of all your contacts
their phone numbers their images etc and
the model grabs that data and passes it
back to the view controller the view
controller then decides how it should be
displayed on the view and then the app
will display all the information that
was retrieved in a nice beautiful format
so this works the other way as well say
if a user taps on a button that deletes
this contact say John Doe the view will
tell the view controller that the delete
contact button was tapped the view
controller will make contact with the
model and ask it to remove that contact
from its database so these three core
components come together to make up what
you see as the app so this is known as
the Model View controller design pattern
and this is a very common design pattern
that people are dr2 when they're
creating iPhone apps and the reason why
we use the Model View controller design
pattern is because it has several
advantages that make our app more
versatile and also easier to manage say
if instead of having all our app in
English we wanted to populate our app
with data that's in French the Model
View controller enables you to do that
really easily without having to change
the view the controller or the model all
you have to do is just swap in the new
French data and you can leave the rest
of the code untouched so this way it's
quite easy to produce new versions of
your app we
painting the functionality and only
swapping out the data another reason why
people really like the
model-view-controller is the fact that
it separates all the different
functionality and the different
components into individual packages of
code so this way if there's a problem in
your app if there's an error or a bug
it's much easier to identify by looking
to see whether if it's in the view or if
it's in the controller or if it's in the
model this way of modularizing code
makes it easier to maintain and helps
you when you're debugging okay so this
is a very brief introduction into one of
the design patterns that we'll be
covering the MVC or Model View
controller design pattern and in future
when we're creating more complicated
apps we'll be going into some of the
other popular design patterns as well as
diving a bit deeper into the Model View
controller pattern as well but for now
all we need to know is that there's
three core components that make up all
our apps the view the controller and the
data model and combined they come
together to create our app okay so
that's a brief primer on app anatomy in
the next lesson we're going to be
creating our very first app so I'll see
you on the next lesson
alright enough talking it's time for us
to make something and today we're gonna
be building our first hello world app
now this is almost a inevitable step in
every single programmers programming
life he or her will have built a hello
world website or hello world program and
today we're gonna build our hello world
app and I'm gonna show you just how easy
it is using Xcode alright so go ahead
and open up Xcode and the first thing
that you'll see is this welcome screen
and everybody should get it unless
you've told it to never display it in
which case you can toggle it here the
first and the foremost first and
foremost
let's do a version check just look over
here and make sure that yours also says
version eight point something so I'm
currently using the beta version because
I'm recording this ahead of the launch
of version eight but yours will say you
know version 8.1 or 8.0
but as long as that first number is
eight then we're good to go
alright so now go ahead and click create
a new Xcode project because that's what
can that's what we're going to be doing
and then we're going to click on single
view application now when you see this
screen this is kind of like a wizard for
building your Xcode app and you can use
different templates to create different
types of applications iMessage
application or page based application
but today we're just going to stick to
single view application so let's go and
click Next okay so now it's gonna ask
you for a couple of details for your app
so let's go ahead and give our app a
product name so I'm gonna call it hello
world and my team is obviously our
company but you may or may not have one
that's fine you can leave it blank and
in the field organization name you can
just put down your actual name if you
don't have a company or organization and
now this is the part that's quite
important
it's an organization identifier and this
is the first part that makes up what is
called your bundle identifier so a
bundle identifier is almost like a URL
that uniquely identifies your app within
all of Apple's apps and their inventory
so the important part is this what they
suggest is for you to use what's called
a reverse domain name so here we've put
down comment a pre because our website
is London app recom so if yours is I
don't know Google com it would be com
Google and if you don't have a website
then just go ahead and put com dot your
full name and the reason why this is
important is because most domain names
or in fact all domain names are unique
and this is just a way of making sure
that your app doesn't clash with anybody
else's bundle identifier so hopefully
nobody who is called comm dot your name
has made an app called hello world but
if they have then maybe add in your
middle name as well just to make sure
it's really unique okay great now next
we're going to choose Swift so there's
two languages that can be used for
programming iOS apps and objective-c is
the older language whilst in use we
don't really recommend students learn
Objective C from scratch and this course
will be teaching you the latest and the
greatest which is Swift so go ahead and
click that and we're going to keep
devices iPhone and we're going to keep
all of these unchecked or for now
because we're not going to be using unit
testing within this app and we're not
going to be using core data we'll show
you some of those in some of the later
more advanced apps but for now we're
just gonna leave it blank and go ahead
and click Next
okay so now it'll ask you where you
would like to save your project and I'm
just gonna put it on to my desktop but
if you want to put it somewhere else
then you can go ahead just change it to
whatever folder you want it to be in now
there's an important part here that says
source control and weather if you want
to create a git repository so git is a
way of version control so it's a way of
being able to manage the different
versions of your app or your programming
project and instead of getting Xcode to
manage these versions which is what
would happen if you tick here later on
we're going to show you how to use
github which is a free online
cloud-based way of managing
collaborations as well as versioning of
your app so we're going to go ahead and
leave that unchecked and then we're
going to go and click create okay so now
that you've created your app this is
what it should look like you'll have a
project setting page which is what I'm
on at the moment you'll have a design
page which you'll find under main dot
storyboard now if you just have a look
in
the file structure over here you could
see that we've got different files with
different file icons now the ones with
the swift orange bird are our
programming files so they all end in
dots which view controller dot Swift is
where you'll be mostly and there's other
files which have these yellow outlines
and these are our design files so launch
screen dot storyboard is where you can
design the initial loading screen so
this is where people tend to put in
their company logos so for example if
you open up a candy crush that first
screen with King showing up this is
where they will int design that part and
then there's main dot storyboard which
is where you'll be spending most of your
time doing the designing for your apps
and it's screens and then there's these
blue icons which are sub folders so in X
and in this particular folder assets
start EXCI assets this is where you'll
be putting in some of your image files
that you'll need for your app or your
app icons over here and finally there's
an info dot plist which we won't go into
too much right now but this is
essentially your property list and we'll
be using it in later tutorials to prompt
the user to allow us to access their
location etc so let's just go into main
dot storyboard this is where we are
going to be for this particular app and
you can see here you've got a view
controller now you can imagine your view
controller as the canvas here for your
screen for your the screen on your app
so if you have a two screen app then you
might drag on another one so here you've
got two of them and you can link these
screens up so it might go from you know
first green which is a welcome screen to
the login screen or to another
registration screen for example like
this so that's quite simple to do but
let's go ahead and get rid of all these
extra screens which we don't need so
let's look at our main let's look at our
main view controller now as we mentioned
before you have a document outline over
here so this is the file structure for
everything that's on screen on your view
controller so for example if I find a
button in the object library which
remember is over here now if you don't
see this right side pane the way that I
see it it might be because you haven't
popped it open so this button remember
from our Xcode guided tour this button
pops open the right side utilities pin
so let's drag that button onto the
screen and you can see that it appears
in the hierarchy under the view so this
view is there by default and this is
essentially the bottom most layer of
your view controller screen so if we go
ahead and change that view so with the
view selected or you could tap somewhere
blank on the screen then you can go
ahead and change the background color
let's make it a nice purple color there
we go and let's just go and delete that
button then I'm going to go into the
object library down here and I'm going
to search for a UI label there we go a
labels popped up now you can obviously
scroll through the object library as
well to find what it is that you need
but it's usually much faster just typing
it in
okay so let's drag the label on to the
screen and we're gonna call it hello
world okay
great so you can see that I've edited
the text over here and making sure that
this particular tab which is called the
attributes inspector is open so there's
a number of tabs as we mentioned in the
again Xcode walkthrough but the most
important ones that you'll be in is
either the attribute inspector or the
size inspector
so the attribute inspector allows you to
set various properties of what are
whatever it is that you have selected on
screen so at the moment the label is
selected and we're editing its property
namely its text property ie what the
label displays so there's one slight
problem you can see that I've changed
the text over here but I can only
partially see it on screen and
especially if I increase that font size
to I don't know something like 32 you
won't see anything on screen other than
just dot dot and the reason for this is
because it has truncated our label
because the text that we have inside is
too big for the current size of our
label so you can either go ahead and
toggle it by dragging one of the corners
making it a pin or you can actually
click on some white space outside of the
canvas reselect the label on the canvas
hold down command on your keyboard and
press the equal sign on your keyboard
and it automatically resizes the label
to fit exactly the content that you have
inside so that's just a really neat
trick that can help you out sometimes
okay great
so other than editing text over here
directly in the attributes inspector we
can also actually just double click on
the label and you know change it over
here so these are equally valid and
depending on which one you prefer you
can choose whatever you like I'm just
gonna go and change the color to maybe a
nice white color make this a bit bigger
and then make that font also a bit
bigger great let's make it centered
brilliant so we have designed our hello
world app now feel free to go ahead and
modify that text or the background as
much as you like you can change the font
of the word by clicking this T so type
button here and you can change from
system to custom where you'll be able to
you know tap into your usual different
typefaces and fonts so we're gonna keep
Helvetica selected and I want it to be
type 40 40 size font they would go done
okay so I am done with my app one of the
things that's new to Xcode 8 is this
little bar down here so right now the
canva
sighs for our viewcontroller is an
iPhone 6s sighs so that's a 4.7 inch
screen if we wanted to make it a bit
smaller so this is a four inch on the
iPhone se or iPhone five now you can see
that when it's a four inch the text
looks a bit shifted to the right and
when it goes back to the 4.7 inch it
becomes centered if we make it even
bigger on the iPhone 6 plus it again
looks a bit off-center so this is
because we haven't set any constraints
we haven't set any rules for how our
user interface elements such as our
label should be displayed so in future
tutorials we're gonna dive deep into
Auto layout and setting constraints and
we're gonna teach you how to make
everything on screen look exactly as you
want it to on different screen sizes and
also when you change from landscape to
portrait orientations so that's all to
be covered right now all we're doing is
something very simple which is making
our first hello world app so now that I
have my screen design and I'm quite
happy with the way it looks I'm gonna go
ahead and run my app on the iPhone
simulator so I'm I've only got one
active scheme over here so say if I had
a watch app or a TV OS app I will have
more than one screen more than one
scheme to select from here but at the
moment I've only got an iOS app so I'm
gonna select that and then I'm going to
select which device I want to run it on
now if you have a device that's set up
over here like a physical iPhone that's
connected to your Mac it'll show up just
under device and in the next tutorial
we'll actually be teaching you how to
sideload apps onto your phone there's a
few steps that Apple forces you to go
through confirming your identity and
your Apple account etc before you can do
this but for now all we're gonna do is
just keep to the simulator so I've
designed this for an iPhone 6 screen so
I'm just gonna select iPhone 6
here and I'm gonna press play so this is
building the app and running the app on
the simulator so let's go ahead and do
that now there's a few shortcuts that
might be quite useful for example
building and running instead of pressing
the play button you can also press
command R now when you're running your
app more frequently in the future when
we're getting on to more complex apps
this will be something that will come in
really handy okay so we can see our
iPhone 6 is just starting up and when
you click on this this is actually
within the simulator so the first time
that your simulator starts up it'll take
a little while for it to set up the
environment and try to mimic an iPhone 6
as closely as it can and once that setup
is done you'll see almost a replica of
an iPhone in your Mac ok so now you can
look at the status of how your app is
running up here so right now it's
running before it was attaching and
basically downloading the package onto
the simulator and now it's showing the
app so perfect we have made office hello
well that way so let me show you a few
things about the simulator sometimes
when you run the simulator it can show
up as a giant screen so what you have to
do is go into window and go into scale
and you can resize the screen to
whatever size you want so sometimes it
shows up like this and it looks a bit
like a big blob which is not helpful to
anyone so especially if you have a Mac
that has a relatively small screen like
a MacBook Pro or a MacBook Air then
you'll need to resize it down to 50% the
other thing is that when you click on
Hardware you can click on home to go
into the home structure and it looks
pretty much just like a iPhone with all
of its enabled features so at the moment
our app doesn't actually have an app
icon and you can see this is the default
no app icon image and in the next
tutorial when we make I am rich we will
teach you how to
to put your app icons into your Xcode
project and it will show up in here okay
so that's all for this episode so now
we've made a new Xcode project we've
designed our canvas design our view
controller to look the way that we want
to and we've managed to display hello
world in our own app called hello world
so well done and this concludes this
first module where we introduce you to
how to download and get Xcode setup how
to use it and some of the various
buttons and features it has so in the
next module we're actually going to go
on to our first proper app that we're
going to build and it's mostly again
still getting to grips with Xcode
understanding how to design apps within
storyboards and we're going to teach you
how to launch your app onto a physical
device so that's all to come and I'll
see you in the next module alright guys
we're back with another app tutorial and
this time we're gonna make a Las Vegas
dice shaker app this is gonna be really
useful for all of those betting needs of
yours so in the previous two tutorials
we've learned about the interface
builder how to design and layout our app
and you've actually had a go at doing it
yourself by making I am poor so if you
haven't done the challenge I'm poor I
strongly strongly urge you to go and do
it before you continue because it's
really important to get the hang of all
those little buttons and egg code you
know and it's only when you start doing
it without the tutorials that you really
get to grips with the whole thing so go
ahead and finish that challenge if you
haven't and for those of you guys who
have already completed I am rich and I
am poor it is time to start building the
dicy app now this is actually a very
simple app and let me just show you what
it looks like so here's dicy let's
launch it and it's just two dice images
with a logo at the top and a button at
the bottom when I press the roll button
you'll see that the dice faces change
just like a real dice shaker now you're
not gonna be able to see this but just
trust me on this I'm gonna shake my
iPhone and you can see the dice changing
its dice face
all right cool so this is what we'll be
building and it's a very simple app but
it's a really fundamental app to get to
grips with some of the most important
parts of app programming so up till now
we've only been really working with
interface builder and designing and
image assets so it's all about the view
and the appearance but in this tutorial
we're gonna be diving deep into coding
and we're gonna be addressing some of
the most fundamental parts of iOS
development so we're gonna be looking at
collections namely arrays we're gonna be
seeing how to link up your design with
your code we're gonna look at IV outlets
IV actions how they work and some of the
common bugs that arise with those things
and finally we're going to be looking at
randomization methods functions and all
of the core pieces that really make up
an app so it's a very simple app it's a
very simple tutorial but it's gonna
cover pretty much 90% of the stuff that
you're gonna use on a day to day basis
when you're developing apps so I can't
wait to get started teaching you guys so
head over to the next lesson once you're
ready and we're gonna learn how to make
the dicy app alright so first and
foremost we are going to start a new
Xcode project so you already pro at this
so you should know what to do so again
you'll see the Xcode welcome screen and
we're just gonna click on and create a
new Xcode project and we're gonna choose
single View application under iOS click
Next and we're gonna name our product
dicy with two E's because that's
obviously cooler than 1e now team you
can leave none if you don't have one
organization name put it as your own
name and organization identify again
this is a reverse domain name with
either your full name or your company
web address so if you get confused about
any of what I've just spoken about go
back to the iron-rich tutorials and
we've covered all of this in detail so
take a look at that if any of this
sounds confusing so make sure that your
language is selected as Swift and keep
all of these three uncheck and we're
just going to click
next cool I'm gonna save it on my
desktop making sure that the source
control is unchecked and I'm just going
to go ahead and click create alright so
now that we've set up our new project
we're going to go ahead and design the
storyboard so head over to main dot
storyboard over here and remember if you
don't have your file Navigator showing
just you can toggle it like so great so
now we can see our design canvas and
we're going to go into the object
library over here so making sure that
this tab the object library is selected
in the bottom right corner and we're
going to search for a UI image view and
there it is image view so we're going to
drag it onto the canvas and we're gonna
align it so as soon as you move it
around you can see that Xcode starts
being helpful or sometimes not so
helpful by giving you all of these
margins so we're gonna shift it right up
to the top left corner and then I'm
going to toggle it to make it fill the
entire screen so currently I've got
iPhone 7 size selected and it's in
portrait mode while all of these other
sizes work just fine we're going to
stick to the iPhone 7 size so that we're
all consistent and I'm gonna show you a
bit later on how to set up constraints
use auto layout to make your screen look
beautiful no matter what screen size
you're running your app on so that's all
to come but for now we're just gonna
drag on a UI image view and make it fill
the entire canvas so now that you've got
your image view which again as a
reminder an image view is just a picture
frame in order to add an image to our
image view we first have to have those
images incorporated in our Xcode project
and if we have a look over here in the
assets dot X the assets folder you can
see that we've got absolutely nothing
nada in here that we can use so first of
course we have to add our image assets
so we've pre-made the image assets for
you in all the right dimensions so if
you just head over to your browser that
could be Chrome or it could be Safari
whatever it is that you prefer and in
the URL you're gonna type in the address
for the download link and that download
link can be found in the description
text bill
hello this video so just go ahead copy
and paste it into your browser and there
we go we've got a zip file containing
all the assets downloaded I'm just gonna
click on it in order to extract it and
then I'm gonna go into the download
folder to try and find it alright so
once you've extracted and located the
dicey assets folder you should be
looking at something like this so it's a
folder that contains all the images that
we're going to be using in our project
and first and foremost we're going to
add the app icons so inside Xcode locate
the app icon folder and you should be
able to see all the placeholders and
then we're going to go back into the
dicey assets folder and find the correct
icons now for those you guys who are new
to using Mac's using the command tab to
switch between windows makes life so
much easier and I highly recommend it so
switch window back to dicey assets and
you can see that all of these images are
named according to the placeholders so
for this one it's a 29-point image
that's at 2 X so we're going to find 29
at 2 X and we're going to drop it into
the right place and just keep doing this
for the rest of them so you've already
done this plenty of times with previous
projects so this shouldn't be difficult
at all ok so once you've got all of the
app icon images placed into the slots
and you'll notice that we're not
actually adding anything to the iPhone
notification slot because we don't
actually have any notifications for this
project if in a future project you're
going to be creating notifications then
just create assets that are 20 pixel by
20 pixels so once that's been done the
next part is adding the rest of the
images now to make our lives easier I'm
just gonna view this as a list and what
I can do is I can select all the images
other than the app icons so I'm gonna
click dice 1 and I'm gonna hold down
shift and select I see logo so that's
gonna select all of those and I'm gonna
chuck them in here underneath app icon
then again I'm gonna select both new
background and new background at 2 X and
drop them again into the assets folder
now again for those of you guys who
new to max holding down the shift button
allows you to select all the files
between the starter in the end and
holding down the command button allows
you to select disparate files now that
we've incorporated all our images is
important to check that your assets
folder looks very similar to mine so
you've got dice one through two die six
all the dice face images and we've got a
dicey logo as well as a new background
so you'll notice that each of these
folders has two images and that's
exactly how we want it to be so once
you've confirmed that you've got all the
images that you need we can go back into
main dot storyboard and slot an image
into this image view so again making
sure that you've got it selected either
on the canvas or in the document outline
we're going to head over to the
attributes inspector which is over here
and we're going to change the image
that's held inside the image view we're
gonna start rioting new background and
there we go
Xcode has really suggested that maybe we
want the new background image so just
hit enter and you'll see it a PIM a
lovely green felt background for our Las
Vegas dice app okay so once that's done
the next step is putting in that dicy
logo so again we're going to need a new
image view so in my objects library I've
still got image view showing up if you
don't then you can just go and type your
image view again to search for it so
we're gonna drag this one on close to
the top ish somewhere that looks
reasonably good and just drop it down
okay so time for a challenge now
throughout these video tutorials I'll be
issuing challenges that test your
understanding and your grasps of some of
the things that we've covered so there's
no point just watching me do everything
and follow step by step because you're
never going to be able to really make it
your own so instead what we're gonna do
is I'm gonna announce that here's a
challenge and it's something that you
would have done before or immediately
before and you're gonna try and do it
yourself so this is a good point for you
to pause the video and go into your own
Xcode project and try to figure out
yourself and then afterwards come back
see if the solution matches what you did
so are you ready for your first
challenge
you
so did you remember how to do it now if
you didn't this is just a quick reminder
with the imageview selected we're gonna
head over into the attributes inspector
and change the image to dicey logo and
click enter there we go now one thing
about this image is that you can see
that it's slightly stretched it looks a
little bit odd and that's because our
content mode is set to scale to fill
which is not what we want because it
stretches the image in a non
proportional way so we're going to hit
this drop down and we're going to change
it to aspect fit instead now you can see
the proportions are back to how they
should be and the image looks a lot
nicer right so next we are going to
design our dice faces so there'll be a
total of two so we're gonna drag on to
image views onto our canvas now instead
of just resizing it by eye this time
we're going to resize it more precisely
so very often when you're working as an
iOS developer especially if you're
working with professional designers
they'll actually provide you with the
exact location and sizes of all your UI
elements so we're just going to select
one of the UI image views and instead of
being in the attribute inspector we're
gonna head over to the size inspector
for our first dice face we want the x
value to be 40 so right next to the left
and then we want the Y value to be 2 7 3
and the width and the height to be both
120 there we go and the other one we're
gonna resize again X 2 2 1 5 y is 2 7 3
and the width and the height are both
again 120 there we go so now as long as
your canvas is the same size as mine so
just check here to make sure that you're
inside the iPhone 7 size canvas in
portrait then your screen should look
exactly the same as mine because we've
precisely inputted both the location as
well as the height and width of our
image views so now it's time to put in
some pictures to do that remember we
have to be inside the attribute
inspector and I'm just going to put dice
one in both of them because right now it
doesn't really matter right so just one
last step to complete our design and
that's having a button so a button
that's called roll and when you press it
we can change the dice faces so again
we're gonna head over to our object
library and we're going to search for a
button or UI button and there we go and
we're gonna click and drag it on to the
screen now doesn't matter right now
where it where you leave it we're gonna
adjust that later on but firstly we're
gonna modify the appearance of this
button to something that pleases us so
we're gonna change the title of the
button from button to roll or something
else that makes sense to you
we're gonna change the font by clicking
on this small t button here and going
from system to custom and I'm gonna
change the size to maybe 30 or 40 so
this depends on you again see what looks
right to you after all you are designing
your own app and now you can see that
we've got dot dot here and that's
because the text for the button is now
too big to fit within this small
constraint so we're just gonna use the
toggle to make it just a bit bigger and
there we go there's our roll button now
the blue doesn't really show up very
nicely with the green so I'm gonna
change the text color to white and I'm
gonna change the background of the
button to have a color now unintuitive
Lee that background button the button
background color isn't located near the
rest of the color settings but instead
it's quite a few Scrolls away down here
and I'm just gonna pick something that I
used recently like this nice salmon
color but you can also change it to
something of your own liking just by
going to other and then picking any
color that takes your fancy
but I'm gonna stick to a salmon ish
color and then we can just adjust the
buttons to make it look reasonably nice
and there I'm happy with my design so go
nuts this is your design do whatever you
like you can really make it your own or
so that's all for this lesson in the
next lesson we're going to be looking at
how to link up all of these designs with
code how we can start making the roll
button actually do something when we
click on it how we can change the dice
image faces all by writing our own code
all that and more in the next lesson so
I'll see you there okay so now that
we've created our designs for our
beautiful dicy app and that you're happy
with how it looks the next step is to
actually let the code files know about
these designs so as you can see we're
currently in the main dot storyboard
which is a design file and if you
actually right-click on it and go to
open as source code you can see that
this is actually just XML code which
stands for extensible markup language
and it looks very similar to HTML for
those you guys who've dabbled in that if
you've never dabbled in any sort of HTML
CSS or anything it doesn't matter don't
worry about it I'm just showing it to
you to show off how much I know about
coding just kidding so the important
thing is that whenever you're making
designs in the interface build which is
the canvas view whenever you're changing
anything or when you're adding something
Xcode is actually very cleverly writing
the the XML code for you so this makes
life a lot easier for us and we don't
have to concern ourselves with this at
all but in order for us to write some
code that changes the way that the app
behaves we need to let the code files
know about the designs rent so the
things that we're gonna change in our
app are gonna be the dice faces we're
gonna change these images randomly to
show different dice faces when we press
the roll button we also need to let the
code file know about this roll button so
that it knows when it gets pressed and
whether if it needs to change its
appearance so these are the two cases in
which you need to link up design with
code when you want to change the
appearance of something or when you want
the code file to know when an action has
been performed on something so I'm going
to show you how we do that first and
foremost
we're going to go into this two little
circle icon at the top and this is the
assistant editor it's really useful
because allows you to split the screen
into two and you can see the design file
next to the code file now I'm working on
a 13-inch MacBook Air at the moment so
I'm gonna need a bit more real estate
and some of you guys might be working on
even smaller screens if you're using the
MacBook or the 11 inch Mac so we're just
gonna give ourselves a bit more room by
getting rid of that utilities pain and
also I'm gonna close the document
outline just by clicking on this tiny
button here so now we've got ourselves a
bit more space to play with and I'm
gonna show you how to link up the
designs with the code so first we're
gonna link up this left most image view
and I'm going to hold down the ctrl
button on the keyboard
and then you're gonna click and drag so
that you see this blue line appearing on
your view controller file now you can
drop it pretty much just below the line
that says class view controller UI view
controller and then it has this little
pop-up and ask you what kind of
connection do you want to make and we
want to just check that the connection
type is an outlet and the name that
we're gonna give it is going to be
called dice image view 1 and the type of
the UI element is of course a UI image
view that's the one that we dragged on
and that's the one that we're trying to
set a connection for and storage week
now don't worry about weak and strong
and whatever else for now so this is
something that will cover much later on
once we've grafts all the fundamentals
so just ignore that for now and just
make sure that it says weak now I'm just
gonna take a moment to quickly point out
something whenever you see programmers
naming their variables or naming
anything most of the time you'll see
this type of convention this is called
camelcase
so the first word has begins with a
lowercase letter and every subsequent
word is capitalized and this is very
common in programming because it allows
you to differentiate each of the words
quite easily
it's called camel case because the camel
has a lower head than the rest of the
humps or I think that's why it's called
camel case oh it might just be because I
have an overactive imagination and
there's a complete different reason what
I count with cases called camel case but
either way when you're naming your
variables make sure that the first word
is not capitalized and every subsequent
word is okay so once you've checked and
that your little pop-up looks exactly
like this we're just gonna go ahead and
click connect and then you see xcode has
written a line of code for us i'm just
gonna give it a bit of space so it's
always important to try and keep your
code as tidy as possible I'm not a tidy
person but I'm a tidy programmer just
because it helps you so much when you're
debugging when you've got thousands and
thousands of lines of code and
everything's all mushed together like
spaghetti it's a really tough job
so make life easy for yourself give
everything a bit of space okay so now
here we've created an iboutlet
which is what this is called interface
builder outlet to this particular image
and we've called it dice image view one
and it is of type uiimageview so the two
things to note is the type of connection
iboutlet
and the name which is dice image of you
one the other things to ignore for now
is the week and the exclamation mark
these are things that are a little bit
more advanced and we're going to come
back to them once we get to that stage
for now all we need to know is that
we're making a connection between the
design file main dot storyboard and the
code file view controller dot swift and
this link or this connection allows us
to refer to this design in our code as
we'll see a little bit later on now
there's something important that you
should notice here which is this little
circle because when I roll over when I
hover over this little circle it
actually highlights where the connection
is going to so this is really useful and
if that circle is not like this instead
if it's empty
then it
that connection is not active so let's
go ahead and just connect up the other
image view so again holding down control
clicking and dragging over to here if
you don't have a wireless mouse and
you're working with the trackpad it is
equally simple just click and drag
that's all you need to do you might need
to mess around with it for a little bit
but just control click drag and as long
as you see this blue line appear
you've hit gold basically now we're
going to slot this just underneath the
other iboutlet that we created over here
and again making sure it's of type
collection type out it is of connection
type outlet and the name that we're
gonna give it is dice image view to type
uiimageview storage week and then we're
just gonna go ahead and click connect
there we go
we've got our two iboutlet set up now
the last one that we're gonna set up the
last connection is to the role button
now this one's a little bit different
because instead of being an outlet which
if you remember from early on is
something that changes the appearance of
a UI element user interface element
we're gonna create something else that's
called an IB action which allows the
code to respond when a user interacts
with it so same so same as creating the
other connections holding down control
clicking and dragging but this time
we're just gonna put it here just above
the last curly brace and then we're
gonna let go
so we're gonna change this connection
type from outlet to action and then
we're gonna give it a name called roll
button pressed and we're going to change
the type from any object to UI button
and the event is touch up inside now
there's various ways that the user can
interact with it they can most commonly
touch up inside now this is nothing
naughty I know there's gonna be you guys
out there with a terrible mind but all
it means is that the user has touched
the roll button
inside the boundaries of the button and
let go while they were inside the
boundaries of it so that defines a
common tap basically now there's other
ways that you can interact with that
button for example touch drag outside
which means that you tapped the button
you've dragged your finger outside of
the constraints of the button and then
you've let go so that's defined as a
common drag essentially but we're going
to keep it as touch up inside and in
pretty much 99% of the cases you will be
using this particular event so you don't
even have to change it it's the default
okay so check that we've gotten action
we've named it roll button pressed type
we've changed it to UI button the event
is touch up inside and we're going to go
ahead and click connect now as you can
see this looks different from this now
this is an IP outlet which changes the
appearance of the UI element and this is
an IB action that notifies the code when
the UI element is interacted with now
you can see that the difference between
this other than the fact that this is IB
action this is IB outlet are these
little curly braces now I'm programming
you have to realize that code gets
executed in blocks so these two curly
braces are essentially defining what
should happen when the role button is
pressed this is the start of what will
happen and this is the end of what will
happen so you should view all bits of
code as blocks of code this is a block
of code this is a block of code and this
is also a block of code so say if I
wanted to change the dice face I would
put my instructions in between these
curly braces if I were to put my
instructions here for example outside of
this closing brace for this block then
it wouldn't happen in synchrony with
this robot impressed action ok so that
was basically are setting up to IB
outlets and one
I be action now you'll have noticed that
when you try to connect a uiimageview
when you look at the connection types it
only has an outlet or an outlet
collection type but when you try to link
up a button you've got both the outlet
and the action types now why is that
it's because the button is slightly more
advanced than the image view the image
view you can only really change its
appearance but the button you can
actually change both its appearance and
as well as notify the code when it gets
tapped so buttons have both actions and
outlets and image views have only
outlets and that's something that's
quite important to understand but we're
going to be doing this again and again
and again so if this is the first time
you're encountering IB actions IB
outlets don't worry if it doesn't all
make sense immediately we're gonna let
you do this a few times and you're gonna
eventually understand exactly what it is
that it does so in the next episode
we're gonna talk about a really common
error that new iOS developers make and
it is related to the IB outlet and IB
action connections so it's really
important episode to watch because it
happens so frequently we see it in our
in-person program boot camps 99% of
people will make this mistake so I'll
see you in the next lesson and we'll
talk about one of the most common errors
and how to debug it alright see you
there
last episode we learned about how to
link up our design file with our code
file by creating these IB outlets and IB
actions now today we're going to talk
about one of the most common mistakes
that people make when they're new to iOS
development and I'm first gonna
replicate how this mistake gets made so
if we have a look over here
my first IB outlet is called dice image
view 1 which is exactly how we wanted to
name it but the second one I've
accidentally spelt it wrong now the
error happens when you try to go and fix
it so let's see if I can do that so
instead of calling it I can't spell
imagery - I'm gonna call it dice
image view - right okay so now it looks
great
I've fixed the spelling error but the
first indication of a mistake that we're
about to make is if you look at this
little circle - remember before we
mention that when the circle is filled
it means that the connection is active
but now the circle is actually empty and
it's not linked to anything and if I go
ahead and run this app right now you
will see it crash and well hopefully not
burn and our app has crashed and we can
tell this is so because the app is no
longer working and also we've got this
red highlighting telling you that there
is a problem and also the debug area
pops up telling you that it's
terminating app due to uncaught
exception NS unknown key exception and
this is a very very common error that
you'll see so when you're debugging
Xcode projects it can seem very
difficult in the beginning but over time
you'll start getting used to these error
codes and what they mean now the
important keywords in this error message
is this class is not key value coding
compliant for the key I can't spell
imageview - now to translate Xcode is
trying to tell you that there was
something cool I can't spell imageview
to which it can now no longer find now
why is this let's go hunting for this
error so I'm just gonna reduce the size
of this debug area and I'm gonna head
into the main storyboard to show on the
left so where does Xcode get this key I
can't spell imageview - well that was
what dice imageview - used to be called
before we decide to rename it right so
by renaming this we've actually broken
the connection because when we hover
over it no longer highlights the second
image view but that connection is a
piece of XML code that exists in main
dot storyboard so if we go
right-click on may not storyboard and we
open as
code you can see that down here there
are connections and there's one outlet
that's called dice image view one and
there's another outlet the key in this
error which is called I can't smell
image view - now this is a line of code
in the main storyboard that gets written
when we create that connection but
because we haven't broken that
connection when we renamed it then this
is why you get the app crashing for that
IP outlet in the code file so how should
we modify IB outlets and IB actions well
whenever you decide to change the
spelling or change or delete maybe one
of the IV outlets or IV actions the
first thing you have to do is to break
that connection and we can see it by
right-clicking on this image view so if
I right click there I can see that it
has a reference outlet to the view
controller with a key called I can't
spell image view - so because I'm
getting rid of that I have to break that
connection by clicking that little cross
button by breaking that connection I
erase that little bit of code in the XML
file now when you look at the outlets it
will only have one outlet and the other
one is now gone so then I can recreate a
connection to the newly named dice image
view - so again in the same way that you
created the previous ones you hold down
control you click on the image view and
you drag it over now slightly different
from before before we were looking for
this blue line to tell us where to drop
it now because we have this line already
written we're gonna hit aim for the name
which is dice image view - and now you
can see this is slightly different
because it actually highlights in blue
the whole area and when I drop it here
it links it up to this line of code and
you can see now it's again working
beautifully so whenever you're trying to
delete IB outlets or edit IB outlets or
IB actions
any connections basically make sure you
have a look at what that outlet or
action is linked to and right click on
it to break that connection first before
you edit any code so whenever in your
debug area you get this line that says
this class is not key value coding
compliant you should think first and
foremost whether if you recently changed
something that has a connection to the
main dot storyboard or to the design
file if your debug area looks slightly
different from mine so currently I'm
running my app on a physical device but
if you are running your app on the
simulator your debug area might look
slightly different because of some Xcode
junk in there and in the next episode
we're gonna talk quickly about how to
get rid of that junk log so this is the
keyword to remember this class is not
key value coding compliant and what it
means is that there is a unbroken
connection to something that no longer
exists in the code and in the next
lesson we're gonna talk about a quick
hack about cleaning up your debug area
so keep a note of this particular error
and make sure you have a look back at
this video if anything similar like this
happens to you but otherwise I'll see
you on the next lesson all right so just
to recap in the last episode we learn
about how we can link up our design with
our code file using these IB outlets and
IB actions now this gives us exposure to
these design elements in our code file
and in this episode we're finally going
to start coding and start using some of
these exposures so the first thing that
we're gonna do is we're gonna create
what's called a variable it's basically
just a container that holds data and
we're gonna do that just under and the
class declaration right here and I'm
gonna write var which is the key word to
create a variable first variable is
called random dice index 1 and it is of
type int or integer and I'm going to set
the value of this
container two equal zero for now so if
you look underneath this video you'll
find a swift cheat sheet that we've
created for you guys that allows you to
get an overview of how various coding
elements are constructed so firstly
we're going to zoom in on the variable
section and I'm gonna draw your
attention to this line which is where we
create a variable so in order to create
a variable you use the keyword var you
give you a variable a name and then
comes a semicolon and you declare the
type of data that your variable is gonna
hold remember that a variable is just a
container for data and then you finally
give your variable a piece of data say a
number or some text and later on if you
decide to change your variable or change
the contents you can just simply use the
name of the variable and set it to
something new so let's take a look over
here at the different data types or some
of the common data types so int
stands for integer which is whole
numbers then comes floats and doubles
now both floats and doubles can hold
numbers with decimal places a double
simply holds a number with more decimal
places so depending on how accurate you
need your data to be say if you wanted
the number of pi to you know 20 digits
after the decimal point then you might
choose to use a double especially for
scientific calculations but if you just
need to do some basic definite
mathematics for example to input you
know somebody's height in meters or
somebody's weight you know precise to
two decimal places
but a float is probably a better bet so
then we've got the ball which stands for
boolean z'
which can only hold the values true or
false then finally we've got strings
which are essentially strings of
characters so most time that's your text
although of course you can store a
number as a string you just won't be
able to do any mathematical calculations
with it so let's go back to our Xcode
project for dicy now it's your turn to
make the next variable so go ahead pause
the video and make random dice index two
it's also a variable
it has data type int and it is also
going to be set to zero
all right so how did that go if it went
well then it should look something like
this random dice index 2 is the name we
gave it the VAT the VAR keyword and then
we're gonna use a semicolon and give it
a type it's also going to be an integer
and we're gonna set the value of this
variable to 0 as well now you can see
it's pretty much identical to the
variable that we created just above it
but it's got a slightly different name
it's the second random dice index great
so why do we need these containers
called random dice indices well we're
gonna generate some random numbers
between 1 and 6 essentially so if you
think about our dice faces there's only
six possible images that we've got dice
one to die six and in order for our dice
app to work we need these images to be
displayed up on here randomly so we're
going to create a random number
generator and then we're gonna use that
number to pick out a random image so
that the user can see their dice on the
screen so the next step is to create
this random number right so previously
we said that you can create a variable
and then you can set it at a later stage
that's exactly what we're gonna do here
so inside the curly braces for roll
button pressed
remember when you press the roll button
everything between this closing brace
and this opening brace is where your
code will get executed and that's
exactly where we want to create a random
number when I use random dice index 1
and we're going to set it to equal arc
for random uniform and we're going to
give it an upper bound of 6 now let's
take a look at this line of code so I'm
I'm taking the random dice index one
variable the container remember which
contains zero at the moment at this
stage I'm going to take out the zero and
set it to equal something else and that
something else is a random number
generator
called arc for random underscore uniform
now this is a functionality that gets
prepackaged into your essentially your
Swiss Army knife when you import UIKit
so when you import this library of code
called UI user interface kit it includes
a whole bunch of code that Apple wrote
that allows you certain really useful
functionalities such as um creating a
random number now if I got rid of this
import UI kid then I won't be able to
use most of the things that I'm using so
it is such an important piece of tool
that we're going to utilize so that we
don't have to write you know all the
code for how image views work or how
view controllers work or indeed how to
create a random number now randomness
exists all around us in the world but in
a closed system such as a computer and
that runs on ones and zeros there really
is no true randomness so we have to
create something called pseudo
randomness and that's done using
mathematical equations and these random
functions use these mathematical
equations and generate numbers that look
seemingly random to at least the human
eye and these random functions are
really really useful for us as
developers especially if you're a game
developer can you imagine playing a game
that has no chance involved so now we've
got this arc for random uniform and here
we're gonna put in the upper bound and
this is basically the finding what
random numbers were looking for by
putting in 6 then this function will
generate random numbers between 0 and 6
minus 1 so you'll get 0 1 2 3 4 through
2 5 but you won't see 6 at the moment
it's complaining to me
so the error code says cannot assign
value of type u int 32 to type int now
the problem here just
to translate Xcode into English it's
telling me that this function arc for
random uniform returns or sends back to
me a number that is of type u int 32 but
my random dice index is of type int as I
declared up here now what is au in 32
it's a different type to an int it's
very similar but the U stands for
unsigned so it doesn't have a negative
sign in front of it ie it can only be a
positive number a whole number from the
int right so unsigned integer 32 so
that's a 32-bit number and that's just
saying how large that number can be so
essentially the problem that we've got
here is a Miss a mismatch of data types
and we can change this by casting you
know how you cast iron from liquid to a
different shape well that's kind of
similar what we're gonna do is we're
gonna write int and we're gonna enclose
everything that is UN 32 namely
everything that's of this function
inside this bracket and we're gonna turn
the UN 32 and cast it into an int so
then X code is happy because the
left-hand side of the equation is an
integer and the right-hand equation is
now been turned into an integer as well
so brilliant we're done now next you're
gonna create a random dice index 2 and
you're gonna use the arc for random
uniform function and it's also going to
generate a number between 0 and 5
alright so did that work out did you end
up writing something like this so
remember we're resetting the random dice
indexed to variable that we created at
the top of the code file and we're going
to set it to arc for random uniform and
then we're gonna set it to a number
between 0 and 5 so we're gonna put 6 in
here and finally I'm going to cast this
you int 32 into an integer okay cool
so just to recap we created two
variables that's going to hold the
random numbers and then we generated two
separate random numbers between 0 and 5
so the important thing when coding is
that you should really check to make
sure that your assumptions are reflected
in the results so let's go ahead and
test out our code what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna use a print statement to print
out the result of random dice index 1
and we're gonna run the app and see what
happens
so either command R or just press the
play button so this bit of code should
only get triggered if the role button is
pressed and only these three lines
should get triggered when that happens
okay great so we've got this showing on
the screen nothing's happened so far and
we're just gonna go ahead and press role
button to trigger these three lines of
code for ok so now my debug console the
part at the bottom of the screen just
popped up because now it's got an output
and then I'm gonna press again ok so
looks like it's working right it's
generating random numbers between 0 and
5 so everything seems to work well and I
can stop my app from running and I can
close the debug area if you assume that
as you're writing code
you're constantly introducing errors
into it now for some people this might
not be true you might be really really
diligent but for most of us this happens
a lot people create bugs and the bugs
get bigger the longer that you don't
test your code if you test it on a
regular basis and test all your
assumptions as you write them then
you're less likely to make mistakes so
in this lesson we've created two brand
new variables gave it an initial value
of zero and then later on once the roll
button is pressed we change that value
to a random number using the arc for
random uniform function as tested
generates a random number between 0 and
5 and in the next episode we're going to
talk in depth about variables constants
and data types in Swift so I look
forward to seeing you there and that's
all from me ok so in the previous
episode we created two variables called
random dice index 1 and random dice
index 2 in this episode we're gonna dive
a little bit deeper into what variables
and constants are and why they have data
types associated with them ok so open up
your xcode instead of going into
creating a new Xcode project what we're
gonna do today is we're gonna use a
playground now this is something that
Apple created to help people explore
various ideas essentially test out your
code without having to have it
associated with a design file or or
indeed an app so open up your Xcode and
we're gonna click on get started with a
playground and today's topic is gonna be
about variables constants and data types
so that's the name I'm gonna give it and
I'm gonna go ahead and click Next and
then you can save it anywhere you like
ok so this is a brand new playground and
I'm just going to maximize the screen
here so I can show you as much as I can
umm and already in here you can see that
it's preloaded with a single variable
called string
it's values hello playground we're just
gonna delete that because we're gonna be
creating our own so remember the first
thing we type is the keyword var to show
that we are creating a new variable and
then you give it a name so for example
my new variable is going to be called my
age now remember that in programming
when you're naming variables when you're
naming functions it always follows
camelcase so lower caps first and then
every subsequent word is capitalized
this makes it easier to see and makes it
less prone to errors
okay so variable a new variable called
my age and it is of type integer and I'm
gonna set it to equal 32 what if I want
to change this variable at a later stage
what if you know one years passed and my
age is now 33 well add one year to it so
then I would only use the name of the
variable so notice that when I'm
changing the value of the variable I
don't have to use the keyword farm that
var is only for creating it so now what
my age is equal to 33 and that was
pretty easy and if you look on the side
of your playground here now this is the
beauty of playgrounds you can
essentially see your variable values at
all times normally when we're working
within our code projects in order to see
the values of these variables we have to
make it show up on a label which will
show up on the app or indeed we use the
print statement where we get it to print
to the console now by having playgrounds
essentially it just saves you this step
of having to print it out so you can see
all the variables as and when they are
created so let's get rid of that print
statement now what if I wanted to make a
different type of variable say I wanted
to make a variable that held my name
well my name is something that doesn't
really change very often so there's no
point using a VAR keyword to create a
variable instead what I can do is create
a constant that doesn't ever change in
value so to create a constant the
keyword instead of var is let and then I
give it the name of my constant which is
going to be called my name and it is of
type string of course because name is
going to be text and then I'm gonna set
it equal to Angela there we go
now if you try to change the value of a
constant for example like we did with my
age my name now equals I don't know Jane
Xcode will complain and tell you that
this is not allowed and you can see the
error reads cannot assign to value my
name is a let constant and it points out
exactly where this error is so let's
delete that line and make Xcode happy so
you can't change the value of constants
so essentially you should consider
variables and constants as containers or
boxes that can hold values and I'm going
to show you in a bit more detail what I
mean by this
if variables and constants are both
containers or boxes that can hold values
then variables are essentially boxes
that have an open lid you can open it to
put in a new value such as a number in
this case and then you can take that
value out and put in a different value
if needed but when you're dealing with
constants you're essentially dealing
with a box that only allows you to put
in a value once afterwards you have to
tape it up seal it up and you cannot
change the value inside anymore so
variables and constants are used
differently variables are there to keep
track of the state of your app so for
example which level is the user on how
many monsters have they killed etc but
constants are there to hold pieces of
data that never changed for example your
API keys or a URL and constants also
take up less memory space than variables
so let's head back over to our
playgrounds and see what else we can do
with variables and constants now using
variables and constants it's quite easy
to manipulate the values that are held
inside so for example if I wanted to
create a new constant cord let my age in
years equal then I would use my age and
then I would just add 10 to it so this
is adding an integer to an integer which
of course has no problems and my age in
ten years now equals forty-three added
from 33 I can do the same thing with
strings but of course you can't
calculate strings so what happens is
that you can concatenate strings onto
strings so for example let my full name
equal my name plus a string that's a
space plus my surname and now you can
see my full name now equals Angela you
so previously when we were printing out
so this is one way of doing it another
way is using the escaped backslash let
me show you what I mean so say if
instead of writing let my full name
equals my name plus my surname what I
can do is open up two quotation marks
everything inside is going to be a
string then I used the backslash and I
use two parentheses and inside I put in
my variable which is called my name and
then to that I add a space and I add my
surname or if I had not just my name but
my surname then I can also just put in a
space and then escape and then add my
surname into here and that would also
give you the same result my full name
now equals Angela you now of course this
isn't going to work when you mix up the
datatypes so what I mean by that if you
try to add a string so denoted by the
quotation marks called ten to my age
then Xcode will complain and tell you
that the binary operator plus cannot be
applied to operands of type int and
string it's saying that you're trying to
mix up a number with a string and it
doesn't really know what to do with that
so that's not gonna be allowed
let's change that back to ten so say if
I wanted to print out my full details of
my age and my name how would I do that
well you can use the backslash to escape
your variables let me show you what I
mean let's say we write let my details
equal two quotation marks so previously
when we declared all our variables and
constants
we've been explicitly telling Xcode what
the data type will be so for example my
age is going to hold int integers or
whole numbers and my name is going to
hold strings or texts essentially now in
this case I'm actually letting Xcode
infer the datatype of my constant my
details because I'm opening up the two
quotation marks it instantly knows that
it's going to be a string that's going
to go inside and the type of my details
is automatically assigned as string
without me having to explicitly state
what type it is
now the beauty of this is that you cut
down on typing but the inconvenience is
that it's harder for you to tell what
the type is without having it explicitly
written out so different people have
different preferences I tend to prefer
not to explicitly state the datatype
just because it cuts down on time but
occasionally when working on
collaborative work and if the style
guide of the project is that we
explicitly state all our data types then
that's the way you go so it really
depends on choice and you'll you'll get
a feel for what you prefer now here I'm
gonna create a string called my details
and it's gonna hold both my name as well
as my age so how do we do that well what
you can do is you can use the backslash
escape so I'm gonna write a backslash
and I'm gonna open up two parentheses
and inside these parentheses I'm gonna
put in my name the variable and then I'm
gonna have a comma and a space and then
I'm gonna have another escaped variable
and here and in here I'm gonna put in my
age now what this implicitly does
is that it converts my age into a string
and combines them together into this one
line which says Angela age 33 and that
becomes my details so we briefly talked
a bit about data types but let's make it
a bit more clear when we're talking
about data types essentially you should
think about it as one of these
children's toys the shape fitting toy
that give one year olds to play with and
it's pretty simple you take the shape
that fits the particular hole and then
you put it in there if you get the wrong
hole then of course it won't fit and
this is a really good analogy for
variables and constants because they all
have a fixed data type so for example if
I had a variable that could only take
strings as values then if I try to put
in a string say ABC then there's
obviously no problem and it fits in
easily but instead if I try to put in an
integer say 12 then it would give me an
error and it won't let me do it so each
variable and each constant has either an
implied datatype based on the first
value it was assigned or it has an
explicit data type which you tell it so
let's head back to our playgrounds and
let me show you a few more data types so
we've already seen a whole numbers and
those are of course of type int or
integer and they're essentially just
numbers can be negative or positive then
we've seen strings as well so that's
usually for text and it is of type
string so a string of characters strung
together such as ABC and they're denoted
by the quotation marks around them now
what we haven't seen is boolean so
boolean z'
are a datatype that can only hold true
or false and the type is bool with a
capital and they can either be true or
they can be false
now another data type is the
floating-point number or usually
declared as a float and these are your
numbers with decimal places after them
but if in your programming you need you
need numbers with
decimal places to a high degree of
accuracy say if you're doing scientific
calculations then you will need to use
instead something called a double
these are essentially 64-bit numbers so
they have a higher level of precision
and that allows you to have a number
precision up to about fifteen decimal
places whereas the float can only give
you about six decimal places so those
are some of the most basic data types
and you'll be coming across some other
data types
during our programming lessons and we'll
mention them as and when we go along but
the most important parts to remember
from this lesson is that variables and
constants are essentially containers for
data with variables you can change the
value that's contained whereas with
constants you can only assign it a value
once and with both variables as well as
constants they have a data type
associated with them and this can either
be inferred from the value that you
place inside the variable or it can be
explicitly typed such as here when we
declare that it is a string so that was
a brief intro to data types variables
and constants in the introduction to
Swift programming section we're going to
be diving a bit deeper into this as well
as other programming concepts so I'll
see on the next lesson and we're going
to continue building our dicy app okay
so just to recap previously we created
two new variables called random dice
index one and random dice index two and
these were created as containers to
store some new random numbers that we
would generate now we've got this
machine essentially called arc for
random uniform that spits out random
numbers in the range between 0 and 5 and
then we printed out the results so in
this lesson we're going to cover how to
change the image property of UI image
views and also how to create arrays so
first things first how do we change the
image views now we've got these two
image views that are linked up to IB
outlets now there's one way that's very
intuitive and that's of course clicking
on the image view and changing the image
here to say dice 2 but the problem is
once the app is up and running we can't
exactly go back into our code
and try to change these properties it
won't affect the app that's already
running so instead what else can we do
well the other option is that we can
programmatically change it which is what
we'll do so in order to change this
image view I'm gonna have to make a
reference to dice image view 1 and so we
can type in dice image view 1 dot and
then we're gonna change 1 of dice image
view ones properties namely the image
property so remember that image views
are simply picture frames and they have
different properties for example they
have a size property or they have a
background color property but the one
that we're going to change is its image
property so which picture is slotted
into that picture frame
and we are going to set it to a UI user
interface image now user interface image
is a data type just as strings as a data
type or integers are a data type your
image is also a data type and we're
going to use a special function called
image named to pull up an image from our
assets XE assets folder so if we just
briefly remind ourselves what those
images were called they were called
diced 1 through 2 dice 6 now you might
remember when we drag these images into
the assets folder
they had a dot PNG as the extension or
the file type now you don't have to
worry about that once it goes into Xcode
it knows how to deal with all of that
and all you have to do is refer to it by
its name so let's make it the same as
this one let's make it show the image of
dice 2 now just one thing to note is
that whenever you use the tab button or
Enter button just as when I started
typing named an Xcode gave me the right
suggestion it always gives you this
light blue placeholder now what place
holder is telling you is to click on it
and change it and it's giving you the
datatype of what you should put in here
and in this one it's a string because
I'm going to put the file name
my image here and remember that strings
are always denoted by quotation marks
around them and we're gonna go for dice
too now if I hit run let's see what
happens
okay so was that what you expected or
did you expect that our code would
change the dice image view one well
let's review where is this line of code
it's right here and it's between the
closing and opening braces of the IV
action roll button pressed as we said
previously everything in between here
only gets executed when the roll button
is pressed
hence the IB action so we will only
expect this line of code to execute when
I press the roll button and there you go
now I'm going to show you an issue that
some people might run into now if you
had not typed a string in here which is
denoted by the quotation marks as well
as the code highlighting in red what you
might have done is you might have
started typing and you typed dice too
now it's very important to have a look
in the left image in each of these
suggestions now when it says V it means
variable when it says M it means method
and when it is an image it means that
you're actually pulling up a UI image
now if I type enter here Xcode is gonna
be very unhappy because it was expecting
a string in that placeholder but instead
I put in a UI image now that doesn't
make any sense to Xcode so this would
give you an error and you can fix it
easily by going back to the string form
there is however a shortcut to all of
this and it's something that's actually
quite new if instead of using the UI
image named method to set the image name
that should be shown if you had just
typed dice to and hit enter and that
would also work but in most case you'll
see programmers actually writing your
image
and the dice to name in here okay but
now we've got the same problem right
every time we press the roll button it
only displays the dice to image and
that's not a very fun app now we want
the possibility to display all six
images and we're gonna pick out which
image that gets displayed based on this
random number that we created right so
in order for that to happen we have to
have somewhere in our code that stores
the data about all of our image names so
here we're going to introduce you to the
array now firstly I'm gonna type the let
keyword now previously we've seen the
VAR keyword used for variables and in
this case we've got the let keyword
that's used for creating constants so
containers that contain data that never
change
so say if I wrote something like my name
which is not likely to ever change if at
a later stage I decided to try to change
my name now set it equal to Jane I guess
it will complain it will not let me do
this because it will say that my name is
a constant and you can't change constant
so it's actually suggesting maybe you
can change my name to a variable now
that's not what we want because we are
going to create a constant that's called
dice array and it is going to hold all
the names of our dice images and I'm
gonna create two square brackets now in
programming you already seen a whole
load of different brackets braces
parentheses and it can be really
confusing and overwhelming at first it's
really important to make sure that
you're typing the exact type of brace or
bracket or curly brace or parentheses
that you see either on screen or on the
course book because otherwise Xcode is
going to get very confused and none of
the code will work so this is very
important now inside these square
brackets I'm gonna put in the names of
my dice face images so that's dice one
and then we've created our first array
that contains all the names of our dice
images now let's just explain array in a
little bit more detail you should see a
raise as essentially egg boxes they
contain things that are of the same type
so for example you can't have an egg box
that contains both eggs and chickens and
similarly if you're creating an array in
programming you can't have an array that
contains multiple data types such as
strings mixed with integers the next
thing to remember about arrays is how we
count in a race as a normal human being
we would all count beginning with one so
the stripey egg is one and the dotted
egg is two but programmers as well as
computers actually start counting from
zero so the stripey egg would be at
index zero the spotted egg would be at
index one and so say if I created a
constant called my egg and set it to the
first element in a gray as you can see
above the zeroth element is the stripy
egg and the first element is the spotted
egg so when we're trying to pick out
elements from arrays always keep in mind
that you start counting from zero now do
you remember when we created the arc for
random uniform function and I told you
that this is essentially a machine that
spits out random numbers in the range
between 0 and X minus 1 so in this case
were created numbers between 0 and 5 and
that may have seemed a bit strange at
first but it now makes sense because
dice 1 is at index 0 1 2 3 4 5 perfect
we have all the numbers we need in order
to pick out the right dice image from
our array so let's go ahead and do that
so instead of typing dice to literally
let's try and pick it out from dice
array so just as we did with the eggs we
would type dice array and then we would
use the square brackets to pick out a
particular one in this case it will be 1
and not 0 if we
wanted dice too so let's go ahead and
run the app and just make sure that it
worked as expected perfect works exactly
the same as before again we still
haven't really improved on our app right
it only ever shows the second dice now
what we want to happen is for it to show
a random dice so that means instead of
putting in one here which is limiting it
to just the first index ie dice two what
we can do instead is put in that random
number that we created up here so we can
put in random dice index 1 and then
we're gonna run the app and see what
happens and so it works the app
generates random numbers and uses it to
pick out a particular element in the
dice of rain and then assigns that image
to dice image view 1 all right so now
it's your turn let's set dice image view
2 in the same way that we did with dice
image view 1 and give it a random image
between dice 1 and dice 6 using our dice
array so now is a chance to pause the
video write your code and run your app
and see if it works as expected
alright so did it work let's see if this
is what you did so we're now setting the
image view on the right which is named
dice image view too so we can again
check that by just going over here and
we're setting its image property to
equal a UI image that's named using the
dice array and we're gonna pick out a
random member of dice array using random
dice index 2 let's run our app and voila
you can generate random dice faces at
the touch of a button
perfect so at this point I'm gonna point
out a very common error that students
tend to make I said we're going to
change the image on dice image view to
and a lot of people just simply take
this copy and paste
don't be embarrassed if this is what you
did because every single programmer has
done a copy and paste job but the
problem with a copy and pasting code is
that you tend to get errors and what a
lot of people do is that after they copy
and pasted it they might have changed
this number two dice image view - but
they forget to change this number to
random dice index - and it stays as one
and this is what happens when you keep
it as that instead of having two
separate dice you have two dice that
simply mirror each other so this is
something to watch out for and we'll
just go ahead and change it back to how
it should be so especially for those
students who are starting out with
learning programming it's really good
practice to type out all your code
instead of copy and pasting because you
tend to run into errors and we're
fortunate here because we've only got
what 10 lines of code you know when
you're working with large projects with
20,000 lines or 50,000 lines it can be a
nightmare to try and find out what
happened so just a recap in this episode
we created a dice array that held all
the image names of our dice faces and
then we used the random numbers that we
created in the previous lesson to select
a random dice face for our image views
so in the next lesson we're gonna talk a
bit more about how to become a better
programmer how to be tidy with your code
how to group functionality together in
methods and how to essentially
reorganize our code until next time I'll
see you there in this lesson we're going
to learn about reorganizing our code
into functions I'm mostly going to be
working with the code file so I'm gonna
get rid of this assistant editor I can
either click this button or you can use
the shortcut command ENTER to make it
single screen and then I'm gonna hit
view controller dot Swift to see my code
file now you can see that we've got a
lot of functionality that's inside this
role but impressed IB action and just a
recap we have two lines that creates two
separate random
and then we print one of the random
numbers and then we use those random
numbers to change the image view of the
dice faces so for a dice shaker app this
is very common functionality changing
the dice face so what if I needed that
to happen elsewhere for example if upon
opening up the app I wanted two random
dice faces instead of just having Snake
Eyes all the time well then I would have
to put it within the viewdidload and
this is a function that only gets
triggered at the time point when the
view or when the screen loads up so this
is the perfect place to put in the code
that's required to generate a new set of
dice faces now I can either essentially
copy all of this and paste it in here
and if I run it you'll see how it works
so immediately upon the app loading up
we already see a random set of dice
faces and when I press the roll button
it'll continue to give me new random
dice faces that's well and good but
remember previously we said when you
copy and paste code you tend to make
errors and also look at how cluttered
our code file has become with loads of
repeated elements one of the most
fundamental principles of good
programming is called dry don't repeat
yourself so whenever you see repeated
code such as these blocks you should
always try to package them into a
function that you can call upon when
needed so the less code there is the
less errors they'll be let's try and see
if we can package this functionality
this closing brace that remember the
ones facing left is closing this opening
brace and together everything in between
make up the roll button pressed IB
action now I don't want to put my
function inside this function that won't
work so instead I'm going to hit enter
and make my new function beneath it so
here in order to create a new function I
use the func keyword in Swift and then
I'm going to give
name that describes explicitly what this
function achieves in this case I'm gonna
call it update dice images now of course
you can name your variables and
functions however you like but just
remember to give it a name that is
explicit and when another programmer
comes along and looks at your code they
can easily understand what your
functions achieve so I think this makes
sense update dice images because this
block of code essentially generates
random numbers and then updates the
image views so then I'm gonna add two
parentheses so nothing goes inside these
parentheses in the introduction to Swift
programming lectures we're gonna learn a
lot more about functions and their
variations and you're going to
understand what these parentheses are
for but for now we're gonna leave them
empty now I'm gonna open a curly brace
and this is the moment when one of the
most common programming errors gets
generated so now that I've opened this
curly brace if I leave it as it is and I
click away float this closing brace
which used to close the entire class now
becomes the closing brace for this
update dice images function and the
class no longer has a closing bracket
which is why there's this error that
says expected declaration which makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever but it's
actually telling you that your class was
opened but was never closed so to avoid
this error whenever you find yourself
typing the open brace always hit enter
straight away that way Xcode
automatically generates the closing
brace for you and all is well and good
with your code so just remember that
little tip to avoid these curly brace
associated errors okay so let's check
great so this closing brace closes this
opening brace and everything in between
is going to be the functionality of our
update dice images so I'm going to take
all of this code and then I'm going to
cut with command X
and paste into here now of course you
can type it all out for practice as well
but just to show you it's exactly the
same as what used to be enroll button
pressed and I'm gonna get rid of this
print statement because it was more for
us to find out what random dice index
was rather than having any sort of
useful functionality and I'm gonna give
my code a bit of space so I can see
easily at a glance what it does okay so
now that we have this function called
update dice images we can now use it
everywhere where we need this
functionality so we can get rid of this
code inside viewdidload and instead we
can make a call to the function update
dice images as soon as I start writing
update Xcode will give me a suggestion
then just hit enter or tab for it to
insert it in there always try to save
yourself work by getting Xcode to insert
these function names or variable names
on one hand you save yourself a bit of
time typing secondly you save yourself
spelling errors and because we're
dealing with computers the uppercase and
lowercase matters a huge deal if you
typed update dice images with a
lowercase D the computer won't know what
the hell it is that you're talking about
because it only knows update dice images
with a capital D and a capital I so
let's change that back to that and you
can see that the code highlighting goes
from black to when it recognizes to this
kind of indigo color so whenever you
have bits of code that's not got the
proper code highlighting always be wary
that there might be a problem with it so
currently when the view loads we're
going to update new set of dice faces
and also when we press the roll button
we want to update a new set of dice
images now I'm also going to call the
method over here now at the moment I'm
using the words methods and functions
pretty much interchangeably they are
different but the difference is mostly
academic for all intents and purposes
it's OK for you to assume that they're
the same thing for now in a later module
when we start talking about objects and
classes and the fundamentals of object
orientated programming
we'll then tease out the difference
between methods and functions
objects classes etc so for now all we
have is a call to the method update dice
images within muted load and another
call to the method within roll button
pressed so let's run this app again and
if we did everything right the app
should look identical to the last time
we ran it okay so initially on loading
up I get a random set of dice faces and
also when I press the wrong button I get
random dice faces so the functionality
of our app hasn't changed at all and
that's because we haven't added any new
functionality all we did was tidy up our
code and group together all of that
functionality within update dice images
and then we called it in viewdidload and
we called it enroll button press now
remember when we create variables we use
the VAR keyword and when we create
functions we use the func keyword but
when we subsequently decide to change
the value that's held inside a variable
we don't use the keyword anymore right
so we just simply say random dice index
and then set it equal to a new value and
similarly with functions or methods when
you call it you don't have the funky
word notice the difference between what
I call to use the method and when I
created using that funky word but what
exactly is so great about functions
anyways why do we bother creating them
and using them instead of just typing
out and putting the code where we need
functions are a great way to group
together similar commands now for
example if you wanted me to get you some
milk and I was a robot you would have to
tell me line by line how to execute this
action right I would first probably have
to take money open the door close the
door walk forwards turned right walk
some more turn left go inside the shop
etc etc etc you know this will be
hundreds of lines of commands so that I
can achieve just this simple task of
getting milk now would you want to write
out all of those commands every single
day if you needed milk no that's why we
package all of the
commands into one function called get
milk and we stuff all of those
individual commands inside so whenever
we call the function get milk the robot
will automatically know to execute
everything that's inside so coming back
to our dicey project that's exactly what
we did we had these four lines of code
which performs a very simple
functionality of updating the dice image
faces and then we've essentially just
called this method every time we needed
it in the next episode we're going to be
talking about how to engage the motion
sensors in the iPhone and how we can get
the dice to roll and change their dice
faces upon the user shaking the iPhone
so all of that yet to come and I'll see
you in the next episode all right so now
that we've completed most of the basic
functionality within our app such as the
ability to change the dice face images
on pressing the roll button or having
new dice face images show up as soon as
the app loads up we want to explore
another cool feature we want to tap into
the motion detectors in the iPhone to be
able to detect when a user has shaken
their phone and then changing the dice
faces programmatically now how do we do
this well let's see if we can figure it
out whenever you're miffed about how to
implement a certain functionality the
best thing to do is to go to help and
review the documentation and API
references now you can either look at
the swift api's or Objective C or
JavaScript but the easiest thing is to
actually use the search bar so let's
think about what we're trying to look
for we want to shake the phone and
detect motion right so let's just search
for shake motion and what have we got so
under the swift tab we've got detecting
shake motion events that sounds pretty
much like what we need let's see what it
says and if you read through some of
this documentation tells you how the
iPhone detects shake motion and if you
scroll down a bit there's how to
implement the motion handling methods
now while Apple is in the process of
updating all their example code and
projects from Objective C of which this
is written in what you're looking for
these hyperlinked method themes because
that's what you're gonna need when you
implement it in Swift so we can see that
there's one which is motion began and
motion ended we don't really want the
dice face to immediately change as soon
as the user shakes it we want it to
change as soon as they finish shaking
the phone that seems to make more sense
to me now if we hit motion enter with
event and just click on it we get taken
to the API reference so it says that
this method tells the receiver that a
motion event has ended and currently
we've got the language selected as swift
so we'll be able to see what that method
looks like in its entirety so let's go
back into our dicey project and try to
implement this motion ended function so
again remember that we don't want to
create functions within other functions
so just double click here to check that
closing bracket closes update dice
images so we'll write a new function
just beneath it so let's start typing
the function name that we saw just now
which is called motion ended so as soon
as I've typed motion e Xcode is already
suggested to me the exact method that I
want which is the motion ended motion
with event method and I'm just gonna hit
enter to let Xcode type out the entire
line for me now Apple likes to have
really long method names so to save
yourself time and to save your sanity
always hit enter or hit tab to let Xcode
automatically write out the code for you
so I don't think that you can see here
is that Xcode has inserted this little
placeholder here which highlights in
blue and that's just to tell you where
your code should go so you can go ahead
and select it and delete it and in here
we're going to be putting in what we
want to happen once the motion has ended
so what do we want to happen well we
want to change the dice faces so I'm
gonna let you guys pause the video here
and figure out how to update those dice
images okay so that was a pretty simple
challenge we did it twice in the
previous lesson
and yes you basically just have to call
update dice images our beautiful
function that we made in the last lesson
that contains all the commands that's
required to change the dice faces so
inside here I'm gonna give myself a bit
more space and then I'm just gonna type
update nice images there you go and
moment of truth let's test out our app
now ideally you should be running your
app on your physical iPhone so if you
haven't figured out how to siloed your
app onto your phone yet this is a really
good moment to take a step back and have
a look at the module where we teach you
about side loading it's a lot more fun
you have your own apps on your phone now
for those of you guys who don't have an
iPhone I'm gonna show you how to test
this on the simulator so let's hit run
and let's just check to make sure
everything else is working as intended
so we've got random dice faces upon
loading up of the app and that's because
our call to update dice images within
viewdidload when I hit the wrong button
I get new dice faces working as intended
and now if I want to test out the shake
gesture in my simulator of course I
can't shake my Mac that would be crazy
so don't do this don't do this
instead you should go into hardware and
shake gesture and it will simulate
shaking the iPhone simulator one thing
to note for those you guys who are
testing out this app you'll have noticed
that this app doesn't yet look very good
when I for example turn it into
landscape or when I run it on a screen
size that's not the iPhone 6 and this is
because we haven't set up any rules for
how the user interface elements should
be displayed in a future module we're
gonna dive deep into Auto layout and
learn about how to make our app look
beautiful on every screen size and
orientation so don't worry about that in
this module we introduced a lot of new
programming concepts and it's far more
important to focus on those for now and
so there we go we've created a Las Vegas
dice shaker app that responds to both
taps and shake and in the process we
learnt how
to link up our design with our code we
learned about how to create IV outlets
and I reactions and then we learnt about
variables constants and data types we
touched upon randomization and creating
arrays and finally we reorganize our
code created functions and tapped into
the motion detectors so this is our
first step venturing towards app
programming and in the coming apps and
the coming modules we're going to be
looking at how to call api's from the
web how to set up our own cloud database
and much much more so hope you guys had
fun while learning Swift and making the
dicy app in the next module on our
online platform we're gonna get you to
fly solo you're going to be creating a
magic 8-ball app that gives you all of
life's answers when you ask it questions
and the idea is to challenge you guys on
what you've already learnt what you've
ready harness and try to see if you've
really understood it and if you can
apply it yourself so that's all from me
for now and I'll see you on the next
module when we build a magic 8-ball
see you there when we build a magic
8-ball app so see there all right so now
that you've built dicy it's time to
think about the next step the most
important thing is just to keep going
don't stop now you've already got all
this momentum at the London app brewery
we've built an entire curriculum that's
been refined and tested through teaching
in our in-person classrooms in London
the idea is to slowly ramp you up taking
you from the end of dicey and getting
you to build apps that'll teach you some
of the core programming fundamentals the
next month is about app design and we
teach you various aspects of user
interface design as well as user
experience design essentially how do you
craft a beautiful app that people will
love when we get you to build wireframes
mock-ups prototypes you name it monthly
you'll be going back to programming and
we're gonna get you to build more
advanced apps so these are apps that
leverage a cloud-based database and
we're also getting you to retrieve data
from the internet so we're gonna teach
you how to tap into API is that all
grab whether data or Bitcoin data and
we're also teaching you what is good
practice in professional programming and
finally on month four it's all about
focusing on your business so we delve
into some of the growth hacking
techniques how to acquire your first
thousand customers and also things such
as how to get featured on the App Store
and much much more so this is a complete
curriculum that is gonna take you from
beginning to end we're gonna teach you
everything that you possibly need to
know in order to build a successful app
based business on top of that you get
access to support from the instructors
as well as our current students so if
you have any questions that you want to
ask any of the instructors or any of the
other students then this is a great
forum so on top of all of that once
you've completed all of the tutorials
and you've submitted all the coursework
we actually issue you with a digital
certificate that certifies that you've
been trained in various aspects of iOS
app development whig Swift so that's
something that you can show off when
you're looking for a job in the future
now finally once you've completed the
entire course then you're ready to start
building your own apps so for example
one of our students miler built an app
called neck speech which is a voice to
text diary another one of our students
built an app that is the uber for
doctors so helps doctors find temporary
jobs and if you've completed our course
and you've built your own app then email
us about it and we'll include you in the
newsletter that goes out to thousands of
students so that they can check it out
too so once you're ready to join us on
udemy then just head over to the
