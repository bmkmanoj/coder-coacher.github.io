to check out top 70 interview questions
with solutions to clear any selenium
automation interview out there okay so I
have divided this complete topic into
three parts so first the part man we are
going to discuss about selenium tool
interview questions we get regarding
webdriver API and in the part two we are
going to discuss selenium framework
interview questions and in part three we
will discuss core Java interview
questions okay so interviews will tester
in three different areas to analyze
students knowledge on this automation
tool let's start with part one selenium
tool interview questions first in this
lecture and then take our part two and
part three okay okay so before we start
I assume that students either have basic
knowledge on selenium and they are going
through this video to refresh their
memory or quick recap for their upcoming
interview preparation but if you are new
to selenium I would recommend you to go
through my selenium webdriver course
from udemy.com which have around 45
hours of content which explains
everything from scratch level to
framework level okay so the discount
link is provided in the video
description you can check it out from
there and you know you can get it for
good amount of discount if you are
already aware let's get started okay
first question
difference between get in navigate
method in selenium okay so we have a
methods called gate and navigate which
are webdriver methods which actually
hits the URL on our browser okay both
does same functionality but what is the
my new difference between this ket
method and navigate method so basically
when you give gate method and you pass
the URL the browser will actually hit
that URL on the browser and you will be
landed on that home page whatever
you pass for example if you pass
google.com with get method in the driver
so it will hit this website on the
browser navigate also does same thing
but the my new difference in the core
characteristic future forget is that
when it hit the browser with this link
it will wait till all the components on
that google.com page is loaded
completely ok so after this navigating
you will write a next step either to
enter values in the check box or to
click on any link right
so when it hit before it completely
loaded if you are trying to click on
link which is not yet visible because
it's still loading to go on that
google.com page ok so before it loads if
you try to click on any link it will not
visible because it is not loaded right
so definitely there will be an error
thrown in your script but when you use
with kit so get hold on your selenium
script until all the components of
google.com are loaded once everything is
loaded then only it resumes the step it
unlocks the script and it proceeds to
the next click OK any kit it can click
comfortably as the page is loaded and
the objects are displayed
but this scenario is not applicable to
navigate in navigate it hits the URL but
it immediately start looking for your
next step it will not keep on you know
here on whether this particular page is
completely loaded or not it just goes
onto the next page which like every step
does in selenium ok so that's the reason
whenever we develop any automation
script the first step what we start
after browser creation is driver dot kit
ok because we don't want to proceed
until the base page is loaded but you
might think that then what is the
purpose of selenium guys in creating
this navigate when gate is doing
wonderfully ok but here in navigate you
you also have a methods to go back or to
go forward or refresh the browser okay
so if you go back to any of your browser
you have a back forward and refresh
right so all these three icons you can
do with the help of navigate ok navigate
dot forward navigate dot backward
navigate dot refresh all these concepts
you can do with this ok but with this
kit you can just hit in the browser but
you cannot do all these methods so
that's one of the major difference
between navigate and get so for complete
reference of this code and to understand
how exactly code works I asked I wish
you to watch this particular lectures in
my course that comes around basics
methods of webdriver ok I recommend you
to go through these topics so that you
will understand how these things works
ok so this is high level answer if
someone asks you on how this difference
work between getting navigate okay you
are already if you are already aware of
the selenium and on you can just learn
and proceed but if you are newbie and
trying to grab the concept from the
basic then you have to watch this
section called configuring selenium and
running tests on all browsers and these
tools lectures will help you to
understand that concept ok
this file X's right next difference
between quit and closed methods in
webdriver
again both the same thing when you use
quit browser get closed and when you use
closed method then also browser gets to
then what is the exact difference
between these two and why selenium guys
have introduced two different methods
okay
so close method actually closes the
browser which is in focus now for
example you have open a browser and you
are automating that and you click on
link which will trigger another browser
to open and again you walk on that new
browser and you click on some link which
will again open another
like that let's assume that three
browsers are open when you are
automating a test and here when you use
closed method it closes the only that
particular browser which is on focus at
that time okay so if there are three
browsers open and if test is on third
browser doing some automation on the
third browser then you if you use closed
method only that particular browser will
get closed whereas if you use quit all
the three browsers will get closed that
means webdriver instance itself will get
closed so with that complete process
whatever opened starting from the strip
will be closed so that's the basic
difference between close and quit so
both does the same thing but if you want
to close the focus browser or everything
you should decide so with that you can
actually get on these methods and I said
we are also having examples in our
course talking about that two different
codes for close and quit now and the
most important topic and in the most
common interview question which we get
across is what is implicit debate okay
so in implicit wait now for example you
are looking to click on a link but it's
not visible when you land that page
immediately okay so you wait for some
time and you click on link and that
navigates to another page in that page
again you want to handle something which
is not yet visible it's keep on loading
so like that
for each and every page when you are
automating your flow it might take few
seconds based upon the components
present on that page or based upon your
server website server speed okay that
decides how much time it takes for the
objects to visible on the screen okay
now for example if i refresh this page
these things are immediately displaying
now you see that step by step they got
displayed but when you are trying to
automate with selenium that does not
have a knowledge
- wait just like us okay because we
manually know that if you wait for two
seconds things will display but selenium
does not have that knowledge we pass
that knowledge with the help of implicit
wait okay so in implicit wait we define
specific amount of wait time in the
beginning of our test only the meaning
of the test we will define that wait for
10 seconds okay so until whenever it's
come it's on the flow of the script and
whenever something object is not
displayed
you were script will wait for 10 seconds
before it throw an error message saying
that message object is not displayed
okay it will wait 10 seconds and a tenth
second it throws an error so if you
don't write implicit wait it fails
immediately but it displayed in third or
fourth second then you cannot claim that
as a failure right so that's the reason
based upon you have company website
server handling and based upon how
frequently objects will display after
loading the page you decide time for
this implicit that could be 10 5 or 20
or 60 okay if you have very slow
application because of some reasons and
you can put up to 60 seconds so that
means you are telling your selenium test
to wait for 60 seconds until the object
is visible when you navigate to a
specific page or when you try to do some
operation okay or you can just say 5
seconds you if you feel that your
application is very fast so this applies
to each and every step in your script so
whenever something is not displayed it
waits for 5 seconds and then it fakes
but let's assume one scenario here so
link is not displayed it's waiting but
in 3 seconds it loaded so finally at the
third second the link is displayed so in
this case selenium will not wait until 5
seconds whenever link is displayed it
resumes script and saves you the 2
seconds okay
so generally people think that
everywhere when something is not
displayed it wait for 5 seconds and then
only it will check again now so it will
check each and every second if object is
displayed or not if it displayed in
third second so it does not wait till
five okay so it just resumed in this way
we are saving the script and optimizing
the test time right so that's the thing
you need to know about implicit wait so
that it poles on every second but it's
not mandatory that it waits for five
seconds the object displays before that
it resumed your execution so that's
where implicit wait will come into
picture and it's recommended to use this
paste upon your actual application speed
and its performance and all okay so if
you want to write a code for this
implicit wait you can write driver dot
manage this is the way you can define
your implicit rate
timeout implicit rate time unit dot
seconds okay so this is the step you
need to provide in your test so that it
waits for ten seconds if it is a file it
waits for five seconds so you might be
wondered or what is this manage timeout
and all this so as I said if you want to
know the things from the scratch level
explaining each and every topic you
should either know it before or you
should complete or you can go through my
course okay so that deep discount link
is provided in the description before
from this video so please go through a
description which is under this video to
get that discount link if you want to
enroll in this tutorial and understand
each and every concept practically with
real time examples now for example for
this implicit wait we have
a clear section which completely talks
about how this weight mechanism works
and what kind of you know examples in
real time we face you see this
synchronization uses in
selenium-webdriver
and here we have clearly discussed what
is implicit weight and explain with real
time scenario and we have practice
examples also on that implicit weight so
there I have clearly explained about
each and every component of this so as
we are just dealing with interview
questions here I am just first frying
the step which is necessary and of
course one more fantastic and
interesting question out there what is
difference between implicit and explicit
so you know about implicit so when you
come to explicit so as I said if page or
link or any text box is not displayed it
waits for some time but there is one
color print section just assume there is
one colorant section in our application
where it is taking two minutes to load
or let's say it's a records table of
records so there are thousand records in
one table to load all the thousand
records it's taking around 150 seconds
or two minutes okay but you are implicit
wait you have defined only five seconds
here so if you thought that okay I'll go
and make it 120 seconds so that my
implicit will catch it but if you do
like that you have performance of test
is coming down you are not only waiting
120 seconds for this table if for each
and every object if it is not displayed
by chance you are forcing to wait for
120 seconds okay that object might
display in 3 seconds but let's assume
that there is some failure in your test
a real failure ok but that failure in
that test can be decided in the 3
seconds so that's why you have implicit
rate of 5 seconds but just because of
this table loading which is taking two
minutes if you mess you are implicit
global implicit wait so for every link
it will wait
two minutes but your client told that
just after fifty second you can close
this test by failure why you are waiting
two minutes then you might simply are
blindly answer that just because of this
table okay so because of one section or
one component you cannot miss and
increase the performance or increase you
know time of your execution right so
that's why to target the specific SPECT
sections which take maximum time we use
explicit wait okay so this explicit wait
targets on specific objects instead of
globally to each and every object in the
test case now this implicit wait
whatever you define it applicable to
each and every step of the test case so
that's why we write this in the
beginning of our test but whereas
explicit wait it targets only the
specific object which we have felt that
it may take some much time so we can
give provide explicit rate with the two
minutes time here and this scope of this
explicit wait dies after this object is
completed so in this way we are only
targeting this particular section for
this minutes and remaining again we are
sticking to five minutes so that's why
when people say to develop a good
framework on selenium implicit and
explicit both come combined Latian it
should be used okay so I saw some blocks
people asking to use only explicit and I
saw some profs people asked to use only
implicit but as per my 13 years of
experience both implicit and explicit
wait should be used together to develop
a robust test case for selenium okay so
that you need to keep in the mind and as
I said I have clearly explained on how
to define explicit wait on selenium and
what are the coding steps have to be
done so everything you will be learnt in
this practice examples and real time
scenarios and the court all over in the
synchronization section if you are
already aware this will help you to
refresh your memory and prepare for
interview if you have not aware how this
works
please we can go through this or you can
go through anything tutorial available
for you okay nothing force right next in
how many ways we can handle frames in an
application right so there are frames in
every application wherever it's
applicable it's not that in every
application so whenever you come
encounter frames in your application so
you should come up with strategy to
handle that okay maybe if you are
already aware or if you have gone
through this frames concept in selenium
you might be understanding why I am
giving this interview question now
because frames handling is little bit
tricky in entire selenium course it's
not a direct way we have to switch to
their frames to handle it okay to just
give you overview a frames are something
which built top over on your application
selenium cannot handle frames directly
okay so on frames you define multiple
objects buttons whatever objects you can
put in that but to handle any object on
frame you have to write some specific
code to switch from your browser mode to
frame mode you can do that with driver
dot switch through dot frame if it is a
web browser component you can directly
automate it but if those web objects are
present on frame sitting on the
application then you need to write this
step to switch your browser from driver
mode to frame mode once you reach this
frame mode you can actually automate any
object there but how to switch to the
frame so here inside this you have to
pass frame ID so that it switches to
that specific frame now for example in
an application there could be multiple
frames so how do you tell specifically
to your selenium test to go to this
specific frame what you are interested
ok you
cannot go by default right so you should
tell give that knowledge to that frame
which frame it should navigate to
automate so you can give the knowledge
with the help of ID of the frame okay so
that's why the question it says in how
many ways we can handle frames in an
application you can pass either frame ID
let me write the details here or you can
pass the frame name or you can pass
frame web element these are the three
parameters which help you to identify
frame uniquely so how to get ID of the
frame how to get name and how to get
frame element that's again a complete
explanation of that frame tutorial okay
so here at this point as interview point
of view I can only tell in how many ways
you can actually switch to that frame so
these are the three different ways you
can use but most commonly ID will be
given by the developer if not you can
ask your developer to assign an ID to
this frame so that you can comfortably
switch to that frame mode with the ID
provided and you can automate the things
okay so if you want to learn more on
this we have a complete section on
frames which talks about a what is frame
and how to get objects of it and you see
that techniques to automate eye frames
as well okay you have here how to handle
frames frame statements real time
examples and some coding examples in the
form of interview questions so there you
will understand how to get all these
things alright next go to handle third
child window good question
so you open a browser you click on a
link which open a second window and you
click on again it will take link on
second window it opens a third window
now you want to automate third window by
default
selenium will be only on the first
window which it opens selenium will be
on first window but with simple clicks
with your automation script third child
window is open and you want to automate
that how do you tell through your
selenium to go from first child window
to the third child window
that's an interesting right so for that
in selenium there is a concept called
driver dot get window handles this will
actually get totally how many windows
opened by selenium that count it will
give you the complete count with the
window IDs so that you will carefully
take into the set okay set stores all
the list and you will write like this
something search strength some s equals
to you can take that into s object so
once I have taken entire set now let me
explain you this set data structure with
neat diagram just on high level to just
get overview on how it works
so basically gate window handles gets
you three window IDs because three are
opened when you have done that operation
here we are assuming that it could be
three two or four
so whenever some windows are open in our
case assuming three are open and when we
get window handles and stored this in a
set object so internally it's stored
like this so let me take a box yeah so
here
so this is my first index second index
and third index so this is 0th index
first and second so the first base
window will get stored in this zeroth
box and the second one will get stored
in the first box and third one will get
stored in the second box this is how
they got stored in our set data
structure box okay so let me write that
number this is 0 3 in the first window
second window all right now we need to
extract all these right to extract all
these we use a concept called iterator
okay with the help of iterator we were
able to move to each and every box of
this and perform the operation okay now
to move to each and every box there is a
class in Java called s dot iterator okay
so once you assign this set data
structure to iterator so this will help
you to move each and every index of that
box which we have seen now okay when you
say I T dot and next the control will go
to the 0th index of that set box okay
and when you say i t dot the mixed again
then control will move to the first
index of s data structure and again so
if you want to keep on moving
you have to use I T dot next so if you
use five times I T dot next at the fifth
one the control will be on that fifth
index now actually we want to get the
window ID of the third because we were
asked adhere to write a code to handle
the third child window so first we need
to grab the window ID of the third child
so that we can switch from our base
window to third child window so when you
write this step clearly so that means at
this step you have actually
the third child window okay so you can
simply take this window ID into the
string string window id third just a
variable like this now you have a window
ID with you right so from your base
driver you can say driver dot so which 2
dot window and provide this window third
ID that's all with this you will be
successfully moved from your base window
to third child window so after this step
whatever steps you perform through
automation that will focus on third
window only okay by default
selenium will not focus on different
windows whatever the window it invoked
initially when we ran a script focus
will be always on that base window but
if you want to based open some key
clicks somehow third window ID is open
and in unit to work on it in that case
you have to write all these steps to
navigate your selenium browse driver
object from your base to the third
window and now whatever steps you right
after this code will be executed on the
third child window okay so I am just
telling you this on high level we have
clearly seen examples in our course by
taking Gmail example and how does it
works okay there I have spoke about one
are explaining this child window handle
concept okay so now as interval point of
view I'm just giving you a brief
information and recap of what you have
lengths so the main core logic lies here
is on get window handles this is a
method to get IDs of all the windows
once you got those the way to actually
pull out the third index ID is with this
steps iterator once you get ID you will
simply pass this step this is basically
collections of java concept java
collections if you are aware of java
collections you will understand what is
iterator and
so if you are not aware of kochava and
if you want to learn it from scratch
level which is required for automation
so I have put a dedicated section tool
in Java you can come there and lend
complete code Java and collection server
and master this selenium tutorial with
the help of you know complete java
concepts so for that you actually have
here yeah this is like Java
oops basics for selenium which is fine
enough are straining not a simple thing
and I have also included collections API
which is advanced Java and here you will
clearly see the lectures for
implementation of set interface which we
just spoke ok so right now I have
described this on high level but when
you go to that lecture I have clearly
explained how to handle set hash set map
hash map and difference between hash map
and hash table and some practice
exercises which were lost in Amazon so
all these were clearly included in the
Java section so though you are not aware
of Java you need not worry because I
have clearly explained it so you can get
this course learn the core Java and do
all these things on your fingertips
ok so that's about handling the code and
third child window and next how to
handle HTTP certifications so let's say
if you want to handle history peer
certifications in chrome browser there
is a core which you get with the decide
capability I already have it here
I'll just place it for you so that you
can be aware and refresh your memory for
that yeah I'll place it here so if you
are interested in taking my course you
can get the link from my description in
the below youtube video with a deep
discount link and that's why already for
few days only just grab that immediately
and get mastered in this store right so
if you want to handle HTTP certification
so what is it and when you hit any link
in the browser sometimes you will get
some SSL certificate or HTTPS saying
this is having security thread do you
want to proceed anyway something like
that if you get like this if you provide
this accept SSL certificate capability
to your browser then it actually no
handles it internally and make you to
navigate to your desired page okay so
this is the capability you need to set
capability type dot except SSL
Certificates and put it to the true so
that we are telling in our test that
whatever SSL Certificates you are coming
through
accept them and proceed further so this
will actually solve your tricky thing
and this is one of the famous interview
question as well
so how do you handle history TPS okay so
when you think about selenium you might
be thinking some basic things like you
know XPath CSS our how to handle a link
and all but when you go to interviews
they will test to you our application
knowledge on how well you have used
selenium in your real time so that's why
questions will be like what is exact
difference between get and navigate
generally speaking
the difference is almost you know both
works in a similar fashion the guy who
have deep knowledge on selenium ApS can
only understand the exact difference
between get and navigate and if the same
thing quit and close if you ask anyone
who have a basic experience on selenium
the answer you get from them is to it
and close closes the browser both the
same thing then what is the exact
difference at the same time with getting
navigate and what is implicit rate
explicit wait when do you use it so all
these are some practical questions which
you face in your interviews because
these questions will tell how good you
are in your real time knowledge on
selenium so that's why if you
concentrate on these questions then
whatever question if they ask if it's
the basic you have can you can handle
but if it is something tricky like that
this video will really help you to crack
all those questions okay
and how to handle the third window and
asking the base window questions is
common but if you are able to answer the
window which is a third one and how do
you iterate through everything and that
will help you to excel yourself in
interview and the same time this history
TPS certifications so you will get the
scenario very rare when you automate but
when you come across how do you handle
it so that's where intervenes need to
know okay common questions common
scenarios common examples everyone can
answer by just going through some
tutorials are having some basic
experience but these kind of questions
can be answered only if you have some to
3ei it's real time experience so based
upon all these observations I have
prepared this document now one pretty
straightforward question how many types
of locators are there in webdriver so
generally people you stick to XPath or
CSS but if you are asked to list out the
complete locator list you should be able
to do that right so what are those
we have XPath CSS ID class name and link
link text even with link text you can
identify what else we have okay so these
five are the main locators we generally
use to get solved in the webdriver so
for you to get no I mean type of
locators just go to your editor and say
driver dot and see how many find
elements you get you get find element by
ID by class name XPath CSS link text and
name and there is one more attribute
look locate a call name attribute so all
these six locators can be used to
identify objects on selenium web browser
okay
so that you need to remember and it's
pretty straightforward but you know real
real challenge comes when people ask you
to list down everything so you should be
able to list down all the objects
present to identify now syntax for XPath
and CSS if ID in tags are given so to
write an XPath
when Heidi and tag is given Xbox syntax
will be like slash slash tag name at the
rate ID equals to value of that ID so
this is a syntax for XPath so if you
want to write CSS syntax based upon ID
and tag name so you can write that with
you need not give slash slash gear you
can simply give a tag name and pass at
ID equals to value so here you are
actually skipping this at the rate and
slash slash in CSS you need not give so
this is the main difference you need to
figure out when you are asked for to
give a syntax for XPath and CSS this
could be ID or it could be any attribute
place that I attribute here okay and tag
name should be always come in the
beginning and the attribute to whatever
you are given place it and attributes
value okay both looks little same but
you need not write this at the rate and
slash slash when you write for CSS okay
so more about experts and CSS we have
talked and much deliberately in our
lectures if you come through here so
it's not an easy to write x percent CSS
if you learn that then 50 percent of
selenium is done so that's why two hours
11 minutes I just spoke on this locators
you can see that importance of locators
ID name class name how to identify them
in Chrome Firefox and generating
customized XPath CSS practice exercises
cheat sheets the lot of things discussed
on this XPath and CSS okay I recommend
you to complete this section and then
come back and you see the confidence
level you get if you want to automate
any object by taking the that
particularly loquacious that could be
any flow cater supported by selenium
okay so if you are already washed this
section this answer is like cakewalk for
you even before I start writing in the
word
you can finish it off okay so next
question how to use contains regular
expression in XPath so what is a
contains and why do we need to use that
now in XPath attributes so one part of
the attribute may varies okay
based upon that could be dynamic so
every time when you refresh the browser
ID name may change so first time I did
name maybe use 0 1 2 and second time it
may be use 0 3 for you 0 so like this if
you feel that part of that attribute is
keep on changing every time when you
load your browser then at that time you
should come up with a neat XPath to make
sure you are actually handling that
dynamic thing okay so for that reason we
would use a regular expression here
slash slash tag name and here you say
contains so if you are clear of what is
ID exact value you can write like this
but in this case you are not aware of
that the part of it is changing right
that's why we say contains just go and
check if it contains you 0 okay so what
is this expert now so here the
difference between previous XPath and
this is we are actually directly
matching equals 2 but here we are saying
that the ID which I am going to check
have you 0 identify that ok if I put 1 2
tomorrow the object last two digits are
keep on changing every time and script
is failing but now script will never
fail because we are trying to identify
with ID which contains you 0 text so
user a text is always static and it
never changes and whenever you run the
script it will directly come and
identify this ID ok because we are only
asking to check you 0 yesterday it is
there today it is there tomorrow also it
is there every day you 0 is always there
so this script will run
every day when you give this XPath so
this expert may say it has the regular
expressions if you have some dynamic
attributes in your code so you cannot
simply write like this so when dynamic
attributes are given you should have
some regular expression mechanism to
create locators so that regular
expression you can do with the help of
contents so this is one example like
this you have many regular expressions
for X path like contains starts with
ends with and star so many things we can
talk about this regular expressions now
for example if you see the question
number 11 interview how to use regular
expression for CSS so this is the way
you can write and show 4x but what about
CSS okay no one will ask you write a
simple CSS expression that's a common
thing you have to write a regular
expression CSS when there is a
dynamically changing attribute so here
it's very simple syntax compared to X
per tag name and you will say ID star
equals to u 0 here instead of contains
keyword we will put star star stands for
it matches u 0 that's all
same contains in CSS when you are
representing thing you will put star
that's all you see that how cool it is
and now you will identify this ID even
any day every day but if this changes
like this use instead of U 0 if it is
like you a then script will fail isn't
it so that's why whenever you see some
object is dynamic first figure out which
part of it is static so that is the
challenging part you have to figure out
which is static and which is dynamic
that static part only you have to use in
your regular expressions ok in that case
use only you because only you is
changing starting everything else
changing that's why you will put u if u
also changes then this is not a right
attribute to use for your xbox ok take
another attribute
so there are a lot of attributes
available for you to create XPath not
only ID you can use class name you can
use type whatever attribute it is
defined now for example let me show you
here
so having coupon right click inspect ok
so once again okay so for this class is
an attribute defined for it
so there is not mandatory that ID is the
only attribute you should be used every
time it depends upon developer on what
particular attributes he defined for
that
so now for the have a coupon link there
is a class attribute here which is the
radium coupon pointer so you can
comfortably use class attribute here and
place it in the place of ID okay so
that's about how you define regular
expressions for CSS and XPath so as I
said if you come down here this is most
and most important topic so if you are
able to grab all these locators then as
I said 50% of selenium is done so I
would request you to go through each and
every lecture and complete all my
practice exercises so after this section
I have included 15 power interview
questions which are different from what
I am showing in my word document and
here it have how to identify siblings
nodes with XPath identifying objects and
how to identify text drips and takes the
lots of topics discussed in identifying
experts and CSS in this video I can
restrict myself to show only a direct
answer to the question which is given
here okay so if you ask me to talk about
this I talk at least three hours on the
six paths in CSS which I already given
in my complete comprehensive course okay
so if you are already aware then you can
skip it and just get with this interview
questions all right
what is the class available in selenium
to handle drop notes select select is
the class used and selenium to handle
the table notes I hope you guys are
aware as you are having basic knowledge
on selenium
okay so this class will help you to
identify drop down options not only a
single drop down you can also have multi
drop downs right even that case select
class help you to do that
and these are pretty straightforward
questions from here what is the method
to check if checkbox is selected now for
example checkbox is selected by default
in your application but from selenium
you need to verify if it is selected or
not what is the method so you can simply
write driver dot find element and
provide the locator maybe XPath or CSS
and at the end dot is selected this is
the method so II selected is a method
which will return true if checkbox is
also already selected it written false
if checkbox is not selected so this is a
tricky part here and this is also
commonly asked because this is the
validation part right how do you tell if
the checkbox is selected or not and the
key is selected it will do so how to
validate if element is visible or hidden
in webpages good question so you have an
element in a page but that is on hidden
mode okay now for example when you put
flight booking when you select round
trip of to destination everything is a
sprint but when you select one-way some
parts of it will be hidden if not you
can just try so within some button
activities you can make visible are
invisible so that part you have in every
web page but how do you check from your
selenium if object is in hidden mode or
not
so that can be checked with the help of
ease displayed method okay so again you
have to put same drive on driver dot
find element provides the locator what
you are interesting to do and
is displayed we'll check if this element
the locator is hidden mode or not if it
is displayed it returns true if it is
hidden it will return false so based
upon that you can put condition or a
session all right
so next question how to get count of
similar objects list in the webpage
okay now let's assume that there is a
class name called ABC like this there
are fifteen classes in my web page with
the same class name so how do you get
the count of how many class names are
present on a page with the same name
that is required for you that's required
when you want to automate something
which is common across multiple sections
okay so this part we have clearly done
in our practice exercises yeah in
real-time exercises into an programming
I have clearly talked about getting
count of links in the pages section and
dynamic links handling calendar handling
all those we have discussed this point
so just I want to give you a heads up
with a straight forward interview answer
here so when you have multiple objects
with it is same class name or same ID if
you want to get count on how many they
have you have driver dot find elements
you use a plural here so here we are
saying go and find all the elements with
class name which is ABC I am just giving
some dummy thing and dot size the size
method will actually give the count of
class names with ABC okay and make sure
you write plural here because we are
checking for multiple things so here all
we use a single singular because we are
just checking if it is displayed or if
it is selected but here we are checking
multiple class names right so that's why
you have to use final
okay so this is used when you want to
loop something now let's assume that
there are five tables and each table
have same class name now when you give
like this total five table references
will be with you and now you can put a
for loop and now in each table you can
work on it okay with this condition so
as I said we have discussed already this
if you are already having knowledge on
selenium by this time you may be
refreshed your memory if not please
watch this section where you will get
clearer picture okay now importance of
desired capabilities so desired
capabilities is also frequently seen in
these days in selenium so if you scroll
up there is a desired capability
discussed here
so basically desired capabilities the
class which describes the browser or OS
and its properties now these are
capabilities described a chrome browser
and it also told how does Chrome should
react if you see that these are
capabilities dot chrome it thrown into
cap object with cap desired capability
object we are setting chrome behavior
that it should accept SSL Certificates
so all these browser properties browser
behavior so all these can be set with
the help of desired capabilities object
okay when you have a browser and you
have to tweak the browser with some
multiple properties and then you use
this desired capabilities okay not only
this you can also define OS properties
so basically we use this when we talk
about selenium grid okay so you know
what is selenium grid selenium grid is
to run test parallely and multiple
machines are parallely of sequentially
you can distribute your tests into
multiple tests for example if you have
some 100 test cases I'll also include
selenium grid here if you have 100 test
cases but with you there is only one
machine right if you want to execute
hundred in your one machine step-by-step
it takes a lot of time but you can
distribute these hundred test cases with
across ten or fifteen whatever number
you have if you have company I have some
15 machines you can distribute some set
of tests to each 15 missions by
controlling from your local machine so
that's the excellent feature you have
that a selenium turret so in this very
execution is little fast right when you
are distributing the test 10 tests will
run in one bra one system 10 another 10
another like in 15 tests 15 systems you
distributed 150 test cases in all to get
together and that distribution and
triggering you will do it from your
local system you know that all can be
done with the help of selenium grid and
when there is an interview question for
you and what does selenium grid does you
can say that in this tribute test across
multiple measures when I say multiple
machines that could be multiple
operating systems as well from Windows
you can ask to run on Mac and from Mac
in Isfahan on Linux so instead of
running locally all your tests can be
run on a remote with the help of
selenium grid concept so there we
actually use the desired capabilities to
set the properties of your OS or a
browser ok so that's about decide
capabilities and if you want to learn
more about selenium grid you have a
section here cross-browser testing with
selenium grid you can clearly learn all
this concepts here alright so how to
enter text in caps lock good question so
if you are aware of actions class in
Java actions class is used to do all
these kind of operations so with that
you will be able to enter the text in
caps lock let me write the step maybe
you can use it for reference with you so
so you can also do without actions also
simple
step driver Todd find element XPath or
whatever the Edit box where you enter
the text XPath or CSS what all you can
use you can use that and any X both I am
giving random here and dot sendkeys is
actually to enter something on that edit
box so first first parameter passes key
start shift and then give the actual
word whatever you want to type you see
that so if you don't give this first
parameter key start shift it will simply
enter hello in the Edit box whatever you
are expose is redirected okay wherever
it's expose is pointing in that
particular edit box it end us hello but
if you add first parameter as a key
start shift so in general in your
keyboard when you press shift and you
write something it enters in capital
letters right so same thing is
applicable here so T's dot shift will
help you to write h-e-l-l-o in caps so
output of this will be HCl elbow okay
so in this way you will be able to enter
the text in caps lock so next how do
move over onto the web element on page
as I said you need to use actions in the
Java in selenium class actions driver
and then a dot
yeah
this step will actually help you to
mouse over on web element so when I say
mouse over I just don't want to click or
I don't want to do any operation just
moving my cursor on the menu item so
that menu will be displayed right so if
you want to validate whether on moving
your cursor the menus or displaying then
you use this code ok I am NOT going to
explain now everything about actions and
all again that takes a one hour and if I
keep on explaining every topic that's
again a 50 ass course so this is just to
our refresh your memory if you are going
to interview or yeah just to if you have
given a gap in learning selenium then
you can use this to recap everything
whatever you have done ok so this is how
you can use to mouse over and this is
also one of the interesting interview
question you know in recent websites you
need not click on anything you have a
menu on top like this right
so however in our document we just
cannot avoid this but in general if it's
just move your cursor on that menu will
automatically display ok so all our
recent websites are doing that so that's
a reason if you provide this step and
you can verify whether the pop-up is
displaying or not when you move your
cursor alright so in the move to element
you have to pass the XPath ok where
exactly you want to move do remember
this did not it could not be any XPath
it could be anything
locator basically will be XPath CSS ID
class name name link text anything pass
the locator where exactly you have to do
that mouse over all right and next
methods to handle java alert if you want
to handle java alert by default you
cannot do that because you are selenium
script restrict is restricted to browser
only but when you get a java alert
pop-up if you want to switch from
browser to papa just like what have done
for windows and frames you need to do
like this driver dot switch to
this step will actually switch from your
browser mode to Alette
if you want to switch to another window
then you have to use driver dot switch
to window of that window ID which window
you want to switch and you know how to
get ID if you want to switch to frame
then you have to use driver dots mr.
fraim
so totally there are three switches in
selenium frame window and elect so all
these three we have discussed now from
interview point of view how to get links
count in the page good question so how
do you get if there are 100 links in a
page you just want to get a count on one
single step with selenium how to do that
that could be one validation right you
want to verify if all links are present
or if anything is breaking so in general
link every link will have a tag name
with anchor a isn't it so we would
simply say driver dot find element go
and identify with by dot tag name and
it's a and get me the size that's all C
as it is plural thing put find elements
and Here I am saying that go and find
all the elements which you see as an
anchor a as a tag name so if it is a
link obviously it will have anchor a as
a tag name so I am getting all that
count and a dot size I am printing the
size that's all next how to validate if
you are navigated to child window
successfully right so earlier we have
navigated to third child window we have
done this okay so we have switched but
how to confirm if our switch is
successfully done or not this question
is asked I think in Oracle because one
of my student gave me this question so
after you switch how do you confirm
whether your switch is successful for
that you can simply get title of that
window okay when I say title of that
window okay I'll let me show you
here for the are selenium landing page
on udemy you see that selenium webdriver
is a title with Java basics to advance
on interview and this is my Google home
page and this title is Google so like
this whenever you are changing the
windows obviously for each and every
window there will be a title which
belongs to that particular website right
so in this way if you can able to pull
the title you can confirm if you are in
right window so simple answer for this
driver dot get title will give you if
you are landed on right window page so
even this alert boxes sorry which I
forgot to tell you if you want to learn
more about this actions alerts in my
course I know those are again very
important topics so you have like
section here you see that actions class
real time handling Mouse interactions
you can learn it from here and windows I
already spoke you right and frames which
you can learn it from there and Java
alerts so that you can learn actually
from here yeah Piper for its present and
methods to handle them handling Java
alerts using webdriver API a let's code
download and how to validate the alerts
for the web elements you see that all
the concepts and when I said a select
class is used for dropdowns
you can sit here handling static
drop-down with select API handling
dynamic dropdowns there are different
dynamic type of dropdowns right some
towns where you enter something and
automatically options will populate
those are dynamics and how do you handle
checkboxes radio buttons everything is
completely present in this course and
you see this is one of the best seller
course in entire udemy platform and
right now when I make this video i have
31,000 students with a 4.5 out of 5 by
the time you are watching this video
that could be the biggest number okay
and as I said we have 45 hours of
content which explains everything from
scratch level
all right so I'm just shown a reference
with if you want to refer it and if you
are already member of my course you can
just refer each and every question with
the practical example in my section so
what is the difference between the
relative and absolute XPath when you say
absolute XPath it starts from the body
HTML body from this level from the first
HTML body tag to and navigates to actual
element okay so you have to write a path
from this level if you actually inspect
and if someone asks you to write XPath
you have to start it from this level
body level and you have to traverse all
the way to reach this point that way of
writing XPath is an absolute and if you
want to write relative instead of
traversing from the body you will be
directly navigated to that particular
section span had to cut if you directly
write an XPath which jumps to this then
it isn't relative if you want to
traverse it from the woods and that is
absolute and please remember this and
and sometimes interview may ask write an
absolute XPath our writer later XPath
then you should be first of all able to
explain the difference between them to
him how from where you have to write
absolute or relating and again knowing
of writing absolute and relative is a
big topic you have to study a lot to get
that
so here I actually explained in fifteen
powerful interview questions where
difference between the later and XPath
and practical examples and how to define
an XPath so all these you have here ok
so here I am just describing just a
definition yeah this is so simple right
from if you want to write X pass from
parent to child
slash slash parent slash and it's child
this is a pretty straightforward way and
I don't think this question will be
simply asked for you an interview and
cool this is the latest trending
questions what driver is must to run in
tests in Firefox driver gecko driver
without gecko driver you cannot run your
test cases in Firefox browser from the
version 50 sorry from 43 from version 43
you have to use Kiko driver to run your
test so this is a best question to check
if you are updated in the market or not
because till 52 through 42 version there
is no concept called gecko driver which
needed to run this Firefox test on
selenium and recently I have conducted
an interview and one of the guy answered
this question saying you need not need
anyone maybe he have recapped this
tutorial two years back and he have not
updated himself so in the recent
versions you need this driver
similarly for Chrome browser to run test
in Firefox browser is a good text if you
want to run your test in Chrome browser
you need to use your own driver okay
this is again one dot both are dot exe
files which you need to download and
which you need to use to invoke your
execution so if you want to quickly
recap and relate that interview question
with your lecture and you will see it
here how to run test in Google Chrome
and latest version configuration changes
and here you will see about a gecko
driver okay yeah how do you set driver
in Firefox and Chrome drivers in the
previous questions we have seen these
are the drivers but how do you set those
drivers in your script you set those
with the system dot set property
we're driver if it is a chrome driver
and here path to Chrome driver basically
it's a dot exe file you have to pass
this path in the second argument
similarly if you want to use for gecko
driver you can put webdriver
dot gecko driver and pass the path to
gecko driver and this is of course a
common step you need if you want to run
any selenium test and I get I hope you
guys are aware of it right and what is
the difference between find element and
find elements so as I said find elements
is for finding an object uniquely on the
page where find elements is used if you
want to collect the similar behavior
from multiple objects so this scenario
we have already seen here multiple times
if you want to get total links count to
use find elements or if you want to just
or identify or work on single object you
use only find element a singular word
okay that that clearly tells the
difference between these two and list
out any two methods available in
explicit weight you can answer this
question only if you work on this real
time because there are lot of methods
defined in explicit weight so if you
someone asked you to quickly come out of
these methods you should be able to tell
so better go and check what are the
methods available for you on explicit
weight so here to answer this question I
can give you the two main methods which
commonly used for explicit which are
visibility of element locator and
presence of element located so that
means this script will wait until
element is invisible mode and here this
also looks similar but even if it is not
visible or invisible world if element is
loaded in that down
fine or you can say wait for
invisibility of element in this ability
all these are methods available element
located in explicit wait so I hope you
have guys have used all this so this
actually will wait till the element is
visible this will wait until element
becomes invisible now for example you
clicked on a button which will actually
make and link our edit box invisible so
that invisible may not happen instantly
it may happen after one or two seconds
after clicking on that button ok so in
this case you write explicit wait and
tell wait until invisibility of element
happened for three or four seconds so
selenium will wait for 4 seconds and
then checks if invisibility happened or
not ok so in this way these methods are
you know commonly used if you are
working with explicit wait and next
question how to take screenshots with
webdriver so it's a four lines of code
which you need to put on your test
I clearly explained this in my course
because explaining each and every
component of screenshot step is little
bit tricky and I have taken enough care
in my lectures let me show you where
exactly I handle this yeah practical
problems and methods to handle here yeah
here I discussed frames part famous
interview questions yeah how to take
screenshots in selenium and SSL
certification code and practice
exercises ok so please watch that
section I will however I put the code
here I don't insist to buy the course
right so I will put the entire screen
shot code and you can refresh your
memory or you can use that when you want
to attend an interval let me paste it
here yeah so this is a code to actually
take a screenshot and selenium the last
step how to hit enter in from webdriver
commands cool so instead of mouse clicks
now I just want to hit an enter how do
you do that so there is an edit box
we're driver dot find element by dot any
locator you can pass so once you pass a
locator and send keys we generally enter
a text right instead of text you can
simply write keys dot enter for this and
in that particular locator where exactly
you want to hit enter
it does that okay so that's how it hits
a enter with a send keys method so
alright so that's art pretty common
questions you get and whenever you go
for selenium interview okay it's for
only selenium tool there is still more
about framework interview questions and
core Java interview questions so as I
said in the beginning whenever you go
for an automation interview you might
expect questions from selenium tool and
questions from framework and questions
from core java if you are clear now this
three you can correct any interview and
this part one focus only on selenium
tool interview questions and as I said I
have tried to explain a high level
answers for all these which you can
simply tell it at your interview but in
the back end if you want to understand
the real concept behind it with
practical examples then I recommend you
to go through my tutorial which will
help you to understand everything from
scratch level so in this tutorial I did
not assume that students have any
predict fest knowledge everything is
taken care from the scratch level and by
end of this course you can automate any
website any real-time web site across
web world and with a lot of frameworks
and kochava knowledge not only the
selenium knowledge and if you come down
there are lots of sections on framework
you see that part one two three four
five there are totally eight parts of
framework and at the end we are building
the framework from the scratch level
with proper agenda okay so you can get
complete knowledge to clear all your
three rounds of into
view with the help of my course you can
get the discount link from the you video
description link where you can check out
and buy the course and get all these
answers not only a high level as per
this video but with the real-time coding
examples okay all the best and in the
next video let's discuss about a
framework interview questions in our
part 2 thanks guys thanks for your time
