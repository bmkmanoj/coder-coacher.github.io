design specifically player choice now
I'm sure you've heard about player
choice and logically you know player
choice is important what do we mean by
player choice basically the player has
more than one option more than one thing
that they can do do you move left or do
you move right do you jump or do you not
jump do you go to the left corridor or
the right corridor
so there's choice that's wrapped up and
weaved throughout all games and if you
read a game design book they'll say
player choice is very important that's
cool but let's talk a little bit more
about the where and the how and and how
many of player choice so that if you're
working on a game at the moment or you
have a game idea you know that you can
put in some fairly simple changes or
fairly simple design rules into your
game and it can be a stronger game how
people like it have that downloaded more
have them play it more and say yeah this
game is fantastic so that's what we're
doing in this conversation the first
thing that I believe and I've seen and
I've seen in games work well and games
I've made work very well is you want to
have player choice at multiple levels of
your game so the examples I was giving
before if you can run left or run right
that's cool that's player choice in the
split second of the controlling of your
character that's very good choice very
important there and that's at the low
level and then you have a level higher
so I can run left or run right but if I
run left I can see that mate has me
leave the room if I run right I see that
has me run further into the room so I'm
having a as a player I'm looking at it
saying well why would I run left and why
would I run right what's the benefits
and if you present the player the
information of well here's a clue about
left and a clue about right then it
gives the choice more meaning is very
important to have meaningful choices
where the player has a little bit of
information about what it means to run
left or what it means to run right if
it's two exactly identical doors and one
on the left one on the right you know
which door do you go from as well it
doesn't really matter people won't feel
invested in that choice but if there's a
red door and a blue door Oh which one's
is the red one the evil door no maybe
that's trying to trick me so giving the
player some information even
it's just colors or or lighting or sound
or some text that you've put on the
screen some way to give them that okay
and continuing upper-level it might be
will when I level up my character I'm
gonna have extra experience that I put
into my stats do I want to put that in a
strength or put that into dexterity is
it better to hit harder or to fire my
bow and arrow more often and you know is
it better for me to have a sword and
have a bow and arrow so leveling out the
next level and when you finish a level
you want to go and do this what level or
do you want to go off and do the castle
level so at each step of the process you
give the player choice so they're not
just sitting there saying well I'll just
I'll just follow this game as its gonna
leave me because if you play your game
with no choice in my opinion that's a
that's watching a movie if you're
playing your game with no choice okay
that's the first part of it choice at
every level in every moment in every
second if your players gone longer than
say 20 seconds without making a choice
then that's an opportunity for you to go
and say what is the choice that I can
have them make in this moment the second
thing is I believe the best choices for
the player to have between two and five
options so if you've got should I run
left or run lot right or run through the
middle or run to the far left or under
the far right if you get many more than
five of those the it becomes meaningless
it's like walking into a supermarket and
seeing 50 brands or 50 options for pasta
sauce that's the classic example in
having too much choice it's like well
all of these choices I don't know which
one and whichever one I choose is gonna
be the wrong one because there's so many
others so you want to give the player a
finite or a smallish amount of options
so they still have to think about it and
not have them way too many if you're
setting up for players to choose what
weapon they have it's good to give them
between two to five weapons if you're
giving the opportunity of ammunition
have put inside that weapon two to five
options so if you follow this two to
five rule throughout your entire game
you have players being very engaged and
very interested in what's going on now
if you're making a mobile app you know
well my game is very simple Rick it's
just a simple mobile app where you just
have to bounce from here to here still
ask yourself what's the choice the
choice could be when do you draw
and you give the player some information
that sometimes might be better to jump
than other times and sometimes if you
jump early you get a certain output and
if you jump early other times you get a
different output so it can still be a
single input by the player but they
think about what in this moment when
should I do that and other times it's a
choice of do a jump or not jump so don't
just make a game where society on to get
over the obstacle jump to go the
obstacle you could ask yourself why is
the player doing that in the moment and
how can I give them choice with which to
do that and then to wrap it all together
in a system I've mentioned this a little
bit make sure you give the player enough
information that they feel invested in
the choice so that is meaningful and
then you give them feedback or
information about what the result of
that was so if they choose left corridor
/ right corridor you might want to say
to them great choice or Oh or now we're
in trouble or you chose the difficult
path so that they know the thing that I
did had a consequence if you're playing
the jumping game and someone chooses to
do a big jump then you can have the
voice over say wow instead of just
having it I did a jump you want to have
the player invested in their choices and
feel that they did something that the
game recognized so it's just a quick
conversation about player choice we try
to weave that throughout all of our
projects that we work on or when we're
teaching you guys in our courses we try
to look at how can you take this this
framework that we've created and add
your own choice to it your own
differentiation so you can take it left
or right yourself and build upon what
we've done to give players really
interesting experiences and really
interesting choices in the games that
you create so thanks for watching and I
look forward to seeing you guys on one
of our courses sometime soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
