very first java application we're going
to make an application called hello
world now in computing terms it's been a
tradition for the very first program you
create in a new language to get the
computer to print out a message that
simply says hello world nothing more
nothing less so the idea is just to
really show you some basics of that
language so what I'm going to do I'm
going to click on create a new project
this brings up a rather intimidating
looking screen but it isn't as bad as it
looks now depending on the edition of
IntelliJ that you're running whether
you're running the Ultimate Edition like
I am or whether you're running the
Community Edition you will see there's
different options here to the left hand
side now because I'm running the
Ultimate Edition and this is the paid
version of IntelliJ the JetBrains people
with the makers of IntelliJ give you a
lot more options but you don't need to
worry about this whether you're running
the Ultimate Edition all running the
Community Edition just make sure you
click on Java to the top left-hand
corner like so now you should also have
a project SDK showing there and it
should say something like 1.8 maybe a
future maybe a different number but
that's ok it will still work and if you
haven't got one refer back to the SDK
the Java development kit installation
video and I actually went through and
showed you how to install a Java
development kit now if you're sure
you've done that and this is not showing
go back and check out the IntelliJ
installation video because right at the
end of that video I go through and show
you how to finish off this setup of the
project SDK and that involves telling
IntelliJ where to find the new Java
development kit again make sure Java is
selected leave everything else
unselected there we don't need to click
on anything click on next now you'll see
this option create project from template
I'm going to leave that unchecked
because we want to create a brand new
project from scratch I'm going to click
on next
next it's asking you for the project
name and also the project location
project name is self-explanatory we're
going to call that one hello world now
I've typed it on the screen with spaces
but I actually don't recommend you type
spaces for a project name you want to
type in whatever it is and you can use
upper and lowercase freely but don't put
any spaces in there and that's because
often depending on your operating system
you can run into difficulties with
spaces in path names so I suggest you
leave that like so so I'm calling this
one hello world topped it correctly this
time and if you click on more settings
down the bottom you get some other
options and it gives you things like the
content route the project format and the
module file location we don't need to
worry about any of that at this stage we
can just stick to the basics which was
the project name hello world and the
project location I'm going to change
this location to another location though
and because this is my first java
application on this computer you can see
i've got a project location and that's
because i've been creating a java
application for another one of my
courses i don't want to put my source
code in there what i want to do is i
want to click on this button over here
to the right and i want to navigate to a
new folder and i want to create a new
folder that's going to contain all the
java code that we'll be using for this
course so to make it simple i'm just
going to click on desktop and i'm going
to quick click on new folder and i'm
going to type in java programs and click
on create and that's going to be the
folder that i'm going to store all my
java code in i'm going to click on
choose and you can see it's now updated
and it's actually updated to point to
that path but what it's done at the
moment is it's only given me the name of
the main folder in fact what i want to
do is create a sub folder that contains
each project so that if i've got two
projects they've each got their own
folder in java programs so what i'm
going to do is click on again to the
right here and i'm going to click on new
folder and i'm going to type in the hole
world and that's going to be the folder
that contains our first application so
you can see now that the project name is
hello world the location is now users in
my case dev desktop Java programs hello
world so it's got its own folder and the
project name is going to be hello world
that's stored in that folder now you may
have if you're running on Windows you'll
see that this folder location will be a
little bit different you probably have
something like C colon backslash you
know users slash and whatever your user
name is and then perhaps a link to the
Documents folder you'll just need to
navigate to a folder that you'll
remember that where these files will be
depending on your operating system but
that's where my own are going to be so
I'm now going to click on finish so
what's happening now is the IntelliJ
editor is now creating a folder in that
directory and it's containing the base
files that we'll be using for our
application now before we get started I
just want to point out the tip of the
day this is a little box that comes up
every time you first start up IntelliJ
and you can turn these tips off because
that's what they are they're tips for
the day and I suggest you leave it on
and actually read some of these because
it gives you some really clever
shortcuts and it gives you an overview
of some of the features that are
included with IntelliJ definitely worth
your time to read some of these and you
can click on next
to go through and read what some of the
other tips are and again it's just a
great way for finding at some of the
capabilities that the IntelliJ IDEA
product has got to really save you a lot
of time when it comes to development I'm
going to click on close and I'm going to
leave the tips on but if for some reason
you didn't want the tips to show just
click on the check box so what we're
going to do now is click on this little
button down here to the left which is
called on a Mac a disclosure triangle
but in any event you'll click that and
it just opens up as you can see and I'm
gonna click here where it says SRC which
is abbreviation of the source and what
that is is the location where we'll be
putting our Java source code so I'm
gonna right click that now you notice
when I click it I get what is a huge
menu of options and believe it or not
down the track once you've had a bit of
experience with Java a lot of these will
make a lot more sense to you right now I
can see that's probably have a whelming
but you don't need to memorize anything
the only thing you need to do is click
on new
and come over here it says Java class
and click on Java class this brings up a
little window and intelligence now
saying what is the name of the class
that you want to create now don't worry
if you don't know what a class is in
later lectures we're going to be going
through in detail explaining what
classes are for now it's good for you
just to follow along and do what I'm
doing and when we get to the stage if
you're needing to know more about class
I'm going to go into that in more detail
that's create one we're just going to
call it hello okay and I'm going to
click on OK now don't be too concerned
about the contents that are on the
screen we're going to go that go through
that in detail in future in future
videos for now let's just get a basic
program up and working in IntelliJ so
that we can actually tick the box that
says we've created our first java
application and we've actually run up
then we press enter on the end of the
first line I'm going to type public
static void putting spaces between them
now as you're typing do make sure you
type in exactly the same case with
exactly the same spelling as you can see
me typing it's very common for new
programmers or people using another
programming language to type things in
to make typing mistakes or to type
things in a different case for example
instead of a lowercase P for the start
of the word public if they typed an
uppercase P you'll get a completely
different result in this case it's
highlighted in red which is saying
there's an error so do make sure you
check your code carefully that you
typing it in exactly as you see me type
it and if you type and if you see
anything like this in red you can just
put your mouse over it and IntelliJ will
normally tell you what the problem is
in this case it's saying cannot resolve
symbol public and that's because the
first letter was typed in uppercase
we're gonna make that lowercase again so
let's finish off our first program so
public static void main with spaces in
between then a regular bracket the word
string with a capital S and I'm going to
put two brackets two square brackets
unless those brackets a little bit
different to the other brackets we've
used and the word arcs I'm going to put
a brace
now the brace is the same character as
the one you see after the word hello
okay now we've done that so now we're
going to type system with a capital S
dot out dot print you know and as I
typed that L you notice that IntelliJ
came up and said oh do you mean print
line' which is an abbreviation for print
line so if you want that and you're
happy with that you just double click
that if you want and you notice how
IntelliJ filled out the rest of the line
for us which is great so what I'm going
to do is go back here to these little
brackets and they're going to type in a
double quote and notice how I topped
only one double quote but IntelliJ added
the boat added button to the second one
automatically and that's because
IntelliJ is saying quite rightly well if
you type one double quote you need to
have a second one to make it valid in
Java so it quite conveniently added that
for you so in those double quotes I'm
going to type hello comma world and I'm
gonna put an exclamation mark after it
so at this point we're now done with our
first Java replication we've created a
valid java application we know that it's
valid because there's no read errors on
the screen we can't see any errors
showing up so the next thing to do is to
actually run the application so how do
we actually get it to do something
because this system dot out dot print
linen or print lines which is an
abbreviation for is meant to display
hello world the message somewhere on the
computer well it turns out that running
in is quite easy you just need to
literally right click that brings up a
menu with a lot of options but the one
you want is run hello dot main so I'm
going to click on that
you know something happened something
happened down the bottom briefly and
there are little windows appeared and
you can now see that we've actually got
a message which says hello world and
it's got processed finished with exit
code zero now we'll be talking more
about what that means in a future video
but the bottom line is you've now
created and successfully run your first
hello world application challenge time
how would you go about modifying the
output to instead of putting hallo world
to put Hello and your name for example
hallo Tim I'm gonna pause the video go
ahead and make that change
so that the output becomes hollow Tim
instead of hollow world or substitute
the word Tim for your name go for it now
and we'll come back shortly and show you
how to do it
welcome back so did you get that going
okay what turns out the change is pretty
easy all we really need to do is we need
to go into here and we can go back and
just delete it as we would be using a
normal word processor I think those
characters out and type in your name
like so and if you want to put an
exclamation mark doing that will
actually display the message hello Tim
but to see that message on the screen
again we need to right-click and click
on run and you can see down the bottom
of the screen we've now got hello Tim so
that's it that's our first very basic
java application in the next video I'm
going to walk you through some other
basic functions within IntelliJ just so
you understand the various parts of the
screen and how to move some of the
windows around depending on the amount
of screen real estate you've got and
just to help you become a little bit
more familiar with IntelliJ so I'll see
you in that next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
