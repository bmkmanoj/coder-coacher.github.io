development teacher over at udemy calm
in this video I want to give you a small
crash course on JavaScript in order to
show you the very fundamentals of the
JavaScript language and Dom manipulation
and if you never programmed a line of
code in your life before then this video
will be perfect for you so let's get
started so in this JavaScript crash
course we will build the functionality
of this extremely simple Bitcoin
calculator okay so in here you can input
the Bitcoin price at a time you bought
so let's say like five thousand dollars
per Bitcoin and then the price as it is
today so let's say like twelve thousand
dollars per Bitcoin if anything new you
say how many you have so let's say five
and it then gives you here the result in
terms of how much US dollars that you
made and the growth so the profit in
percentage okay so everyone is talking
about Bitcoin these days and so I
thought that this would be a fun project
for you to learn the very fundamentals
of JavaScript so we will code this very
simple application in this coding
environment called code pen so instead
of having to download a code editor to
your local computer and create a bunch
of files with HTML CSS and JavaScript
and connect all of these we can write
our code in environment like this and
then everything just works automatically
so instead of having to download in an
editor and to have to write all of these
files of course later when you start
writing your own code you will want to
do this in an editor but that's
something that you can learn later on
another time so for now we're just going
to use this coding environment here
called code pen so right now I want you
to go to code paint io / Jonas madman so
that's my name
so just to this profile here and from
there you can then select public and
then this is your starter code basically
okay so just like the one that says
JavaScript crash course PTC calculator
in an starter so there will be a final
one here as well but you need to select
dad says starter ok and so this is what
it looks like so here on the left side
we have the HTML code in the middle of
the CSS and on the right side the
JavaScript code which for now is empty
because this is where we're going to
write our code so right now we just have
the HTML here so the content and the
styling and that gives us here this
interface which we will then make work
later in this video now if you're not
familiar with HTML CSS that's no problem
it's not really a requirement in order
to follow this tutorial so all you need
to know about CSS and HTML in order to
get started with JavaScript I will show
you during this video now in order to
get access to this code and to start
coding yourself here in this code pen
you can either copy this entire code
here and paste it into a new code pen or
the easiest solution is to just click
this fork button here so that's going to
create a new code pen with this same
code here in it ready for you to work on
ok so this is now a brand new code pen
and we're gonna change the name of this
one here from starter to final okay give
it a safe and that's it now if you want
to save your own code pen with your own
code you just have to create an account
here but that's not necessary at all to
follow this video okay now that we're
set up let's get started let me close
these two tabs in here and alright so
javascript has a ton of features and
we're really only gonna scratch the
surface here in this short tutorial now
maybe you've heard about es6 which is
basically the modern JavaScript and
everyone wants to learn es6 now of
course but people tend to forget that
it's really important to still know es5
as well so that's the version before es6
and so in this tutorial i'm always going
to show you how things work in both es 5
and es6 okay so let's now start with
some simple stuff like declaring
variables doing some calculations and
taking decisions with code then after
that we will do some simple Dom
manipulation which means to actually
make JavaScript interact with elements
on our page so in the HTML in our case
that is of course
here or application so we have this
input fields here and this down here is
like this output field and so what we
have to do is to basically code up this
entire logic which I showed you before
in the demo so when we click this button
here it will calculate your profit and
display it down here just like I showed
you before right now let's start by
closing this year we don't really need
to talk about HTML and CSS now so all we
want here really is JavaScript and the
first thing that we're going to do is to
declare some variables so variables are
a fundamental concept in every
programming language in the world so
variable is like a container where we
can store some data so like a number or
a text or something like that and it's
actually very simple to do all we have
to do is to write var and I'm going to
call this one BTC which stands for
Bitcoin and I'm just gonna say three
point five okay so again we just
declared a variable called BTC and
assigned it the value of three point
five and so def three point five is now
stored inside of this BTC variable like
this container okay
so let's create a new one so variable
and this one is going to be called BTC
USD but so what does this mean
this is just the price of BTC in US
dollars by the time that we bought and
so basically that will later be this
price here okay
but for now remember that we're just
doing some very simple JavaScript here
without actually interacting with our
page down here so right now we're not
really concerned with this page here I
just want to show you some very
fundamentals here in the code without
really thinking about the the app
interface down here so let's pretend
that the price that we bought was at
five thousand dollars per Bitcoin okay
so five thousand and we can now do some
calculations with this so let's imagine
that I want to actually calculate how
much money I invested to buy these three
point five Bitcoin so that's easy enough
let's just create a new variable called
invested and then I can do mathematical
operations with variables so I can say
BTC
time's BTC USD but okay and so in this
invested variable we will now have the
result of multiplying three point five
by five thousand now what if you want to
actually see this variable well that's a
very simple trick that we can use which
is to use something called to console
and so we say console dot log
so basically logging this value to our
JavaScript console and you want to log
this year okay and so down here now we
have this year which you can see is
console and so let's open that up and
here we go so that is the result of
logging to the console to invest it
variable okay and it actually makes
sense because if you do the math by
yourself you see that 3.5 times 5,000
makes these 17,500 now let's change this
here for example imagine that it was
just a thousand dollars and then down
here you will see their new result which
is exactly 3500 so you see here the
advantage of storing these values here
in a variable instead of having them for
example right here in this equation here
so in this formula because this way we
can just change the value of the
variable here in one place in this
example here and then it will change in
entire code and that's great for
usability so let's say I also want to
know how much the Bitcoin that I bought
back then is worth now so let's create a
variable again BTC USD now and let's say
that right now it's worth $12,000 okay
and so now I can also calculate how much
is the current value so I can save our
current BTC BTC USD now okay and so you
see that I used the BTC variable in
these two places here okay so that's the
whole point of using variables so the
ability to reuse data throughout the
code okay so let's say you now I also
want to lock this one to the console
current and so it should pop up here and
yeah so invested 3,500 and now it's
worth $42,000
okay so great we already used variables
here and we reuse them here in different
calculations and yeah we also did these
mathematical operations which is of
course very useful in JavaScript now
this way of declaring variables using
the VAR keyword is the es5 way of doing
it so the older version of javascript in
es6 so the new version that everyone
wants to learn now there are two
different ways of creating variables so
let me start by writing a comment here
so a comment in JavaScript is this slash
slash and in the comment we can write
some code that this javascript compiler
should basically ignore so this is just
to comment or code and to just write
some text describing our code and so in
here i can just write bar is es 5 and i
can also say that const and let yes es 6
okay and so yeah instead of using
variable in es6 we can use const which
is for constants so variables let me
know we will not change later or let
which is a variable that we will change
later okay and so let's make all of
these a cons okay because I'm not
interested in having another variable
down here changing this Bitcoin for
example so I can change these to Const
and I can actually select all of them at
the same time by hitting command on my
keyboard or ctrl on Windows and so I
just write Const because all of them are
constant now if I were to write again
here down here constant and then one of
these variables here like BTC then that
would give me an error or at least it
should down here but it does not for
some reason but it doesn't really matter
so anyway we have a constant we cannot
actually reuse it I don't know why this
console here is not not working properly
now but yeah as I was mentioning Const
is a variable that you
not change later so it's called an
immutable variable okay now let's do
some more calculations so we can
calculate the profit and the growth so
the profit and again we declare a
variable a content one that we're not
going to change and then we can just say
that we want the crop profit to be the
current value minus the the one that we
invested right so it's just current -
they invested okay and then let's also
calculate the growth so again a variable
definition and that's something that
you're going to do all the time
when coding javascript or any other
programming language for that matter
okay now the growth is calculated by
dividing the profit by the invested
value so profit divided by invested and
if you want to express this in
percentages then we just multiply all of
this by 100 okay and now let's just lock
this one here to the console as well so
console dot log and then the growth and
let's wait for it here and - whoa so you
see that we have eleven hundred percent
so that's a lot of growth so let's
change one of these here so for example
the USD but suppose we bought this year
for like ten thousand then all of this
year is going to change
I hope yeah so now we have these new
values here so the invested is now
thirty five thousand and the current is
42,000 and or growth is twenty percent
okay so you saw that all I had to do was
to change this one variable here right
at the top and then that reflected in
all of these other variables so all of
this was recalculated and then became
reflected in the others so the the
bought variable had changed then
therefore changed invested and he
invested which I use down here change
the profit and dad
to growth right and so that's the beauty
of having variables for starting all
kind of data here okay great now let's
suppose that we want to print a
different message here to the console so
for example each time we have a profit
we want to log to the console something
like hey great you made a profit of
$4,000 and each time that were actually
at a loss so basically that the price we
bought is higher than the price that is
worth now it says oh no you're at a loss
and your growth is negative and so
that's what we want to paste here to log
to the console so basically what we want
to do is to take a decision right so
when the profit is positive we want to
log to the console the positive message
and when the profit is negative we want
to log the negative message to the
console so how can we do that and we do
this in JavaScript and again in all
other programming languages using an if
statement okay so it's as simple as this
all we have to do is to write if let me
give some more space here okay so we
write if and then in parentheses we
write or condition so what do we want to
happen so the first thing as I mentioned
before is when the profit is positive
and what does that mean well it just
means that the profit is larger than
zero right so that's positive profit
so basically when we're really making a
profit and so what happens then goes
into these curly brackets so let's then
log to the console console dot log
something like great you made a profit
you made a profit okay and so that's how
we define text or or strings in in
JavaScript using these double quotes or
we could also have used the normal
quotes like this okay so this is how we
make strings now let's just get rid of
these console locks here so that we
don't always repeat these numbers down
here okay so let's see what it looks
like now
I can say clear and then then yeah it
just says great you made a profit now
but what profit did we actually made hmm
let's add that here to our console dot
log and so we can add this actually to
our string and it's as simple as that
all we have to do is to say great you
made a profit and then use plus and then
in here we can put our profit and what
this will do instead it will basically
join these two here into a new and
bigger string and so now you see great
you made a profit 7000 okay
and so that is or current profit let's
actually lock that to the console as
well just to make sure so the profit is
right now 7,000 and so great you made a
profit of 7,000 now what if the profit
is actually negative so let's set the
current price here to 8,000 let's say
and let's see what happens so now it
puts or or profit here as minus 7,000
and so therefore this year is no longer
true so profit is no longer greater than
zero and therefore this part of the code
here never executes and so that's why we
don't see any analog here in a console
okay so let's now create some code for
this situation so we say if the profit
is greater than zero then this happens
but if it's not then we can say else and
define a new condition so else if profit
is less than zero so what happens here
console dot log again and oh no you're
at a loss
and you see that down here now it should
appear yeah oh no you're at a loss
so that's because now this part here is
true and therefore this part if your
code is what gets executed right okay
but there's still one situation that is
not handled here by or if-else statement
right so imagine that the profit is
actually equal to zero what happens then
well right now nothing happens so let's
put ten thousand here so ten thousand
and now you will see probably that or
profit is zero but nothing happens so
nothing is locked to our console besides
this this number here and so we can now
add something else and that is actually
just called else so we could now add
here profit equal to zero and let me
actually do that so profit in order to
test for equal we do not do it like this
so this equal sign is is this one here
we do not do it like this because just
the equal is it is used for assigning
values to variables so just like we have
here word equal is to assign this
current minus invested to the profit
variable but to test for equality
we use the double or even better the
triple equal okay so profit equals zero
what do we want to log then console dot
log you're breaking even so let's see if
that works
and that's not correct so you're
breaking even and so that should now
work but actually it's not
and yeah I see I have an error here so
this year shows me that there's an error
and that's because I forgot the if here
probably you saw that already but yeah
for some reason I missed that okay so
that is the correct solution so else if
profit is equal to zero then it says
you're breaking even but in this case we
wouldn't really have needed that right
because we could have just said else
because that's really the only other
situation that there is so the profit is
either greater than zero it's less than
zero or it's just zero so it's the only
real possibility
that's still left here and so we can
just use else here and then log into the
console you're breaking even just like
this now we're using a lot of console
dot log here and so we're repeating the
same code over and over again and that's
not really a good practice so instead we
can create a variable and then assign
this this string here to that variable
and then after this if-else statement
here runs logging to the console the
result of that okay so let me create a
variable here on top of this and right
now I'm not going to use Const but
instead I'm going to use let and I'm
gonna explain your why in a second so
let I'm going to call this one message
and for now I will equal it to an empty
string
okay so right now it has no meaning so
it has no content at all and now down
here we can say message should be equal
to this string and that's actually it so
let's do the same here message should be
this and the same thing here and all
right
and now after this one year we then
finally log it to the console console
dot log our message so let's clear it
and let's see what happens
and all right so zero and you're
breaking even so how does this work so
first of all we have to use let because
we will actually change the value of
this of this variable right remember
that with Const we could not change the
value and so a Const is not the correct
use case here in this situation so
instead we use let set a message to an
empty string and then down here in each
of these blocks we say that if the
profit is greater than zero well then
the message should be this string here
if the profit is less than zero then the
message is this string here and in all
other situations then the message is
this one and then finally in the end
after this logic here runs we then log
this message to the console okay now
let's get rid of just one here actually
and alright
so we already wrote some
some cool javascript code here right now
let's make this even a bit better
because this way here of of constructing
this string so basically having the
string here and then plus and then the
profit variable this is the old way of
doing things so this is using es 5 so
imagine that our now wanted to continue
this string like saying a profit off and
then here we have the number and then I
wanted some parentheses in order to put
the growth so then I would have to say
plus open the quotes then put a space
parenthesis and that's a really
complicated way of doing it so closing
this now and then plus and then the
growth then another plus and then
percent and close this brackets and then
finishing the sentence now let's just
test this out set this one to a bigger
value here so in order to basically
activate this part here off for if-else
statement and so now down here you see
the message great you made a profit of
seven thousand and we can actually also
include the dollar here I guess we have
to make some change here in order for
this console to run again so yeah you
made a profit of seven thousand dollars
which is twenty percent okay but this
way of writing it here is a bit it's a
bit strange ok it looks a bit difficult
to write and so in es6 this was changed
and so let me comment this part out of
the code and so again I use comment here
and comments are a great way of removing
some part of the code that we don't
really want to delete that we want to
keep and in the code but that we don't
want to run okay and so let's not do
this and in the new in a new es6 way so
instead of using these quotes or the
single quotes we use backticks so this
thing here okay so these are the
backticks and so now we're going to
write something called a template string
and it works like this so again we write
great
you made a profit of dollar and out
comes the difference because right now
with the template strings we can
actually include our variables right
into the string all we have to do is to
write the dollar sign curly braces and
then the name of the variable profit in
this case and then we can just continue
writing or string like we were doing in
before so into these parentheses here we
want the growth so again we use dollar
sign curly braces and growth then
percentage and that's actually it
I believe so let's see yeah that's it
just just this space here so let's move
yeah that's this space and all right so
that's exactly what we had before but
I'm sure you agree with me that this one
here is lot easier to write okay so this
is the new way of writing strings when
we want to include some variables into
the string okay so let's do the thing
here as well so back ticks again and
let's say oh no you're at a loss of
dollars and then now the dollar sign so
this may be a bit confusing so this
dollar here is really for this dollar
sign here and then the second dollar
sign that I have here is to specify the
variable okay so just like I have it in
here so profit again a then just like
before also indicating the growth which
in this case will be negative of course
percentage and that's it okay down here
we don't want to include any any numbers
here and so we can just leave it like
this all right now just to test this
lets put again a smaller number here so
that we can have a negative growth so a
negative profit let's say 5,000 even so
to make it really bad and so oh yeah oh
no you're the loss of minus seventeen
thousand five hundred which is minus 50
percent and fifty percent makes total
sense right because five
is exactly half of 10th out okay
so we're already making some progress
here we talked about variables about
mathematical operations about taking as
agents with code using the if-else
statement we locked stuff to the console
we also created these template strings
here so that's already a good progress
so let's not move on to using something
called functions and again that's a
fundamental principle in any programming
language so let's suppose that you
wanted to calculate the growth here so
these two lines over and over again for
many different people so instead of
having to write this code here over and
over again we can create something
called a function where we basically put
this code and then can reuse it all the
time whenever we need it okay so let's
create this function down here and there
are actually different ways of writing
functions but let me start with the
first one which is simply saying
function and then let's call this one
called growth so called growth then into
our function we can pass some variables
and we call these variables arguments so
what arguments do we want in our call
growth function in order to calculate
the growth we need to know the past
value and the current value right so
past Val and current Val okay don't
worry if this doesn't make all that much
sense to you at this point you will see
how and why this works in a second okay
for now let's just type this here and I
will explain it better in a second so
into this function called call growth we
pass two variables and we will then from
this function return a new variable so
let's actually calculate that variable
so Const and this time let's just call
it G which stands for growth so Const G
and the way that this is called is
remembered the profit divided by the
past value so like we had in here so the
past value is the invested value so the
one that we had in the beginning so the
past value so the growth is current
minus the past divided by the past right
so
current ball - the past Val which is
basically the profit and then divided by
the past value so the value that we
invested okay and then to pass this
value basically out of the function we
use the return keyword and what we want
to return here is G so the variable that
we just created in here okay so you can
picture a function let's say as a
machine where you put in some values it
then does some calculations using these
values and it then gives you back
something new and in this case what it
gives you back is the growth okay
and so let's now actually use this and
so let me comment out this code so again
instead of simply deleting it I will
just comment it out here in order to
leave it for for you to see that this is
what we had before so const growth it's
now instead of having all of this code
here we can now call this function so
called growth so called growth and now
we actually have to pass in the values
that we had and let me actually copy
this one to have it a bit closer here
okay so we can see it all here without
having to scroll back and forth so
called growth and now we have to pass in
the variables and what are the variables
well as you see it's the passed value
and the current value so what is the
passed value it is the value that we
invest it initially and so we simply say
invest it and then the current value is
of course this one here so what your
Bitcoin is worth right now based on the
BTC USD value okay
so again this is how this works we call
the Cockrell function which is what we
defined down here and in there we pass
these two variables invested and current
so basically these two variables that we
defined here and they will then be
passed into this khakhra function and be
called past Val and current Val okay and
then in here
inside of this function we can then use
these variables as we did here so here
we used current wall which is this one
here and then past wall
okay and so just in order to see if this
actually works let me change the value
here again to 12,000 and see if it
changes here and actually it did not and
that's because down here we use the
profit variable for a dis if-else
statement here but remember we took out
this profit variable in here so let's
get it back and so here we go great you
made a profit of 7,000 and 0.2% and
that's actually not correct it should be
20% but that's just because we forgot to
multiply this entire value here by 100
and so I change it now in the function
and so it will now get recalculated and
here we go now it says 20% so now it's
correct okay so again we call this
function here passed it
this invested and current value and they
are done inside of the function called
passed value and current Val just like
this one so we can then use them we can
of course then reuse this so let's say
Const grow of two and then we can use
this again call growth and let's say we
invested like five thousand and we now
have five thousand five hundred so just
some examples and then that's console
dot log this result just to see that
this works and here we go so 10 and
that's actually correct right because
5500 here minus 5000 is five hundred and
divided by 1000 and then multiply it by
100 makes exactly ten ten percent so
great we just created a piece of
reusable code here basically and we can
make this here even better so instead of
defining the variable here and then
returning it right away we can simply
skip this variable we don't really tit
and then just copy just part here and so
that's gonna work the exact same way
let's give this here safe and you see
that it works just the same now this way
here of declaring of function is
actually called a function declaration
let me write it down here for you
function declaration because as I
mentioned before there are multiple ways
of defining functions so the second way
is a function expression so how does a
function expression work well it's a bit
different because now we basically just
define a variable with the same name so
let's say it Const call growth so the
exact same name is this one here and
actually this is not ideal because we
already defined a function with the same
name up here so let's simply call this
call growth to okay
and so what we do is to say that this
variable should equal a function so a
function int n from here things work
just the same so I can just copy this
and put it here okay so it looks
slightly different but it's going to
work almost the same way but not the
exact same way and so let me explain you
why it's not working the exact same way
so you see that we used the kaurav
function in here but the function itself
is only declared later
so here later in the code but we can
still use this function here at this
point so at the point before the
functions actually written in the
and that is possible only with function
declarations so it function expressions
we cannot do that so let me show that to
you here with the growth too so let's
use the coke growth chew function here
as well and you will see that's now it's
not going to work okay
and so it's not actually not really
logging anything you to the console let
me just clear it here again try to
change something just to see if then it
it's going to log something here to the
console but actually it's not not
nothing is really happening here and
that's because up here I'm using this
function expression before it appears in
a code and remember how I just said that
this only works with function
declarations but not function
expressions okay let me now take this
code here and actually put it after the
function expression so now we first
define a function and then we call the
function so caulker of two is defined
here and then we call it and you see
that now it's back to working now we
have ten here again okay does that make
sense to you so let me explain it again
so we have the function declaration and
a function expression but only the
function declaration can be called or
can be used which is really the same
thing in a place in the code before the
functions actually declared so that's
what we do here with call growth because
this one again is a function declaration
but with function expressions we cannot
do that we have to first declare it in a
code and only after that we can use it
okay
now in es6 so the newest version of
javascript just actually a third way of
writing a function that's actually also
a function expression but it's written
in a slightly different way so let me
show that to you so this is es 5 meters
copy this year so that i don't have to
write it all over again and so function
expression in es6 which is actually not
called a really a function expression so
we prefer to call it es6 the arrow
function and so the way it works instead
instead of having to use the function
keyword in all of this we just write the
parameters and then we just use the
arrow here okay so just like this now we
transform this into in
of function and if the function buddy so
basically this part here only has one
line we can make this even better
because in an arrow function we can then
remove these curly braces here and
remove the return keyword and all of
this and so we can have one line with
all of this so let me call it function
growth 3/3
change this year to let's say 20 and 60
and log growth 3 and let's wait for it
and here we go
so 200% of growth and actually that's
not correct let me change this year to
number 3 and so this is all in sync now
here but the result here is of course
the same so this is the way that we
write function expressions basically in
es6 which is called an arrow function so
we pass in here the parameters then we
have the arrow and when the function
body only has one line we don't even
need to return keywords neither do we
need the curly braces so we can do it
all in in one nice line here and so
that's actually a big improvement in in
es6 okay so I hope that all of this made
sense to you we already covered a lot of
ground here so let's review this and so
we learned to declare variables in es5
and also in es6 we learned how to do
mathematical operations with them we
learned how to create different kinds of
functions and how to use them so
function declarations expressions and
arrow functions and we also learned
about parameters or arguments which is
not exactly the same thing but for sake
of simplicity let's just assume that
they are the same thing so these here
are the parameters or the arguments okay
so we learned about how to use and how
to pass in arguments into functions and
why we should use them so for
reusability right then we also took
decisions with our code here wrote these
testing statements testing for profit
greater less or equal than zero and then
we learned about these template strings
in order to output some some strings
here which includes our variables and
that is fantastic
so you just cover two very very
fundamentals of JavaScript there is a
ton more
or to the language this is really just
like 5% of the language but for now it's
it's great okay and so now that we have
two real D fundamentals down we can move
on to finally start working on our small
app okay
so let's close up the console here we
don't need it anymore and take a look on
a tour Bitcoin calculator down here and
actually let's change the view of this
so when you come here you can change the
view and I want like this this view here
on the right side and the code on the
left side so that makes it a lot easier
to work with here in this situation okay
so we have our code here and now let's
do some dumb manipulation so as I
explained right at the beginning Dom
manipulation basically means interacting
with our page and how do we interact
with our page like with a small app here
well we write the prices here so the
Bitcoin price when we bought it the big
comprise today how many Bitcoin we have
and then we click this button we didn't
want the results to appear down here so
let's not do all of that so let me write
it down here that we're now doing Dom
manipulation and two fundamental aspects
of Dom manipulation are selecting
elements and events let me write it down
here as well so selecting element and
handling events handling events okay
and so let's jump right into it now what
is an event well an event is basically
something that happens on the page and
what do we want and what is the event
that we want to handle here well the
event is is a click on this button here
so basically when someone clicks on this
button is when we want all our logic to
happen so this click here when this
click happens we want to basically read
this data this data this data intend to
some calculations and display it down
here okay so that is the logic of this
very simple application right so how do
we handle this click event here well
first we have to select this element and
then we have to attach
something called an event handler to it
okay but first things first let's start
by selecting this element so we do that
in JavaScript by using something called
query selector and a query selector has
to be attached to some object okay now
this is all a bit complex here when I
say objects and attached and all that
stuff so that's really more of the other
advanced stuff but for now that doesn't
really matter all that matters here is
that we just have to write document dot
query selector okay because in this
small tutorial of course I cannot
explain you the entire JavaScript theory
for that you can take my advanced
JavaScript course where you will learn
everything there is about the Dom
manipulation and in javascript in
general so document or query selector is
basically a built-in function that's
already available to us in JavaScript so
imagine like or growth function here
right that's also function but a
function that we created by ourself and
this query selector is a function that
is basically already available in
JavaScript for us to use okay and so we
now have to pass in an argument here
just like a regular function and the
argument that we pass into here is a
selector so that we can select that
button and how does that work well it
actually works the exact same way as in
CSS so let me open up that CSS code here
so for example in order to select the
header logo which is this year we just
write this the selector here in CSS
right I'm sure you're familiar with that
let me take a look at that here in the
code in HTML code so where is that
header so header logo so we have an
element with a class of header logo and
in CSS we then select it by writing dot
header logo so simple as that right and
for example the button here is called
now it's here it's called investment
button and the way queries like works
here is just exact same way as CSS so
the selector it we have to write works
in just in the same way as CSS so for
example to select a class we use the dot
to select an ID we would use the hash so
just like this and we can do all kinds
of slike
so again the selectors here worked just
the exact same way as in CSS okay so we
pass in a string with that selector and
we want to select remember investment
button so we say dot investment button
and that's it so let me close that down
again and so with this we already
selected this element now as I said
before we now have to attach something
called an event listener to this element
okay and so after selecting it document
that query selector we now use dot again
and call the next function the next
method but again I don't really want to
confuse you with all this this theory
okay so let's just write add event
listener okay and again this is a
function here a function that is now
attached to the selection that we did
before so an event listener that will
listen to our event on this button here
and what kind of event should this event
listener listen to well we want it to be
a clique right so we want something to
happen whenever we click here on this
element and what do we want to happen
well there is the second argument of
this event listener which is a function
okay so the first argument is what type
of event we want to listen to and the
second argument is what we want to
happen whenever that event happens and
when we want to happen is simply a
function so I can write function with no
argument and then just like this and
that's it so maybe you recognize that
this way of writing a function here is a
bit similar to or a function expression
right so remember this looks a bit
similar right let me actually copy this
here for you so what we did with the
function expression was just to write a
function like this and then assign this
year to a variable so you see function
and then the parenthesis and then the
function body now in this case here we
don't really have an argument but the
logic here is the same
now this function see didn't always have
to have a name okay and so it's like an
unnamed function an anonymous function
in this case okay so what do we want to
happen here well before we do anything
here let's actually log something to the
console so console dot log let's just
say something like it's working or so
it's working okay this is just so we
know that or event listener actually is
listening to the event and that the code
that's in here is then executed so let's
fire up again or console I know it's
here so how am I going to click that
button let me just first click the
button and then I open up the console
okay so I now click this and now I open
the console and you see it's working so
that's exactly the tags that I wrote
here it's working so let me just change
this here so that you see that it's
really coming from that place I'm gonna
click it now again I can even click it
three times the console and now we have
three times it's working it's working
it's working okay so that is now the
code that is executed each time that I
hit this button all right now of course
this is not exactly what we want to
happen so let me just write here what we
should write in here so the logic that
we want for or callback function okay
because this function here is called a
callback function and it's a callback
function because it's only called
whenever this event happens so one we
want to select select and read data from
the UI so from the user interface
then we want to calculate the profits
let's say and then we want to write the
result to the user interface okay so
basically just these three steps now how
do we actually read this data from or
user interface well again we have to use
the document dot query selector function
so document dot query selector and now
we want to select this input field
so let me take a look at our HTML to see
what it's called so move up here and it
is called the price input and actually
it's your price input bot and then the
next one is price input now okay so
let's copy this here and move back to
our JavaScript and I just have to click
here a double click in order to to open
this up again okay so document dot query
selector and now we have four element
selected but that will simply select the
entire element but we don't really want
the element itself because that will
select basically like the entire HTML
that we have here in this in this
element but we just want the value
that's in this in this input field but
we really just want the value that's in
this input field and so we can use dot
value right now we also want to store
this somewhere so let's create a
variable for that so Const BTC USD when
bought okay and so yeah right now we can
save the data that is in this input
field here into the BTC USD bought
variable all right and all let's
actually test if just works so console
dot lock the BTC bought variable okay
and so now I'm going to fill something
here like 555 hit OK and then open up
the console and here we go so now we
have 555 in our console great
so this really works right so again let
me summarize what happened here we use
document dot query selector to select
this element here this entire element
and then we basically read the value of
it using the dot value property here
okay and don't worry about these names
like properties or methods that I'm that
I keep using here that has to do with
object-oriented JavaScript and that's a
bit too much for this a small crash
course okay so for now let's just accept
that it works this way
and that we can then store this entire
result here into a variable okay
get rid of this one here and then let's
actually just copy this let's write it
out again okay just to get some practice
so we now have to read the second one
here so BTC two USD now and use document
dot query selector and so the price is
now called price input now dot value and
again I'm going to just to make sure
that it's working I am console logging
it now in the real world you're not
going to do this all the time because we
we have to be confident that our code is
working right but for now as we're just
learning here let's let's make sure that
everything is working so I'm going to
put 23 here hit OK go to the console and
indeed here we go so 23 and finally we
also have to read this field here and
now I'm actually going to copy it okay
so Const and this one is just PTC let's
check out the name of this field so it
is called investment ptc okay so that
that input field here has the class of
investment ptc and so let's put that
here and log it to the console so let's
say that i have 100 BTC that would be
amazing right and open up the console
and here we go 100 so it keeps on
working great
and now let's actually calculate our
profits and we did that before already
so let's just do it again now so first
we have to calculate or invested value
and the current value so what we
invested is of course PTC times the BDC
USD baht and the current value is the
BTC that we have times BTC value and now
right now as for the profit and we need
that because we want to display it later
down here in this field so as for the
profit it is again the current minus T
invested and now finally or growth so
the growth now how are we going to
calculate the growth remember that we
already have one function that we wrote
before right actually we have three
functions doing all the same things so
let's just use one of them and actually
let me use the core growth 3-1 here
because that's the one using the es6
syntax here so this error function and I
really like the simplicity of this
function here okay and so I'm really
used now to two writing functions like
this especially when they are really
simple functions like this one liner
here okay now we can actually use these
functions here inside of another
function okay and so that's because of a
topic called scoping which again is a
bit too much for this crash course but
all you need to know is that in this
function here which is like it's an
inner function in this function we have
access to all the variables and two
functions that are out here so out here
in the global scope which is what this
is called so in the scope of this inner
function we still have access to the
variables and functions that are out
here in the outer functions and so
because of that we can still use the
khalq growth 3 function okay so kalk
growth 3
and now we have to pass in let's say
what it was the past value and the
current value so the past value is again
what we invested and then the current
value is of course this one called
current all right and so now let's
actually copy or logic that we have here
can actually let's get all of this and
so now the indentations are really
correct you're let's give it a tap ok so
that's better so this is just the exact
same code that we had before and
actually let me do something here which
is to to comment out this entire code so
we just need this function here so let
me copy this one here down here and now
let's comment out all of this so I
showed you already how to do these one
line comments here using slash slash
when in JavaScript we can also do
multi-line comments and all we have to
do is to do slash then this star and
then to close it which is down here we
use the star again and then the slash
and soon all of this is now a comment
here and I think that's better
instead of deleting all of the code so
instead of just deleting and getting rid
off the code that we wrote so far I just
wrap them all in a huge comment and so
it's like it doesn't even exist so all
we have now here is just called growth
and let me actually get rid of the three
here so we ever call growth function
here in outside scope and then we can
use it in here then we have our message
variable and of course or if statement
let's get rid of this comment here and
so this should now already work except
of course for the part where we display
the message here to this field but for
now let's test it as it is where it
displays this message here right to the
console okay so instead of already
displaying it here in this element we're
just going to log it to the console just
to see if everything works so let's just
use some very simple numbers here just
make sure that that everything is
correct so imagine the price was 1 and
now it's 2 and that we have 10 bitcoins
so the profit should be 10 right and to
grow
should be 100 percent so that's hit okay
and open up our console and yeah you
made a profit of $10 which is 100
percent so we doubled our money and made
a profit of $10 so that is 100 percent
correct so all our calculations all
illogic is already correct here so we
read the data from the interface we then
did the calculations we took this
decision here and then logged this
message to the console now all there's
left to do is to actually instead of
logging into the console of course
displaying it down here in this field so
let me just get the name of that field
and it's called the result so it has a
class of result okay so how do we do
that well we again start by selecting
that element so we use document dot
query selector then do a query just like
in CSS result and now we can say text
content and all we have to do now is to
set the text content to the message and
that's actually it so you see maybe that
we use this document query selector in a
slightly different way so up here we
selected the element read the value and
then stored that into a variable which
is called PTC now down here we do the
opposite basically we store this message
into this document query selector right
so into the selected element and that
basically means that up here this
document that query selector acts as a
getter so to get values out of the
interface while down here it acts as a
setter so here we can set values into
our selection and that's way up here it
appears on the right side of the equal
sign and down here on the left side so
we have our selection then the text
content and we set it to message okay
and remember that our message is of
course this string here that we
generated in this step based on our
calculations okay so let's now see if
this actually works so let's do the same
values again
so one two and ten and now let's see and
tada here we go
great you made a profit of ten dollars
and our message is not properly
displayed right here into this element
amazing right so this app is now really
working just just one small thing that I
want to do here which is that when we
have a profit I want you to turn this
text here green and when we have a loss
I want to make it red and that isn't all
too difficult so with JavaScript we can
not only a change the content of our
elements but we can also style them okay
so how can we actually do that well we
just have to say that when the profit is
greater than zero we want to style it
green and when it's less than zero so in
this part here after if we want it to be
red so how do we do that well we use
again or document or query selector so
that's always as you see the first part
we always start by selecting some
element that we want to manipulate okay
so document or query selector result
which is again this field and then
instead of using a value or text content
we use style style and then the property
that we want to change and these
properties have the same name as in CSS
and so the text color is changed by the
color property now all we have to do is
to set it to green in this case because
we want it to be green and so again this
is now here a setter just like down here
okay so this acts to basically set a
value into our selection and in this
case we want it to be green and then of
course in the other case we want the
color style to be red so let's not test
it with some other values mm now it's
10,000 so a huge increase and let's say
we have five Bitcoin and okay and tada
now it is green great now let's say that
it was like 10,000 in the beginning and
it's now only worth 8,000 and we have 29
Bitcoin
something different now and of course
we're at the last now and so it turned
red so this really works fantastic and
now just to finish this let me do a
little refactoring here okay and
refactoring simply means to make some
small changes in the codes to make it a
bit better that's because we're we're
repeating this piece of the code here
three times so it's your document select
your result is here here we have it here
and we have a down here as well and
that's not a good practice because
imagine that we someday change the name
of the class from result to something
else then we would have to change it
here in the three places and that's why
we should always use a principle called
dry which means don't repeat yourself
okay and so instead of having this year
all over the place we can simply create
a new variable and let me call this one
here result field and this result field
will be this selection okay so we can
actually save selections here in two
variables so variables cannot only be
like text or numbers they can also be
this entire object like the result of a
selection like this with query selector
so now all we have to do is to replace
all of these by result field okay does
that make sense so result fields and
again down here and now just one final
time just to make sure that everything
works we bought it at four thousand now
it's worth twelve thousand and we have
five Bitcoin okay and all right you made
a profit of forty thousand dollars whoa
that's a lot and so with this we
actually finished or very small project
in a very small crash course so I hope
that all of this made sense to you and
that you really understood the code that
we wrote here let's actually convert
this one year to error function as well
so an arrow function without any
arguments it's just the empty argument
and what happened here and then the
arrow here oh okay so just so that we
have everything year with a es6 syntax
all right and of course it's all we're
going to work just the same way so as I
was saying I I really hope that his code
made sense to you and hopefully that's
you now really enthusiastic about the
JavaScript and taking the next step in
in really learning JavaScript now
because this is really exciting I mean
this is really really really simple but
at the same time I think it's really
cool how a couple of lines of code can
give us this this cool result here
right so of course we really just
scratched the surface here and there is
so much more to learn and that is why I
