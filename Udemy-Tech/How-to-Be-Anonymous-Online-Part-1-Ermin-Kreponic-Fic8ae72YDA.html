and show you teach you about proxies how
they are used to mask your real IP
address and I will show you how you can
use a proxy how you can actually
configure your own proxy for others to
use and I will show you what the person
controlling the proxy can actually see
so do have if you have your own proxy if
there are a lot of people if there are
people connecting to it and believe me
there will be people connecting to it
especially if it's a free version of it
you'll be able to see their traffic in
essence which which is kind of hilarious
but a lot of people think just because
they're going over a proxy that gives
them a good amount of anonymity but not
really the person controlling the proxy
sees a lot of things which you would
rather not which you would rather remain
anonymous that nobody sees it but they
do because they run over their servers
so they have the ability to monitor the
service and I will show you how this is
done
now because you need to set up a proxy
server I will do most of these things in
the cloud I deliberately actually opted
out not to show you how to do it on your
own machine even though it is very much
possible and quite frankly not that
difficult but it's also kind of
dangerous because you're opening up your
own machine to the external traffic and
for an inexperienced person that is a
very bad idea anyway let's go ahead and
see how we can actually connect to a
proxy let's fire up Firefox so Firefox
and if I I only have one instance of
Firefox open because I'm gonna go ahead
and configure Firefox to use a proxy so
you can configure it here but that's a
GUI interface for Firefox I'm not well I
might as well show you I mean it's not a
it's not a big deal
preferences if you just go to where is
it is a general search locations
security advanced networking should be
there advanced network so you can
actually configure your connection here
you can use the manual proxy
configuration but I prefer to use the
system proxy settings so when I go ahead
and type in proxy chains and tunnel the
Firefox through the proxy chains I am
going to be connected to a I'm going to
be connected to a proxy over which I
will go elsewhere another thing that
this doesn't really allow you to do is
at least I don't know a way there could
be it's very possible that there is a
weight like to create chains of proxy so
that you hop from one proxy to another
and to another and then bounce back to
your destination so this is not
something that I like to use at all
rather instead if you just will just
confirm what is my IP so this is my IP
address at the moment and if I go ahead
and type in list of free proxies I don't
know let's just go ahead and open some
of them you can actually also pay for
proxies and they will be very stable and
they will work and don't be very fast
but I'm just gonna go ahead and use use
the ones that I got so it says here
Sarajevo Federation of Bosnia
Herzegovina so you know where I am and
I'm gonna go ahead and use one of these
oh these actually go over to domains Wow
not just let me just use the IP
addresses better that way
okay so India I know
you have them set here by can list them
by the anonymity level the reason why I
said India no it's because it's way too
far in my connection will be kinda slow
and the bandwidth in India is not the
best China I've been in China and it's
it's a great place but the connection is
it's not slow but like there are a lot
of sites which are which are actually
blocked but hey that's why they have
VPNs but then again it slows down anyway
let me just go ahead and use the come on
isn't there anything in Europe like we
can forget about it I'm gonna go ahead
and use the u.s. ones there's there's a
fairly good link in terms of cable
between Europe and the US I can use
these anyway it says your IP address
port and protocol these are all HTTP and
HTTPS proxies I wonder if they have any
socks5 proxies no apparently they do not
so I'm not going to go ahead and use
these generally you want to socks5 as
they are the best part there are the
best proxies available out there okay so
let's have a look at here socks5 okay
I'm gonna go ahead and use these socks
for and how well okay so now that we
have this this page opened up we can go
ahead and start installing the tools
that we actually need so you will need
to install proxy trains just be be route
oh wait I'm still with my tour thing
lectures type in DNF search proxy chains
and you will get them geared and just
type in DNF install proxy chains and you
don't need to type in the arch here
actually you can just type in proxy
chains and that
be sufficient - ng okay so it's already
installed so there is literally nothing
to do there now I'm gonna go ahead and
type in VI ever / let's see
proxy chains comm and I'm gonna go ahead
and expand this console a little bit so
I could actually see what it's going on
and here you have a good amount of
options so you have the dynamic chain
you have the strict chain you have
round-robin a random chain and some
other things but they're really not
important well if this one is here by
default so that's good but they're
really not that important so what we
want is to actually first of all use a
dynamic chain what does it mean well if
you have a list of proxies through which
you wish to go you can utilize this
strict chain what is set here by default
and a strict chain is generally a good
option if you have a list of paid
proxies and you know that they will work
100% pretty much but it's a pretty bad
option if you are using free proxies
because they tend to go up and down and
if one of the proxies in the chain is
down your entire chain will be unusable
so the dynamic chain is superior in this
regard because regardless of whether or
not all the proxies are functional the
chain will still work in a dynamic
fashion so I'm gonna go ahead and change
that I'm gonna delete this press I for
insert mode and then you'll be able to
type things in and I will comment to the
strict chain out I also have the I also
have the round robin which is kind of a
hybrid thing feel free to read through
it but I generally like to use either
the random chain or the dynamic chain so
random
is a fairly good thing so each
connection will be done by a random
proxy but again random and dynamic
change they're really good when you have
a list of free proxies and you know
sometimes they go up sometimes they go
down so it's not a bad idea to actually
use them you can leave everything else
as it is Wow they've actually increased
the configuration file since the last
time I've seen it and now I'm gonna go
ahead and type in Sox 5 1 120 7.0 0.1
950 ok just so you know if you don't
type in any of the proxy list any any
proxies like here I like they are type
in this example here they the proxy
chains will by default actually use the
Tor network in order to anonymize you
which is actually the one of the best
types of animation per one of the best
ways of being anonymous on the net but
since we're since we're gonna have a
separate lecture for the tour we're
gonna go ahead and see how this works
with the manual list of proxies when you
type them in ok so it says your us let's
go ahead and type it in so just what
what type dude are you serious are you
not listening the type here are some
free Sox proxies they're just checked
yes but is it sucks for or socks5 genius
ok version Sox 5 thank you very much for
my stupidity but oh well let's go ahead
and begin typing them in as the example
above demonstrates so if you have a paid
proxy you will just need to probably
type in that password the user name and
the password so the user name goes here
and the password goes here
that's quite literally it so socks5 and
this is gonna be like yeah let's just
copy it I am not in the mood to type it
to type today like a bad bet let's go
ahead and take the port as well and
there we go so let me just go ahead and
delete this tab a fight so to say okay
well I am one of the people that likes
to use tabs a lot and against spaces
completely don't start don't start don't
start an argument in the discussion
sections the way he's over tabs and
spaces I don't even know why I mentioned
that
okay let's list another proxy here and
the port is ten thousand two hundred so
ten thousand and two hundred I actually
have literally no idea which ones of
these will actually work and which ones
won't so I am just oh wow this one is in
Brazil sucks five and the port is 48
hours and all you can actually configure
your proxy to listen in pretty much any
port that's really not a big deal
oh my god but now we just skip Bolivia
and use the United States because the
bandwidth is probably going to be really
bad sucks alright although arguably you
would get a better level of anonymity in
these countries as opposed to perhaps
some of the Western countries due to the
regulation which is in place but the
bandwidth is also not the best since I'm
doing this for the demo purposes it's
really unimportant which proxy set am I
using
I just need true how you can actually
use the proxies
sucks 5 and the porch is again 10200 ok
let's see if these actually work so
let's go ahead and close the browser
type in as non-root user so as non-root
user not as root user not start your
browser as root proxy chains for firefox
hit it okay please tell me that at least
one of them will work ok so first one
has timed out this is not going to
happen to you with a paid proxy this is
going to work with paid proxies ok so
let's just open up the account file so
we can see the addresses as they're
being listed so it's going from 1 8 9 to
24 it's skipping down the road because
actually some of them are not actually
functional and that's the beauty of a
dynamic chain if this was a strict chain
this would crash
it just wouldn't actually work so it's
picking up the certificate going to the
certificate authority and it's fetching
my default site and hopping and hopping
and hopping it's still loading so it is
loading the site just taking a while
sometimes you would get luckier
sometimes you won't sometimes you'll get
some really fast and stable proxies
which are free which is generally
awesome but most of the time free
proxies will actually be pretty bad let
me put it like that just loading the
fedora site today my friend today I wish
I had more luck during these tutorials
let's just go ahead and try to load
another one so what is my IP but this
one should be easier to digest
hello well now now it's just a matter of
basically waiting you can see in the
terminal up here what sort of data is
being fetched and which chain which
proxy in the chain is actually being
utilized so it seems that out of like
five proxies that I specified here that
only one of them is actually functional
which is nothing strange compared to the
computer which is nothing strange in the
free proxy world really that's the price
you have to pay for it being free again
as I stated if you go to any of the VPN
providers out there that also offer
proxies or something like that or offer
paid proxies make sure that they are
reputable that they've been a while that
they've been around for a while and that
they have good reviews and not reviews
on their own site but reviews and other
forums and see what people are saying
about them and if you use them you can
have proxies there for a fairly cheap
amount of money and this is not gonna
happen it's not gonna be this slow so
the Fedora project is still loading I'm
gonna go ahead and close that I just
wanted to show you that I have actually
changed my IP if I can it should have
bought a proxy for this demo true how it
actually works but trust me this is not
always the case you will you will
sometimes get luckier and sometimes you
won't just the way the world turns no no
no Mike it might not start Fedora
project I don't care I really don't care
again don't go to the home page or
you're loading something anyway I'm
gonna I'm running a little bit short on
time I'm gonna come back in the fall of
tutorial where i'm gonna revise the
proxy list and then i'll restart firefox
and then the loading time should
actually be
so bid you farewell and hope to see you
in the follow up tutorials where I'll
shoot well I'll just do a demo of this
and then I'll show you how to set it up
and how to monitor how to set up three
proxy and how to monitor it and I'll
show you what sort of traffic can you
actually see okay so after a little bit
of thinking I got it to work and
thinking consisted of me just adding
more proxies to the list if you see that
some of the servers are not responding
like that there is a continuous error or
that it has been denied just go ahead
and remove it from the list that's
really all that you need to do and as
you can see this is actually functioning
it is working and if I just large my
browser here you'll see that my IP
address now is 189 80 3348 in tress core
course Minas gracias
Brazil I have no idea where this is I
it's in Brazil somewhere but I have no
idea where of Brazil anyway I can tell
you for a fact is you have seen from
before this is not my real IP address
and this is not my this is not the place
from where I'm actually coming from
however you can see even my language
settings have been changed by default
and all the other things and that is how
you can basically change your IP address
out there on the internet however if you
have sticked around with the set of
tutorials in the very beginning where
I've shown you how to configure Firefox
if you didn't really configure Firefox
the way I have instructed YouTube and if
for example you visit a website such as
Facebook with this IP and then you visit
a site I don't know such as Facebook or
any other social media network really it
doesn't need to be Facebook or whatever
there is there is a there there are
cookies that each browser is a sign and
they will basically know that it's again
you coming from the same
place that's why you need to configure
the Firefox to actually clear or not
clear cookies and not store history the
clear cookies on exit basically to make
sure that every time you start the
browser it's like a it's like a fresh
cold start I cook is just one way of
tagging the user is basically so
regardless if you changing the IP
address your piece your browser is
actually tagged with the cookies that
are stored in it
anyway the countermeasure for that is in
the very first chapters in the setup I'm
gonna go ahead and bid you farewell here
and in the follow tutorial I'm gonna go
ahead and show you how you can actually
set up a set up a proxy server for
yourselves and then we're gonna go ahead
and connect to it and see what happens
then what sort of information do we are
we able to see okay so let's go ahead
and connect to a VPN so how is VPN
different from a proxy well for one
thing VPN has heavy encryption between
it's a point point encryption between
the VPN provider and you as a client
now I've just gonna go ahead and I would
advise that using Open VPN as opposed to
the PPTP VPN is open VPN is generally
better integrated with Linux systems it
goes
I do believe under the GNU Public
License so I'm gonna go ahead and find
some free VPNs on the net and I'm going
to go ahead and use them and then I'll
show you what actually happens the
primary difference is that between me
and VPN providers so between two points
all traffic is encrypted so whoever
snoops between those two points cannot
actually decrypt what is going on
without having the arse keys that are
needed so VPN is generally the best or
the second best way to anonymize
yourself on then
and I'm gonna go ahead and use a free
one but there are a ton load of paid
ones which are just amazing which have
fantastic speeds stability etc now
whether they hope keep logs or not I
don't know I mean you can take a look at
their policies etc you could ask them
like pose a straight-up question or
something like that but there really is
no guarantee because you have no way of
knowing what the other person that what
the person on the other end is doing so
let's go ahead and type in DNF search
open VPN you can do this through the
network manager in the GUI but I don't
really care much for that I generally
prefer to do things through the terminal
so what you need is a Open VPN here this
is a client so at the nf install Open
VPN I don't need the x86 64 that's gonna
be that's gonna be placed there by
default you just need to type it
actually open VPN and now I'm gonna go
ahead and open myself a browser and I'm
gonna go over to Open VPN free just see
if I can find some free VPNs and there
is this service the VPN book now I am
going to use them I'm going to use these
free VPNs to actually do a demo but
there is no guarantee on my end that
these servers are actually anonymous and
that they don't actually keep any logs
or anything like that so keep that in
mind I'm just using this as a demo
because I don't particularly care at
this point in time whether they keep the
logs or not because I'm doing a demo you
should care and I make no guarantees for
this service just so you know maybe they
do maybe they don't
I really don't know all that I'm saying
is that you need to run the reputation
checks for yourself so there is the PPTP
and
Open VPN now you have the username and
password here and then you have the
configuration files here now you can
download any I don't know any one of
these really I'm gonna go ahead and
download the last one for Germany that
seems to be the closest to my location
I'm just gonna go ahead and save this
okay save file go ahead and click here
you will be offered an option to
actually extract it now here in the
extraction you have the TCP 443 TCP 80
UDP UDP 53 I would just extract this one
honestly and I wouldn't bother thinking
the others at all so I'm gonna go ahead
and state that I should does I shall
like to extract this and I'll simply
extract this here under my username so
home and then use your name I'm going to
go ahead and state ok then I'm gonna go
back to the terminal
and I shall before I do I'm just go
ahead and type this what my IP ok right
so it says here that I have one IP one
let's go ahead and type the following in
as root Open VPN - - fig home your
username opposite VPN now let's go ahead
just pray keep pressing tab Oh V p.m.
book right so the p.m. book and I only
have one in there so I'm just gonna go
ahead and use tab completion I'm gonna
press Enter
it's gonna ask me for the username now I
have the username and the password on
the other screen but I've shown you
where they are on the website so it's V
p.m. book I'm kind of lazy I'm not gonna
type them in I'm just gonna copy paste
both both of them and it's going it's
going it's going
just give it some time initialization
sequence complete you are looking for
this line now just press ctrl R in your
browser to refresh the site what is my
IP and well you need actually shut the
browser off but I mean yeah you should
actually close the browser and close
close any programs that you have which
have open connections and then reopen
them after you have initialized the VPN
but for the sake of the demo I just want
to show you how the IP address changes
here so it says your IP address is 178
161 9 3 2 3 3 in Germany I can tell you
for short I'm not actually in Germany
great place but I'm not there at the
moment especially during the Oktoberfest
oh my god anyway it says what is my IP
and I can guarantee it to you this is
not my IP this is from the VPN provider
ok so this is a very nice way of for not
amaizing yourself especially if you have
a paid VPN you are very safe I mean if
you go to a country where you have bans
etc you might want to configure your VPN
prior to actually entering that country
because entering a country before you've
configured the VPN it's still doable
it's just a little bit trickier because
a lot of the domains where you get the
config files for the VPNs are banned or
actually censored but in any case this
is how you will change it the encryption
between me and this point in Germany
exists and anything in between cannot
actually see what I'm doing so your ISP
you RSP provider it cannot actually does
not know what it is that you are doing
on the net
the person that does know what you are
doing on the net is the owner of this
VPN server anyway gonna bid you farewell
here and in the follow up tutorials I
will I will show you how to set up your
own VPN server and what the person on
the other end can see ok so bid you
farewell ok so welcome back let's go
ahead and see how to actually host it
how to create a VPN server
which others will be able to connect why
are we doing this well so that you know
what the person on the other side can
see and plus it's always a good idea to
know how to create your own VPN because
when you have your own VPN basically you
know what logs are kept and what logs
are not kept what is going on on the VPN
machine etc on the VPN server now let me
just go ahead and walk into the server
just go ahead I just went ahead and
created a new instance and I didn't
switch the route plug-in why well
because the law is the lifespan of this
machine is probably a couple of hours
before it is destroyed therefore I
didn't really see much point in
disabling the root login and all that
because it's just for a couple of hours
but if this machine is going to run for
a while then please apply the settings
from the proxy lectures where you
actually configure it most of the things
to run in as non-root and you are
logging in to the server as a non root
user anyway
mmm let's go ahead and begin so the
first thing that we're gonna need to do
is set up our beautiful firewall so apt
- get install ufw now this is
uncomplicated firewall I do believe
that's what ufw stands for but it uses
the IP tables so this is just an
interface for IP tables basically so ufw
allow SSH you allow SSH because we're
connecting by association a server
therefore we when we start this up we
did not want to be blocked because all
inbound traffic is rejected and all
outbound traffic is is clear to pass so
if the inbound rules do not include SSH
we will be promptly disconnected which
will be a problem so you have W allow
and I would like to allow one
additional port aside from a sage that
is 1194 slash it's going to this is
going to be UDP not DCP why this is a
very stable server and I'm the only
person connecting to it so I don't
really need that much of confirmation
going back and forth and UDP is
generally quicker but less stable of
protocol as a plus no I can't say less
stable but there's no guarantee that
your data has actually reached
destination so does it there's no point
there there is no confirmation from the
other end let's put it that way okay so
the next thing is we're going to do is
type in V I am / let's see default you
are FW Center and you can see that the
import policy by default is drop output
policies by default except we need to
modify the forward policy so Felipa now
you know how to use V I am I just press
escape and then press I to enter insert
mode and then you write whatever it is
that you want to write and you press
escape then you press colon then you
type in double WQ to write and quit okay
so now the test that has been changed to
D except we need to edit the UFW before
rules so yeah blue before rules ah
just gonna go ahead and copy this from I
know this is basically a universal set
up for the VPN the universal rules
they're they're applied everywhere you
can apply some of your own it doesn't
really matter
oops I made an error they're my notes
let me just go into the insert mode okay
that should be that should be fine and
dandy let's go ahead and write quit
that's all we really need to do there
let me just go ahead and show you
something else since I'm just copy
pasting this universal piece of code I
was too lazy to edit it you don't
actually need these calm
but they are good to actually tell you
what it is that it is going on these are
the actual commands that are taken into
consideration to four of them okay so
now we need to enable the firewall ufw
enable god ufw enable it's telling you
that it might disrupt the existing SSH
connections well since we've already
allowed in the firewall the SSH
connections bringing it up will not
actually terminate it okay so line a
lemon there is a failure let's go ahead
and have a look okay this the thing that
was missing you have W disabled UFW
enable god what is the problem with this
file line 12 failed huh let's have a
look at one more time maybe I have
something in there it says not table not
post driving a lot of traffic from Open
VPN client that should all be that
should all be as it is I mean there
shouldn't be any real problems let me
just go ahead and verify this set up
I'm working on the net for the universal
configuration so just before rules for
the for Darth oh okay okay before rules
let me just go ahead and do a quick
check on this before for word start
openvpn okay that's fine that's a
comment I don't care I don't care and
then we have NAT and then we have allow
post-trial thing from that source which
is fine that's gonna be our interface
and the the source IP address the source
subnet actually and the - oh is the
output that's the 88 0 and then - J
masquerade well actually let me just go
ahead and copy it from here
because I must have messed something up
in my notes I usually do which is
frustrating to the point of extreme but
nothing I can do about it unfortunately
you go ahead delete delete
oh that's not something I want to delete
okay so no big deal let me just paste
them they are the same I guess the
indentations are a little bit different
right quit you have W Sabol ufw enable
there we go so firewall is active and
enabled on system startup I don't know I
must have messed something up indeed
before rules here I'm basically too lazy
to go checking one line at a time to see
where the actual mistake is perhaps it
has something to do with the indentation
but it doesn't really matter this is the
this is the set of this is the line
which you actually need to add ok so let
me just go ahead and quit and as you can
see I am still connected no problems the
function the connection is functional
now what we will need to do is actually
do app - get install install Open VPN
easy - our sub and then I'm just gonna
go ahead and say yes so the things that
we need to install so we need the Open
VPN and the easy orsa and then I'm gonna
go ahead and we will need the
configuration files for our VPN servers
so just type in G on zip - see /usr this
is an existing documentation file which
we will utilize Open VPN examples sample
config files server dot coms GZ and now
we're gonna create a new file by
outputting this to a non-existent file
which will be created in the process and
populated with the information with data
basically not information Open VPN and
server comm file is the new one that we
are creating so sir
third dot-com there we go so that is the
one that we needed to create I'm gonna
go ahead and call the story all here and
in the follow up we're gonna go ahead
and begin editing and setting this up ok
so welcome back let's go ahead and
continue whoops
that's what stupid so yeah I am
/ let's see let's go ahead and edit the
file which we've just copied so server
conf
there are a few things which we need to
change in here so the first one is dh10
I think was it yep
so the diffie-hellman parameters never
could pronounce this right I'm
butchering the name I know I understand
but yeah what can i really do about it
so let's go ahead and change this to
2048 2048 bit keys I'm looking for 4 and
8 if you're wondering what I'm doing
with my key moment okay so that's done
2048 next up we need to uncomment a line
which says Porsche space that redirect
so push redirect gateway def 1 bypass
DHCP yep that's what we need so insert
let's just go ahead and uncomment this
this is so did the VPN server can Pat
can pass on the clients web traffic to
its destination otherwise basically the
trying the clients traffic will die at
the server it won't leave it so next up
its push space DHCP - option I think up
there we go so we have the two DNS
servers which we will be utilizing okay
so I refer to the public provided by
Open DNS yes these are the Open DNS
servers which are very secure and very
good I must say they have fantastic
filters and companies do tend to use
them a lot privacy and anonymity I can't
really make a comment on that as I
really don't know but I did tell you
before when I told you how to swap the
DNS servers how to use the static DNS
series for yourselves how you should a
method general way in which you should
choose a DNS server anyway now that we
have uncommon
these two great lines let's go ahead
write quit exit and we shall echo 1 2
the beautiful proc I wish they had
something like broken windows sometimes
ipv4 P underlined forward and let's go
ahead and type in V I am I mean you
don't need to do these repetitive tasks
if you have followed the previous
tutorials for echoing these things into
IP so we're setting the system to I to
forward to be to be capable of
forwarding network traffic but it does
no harm really to echo one twice into
this I mean you just substituting the
value if you have one there already one
will get substitute a good one so no big
deal
let's see sis CTL dot conf and we are
looking for our line net dot ipv4 IP
underline forward okay so let's go ahead
and leave this there so just uncommented
that's all you really needed to do there
nothing more the firewall liske figured
this is done the proxy is installed and
let me just go ahead and check one more
thing I'm not sure if I actually done
this in the previous tutorial not if I
come to think of it forward policy
accepts so make sure the default forward
policy is set to accept I forgot I
forgot this from the previous tutorial
nuts wasn't sure anyway let's go ahead
and deal with the certificates so we
will need to do this so let's go ahead
and copy over the easy our generation
scripts they are on our system
us our share easy our keys yes no no
just easy are set and then let's see oh
when VPN that should do it the sound
that you just heard was not the
confirmation that something was copied
the sound that you just heard was the
system telling me Herman my dear Airmen
you have a billion updates waiting for
you why or why can you not just update
me anyway let's go ahead and continue so
we need to create a directory to house
the key in essence so m'kay dear Etsy
Open VPN easy arse keys so this is the
creation of the directory and now we
need to type in V I am at C Open VPN
easy Arzo farce
that's what's that that was nice
okay so let's go down there are some
things which you can change here just
gonna change one really but how you can
change a ton load of parameters here let
me show you some of the obvious ones
which are subject to change okay so
expertise yours okay PWD that's fine
Vanessa cell that's all great fine and
dandy key config that's great dear
update as you can see export key dear
it's actually easier says slash keys but
easy RC is a variable here in this case
so let's go down export key size that's
fine 2048 and here we go so these are
some of the obvious things that you can
change for your certificate you can set
the country the province city or some
organization mail and I have no idea
what this is like my organizational unit
so you can these are arbitrary so you
can set these pretty much to whatever
you like technically speaking this is
what I would like to change here the key
name is also out of a tree let's name it
server very intimate hit
if you put it to something other than
server as it is arbitrary and you are
entitled to it
make sure to that your changes here
reflect the changes throughout the
tutorials because I don't know how many
changes I will make in advance so just
remember the name ah that's all fine and
dandy lets me just go ahead and write
and quit next up we will need to
actually go ahead and generate the
certificate and this might take a while
so let me just show you something AB -
get install H top and H top this is like
one CPU core and take a look at the
amount of RAM that's available now let
me just go ahead and do something else
okay this is the previous IP address I
don't really have this one this is
probably not terribly important what I
am doing right now but I wanted to show
it to you anyway I don't know I guess
some sentimental reasons okay there we
go so I'm connected again to the same
server just by a different term we can
have multiple SSH connections coming in
from the same place so that's fine
the CPU usage basically is practically
idle at the moment and memory it's like
52 megabytes out of 400 out of the
entire 494 but now I need to generate
the certificate so if I type in open of
course this part here this is not
something that you need to do this is
just something that I'm doing this as a
demo open SSL it has nothing to do with
Open VPN so this part does that we need
to generate a certificate the H dash out
slash at C Open VPN D H 2048 dot PEM and
2000 and
forty-eight okay so it's working and
okay there we go there we go
so the CPU core is basically maxed out
the CPU core is I believe 1.8 gigahertz
it's a Intel Xeon it's not gonna take
like forever but it certainly will take
a good amount of time maybe a couple of
minutes and that's it so when it's done
I'll come back in the fall of tutorial
okay so let's go ahead and continue now
that this is done so let's go over to
Etsy open let me just see what else
begins with open I'm guessing OpenSSH
yep I know
open NSC OpenVPN easy orsa and then
we're gonna do I'm just gonna do LS okay
so dot space dot dot space dot slash
force yep it's warning me of what I am
about to do clean all and then build all
not sorry not build old build CA just
keep pressing enter here unless you wish
to change some of these values and feel
free to change them if you really wish
to I don't because I don't really care
this is gonna be for a couple of hours
and that's it but you might wanna like
have some sort of information here that
is like your own in case you need to be
contacted it was something like that but
in case of anyone submitting a abuse
report to the hosting provider where
your VPN is hosted your hosting provider
will contact you and what happened in my
case was that if you respond in a timely
fashion
that's usually less than 24 hours if you
respond and if you handle the
matter like close the port or something
like that if you just handle the matter
your hosting provider will usually show
a large dose of reason and they will
understand basically what is one ton but
this really depends on their policy and
the way that they choose to behave but
as I said for me it happened somebody
abused my proxy the cloud provider they
digitalocean they've contacted me and
I've responded very fast and they said
okay like you handle the matter you
responded it's I the matter is closed so
if you get abuse complaints please make
sure that you respond very fast
otherwise they will take action and that
is not something that you want occurring
but and here we're gonna need to type in
server but this is as I said this is not
a guarantee on my end this is not an
instruction on my own how to handle
complaint abuses abuse complaints in
regard to the abuses of traffic or
bandwidth on the cloud service every
cloud provider has their own policies
and they will behave accordingly so
let's go ahead and execute this command
to the yep yes I would like to sign it
yep there we go so database updated okay
so now we need to do a little bit of
copying so let's go ahead and do CP Etsy
Open VPN / e zr / keys and then it's
going to be serve ver SI r d-- and this
is gonna go to etsy Open VPN / okay
that's one down the next step we need a
CA cert and server key
so see a cert and server key there we go
so just the just three of those and you
should be fine now a good practice is to
basically confirm that this has indeed
been done so up there we go so let me
just go ahead and install one more tool
you don't need to install it if you
don't want to but I will
unable to locate package ll mm-hmm
doesn't have it doesn't matter you can
type in ll like I can do on fedora ll
and this gives me a very fast list long
listing yeah probably has it somewhere
but I'm too lazy to look for it doesn't
really matter anyway
now that we have actually done this we
have confirmed the copying and we have
configured our VPN server time to start
so Service Open VPN start and service
Open VPN status this is the line that
you are looking so you're looking this
line needs to be identical and when it
says loaded loaded this is its place so
if it doesn't find it it's not going to
be able to start it okay ah that part is
done now what we need to do is generate
certificates and keys for our clients
okay so how do we do that well simple
enough
build - key client one oops and this is
gonna be us the same don't really care I
don't care don't care don't care sign it
yes that's it so let me just see what
did i do client one okay so i have
generated a certificate for i've we are
generating certificates and keys for
clients so that's what we need to do now
and let's go ahead and do the
CP let's pull up our config file so user
share dark slash Open VPN examples
sample config files / client conf and
then we're gonna go ahead and copy this
into @c Open VPN easy Arzo and then
we're gonna go ahead and type in keys go
ahead and paste it right there
this section can be repeated time and
time for each client and you can have
multiple clients connecting as well and
you can have a general certificate for
all the clients to connect etc but I am
the only person that's gonna be
connecting to this since I'm doing this
only to demonstrate what the other
person on the other end can see and how
you can basically just set it up for
yourselves that's all I'm going to do
anyway
ah now I'm gonna go ahead and type in V
I am / let's see Open VPN easy
Arzo Keys client client at CRC keys hmm
I'm just have a look at this for a sec
its you see a Shakey's lion and i am
looking for the oh v p n c RT c-- s
artie kampf
CP oh no no this is not gonna do so the
client comp actually needs to be renamed
into the client dot o vp n
so uh well I could just rename it in the
file but I'm gonna go ahead and repeat
the copy procedure so client we're just
gonna go ahead and name this the client
out ovp n so this is the this is the
proper copy command
not that what I actually just did hey
let's use a list now and wait I'm
nothing to write fold it doesn't really
matter so just type in V I am at see
it's gonna be there now OpenVPN easy
oops
easy our keys client ovp n o okay let's
go ahead and begin scrolling down so
this is gonna be our device ton tu n
that's it's gonna have the IP address
and the subnet which was pretty found in
the firewall by default protocol is UDP
remote and we need to get give this is
the port on which this is gonna run on
which it is running so let's go ahead
and type it here 46.1 o 1.9 7.26 is it
yep keep in mind that your IP address
will obviously be different from mine so
you get the IP address by just typing an
if' config and then it should be like
one of these interfaces you see this one
is the active one this is not on the
server though I'm just go ahead and show
you on the server
I have fig and there we go so eth0 this
is the IP address so just go ahead and
alter that then I'm gonna go to the user
and this is gonna lower the privileges
is there group user nobody group no
group this might have some problems on
Fedora because it should be nobody as
well for a group if I'm not mistaken but
doesn't matter we'll
get to that when we actually get to that
that's basically it so just write and
quit nothing else to be done there now
the next thing is you need to do is just
go ahead and exit here clear if you
don't have root login enabled you're
gonna need to enable it now at least on
temporary basis so here you can see sage
know it's config so permit root log and
just make sure it is it's yes here for
the time being as soon as we're done
with the copying you can basically
revert it back if you wish which is a
good idea anyway we need to go ahead and
perform some copying I have a copy
command here listed we're gonna I'm just
gonna go ahead and go into this terminal
so SCP root and then your server IP let
me just go ahead and change this to 46.1
Oh 1.9 7.26 okay so let's see openvpn
easy our client one key downloads and
just name it well I'm not gonna go ahead
and put in the Downloads I'm gonna go
ahead and give it the full path so home
chronic and I'm gonna put it on desktop
full places client 1 dot key done okay
so next up it's going to be client 1 dot
CRT turned on CR T this is going to be
CRTs well
okay next it's the client just client
dot OpenVPN so dot o VPN and here it's
going to be dot o EP n okay that's done
and we need to see a desert that's going
to be the last ones see a dot CR T and
the see a dot CR D okay so that's done
fine and dandy now as we're finished
actually copying them we'll be able to
use them but I'm gonna go ahead and jump
in the follow-up tutorial where we're
gonna go ahead and mess around with that
now that we've actually pulled them onto
our system I mean basically you can pull
these files from the net as we have
pulled them for openvpn except it was
all kind of bundled into one single file
okay let's go ahead and continue so I've
switched to root here and I'm just gonna
go ahead and edit this file so VI m / @
c / openvpn a / ez RC / key / client dot
ovb n problem this does not exist you
have to actually create it and then
remove the files manually there as you
can see nope
yeah that's gonna happen so m'kay dear /
Etsy Open VPN and easy
- Arzo / cannot create directory file
exists okay I have created this one but
you just got you for you it's just going
to go ahead and get created and then
we're gonna go ahead and create keys and
that I'm gonna go ahead and CP home
desktop see a dot cert -
dot is for present folder and then I'm
going into the EZ Arzo and then I'm
going into keys I'm just gonna go ahead
and copy it there and then I'm gonna go
ahead and copy the client 1 dot CRT and
I'm gonna go ahead and copy client 1 dot
key as well keys well and I'm gonna need
the client data VPN client at ovp and as
well so there we go that's all you
really need to do go over and navigate
to the folder slash let's see even
though I'm already there but hey Open
VPN and going to easy Arzo keys so go
into keys and we have four things in
here well let's go ahead and edit client
dot Oh VPN client there that's fine
protocol UDP remote IP address is fine
and resolve no bind and we're gonna need
to alter this a little bit so - I this
is gonna be group nobody that's a little
bit different so just go ahead and set
that there and now we're gonna need to
look for something else so see a dot CRT
okay so see a CRT is their third it's
client inserts of the skin to be one and
this is going to be one as well so let's
just go ahead and write and quit there
is a way of putting the CA desert and
the the client wandered into the
client ovp n that's what's usually done
but i don't really care i just have the
files statically here so it's fine
and now i think i should be i think i
should be able to basically connect so
let's go ahead and give it a shot
Open VPN config if I'm not I'll come
back in the fall of tutorial where we'll
see what am I actually missing config so
client dot a VPN okay so I did have a
simple mistake on the server in the
configuration file so VI m XE OpenVPN
slash server conf
slash nobody okay so this is these two
are supposed to be uncomment it's a user
nobody and group no group so just
uncomment these lines and that's gonna
be yet save the file and exit afterwards
systemctl you can also use service
whichever one you prefer
so systemctl restart Open VPN and just
go ahead and from your from your client
machine press enter and wait for it
there we go so you're looking for this
line initialization sequence completed
this is the line that you are looking
forward go ahead and open up your new
web browser and type in what is my IP
and you will see some IP you will see
the IP of the server here however if I
let me just go ahead and prove this you
if I disconnect from the VPN and if I'd
through the search again
just give it a little bit of time it
takes a while for it to actually
reconfigure what is my IP so see it now
gives me the IP in Sarajevo where I am
at the moment so that is how you can
protect yourself by creating
own VPN now we're gonna go ahead and see
what we can what the person controlling
the server can actually see and we're
gonna be using wireshark the GUI
interface in combination with dee shark
which is the command line interface for
Wireshark in order to set up the
monitoring of this of the traffic on
this particular server so your farewell
and we shall see each other and Dee
follow-up
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
