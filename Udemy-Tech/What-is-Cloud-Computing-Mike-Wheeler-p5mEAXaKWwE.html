should you care so first off we're at
the very front end of the massive shift
of IT spending where companies are
moving their spending from on-premise
data centers and servers and they're
shifting that spending on to the cloud
and what that means is that currently
only 3% of IT spending the lights
figures that I've seen at least only 3%
of that spinning is allotted to cloud
computing and that 97% is to data
centers servers and personnel and those
sorts of things and so we're on the very
front end of this shift as big as cloud
computing is and as big a buzzword as it
is in the industry we're at just the tip
of the iceberg as far as the potential
growth of where things are heading and
so you're hitting this course at just
the right time for your own career
because the demand is already huge for
Salesforce professionals and only going
to get more massive and so this idea of
cloud computing and what that means that
how it relates to you is that companies
back before the cloud they would have to
set up their own data centers set up
their own servers and then deal with
disaster recovery plans and backup plans
they would have to heat and cool these
data centers they'd have to you know
provide all the wiring they would also
have to provide the personnel to keep
the lights on and to keep the servers
running and to provide 24/7 365 support
and support technicians with pagers to
make sure that if a server goes down
they're not losing functionality and
that sort of thing and so as companies
such as sales forces come along and
other companies that provide certain
types of cloud-based services such as
Google or Amazon these massive companies
that have top end servers and computing
capacity they've been able to package
and sell this to companies at a fraction
of the cost that companies would be able
to do this themselves it's it provides
an economy of scale so that you can do
what you need to do from a computing
standpoint
and do it more efficiently and cheaper
and so in order for companies to remain
competitive they have to also move to
the cloud and so there's the companies
that have been first to the cloud and
they're the fast followers and then
there's a lot that are kind of lagging
behind what you'll find is that when you
embrace the cloud
as far as an IT organization or a
software development company or whatever
industry you may be familiar with you
find that you can develop these
applications in the cloud much more
rapidly than a traditional setting
especially on the Salesforce platform
and the Salesforce is making more and
more of their functionality customizable
and configurable through clicks instead
of code you may see this referred to as
declarative instead of programmatic and
so the main takeaway here is that you
can do probably 90 to 95 percent of your
application functionality through clicks
instead of code this makes for some
complex business requirements being met
through quickly configurable solutions
and so it provides for rapid development
and deployment it also is easier to
maintain in the cloud Salesforce does
three major release cycles per year and
those are always backwards compatible
and so as they release updates to their
platform what you've built in the past
just doesn't break what cloud computing
is and how it relates to Salesforce is
that it's quicker development time and
there's also just a lot of demand for
these jobs as well a lot of demand for
people that can fill these jobs which
leads to better pay and better
flexibility so this is you know
definitely a fast track to a well-paying
career and also there's a lot of
examples of people that I know
personally that have switched careers
myself included to the platform and so
this is an ample opportunity for you to
get your foot in the door for a
cloud-based career
