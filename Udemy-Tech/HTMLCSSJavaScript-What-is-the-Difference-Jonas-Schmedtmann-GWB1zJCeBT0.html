teacher at udemy.com in this video I
want to talk about the very fundamentals
of web development and that's HTML CSS
and JavaScript so these three languages
are the absolute fundamentals of web
development and every aspiring web
developer totally has to learn them but
what is actually the difference between
HTML CSS and JavaScript what does each
language do that's what I'm gonna answer
in this video so HTML CSS and JavaScript
all work together to create beautiful
interactive and dynamic websites or web
applications
now the HTML is responsible for the
content of the page so the text the
images the buttons and all the content
that you see on a web page is always
written in HTML then the CSS is
responsible for the presentation of that
content so basically for styling and for
laying out the elements on the web page
okay and then finally JavaScript is the
real programming language that allows
developers to add dynamics into the
picture like interactive effects
manipulation of the content and also of
the CSS and much more so again hTML is
responsible for the content CSS is
responsible for the presentation of that
content and finally JavaScript for
adding real programming capacities to
websites all right but let's look at a
real example here to make this a bit
more clear so on the left side you see a
piece of the HTML of one of the apps
that I killed in my JavaScript course so
remember hTML is where all the content
goes right now hTML is a markup language
so it's technically not a real
programming language but that's not a
problem at all it doesn't really matter
so in HTML we use tags in order to
basically describe the content that's on
the page and this is very simple
actually
and so hTML is by far the easiest want
to learn now with just HTML without any
styling or facts this is what it looks
like in the browser
okay so it's just plain text and some
buttons and input fields here in this
case but without any styling whatsoever
and that is where CSS comes in
so in CSS we define a bunch of rules
that apply to our HTML elements each of
these rules contains properties that we
assign values for example we can use the
color property to define the text color
and set its value to blue or to red or
whatever we want and there is a whole
lot of properties like this to define
font sizes text alignments margins
background colors shadows and so on and
so forth there are a ton of these
properties
okay so again CSS is the presentation
layer of any web site or web application
on top of HTML and so with CSS we can
really transform the bare-bones HTML
structure that we saw earlier into
something more real more beautiful and
also more usable of course in CSS we can
get really creative because it allows us
to do so many things and so it's also a
bit more difficult to learn but in my
opinion it's way more fun - I really
love CSS and all the things that we can
do with it because it's really powerful
actually now what if we want some
interactivity and dynamics on our web
page or web app like in this example
where we can add fields to these lists
or delete them and all kinds of
calculations also happen all over the
place as a result of that so this is
something we cannot do with just HTML or
CSS and so that's where JavaScript comes
in javascript is a really powerful and
modern programming language and in fact
it actually has become the most popular
programming language in the world in
these web applications that we use every
day like Facebook or Twitter or really
any other app that you can think of are
powered mainly by JavaScript so
JavaScript really has taken the web
development by storm in recent years and
so it's ultimate language you really
have to master today if you want to
become a web developer there are also
all kinds of popular JavaScript
frameworks these days like react
angularjs node.js and just to mention a
few but for now as a complete beginner
you really just have to master Java
first and of course HTML and CSS so I
hope it's now clear what HTML CSS and
JavaScript are and what they are used
for now another way of easily visualized
the role of each of these technologies
is to put them in terms of nouns
adjectives and verbs so in this like
thought experiment HTML does the nouns
like saying that the P element is a
paragraph so paragraph is the noun okay
then the CSS is the objective because it
describes the noun like saying the
paragraph text is read and Sedaris or
adjective and finally JavaScript is the
verb like saying hide the paragraph so
we are doing something here and so we
have a verb right so does it make sense
now after all these explanations you
might be wondering well this is all
great but it sounds very complex so how
can I actually learn HTML CSS and
JavaScript and let me tell you that
there is no easy answer really but you
do have a couple of options to choose
from you can learn from free online
videos like here on YouTube you can read
and work through a bunch of tutorials
you can buy books and study them or you
can learn from online courses and every
learner is different each person has
their own way of learning so different
strategies work for different people of
course but here is what I find to be the
best approach I strongly believe that
it's best to start learning the
foundations of any technology with a
very good online course and let me
explain you why when you're just
starting out it's great to have a
structured approach to learning and a
good online course can give you exactly
that it has a logical structure and
covers all you need to know in order to
build a good foundation on which you can
later build on and really I don't just
say this because I actually design
create and sell online courses myself
but because this is how I actually like
to learn now even a very good online
course alone is never enough to make you
a professional developer no matter what
other people might tell you okay you
will have to learn a lot more by
yourself and get a ton of practice but
as I mentioned an online course is a
great starting point and I totally
recommend you starting with that now for
taking our skills to the next level
you'll have to get a ton of practice and
you can also take more online courses
and you can read some tutorials and
watch some free YouTube videos because
at this point you already have an
overview of the technology you're
learning and you actually know what to
search for and what problems you need to
solve and I find that working through
some tutorials or Stack Overflow
questions is perfect at this stage and
if you then want to go even deeper into
a very specific subject you can always
buy a good book which is also a good
learning method I think the problem with
books is just that they get outdated
quickly so you need to be careful with
that all right now of course this is
just a suggestion as I mentioned earlier
because every person has a very specific
learning method but I believe that this
way it might work for everyone but again
let me warn you here that there is no
ultimate online course or video or book
alone that will make you a web developer
okay you will always have to put in the
work to time and to practice yourself it
will be hard but it will be totally
worth it okay because web development is
an awesome career that I'm sure you're
gonna love okay and since we were
talking about online courses let me show
you my three online courses that I
designed specifically with HTML CSS and
JavaScript beginners in mind so I have
one beginner HTML and CSS course with 11
hours of content one beginner javascript
course with over 17 hours and one
advanced CSS course with over 28 hours
of video to take your CSS skills to the
next level hosted on udemy.com in all of
these courses we build beautiful
real-world projects step-by-step with
deep topic explanations as we move
through the projects so that you don't
only learn how to do things but also why
so if you're like me and think that
taking an online course to get up and
running with HTML CSS and JavaScript is
a good idea I can recommend you taking
my beginner course which also comes with
premium support you can check it out and
sign up today using my exclusive youtube
coupon just click the link in the
description below and I see you in class
alright and that's actually it I hope
that you learned the difference between
HTML CS
in JavaScript and what we used them for
and also how you can learn them if you
got interested so thanks for watching
and I see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
