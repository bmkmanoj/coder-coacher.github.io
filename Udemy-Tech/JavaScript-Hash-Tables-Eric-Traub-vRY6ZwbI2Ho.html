working with is the hash table hash
tables are very powerful data structures
because they provide us with constant
time lookup and insertion or oh of one
runtime which neither the linked list or
the binary search tree can do for us
hash tables are used for a wide variety
of applications because they have a very
fast runtime and you will come across
different implementations of them all
throughout your programming hash tables
are used to store data that is in the
form of a key associated with a value
in many cases the key will simply be a
string and the value will be any data
type
let's get into how our hash table will
be set up and function a hash table is
simply a table of a predetermined length
in which each of the cells of the table
or buckets as we will call them holds a
piece of data which has a key and a
value
we will be using an array as our hash
table and each index of the array will
be a bucket our array will start off
empty and then we will fill it up as we
add data to it for this example
let's make a very small hash table of
size 10
you can see that our hash table is an
array and each of the buckets is
initially empty now each piece of data
that we insert into our table needs to
be assigned to a different bucket so how
will we do that we are going to take the
key and hash it into a number so let's
say that we want to use our hash table
as a phone book to store our friends
phone numbers in the data that we want
to store is an object with a key
property in a value property in which
the key is our friends name and the
value is our friends phone number let's
take our friend Jim in his phone number
of 555 28 28 as our first piece of data
the first step is to hash our friend's
name into a number that corresponds with
one of the buckets in our array or our
hash table
when we get into coding our hash table
we will write out a function that does
this but for the sake of this example
let's just say that the key Jim hashes
into the value 8 so we will store this
data as an object with key Jim and value
5 5 5 28 28 in bucket 8 in our hash
table if we now wanted to insert our
friend Brittany and her phone number
into our hash table the first thing that
we would do is hash our key Brittany
let's say that this gives us a value of
3 so we would store Brittany and her
phone number in bucket 3
that is how we would insert data into
our hash table
to retrieve data out of our hash table
we will write a get method that will
take in the key of the data we are
looking for
so now if I wanted to look up Jim's
phone number I would take the key Jim
and hash it again
our hash method will give us the same
number that we got the first time we
hashed Jim which was eight so we can now
go to bucket eight and get Jim's phone
number because it will be right there
simple as that
that is how the main functionality of
our hash table will work now you might
have thought to yourself what happens if
we have two keys that get hashed into
the same bucket then what do we do and
that is a great question to ask
multiple pieces of data end up in the
same bucket we call it a collision
to handle collisions that we form each
of our buckets into a simple linked list
so that if there is already a piece of
data there
we simply chain what we want to insert
at the end of our linked list
let's say we want to add John and his
phone number to our hash table for the
sake of this example let's say that his
key John also hashes to the bucket
number 8 since Jim's data is already in
bucket number 8 we would simply start a
chain at bucket 8 and link John at the
end of the chain like this if we wanted
to insert Bekaa into a hash table now
and she hashes to bucket 8 as well
we would simply run down our chain and
attach her at the end
you
now to retrieve Becca's data out of our
table we would have to hash her key
which is the string Becca go to the
value we get which would be bucket
number eight and travel through the
chain until we find Becca's data now as
I mentioned earlier hash tables are
considered to have constant time
insertion and lookup but how can this be
possible if we have to iterate through
chains when we have collisions and that
is a good point they are not exactly
constant time lookup and insertion but
if you make a hash table correctly with
many many buckets and a good hashing
function you shouldn't get too many
collisions
so that is why on average we consider
hash tables to have constant time lookup
and insertion so that is how our hash
table will be set up the only operations
that we are going to want to perform on
our hash table are inserting data into
it and getting data out of it
but in order to do these methods we will
need a third hashing method as well
to hash our keys for our purposes we
will be creating a hash table that
stores our friends email addresses so we
will have data in our hash table in
which each piece of data has our friends
name as the key and their email address
as the value this is the hash table that
we will be creating throughout this
entire section let's start coding out
our hash table in the next video
