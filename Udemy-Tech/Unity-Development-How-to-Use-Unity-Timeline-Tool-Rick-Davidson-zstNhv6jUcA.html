unities timeline tool we'll be setting
up a very simple animation sequence
where we have a few different things
triggering at the same time triggering
by having our playable director start
when the player runs through a trigger
volume we'll be setting up a really
simple script that allows you to control
the start of your time line through that
playable director and get the starting
point for you guys to create cinematic
moments in your game or you can have a
whole bunch of things happening depth
and flavor and additional aspects that
have the player really see that this
game that your game world is alive so
the first step in this process is to
have a thing about what it is that we
want to have happening in our game what
are we trying to show the player what
cinematic moment are we creating and I
think as the player runs down here
through this lovely little forest and
grass and stuff I'd like to have some
sort of animals go scurrying off to the
left that says to the player you should
be looking down that way there's
something down that way of interest of
importance and I'm gonna choose I'm
gonna call them rabbits although for now
I'm just gonna introduce capsules into
my scene and then we can change out the
art assets later on I'm gonna put a few
rabbits just down here I'm gonna start
by adding a capsule and that's last
nicely way up in the sky there let's get
the capsule roughly where we want it to
be placed in the area just pretend for
now that this is a rabbit kind of like a
rabbit doesn't it make it nice and
bright white so it stands out I'll
figure out later on what art we want to
have for its skull one on one that's
fine I'm gonna rename this as rabbit
rabbit zero and then I'll probably
create yeah you know let's create a
couple of rabbits I'll duplicate that
rabbit one two there we go we've got
three rabbits to put second rabbit over
there and the third rabbit just they're
hanging out munching the grass they're
eating on the grass just here having a
good old time so when the player runs up
to here they're going to go look there's
a player there I need to run away so how
do we do that first of all we need to
create a timeline and the timeline is a
mechanism that allows us to have
multiple animations and say at what
point those animations happen that'll
make sense in a moment if you don't see
your timeline window then jump over
to window timeline to bring out this
timeline window here the very first
thing we need to do is create a director
component so a playable director what
I'm gonna do to make that nice and easy
we could put the playable director right
on top of one of our rabbits here but
that becomes a little bit confusing
later on because it looks like this
rabbit zero is driving everything that's
happening so I'm going to create a new
empty game object and call this rabbit
timeline as game object rabbit timeline
and then I can click create to create a
timeline I've already got a folder here
for timelines this will create a
playable that's a type playable I'm
gonna call it rabbit timeline it's
called a rabbit timeline timeline just
one timelines fine thank you
now we have our first timeline this is
cool so you can see timelines I'm just
gonna switch this over here to seconds
it defaults to frames it's basically
saying what happens at a certain point
in time let's have a look and see what
we would actually like to do here let's
see the the first rabbit rabbit zero
here if I here's a trick if you click on
the rabbit timeline which is our empty
game object let me just put these
rabbits underneath that in the hierarchy
so they're nice and tidy down I'm just
gonna close up my core that's got my my
guy running and the Sun and a few other
things so I've got these rabbits in here
you don't have to have them childhood
under the timeline but I'm just doing
that to keep it nice and organized I'm
gonna click on the lock down here so
that I don't you saw just now when I
clicked on the rabbit to check out the
rabbit and what's the timeline so I want
to keep on the timeline down here so it
locks it in place and the first thing I
need to do is to go and drag this rabbit
down into the timeline here as an
animation track and then I'll grab
rabbit number two so I guess that's
rabbit number one animation track and
rabbit number two there we go so I've
got animation tracks for these guys and
the technique the mechanism for making
them animate is pretty simple click on
the red dot here which is recording and
now we can move them over at time zero
and a little trick for you give them a
little bit of a shake in place and that
creates the first
keyframe or you can click on the object
itself come over under here right click
on position and say add key that will
also add a key down here on its timeline
so I've got three animation tracks one
two three that's one per rabbit and I
can manipulate those I don't have to do
them all at the same time but I am going
to hit record on all three so I can
coordinate them together now we move our
timeline to where we want the next key
to be I'm gonna say about mm nearly
about a second okay and this rabbits
gonna go jump look what's going on here
this guy is going to go jump over there
and this guy's going to go jump there so
I want the player to initially see some
movement for the rabbits then do a bit
of a jump when the player comes along
and then they're going to stand there
for a second thinking looking at the
player I might even have some extra
animations where they turn around and
look what's going on and then I'm gonna
say we're gonna get out of here so I'm
going to give them a little bit of a jig
or I could as I said before I kick out
to here and add a key on each of these
right click and add key now we've got a
key therefore they did a jump they stood
around doing nothing and now they're
gonna run away and I say the run away
probably is about what's five seconds or
so where they're running down the path
so I find way down the path it's going
to be and I simply move them to down the
path and they will animate down in that
direction should be pretty good and then
when they're down there they should be
out of sight from the player but I'll
give them another second or so to
basically just disappear into the
mountain so there's no chance that the
player seeing them and seeing them
sitting down there hanging out okay now
that I finished recording I can click
the red dots again to stop recording and
if I scrub this timeline back to the
start you can see they go what's going
on and then a run run run or I can click
the play button here to see it in the
actual time and then run run run run run
it's all going pretty slow but that's
not too bad for now we can fine-tune
that later on if our heart desires okay
so that's the first stage is creating
some animations that we're reasonably
happy with had some rabbits just seeing
the player and saying what's going on
here now we need to identify when they
will be triggered when
this timeline is going to be triggered
when we call it when we say do this now
and that's pretty easy process what
we're going to do is create a trigger
volume and then put some code on that
trigger volume that says tell this
timeline to start so we aren't here
again we'll create a cube it's a nice
easy way to visualize this just drag it
into the position we want okay
cube now I'm going to there's a few
different ways to do this but this way I
find nice and quick and easy just drag
the cube up to roughly where we say if
the player was to come along they're
definitely going to walk through this
area so what we need to do on the mesh
renderer over here is simply just
unclick that so that there's not a solid
object the player won't see anything
there's just this invisible box Collider
and it's super important SuperDuper
important that you click is trigger this
is important there's a few scenarios
where this will cause our timeline to
start to trigger and others well not if
I don't have that on then when I run up
to I'm just going to go bunk into it
like an invisible wall because it thinks
it's a Collider so a Collider that's a
trigger is a is a basically an invisible
box you can walk through
okay so we've set that up now we will
call this instead of calling it a cube
would call it rabbit trigger now we have
ourselves a rabbit trigger very
excellent okay I've got a rabbit
timeline and stuff down here and a
rabbit trigger and three rabbits that
have some animation on it and our player
down here so next up we're going to
click on rabbit trigger add component
it's going to be a script will call this
script timeline because this is going to
be our timeline controlling script will
create that jump into our script here in
visual studio okay now what we need to
do first of all is we're going to be
using the namespace of unity engine unit
dot playable x' so that we can access
this playable director that we've just
created let me get rid of this start and
update and we need to create ourselves a
variable type I'm sorry a variable
that's of type playable
director creating available we'll call
it director to start there we go that's
gonna be our variable and in order for
us to be able to access that from the
inspector we will create it as a
serialized field okay so that's our
variable there and then pretty simple
method we're going to create is void on
trigger enter so we're gonna use
ontriggerenter which is good knowing
that it's only going to trigger once
it's not going to be the whole time the
player is inside the the trigger volume
that's created a little of extras Auto
populated collider and other in here
that's fine we'll leave it like that
so basically saying method for when we
go into the collision box this collision
trigger in here we want to do a
particular thing we are going to first
of all check that it's working this is
super important whenever you're dealing
with collisions I'm working it's just to
make sure that it works because this is
one of the big things that can happen
when you're playing around with
collisions and triggers that you think
it's your code not working but it's just
the fact that the actual triggering is
not taking place you've got something
set up you know wacky way let me just
see if I can grab my console here okay
back into the game the trigger volume is
somewhere around here and blump I'm
working wonderful okay so we know that
that is working as expected
and then it's pretty simple if we want
to start the playable director we just
need to say this variable here director
to start dot play piece of cake and then
I'll leave that print statement in there
for a moment jumping back into the build
I've got my scene and my game windows
side by side there's two more steps step
number one is when clicking on your
timeline find your playable director
here and make sure that plan awake is
turned off or else your timeline
sequence will start as soon as you click
play so to turn that off and the other
thing we need to do is go to the rabbit
trigger and define which director we're
starting so we've got director to start
here that we set up as our serialized
field over here
our playable director director to start
and we are going to drag in the rabbit
timeline over to director to start
play let's see what happens on the left
you can see as I'm running along as I
run through the Box there now they
should do that little jump and then they
go running and on the right you can see
they're running off to the left and
players saying why those rabbits running
down the less must be something very
interesting down there so I hope you
guys have found that useful I hope you
see a thousand ways to integrate this
time line system within your game so we
can be movie director and game developer
at the same time thanks for watching
always enjoy hanging out with you guys
and I look forward to seeing you in one
of our courses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
