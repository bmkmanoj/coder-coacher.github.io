how to do math operations with numbers
so we're going to look at math operators
let's go straight away and open a Python
section and let me write a math
expression there 20 minus 10 divided by
5 times 3 in the power of 2 and what we
get is 2.0 so why did I write this a
long expression well because I want to
explain to you the order of operators so
when you have multiple operators in an
exploration the want to be executed
first is the exponent so we have 3 in
power of 2 here that will give us 9 so
power is the first to be executed and
after that is division and
multiplication actually division and
division and multiplication are on the
same level we're talking about order but
the one that this first will be executed
first so in this case division is the
first one so what will happen here is
Python will ignore - for now so it will
divide 10 by 5 and it will give 2 then
it will do 2 times 9 so again 10 divided
by 5 2 times 9 19 and then we have the
rest of the operators which could be a
plus or minus so in this case we have -
and so 20 minus 18 we have 2.0 so you'd
ask why we have 2.0 because 10 divided
by 5 gives 2.0 so division outputs a
float in Python 3 if you are on port
phone to a to the output an integer now
to make your expressions look better
you'd want to remove the spaces
for the power operator and I'll say you
do like that so now you can read it
better
so 2 times 9 and then 20 minus 18 and so
on you get the idea
you get 2.0 again and now if you want to
execute the minus operator first you'd
want to put that inside brackets so why
did we get 18
well because 20 minus 10 gives 10 and
then 10 divided by 5 gives 2 and then 2
times 9 gives 18 that's the idea of an
you could also do this put this in
brackets and what would happen here is
you know 10 here 15 here in the power of
2 so 15 in the power of 2 and then 10 so
10 divided by 15 in the power of 2 so
let's see what we get
yeah we got that so let's see if I was
right 15 in the power of 2 we get 225
and then we got 10 on the other side so
10 divided by 2 2 5 we get that number
so whenever you want to change the order
of operators you should use brackets so
I hope you get the idea and please try
this out so try to do a few operations
with numbers to get used to it
and you I'll talk to you later Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
