going to cover is the binary search tree
so what is a binary search tree and what
is it useful for a binary search tree is
a collection of nodes that are all
connected together in a certain way
each node in a binary search tree will
have up to two child nodes a left node
in the right node and each node will
contain some data or a value similar to
our linked list for this course we are
going to focus solely on binary search
trees that take in numbers as a value
but of course you can make a binary
search tree that holds any data type as
a value if you wanted to the way our
binary search tree works is that all of
the left nodes will be of lesser or
equal value to their parent node and all
of our right nodes will be of greater
value than their parent node so for
example if we start with a root node of
50 and we want to insert the value 30 it
will become the left child of the root
node if we want to insert a value of 100
now it will become the right child of
the root node and this pattern just
continues all the way down our tree so
if we wanted to insert a value of 75 now
we would say is it greater than 50 yes
can it become the right leaf of 50
no because 100 is there so now is 75
greater than 100 no it is not can it
become the left branch of 100 yes
because there is not a child node there
great that is where 75 goes and we could
continue if we wanted to insert 110 it
would go here if we insert 105 it will
go here and so on each left node is less
than or equal to its parent node and
each right node is greater than its
parent node
we have the basic outline of our binary
search tree here but one thing that we
are going to change is calling all of
these elements nodes instead we are
going to make each one of these elements
its own binary search tree
if we think about this for a minute it
will actually make a lot of sense each
node in our tree is basically a subtree
it's itself is a root node with up to
two children nodes which makes it a
binary search tree this is a binary
search tree this is a binary search tree
this is a binary search tree of only a
parent node and one child node this is a
binary search tree and so on so that is
how our binary search tree is going to
be organized
the functionality that we want to put on
our binary search tree is that we want
to be able to insert values into it
which will essentially be like adding a
new binary search tree to our root
binary search tree
as an example if we start with this
binary search tree that has a root node
of value 20 and insert 10 into it we
will place a new binary search tree with
no child nodes at its left branch we
will also have a contains method on our
binary search tree that will take in
some value and tell us if that value is
in the binary search tree or not
we will also want a depth-first
traversal method and a breadth-first
traversal method on our binary search
tree each of which are simply ways of
travelling through the tree or
traversing through the tree as we call
it and touching every node
the difference between these two methods
is what pattern we traverse the tree in
in depth-first traversal
we will start at the top and follow each
branch all the way down to its bottom as
you can see in this diagram
you
in breadth-first traversal we will also
start at the top but we will go across
each level before moving down to the
next level as you can see in this
diagram
you
as we touch each node in the tree we
will be running some function on each of
them in our case we are going to simply
log out the value of each node but you
can of course perform whatever function
you want to on them
and that will be our binary search tree
great now it might look like a lab but
we will break it down step by step and
be pros at binary search trees in no
time
before we start coding our binary search
tree we need to cover an important topic
recursion because binary search trees
are very recursive structures by their
very nature so that is what we will
cover in the next video
