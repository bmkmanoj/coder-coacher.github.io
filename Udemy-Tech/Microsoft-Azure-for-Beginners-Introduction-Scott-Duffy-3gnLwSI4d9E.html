about Microsoft Azure from absolute
scratch into at least getting to know it
you can become an azure superhero now my
name is Scott Duffy and I've got over
40,000 students in my Asha courses on
udemy and other platforms in this video
I'm gonna cover a lot so this is gonna
be a bit of a longer video but if you've
always wanted to know a sure and you've
always wanted to know about the cloud
you can get something out of this and is
gonna cost you absolutely nothing so in
this video we're gonna talk about what
the cloud is so you may have even just
heard this as a buzz word what is this
and what is it what benefits does it
give and specifically about Microsoft
Azure Microsoft Azure is the cloud
platform that I tend to specialize in we
do talk about Amazon AWS which is the
other leaning cloud platform but in this
video we're not gonna get into it that
much I'm gonna show you how you can get
a free as your account and with some
bonus credits so that you can go in and
create resources it's not even cost you
anything you're able to use all of the
networking and computer servers on
Microsoft's dime basically then when
once that's over we're going to go off
into the azure portal ourselves we're
gonna have a look around we're gonna see
how to create resources I'll show you
the azure marketplace and all of the
different options that we have within
that that Azure portal then we'll switch
into actually actively doing things such
as creating our own virtual machine that
is a a Windows server in this case you
can also to use a Linux server but in
this video we'll do a Windows server in
the cloud that we can use as if it's our
own machine we're going to set that
machine up as a web server and so we'll
actually get to the point where we can
navigate to that machine using our web
browser and we can see that machine
serving up a web page switching from the
infrastructure side we'll get into the
platform as a service which I'll talk
about the difference between the two by
creating a web app we'll actually go in
deploy a demonstration web app into the
Microsoft Azure portal and you'll see
how a developer would create a website
and deploy it within within just a few
button pushes
finally we wouldn't be complete if we
didn't talk about storage accounts so
we'll have the infrastructure as a
service let virtual machines the
platforms of service web apps and
storage accounts which is where all the
files and data and all this other things
can get stored so this video is gonna
cover it pretty completely and so sit
back get yourself a glass of water if
you need and we'll get into it before I
dive into the details Who am I my name
is Scott Duffy there's a picture of me
on screen I do have a number of courses
on the enemy platform and I have over
40,000 students in those Microsoft Azure
specific platforms over 65,000 students
total
I do have arguably some of the most
popular Azure courses on the web so if
you look around at various options that
you have you'll see that my courses are
some of the most popular ones if you are
interested there are some links in the
description but for now let's get into
the details of Microsoft Azure and then
you can see if that's something you want
to learn more about so what is the cloud
now we don't know if you've been into
two IT technology for a long time but I
can actually remember the days when we
had servers in our office you can go
into the IT department they had a locked
room at the back and then you go in
there and they had racks of computers
and that would host at least some part
of our applications and so if something
went wrong you run back there they
opened the door you go inside and you're
basically pulling out a console and
trying to fix something on the fly in
production in within the Microsoft Azure
platform they call this on-premises
servers and it's sort of a coverall term
it could be the computers are in your
office maybe you use a hosting provider
a third party provider you might own the
machine or you might rent the machine in
any event you are entirely responsible
for this actual physical machine whether
the hosting provider owns it and you're
just the lease holder if you need
updates it's up to you if something's
broken you need to fix it that the
hosting provider is not going to be a
lot of help there they might be able to
switch over to new server but it becomes
a bit of a
a hassle okay so we've got this
on-premises concept where with four
servers are in your office you actually
have to pay for an advance - when you
had racks of computers in your office
you know you you shelled out twenty
thousand fifty thousand dollars to Dell
and it took weeks for those things to
get shipped to you and then you have to
install all the software and build the
rack set up all the cables you owned it
you leased it it's it's you you're
responsible for everything now when
you've got sites like Amazon AWS and
Microsoft Azure you can at least move
some of that responsibility to a
third-party company and so you can see
on screen there's a little diagram
you've got your networking layer these
the servers and the hard disks and even
the the virtualization which we'll talk
about in a second
that's all responsible by Microsoft now
it's to you it's still like having a
server where you've got operating
systems you've got any apps that you
need your code your data everything that
you runs inside the server that's called
infrastructure as a service and so you
you can order these things in minutes
you can we'll I'll show you in a little
while setting up a virtual machine can
be done in 15 minutes and it doesn't
take weeks for a server to be
constructed and sent to you and then
installed and plugged in it's all
software ok and that's why it's called a
virtual machine so while we have an
operating system there might be other
people running on those servers as well
in Microsoft takes care of making sure
that we're all isolated and that we all
feel like we've got an entire CPU to
ourselves and all that wonderful stuff
so it looks acts behaves like a real
server ok that's what a virtual machine
is
and it's actually relatively easy to
migrate a self-hosted physical machine
into a server virtual machine Microsoft
provides a virtual machine preparation
tool to take to backup that server save
it in a format that's you know Asher
would understand and then you just
upload it and you can spin that up back
up and it's just like you have your
machine running okay so once we got to
this cloud state and we can create and
in stop virtual servers in an instant
literally within minutes
that's a game-changing technology right
and that's when you've got all of these
start ups you know the the startup craze
that happens in Silicon Valley happens
because these companies can be started
they don't need $50,000 to create
servers they can have an idea on a
Friday spin up some machines do some
coding over the weekend and by Monday
have something kind of working that they
can demonstrate to their friends and
demonstrate to investors etc and then
when something's not working they can
turn it off in the charges stop right
things like that so that was the
infrastructure as a service and that's
what whether they're called virtual
machines we're also gonna get into this
other concept which is called platform
as-a-service
you can see in the image on the screen
a lot more of that gets managed by
Microsoft so now the operating system
itself is out of your control you don't
know what version of Windows you're
running and if it needs an upgrade
that's not your responsibility any kind
of applications that run behind the
scenes the runtime libraries and all
that stuff DLLs those are all also
managed by Microsoft all you responsible
for is your own code and your own data
so that takes off your shoulders the
burden of a lot more ok that's called
platform as-a-service it's a relatively
new model I mean Microsoft had this out
there for several years but it's it's
getting into this more and more about
leaving the technical
physical stuff to the experts and you
just worry about the applications okay
so the basic application would pretty
much be the same as if you're running it
in a virtual machine I mean there are
some changes to it but you just get rid
of the rest and that's and that's a more
ideal state so that's just really
touching a little bit on what the cloud
is and what Microsoft Azure is so we've
got this concept of being able to create
computing resources you know within
Microsoft's data center and they can do
that within minutes and we can do that
either as a virtual machine that we can
control or just as code that we upload
and let Microsoft run but that's just
touching the surface of what a jerk and
ooh Azure actually has over a hundred
different services but some you know
virtual machine is just one of them Web
Apps is one of them and so there are a
hundred other different services that
Microsoft provides that you can plug and
play into your applications so if you
need in a CDN which is a content
delivery network you can go into Azure
and create yourself a CDN you need
storage of course you can go in and and
create yourself a a blob container where
you can put your files if you need a
database you can get sequel database
several different types of databases
within the cloud and as you design your
applications there's so many different
things you can plug together like a big
Lego set with tons of different shaped
pieces that you can build together for
your solution another concept within
cloud computing as I can see on screen
here is that Asscher is now positioned
itself all over the world so there are
literally more than a dozen locations
within Canada United States but we also
can scroll down they have a location in
Brazil they're now building out half a
dozen locations in Western Europe
they're planning South Africa which will
be exciting there's everything with from
within India from within the
asia-pacific region and Australia so you
can see here wherever you're located
wherever your customers are located you
can get computing resources
in that location in general the closer
that you can get those computing
resources to the customers that use them
the faster things are going to be the
other advantage of this of course is
that you can protect yourself from
disasters and so that you can have
resources not only in North America but
within Europe and within Asia that are
backed up and if something was to happen
wind does happen from time to time where
there's a power outage or some type of
broken cable within a data center and of
course these companies do their best to
make sure there's not a single point of
failure
but if anything happens to your
application in one area if you architect
your application correctly you'll have
it already running in another area and
you'll just be a flipping a switch to
get that location up and running and so
you have you know you can't do that with
an on-premises data center you can
hardly do that with hosting companies
how hard would it be for you to create a
server in North America and to create a
server in for instance Japan or within
Australia as a backup I mean you
wouldn't you would need two contracts
and traveling around the world and all
that stuff so there's it just makes a
lot of things very very much easier so
now that I've sort of prepared you or
sold you on this benefits of using cloud
computing I should mention also that in
a lot of cases it can be significantly
cheaper a lot of companies are moving to
the cloud specifically to save money and
so Microsoft let's go into the pricing
section here and I'll give you an
example right so if we were to
if we were to go into the virtual
machine section and we were to look at a
basic a one-size instance so pay as you
go you can see that
for general purpose right d-a-d instance
types they're looking at about 10 cents
an hour and if we change I think we can
we can change this to display by month
depending on the operating system
Windows OS depending on the region we
can see here that I want to see by month
we can see here that you can get
computers from as low as $14.99 and
clusters use load-balancing etc so with
this type of pricing a lot of companies
are finding that their infrastructure
costs are dropping in half or dropping
in quarter but the real flexibility is
being able to turn off and on these
resources since you are paying in the
case of Microsoft you're paying by the
minute and they round down to the
nearest minute basically you can if you
need a computing resource only for 45
minutes you're only going to pay for 45
minutes and that's some of the bigger
advantages of cloud computing we'll get
back to the lesson in just a second but
first I want to remind you that I have a
number of courses on Microsoft Azure on
the udemy platform if you're interested
in learning more I even have courses for
absolute beginners as well as a number
of certification courses there are over
40,000 students in my Azure courses so
I'm sure you're gonna find something
that you like click the link in the
video description to learn more and now
back to it alright so let's get into the
free account
Microsoft has recently changed this you
can still sign up for an azure account
for free you can always sign up for a
national account for free if you use the
correct link by looking at Google Azure
Microsoft Azure free
in the search engine and I get up a link
that brings me to this page if you sign
up for an Azure account through a link
like this you'll get $200 in credit in
your account where you can use Azure
products and you have to use that $200
than the first 30 days and this is going
to allow you to use some of these
resources that have prices associated
with them for minutes or for hours and
not actually get charged by it okay
now Microsoft recently identified and
updated a list of products that you can
get twelve months for free within your
your first year so when you create this
as your free account you get 200 credits
there's going to be a number of products
that you can get access to for the first
year and then there's also free tiers of
products that you can that just never
charge you so for instance for the web
app which we started talking about in
the beginning there is a free tier for a
web app and so you can create code up to
upload code and you'll just never get
charged for that for years so you can
use these sets of things to build your
solution although if you're in business
and you're trying to save save money you
still need to spend some money and so
you know some of these things just cost
money again with the free account if you
run out of your $200 then basically the
services stop and you'd have to then
pick a plan in order to start getting
charged so they're not trying to sneak
sneak charges into you you actually have
to upgrade in order to get into a plan
where you can where you can pay okay so
go into your search engine search for
Microsoft Azure free and a Microsoft
advertises but there's also links that
will take you to this as your free
account page next up we're gonna go to
actually I'll just start up a new tab
here and let's see portal a sure com
okay so that's the URL for the Microsoft
Azure portal it's portal Microsoft com
now if you've created an account using
this or you will have an existing
account then you're gonna have to login
this is the new login style and I'm
going to select this I do have a
password manager so I don't need to
remember these things and so I will
paste my password
goes through the login process and we
can see this is this happens to be my
account that I use for testing purposes
here for courses and training so I do
have a number of resources that already
exist you might find that
you've got no resources hopefully you've
got no cost and and your dashboard is
going to be fairly plain now dashboards
the good thing about this is it's
completely editable and so if you're
thinking that this health and health
help and support will never be used off
the dashboard you can just click the X
here and have that moved if you want to
move things around you can also
customize it
there's put the resource groups on here
and so you can you can do a number of
remove that maybe we'll move this down
here so it's very easy to make this the
way that you want and things that might
be you'd more useful to you now there's
a couple of different ways to to search
around for this interface one is there's
a search box off the top and if you just
start searching for things like if I
want to look at virtual machines start
typing virtual and you'll see that
free certain there's under free services
virtual machine is classic we're not
going to use the classic model I'll
explain that services there's other
results for that you can also find
documentation in there or we go over to
the left side and we can see like for
instance virtual machines as already
identified as a menu item by going there
I'll see that I have one virtual machine
but I can then this is where I can say
add and create a virtual machine I can
also go into the marketplace so by
saying new and you'll see it says azure
marketplace I can actually search for it
in here if I know the category I can go
right to the category or I can say see
all see there's so many different ways
to get to resources Microsoft featuring
Red Hat Linux is their virtual machine
but I want to start off with a Windows
virtual machine so I'm going to search
for Windows and you can see here that
we've got Server 2016 Server 2012
there's a couple of Windows 10 editions
I always used to like to use Server 2008
of course that's starting to get a
little bit old but that's a familiar
operating system for me
if I was to click it I can get into the
creation process right from here
to create a Windows Server 2008 r2 sp1
virtual machine now inside of this
creation process is where I set all the
settings how I the size that I choose
how much I'm going to pay etc you'll see
in various places with the imager this
mention of the classic model versus the
resource manager model now as the name
implies the classic model is an older
style of resource creation several years
ago Microsoft introduced this a resource
manager model and they've slowly been
migrating services from the classic
model to the resource manager model it's
getting to the point soon where you
won't be able to create resources in the
classic model so already some resources
are no longer available for creation in
the classic model and so I would say to
you if you're just getting into Azure if
you don't have any pre-existing virtual
machines or networks that you're always
always always going to use the resource
manager model this is the current way of
doing things it's a future way of doing
things
Microsoft holds on to the classic model
because a lot of customers may already
have classic virtual machines running
and it might be very difficult for them
to migrate from the classic style to the
resource manager style there's effort to
it and costs and things like that so
Microsoft keeps it around but you should
have no reason at this point to choose
the classic style and you'll be missing
out on a number of features and
functions and at some point you'll be
forced to to migrate right so a resource
manager
style you have the option but you really
don't have an option I'm not going to
create this for now we're gonna do that
in a few minutes
but this is how you would create a
Windows Server 2008 so we've touched on
briefly this concept of creating virtual
machines virtual machines fall under the
compute category so when I go into
compute here I can see the options from
Windows
over Red Hat Linux Ubuntu a sequel
server virtual machine and there are
literally thousands of sequel images to
choose from so Microsoft provides a
number of them but third party companies
like Red Hat canonical and you can see
on screen for PS a five nine software
lots of companies provide images that
Microsoft puts in as marketplace that
counts as compute ok so it could be a
sequel server instance running on top of
Windows ok so if I click on this you'll
see that it's a sequel server 2017
edition on Windows Server 2016 so it's a
combination so that's all considered
compute but what else does Microsoft
provide now it's very important in this
day and age to put your your compute
instances on networks right now networks
are the fundamental backbone of security
within Microsoft if you create a network
you can restrict who has access to it
this is where the firewall settings are
set what kind of traffic comes in what
charter traffic is allowed to leave if
something is allowed to communicate to
this the computers running on this
network it's set inside the network now
so basically every virtual machine that
you're going to create you're going to
have to put that onto a network now
Express route is a technology that
Microsoft provides companies so they can
have extremely fast connections into
Azure and private connections you're
essentially setting up a fiber optic
connection between yourself and a nice P
and that is P has a connector high speed
connection to Microsoft already traffic
manager is a type of load balancer that
runs at the global level you can send
traffic for people in Europe to your
London data center and you can send
traffic for people who aren't in Europe
to the United States etc you can set
Geographic and speed and other reasons
for sending people to different
applications and so we've got lots and
lots of different networking
options okay so when we get into it you
get into a deeper you can set all of
those fun things Citrix is in here
barracudas in here actual firewalls
software firewalls stuff like that
okay storage accounts we talked about
this is where you can put your data in
your files and so you've got everything
from a data Lake which is one of the
newer Microsoft data solutions you've
got cosmo DB you're back to the recovery
vaults are in here and even just your
regular plain old boring storage
accounts which are blobs and tables and
things like that Microsoft provides a
number of web apps and web services app
service environments which is like a
hosted thing where you can have a number
of applications running within a single
host site courses CMS all this stuff is
available as platform as a service so
you can sort of see there's just
literally hundreds of services that are
available to you to build your solution
so let's go get into the fun bit now and
to create our first virtual machine so
I'm sorry I'm gonna go back to the
dashboard here I'm gonna say new I'm
gonna choose compute I'm gonna say C all
and I'm gonna choose I'm gonna choose
Windows Server 2012 as the virtual
machine okay
there is a way I can actually say just
windows right Windows Server and then I
get the selection of all the different
types of windows so you can see I've got
everything from - 2008 2012 2016 several
versions that our data center the the r2
and the non-art to the high-performance
clustering packs so if you're gonna have
you have a specific needs for using HPC
versions of Windows etc okay small discs
so there's there's at least a dozen or
two dozen options here for Windows I'm
gonna choose two
twelve are two okay so I'm going to make
sure it's on the resource manager model
which is the default and I'm going to
click create so let's create our first
virtual machine now we're presented with
four blades here and there's a number of
form fields on each of them on the
Settings tab on the basic settings tab
you have to give the virtual machine a
name so I'm going to call it as your SJ
d1 now this name only has to be unique
within your account it doesn't have to
be unique within all of Microsoft Azure
you'll see in some instances you have to
give you names that are unique across
all the Badger in this case this into
one now we're asked the first sort of
serious question we have to is which
type of hard disk we want now there are
two types there's the solid-state drive
that is SSD that is as we know flash
drive which is faster to access and it's
slightly more expensive so there are
some trade-offs here the other one each
is a hard disk which is a splinting
spinning magnetic platter sorry and you
know the traditional hard drive it's a
little bit cheaper the i/o rates are a
little bit slower the operations per
second you've got just different limits
so we get into the Microsoft
documentation and if you need to really
do this for your job and for some
serious purpose you really understand
the trade-offs between solid-state and
making it a hard disk I'm gonna choose
solid-state now because this is a
Windows machine I need a username and
password I'm going to use our username
and password that I commonly use for
demonstration purposes so forgive me as
I type it in here okay so the username
the passwords have to match now as far
as description goes if you created that
free account like I showed you you'll
have the free subscription I'm using a
pay-as-you-go subscription which means
that this when I create this this will
actually cost me a little bit of money
hopefully once I created this video I
can stop the virtual machine I'll tell
you a little bit about how charges work
so we've said we saw in the earlier of
this video that virtual machines have a
price okay so and so basically when you
when they're running you're being
charged for the virtual machine per hour
and when they're not running you're not
being charged but there is a storage
account well we'll get into that in
another blade here but we do have to
create a storage account to store the
VHD virtual hard disk file and so you're
always going to be charged for the usage
of storage so for the machine itself
you're only charged when it's running
and for the storage you're always
charged now comments the next question
in terms of resource group we haven't
talked about resource groups before
resource groups are part of the Azure
resource model and I did tell you this
is the new way of creating resources the
Azure resource model and what it does is
it allows you to organize your resources
into groups they're called resource
groups you can have you know virtual
machines and app service plans and
storage accounts and virtual networks a
lot of different types of resources will
allow you to choose a resource almost
everyone actually except for the
sufferers as service options so you
create your resources into a resource
group this allows you to track them by
project for instance so let's say you
have five different websites well you
can create five different resource
groups and be able to track spending and
resource utilization based on those
individually you can delete all
resources based on the resource group
name for instance and and it's just
another organization structure you can
create security rules you can you can
basically restrict people to a certain
resource
so we have to give this resource group a
name I'm gonna call it a Zed sjg RG
okay based on similar to my virtual
machine name now location we talked
about in a previous previous in this
video that Microsoft currently has 42
regions of the world that contain data
centers and there are multiple data
centers in each of those regions and so
there are not quite 42 options in this
truck ducts now why aren't there exactly
42 well the for instance there's a
number of government locations so the
Department of Defense US Department of
Defense US government has several in the
United States here US government Arizona
there are those locations and then for
instance China China north and China
East that is actually it's a sure but
it's run with another company there's a
Chinese company that you have to sign a
service agreement with and so you're not
just able to deploy Roy's resources into
China obviously there's some certain
specific rules around dealing with China
so those are a couple of examples
occasionally Microsoft will have
restrictions such as being able to book
resources in India if you're not an
Indian company or Australia but you'll
have to check the documentation as of
now you can choose India you can choose
Australia I prefer to choose the u.s.
once these eastern US and central u.s.
those have all the features different
data centers have different support
different features and so for instance
not every like maybe if there's a
hundred services in Azure the u.s. East
one does all hundred but perhaps
Australia only has 50 or 75 of them
right so not every service Microsoft
offers is available in every region so
do you'll have to check on that
finally you can save significant amount
of money look forty percent of your fee
is going to be a Windows license and so
if you are part of a Windows book
licensing program and you're able to
devote a license to this you can use
your batch license from Microsoft
directly in your Azure account now don't
set this unless your your hundred
percent sure cuz licensing is a pretty
serious deal for Microsoft
now the second blade is going to ask us
to choose a size you'll see here that we
chose a flash drive this the solid-state
drive and so we're only going to be
having options for solid-state servers
okay so that that there's still dozens
to choose from like if I was to go 3 6 9
12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 okay I'm running
out of numbers here there's at least 50
of them
and they range in price from about $13
all the way into the thousands of
dollars two thousand four thousand
dollars per month so if I was to choose
this type of server with a two hundred
gigabytes of RAM for virtual CPUs
sixty-four data disks this would cost me
over a hundred dollars a day right now
I'm not gonna choose that one but will
choose one that's decent I'm hoping that
I'll shut this down as soon as I'm done
with it
so let's choose the hundred dollars a
month one that is one virtual CPU 3.5
gigabytes of RAM up to four data disks
optionally seven gigabytes of SSD
storage all right I'm gonna choose that
one
now we're next up on the third blade
they're asking us about availability set
availability set is Microsoft's way of
indicating to them which servers should
be physically separated within
Microsoft's environment so that if a
disaster was to happen that only one of
them might be affected so if you choose
to create multiple sets of servers and
put them all in the same availability
set then Microsoft will take some effort
to separate them across what they're
called fault domains and update domains
we're not gonna do a bill reset for a
single VM it wouldn't make sense for
that now manage disks Microsoft has a
couple of different ways of dealing with
storage with with the unmanaged disks
you need to create a storage account
like I said you're gonna be charged for
that create a storage account and the
virtual machine files get stored into
your storage account using the manage
disks then Microsoft will provision your
storage within their own storage
accounts and then they are going to take
care of maintaining and managing it
making sure that the the files are big
enough and all that stuff so there's
there's some difference between managed
and unmanaged of course managed to serve
a little bit more
depends it could be more expensive if
you're gonna use it fully or it could be
cheaper that's it's based on your paid
based on usage now network we talked
about virtual network being software
quibbling to routers and cables when by
default when I'm creating a virtual
machine it's going to create a virtual
network a brand new one for me inside of
my resource group so you'll see here
it's created based on the name of the
resource group /v net it's creating a
brand new network a subnet is basically
contains the ranges of IP addresses and
in this case this is going to start at n
dot 0.16 0/24 is a full 255 IP addresses
and so this whole network if you're
familiar with networking at all is going
to take the full 10.0 at 16 at 0 all the
way to 10 at 0 16 dot 255 minus the
reserved IP addresses that microsoft
requires now this is important because
I'm going to need a public IP address if
I'm intending to use this web server the
server as a web server then I'm going to
need to access it from outside so it's
an optional but you're gonna need a
public IP address dynamic or at least in
order to access this from outside we'll
talk about dynamic and Static warring
the courses but in this case we just
need an IP address accessible from the
internet this is the network security
group I said the resource group is where
you create your firewall and it protect
who's coming in coming out so for on
this virtual network you're going to
have this resort this security group
assigned to it and we can open it up to
the full internet or we can restrict it
to certain IP addresses and do various
firewall things we'll skip the
extensions for now enable auto shutdown
so auto shutdown but I can I'm gonna do
that because I want to don't want to
forget but you can if you're gonna do a
virtual machine that's a
testing environment or development
environment it might be that you don't
want them the machine to live you know
after 8 p.m. or something like that so
I'm gonna see 11 p.m. whoops 11 p.m.
Eastern time and I don't need to be
notified monitoring diagnostics we won't
talk about that but that's some way of
getting reports out of this and if you
had Diagnostics that gets into a storage
account and click ok now it's just gonna
verify all of my settings and you can
see I'll scroll down here I'm going to
be charged 14 cents 15 cents Canadian
per hour for this so hopefully I only
use it for a couple of hours all of the
settings that I've chosen now I won't
click on this but there's this thing
called templates arm as yours add the
Azure resource manager templates this is
another benefit of the arm model where
you can have JSON files that will
contain all of these settings I can
download that and save it to my local
machine and anytime I need to create
this exact same virtual machine maybe
with a slightly different name I can
just use the template and I don't have
to go through this whole process so I'm
gonna click create this gonna take about
15 minutes so I'll pause the video and
when we come back we'll have a virtual
machine we'll get back to the lesson in
just a second but first I want to remind
you that I have a number of courses on
Microsoft Azure on the udemy platform if
you're interested in learning more I
even have courses for absolute beginners
as well as a number of certification
courses there are over 40,000 students
in my Azure courses so I'm sure you're
gonna find something that you like click
the link in the video description to
learn more and now back to it so it's
been a few minutes and the virtual
machine has been created you can see a
sure SGD one I go into it I can see that
it did take some effort to start but now
that it's running
the number of CPU cycles the number of
disk operations seems to have gone to a
standard level so this is our our first
virtual machine you can see that it's a
Windows machine
the ds1 v2 instant size we do have a
public IP address so I should be able to
connect to that machine through this IP
address from my computer at home without
any special VPN or any special
networking you can see on the top here
there's a connect button what that will
do is it will download the RDP file so
that we can use a remote desktop to
connect to this machine and that's what
I'm gonna do so it downloads it and I'm
gonna use a remote desktop from my
machine I have to accept the security of
this unknown machine and I do have to
login and remember I gave it some
username and password when I created it
and so I have to use that username and
password to log into it and then I'm
gonna say ok I do have to accept that
this computer is unknown so yes I accept
and you can see here windows remote
desktop is running and it's connecting
for the first time so when when you
connect to Windows for the first time it
does have to do some stuff for you now
when I first log in it's basically the
first time you're logging into Windows
and then this machine has nothing
installed on it it's a completely empty
Windows machine there's no application
software it's basically got nothing so
I'm not gonna turn on remote finding
when you log into a Windows server the
first time like I said it's got nothing
so I want to add this as a web role so
I'm gonna say add roles next role-based
this is the local server and what I want
is I want this to be a web server and so
if I look at the list of roles I can see
web server on the list include
management tools okay
so I've chosen web server if I need
anything else if you need it to be an
application server DNS server etc etc
you can do that Active Directory server
ok so I chose it to be a web server now
when you're setting up a web server you
need to pick certain features right so
if you wanted to have ftp client dotnet
right the web the web elements of dotnet
so even ASP 4.5 for instance there's a
lot of options that you can choose for
the purposes of this test we don't
really need to get too specific but if
you're doing this for for work you may
want to look into here and get into
whether you want authentication and
redirects and FTP server etc I'm going
to leave that and I'm gonna say install
now this does take a few minutes so
we're gonna let this install the web
server is and we'll come back to that in
a second
so that didn't take too long I can close
this wizard and minimize this now I
should be able to find a browser like
Internet Explorer
on this machine use the recommended
settings and I should be able to say
localhost localhost is the default of
this machine okay so I brought up a
hello this is the default web page for
is so besides calling this machine by
localhost you can also refer to the
machine by name so this says a Juris JD
one and it still works brings up the
default web page for calling it by name
one thing that doesn't work at this
stage is calling it by its IP address
isn't that strange that we have a public
IP address but on the machine itself
were not able to bring up the default
web page using the IP address now what
this machine is doing this virtual
machine is going out to the Internet to
look up this IP address and then we're
coming back inside of a sure essentially
okay it doesn't know that this is its
own IP address and so it attempts to
leave itself and then navigate back to
itself so something is blocking traffic
from getting to this machine if I go
into the Windows Firewall you know every
version of Windows these days comes with
a version of Windows Firewall and Azure
virtual machines are no exception you
can see that by enabling the web rules
that are both port 80 and port 443 which
is HTTP and HTTPS traffic it's already
configured I do not have to do anything
to allow port 80 to enter this machine
by going to the iis settings for this
website and we look at the bindings we
can see that it does accept port 80
traffic under any IP address under any
hostname so there's no filters in IAS
that's restricting traffic under a
certain name if you were to host
multiple websites on the same virtual
machine you would need to start playing
with these filters within the bind
so let's investigate why traffic is not
being able to get here under this direct
IP address so heading back to the azure
portal we have the virtual machine now I
mentioned that the virtual machine has a
public IP address but it also has a
virtual network and a subnet and it's
the virtual network in the subnet that
has security attached to it so if I go
visit the virtual network I can see I
can see this I can see the network
interface for my virtual machine is here
so that's the private IP address for it
what we want though is we're gonna want
to see the network security groups so
you'll see here for the I address range
we have this but there are no network
security groups so let's create a
network security group or we can use why
don't we use the existing one so I'm
going to sign the existing network
security group to this we're gonna have
to visit to it and I can show you how
the settings go okay
so let's close out of this let's go into
the resource is resource groups let's
see let's go into the resource group
that we created and let's look at the
network security group by default the
network security group has only one rule
basically it is allowing RDP traffic
which is the remote desktop which is
what we were doing over port 3389 it
does allow other machines on virtual
networks to connect it does allow load
balance or traffic and but it basically
allows only external RDP traffic and
then denies all other traffic there's
only one port open to the public
Internet okay then and then the outbound
rules is it basically allows any
outbound traffic okay so let what we
need to do then is we need to allow port
80 we need to allow port 80 into this
okay now this is we can set up a very
sophisticated mapping and go back to the
basic view I want to allow HTTP traffic
over port 80 at one of the highest
priorities the lower the number of the
higher the priority so let's allow HTTP
traffic and it's going to create that
rule for us we'll give it a second to do
that now you can see that HTTP traffic
is just the name but over port 80 Pro
TCP protocol from any source to any
destination this is going to allow port
80 traffic while we're here why don't we
allow HTTP traffic okay so HTTP is port
443 we have to choose a new priority so
I'll choose 101 and that'll create the
rule for that okay so we just added two
new rules I'm gonna close out of this
I'm gonna go back to the virtual network
and go back into the subnet just to make
sure that we have the narrow security
group as azure SJD 1 and as
gee okay that's great
okay so by doing this network security
group rule and attaching it to the
virtual network we should now be
allowing traffic to come into the
network which of which this virtual
machine lives into this network so I'm
going to go back to the virtual machine
and recall we could not access this
website by its URL let's click it and
right away it now resolves so by local
host by server name or by IP address we
can access it if I go back to my
computer and access it you can see that
the same page loads up so right to this
moment we have got a web server running
within a virtual machine in Microsoft
Azure and it really wasn't that
difficult to get that started so you can
imagine all of the services you can
create in a machine that you're just
renting by the hour and you can create
pretty granular security settings if
you're concerned about that but it's
pretty easy to do with in Azure we'll
get back to the lesson in just a second
but first I want to remind you that I
have a number of courses on Microsoft
Azure on the udemy platform if you're
interested in learning more I even have
courses for absolute beginners as well
as a number of certification courses
there are over 40,000 students in my
Azure courses so I'm sure you're gonna
find something that you like click the
link in the video description to learn
more and now back to it so we just
created a virtual network a virtual
machine and network interface public IP
address and a security group and showed
you how to create a web server now if
you recall this is going to run a couple
of hundred dollars a month right so I
don't want to that expense to continue
and so I want to get rid of these things
now one thing I can do one thing that I
should point out is that I'm being
charged for the execute
this virtual machine by the minute
unless it stopped so as soon as I go
over here and I click the stop button
it's gonna take a moment or two to stop
it but basically that's the charge for
this virtual machine as far as the
computation or power goes will end as
soon as I click the stop button so
Microsoft will calculate to the minute
basically how much I owe them based on
that or if you're using the free plan
then it'll just deduct it from your
credits you see here now it stopped and
now it's deallocating it from its
instance memory okay now if I wanted to
delete all of these and there's probably
no reason to have these kicking around
if I'm never going to use this again I
could delete the individual resources
but of course the virtual machine has a
network card and the network card has an
IP address and the that lives on a
network and things have to be done in a
certain order but I can delete the
individual resources or I can just
delete the whole group of them okay so
this virtual machine is still stopping
sitting down but you know what I'm gonna
live on the edge here so I'm going to
delete the whole resource group which
should delete the storage account the
virtual machine the virtual network and
everything that I've done okay so if I
say delete there are seven resources in
this group it's just going to delete
that see how easy that is
I'm going to let that run because I
don't need to be watching this while
it's deleting obviously now if you
remember we said that we are going to
cover and I'll pull don't mind me I pull
my presentation in here we're gonna
cover the cloud as you're signing up for
a free account using the azure portal
creating your first virtual machine and
using that virtual machine as a web
server so we've done this so far in this
video if we want to really have a
complete picture let's talk about Web
Apps and let's see how easy it is to
webapp now if you remember from that
earlier in this video I talked about how
a virtual machine is called
infrastructure-as-a-service
how Microsoft will give you a
virtualized environment but it's
basically the same it's equivalent as
having a machine on your premises that
you can just remote into ok this it's
pretty much similar to that you're
responsible for operating system updates
you're responsible for installing
software you're responsible for
monitoring and logging and backups and
things like that if we get into the web
app world we'll see how a lot of that
stuff gets lifted off of our shoulders
and all we need to do is just send
Microsoft the code so I'm gonna put that
away go back to our portal so let's go
into the new section again but instead
of going into the compute section we're
going into a web and mobile first option
within featured is web map but I'm going
to show you the entire category here so
within a web app web and mobile it does
include a storage account web app logic
app a bunch of other other things that
are included as a web site maybe this is
an example but we can create even a
wordpress website as a web app where
Microsoft is setting you up with that
that platform okay
Drupal other CMS CMS's are available I'm
just gonna go straight for a web app
let's just get right into creating it so
we get the familiar button notice that
there's no concept of classic model
versus a resource model web app is a web
app so this will be created in the
resource model I hit create now in this
particular case we don't get so many
options there's only these fields and
then when I click create it'll get
created so I'm gonna call this a Zed sjg
new web app now notice that there's this
dart as your website's dotnet URL
underneath it this means that it's a
fully qualified domain name this
means that this name has to be unique to
all of Asia so you can probably cannot
pick some very simple names you're gonna
have to make something a little bit
unique in order to get this web app
running but this means that you're gonna
have a public URL and a public domain
name by default with this those in my
page you go subscription again if you're
running in the free account it'll be in
your free of scripts a subscription you
can create a new resource group or use
an existing I'm perfectly fine creating
a new wait resource for group for this
and it's named a resource group the same
as the app Microsoft recently introduced
Linux Web Apps up until now you've only
had the option for Windows it is
important to note that Microsoft allows
several different languages for your app
and so you can have your you know
c-sharp app compiled in visual
studio.net but you can also use Java and
nodejs
PHP things like that obviously if it
supports WordPress WordPress as a PHP
environment and so they do have both
Windows and Linux options for your web
apps app service plan now web apps can
be created this is the free plan that's
set by default I have an existing one
called WordPress app
but let's look at the pricing tiers so
this is just like a hosting environment
where you're gonna have different prices
it's kind of like the virtual machine'
pricing as well there is a free tier and
so if that's something that you're you
want to test in you can test on the free
tier I wouldn't recommend this for
production apps there's an extremely
cheap $11 a month shared tier but then
you're going to get into the real
production quality basic standard and
premium versions okay and even up till
isolated which guarantees you your own
hardware okay but we can see here that
basically there's P 1 and P 1 B 2 they
just recently announced the next
generation of web app hosting and it
just sort of doubled the RAM here let's
do a standard web app for now they're a
member we could do a free one too but I
think that takes a bit longer but you'll
see here that you can have a web app you
can get your own custom domain so if you
have your own Russia sure domain name it
has SSL support you can have up to 10
copies of your application running that
10 instances means that if you need some
scaling you can then get a second or a
third instance running up to ten
instances in the basic plan adopted
premium has up to 20 instances for
scaling it supports daily backups
premium plan has 50 times day backups ok
these slots now slots are really cool
feature where you know how you can have
like development environment a staging
environment production environment slots
are a way of deploying your code into
this production environment but not
having it go live right away ok so if
you want to deploy something and then
send a link to the client or send a link
to your boss or send the link to the
business and say here's a demo of the
new features if you give your approval I
can make it go live right away now
that's one useful for it the other use
for it is some applications have us a
bit of downtime
like a little startup cost so maybe it
takes 45 seconds for your application to
really get up to full speed you might
want to do that startup stuff in its own
environment and then swap out to
production once it's fully up and ready
Traffic Manager we said before is a load
balancer that runs at a global scale so
it within the DNS system you can have
environments that go down and then the
traffic manager will take care of
directing traffic to a different region
entirely or it could just be having your
application running in different regions
of the world and the PERT and as the
person goes there they get directed to
the closest region right so there's lots
of close to coolness there so we get
again the choice of where to run this
and gonna run this in central us so give
it a name a Zed new app plan why not
select ok and finally application
insights this allows you as a developer
to monitor internal events happening
within your application so this provides
a little bit of more telemetry as they
say for you to detect and diagnose
issues of your web apps from the
application insights which is its own
analytics tab ok application insights
has a charge to it and again you can run
it in o there say there's only six areas
of the world that currently support it
and central isn't one of them so my
applications insights will be located in
eastern US when I click the Create
button it's gonna go off and create me a
new web app with nothing in it and when
I come back to this video we will deploy
something into this web app
so fairly quickly our web app was able
to get created and I'm into it now you
can see here our statuses running in the
central us the web app has been given a
URL and it was the app name that I
created when I created it if I was to
click it I can see my Microsoft Azure
web page saying your app service is up
and running so I have an empty web app
I've not deployed any code to it and
this is the default page you'll get when
there's nothing that you've deployed
into it now there are a couple of ways
to deploy into a web app right like I
said the purpose of a web app is to
upload your code and have Microsoft run
it within their web now Microsoft
supports several different languages
dotnet being one of them but you can
also do PHP Java and nodejs etc ok
there's a whole list of languages we do
have an FTP account so if we wanted to
ftp into the server and upload the files
we can certainly do that so you know
HTML files or PHP files or etcetera like
that can just be uploaded by FTP the
most common way I would say is if you're
a visual studio developer is to just
directly publish the application to
asher from within visual studio if you
want to try this Microsoft has a visual
studio comm website and you can download
the free Visual Studio community edition
and this is a full-featured
IDE you do not need to register for
professional enterprise versions of
Visual Studio and so you can set this up
connect it to asher and published from
directly inside Visual Studio I'm gonna
do that and we'll show it to you now
when you're running the Visual Studio
installer be sure and choose both
asp.net development and azure
development at least you may want to do
a window
apps development or the universal
platform and some other cool stuff but
at the minimum to develop for Azure
you're going to want the web development
options and the azure development
options so choose that when your ins
doing the azure is that the visual
studio installer so we've downloaded
installed Visual Studio 2017 and we need
to connect to our Microsoft account in
order to sign in for it we don't need to
but we should probably do it now I'm
going to connect to my normal Microsoft
account it's just out of force of habit
perhaps I use a different account for a
sure so when we log into it we're going
to have to connect it to asher
separately and this is also if you've
already got Visual Studio setup how you
would connect to a sure okay so I'm just
gonna say start Visual Studio preparing
for first use
and that's pretty pretty quick now if we
go into these on the left side it says
server Explorer before I start creating
a project I want to show you how to
connect to Microsoft Azure and that's
done through server Explorer you'll see
here that it says asher and it's
connecting to my personal one I want to
say connect and instead of using that
one I'm gonna use the one that I use for
training and you'll see how easy it is I
just i right clicked it said connect and
it's going to switch over hopefully to
my other one and it does okay now we
should be able to see the app service
that we created under the app service
folder underneath of asher here so if i
open this up it says refreshing it's
connecting to a j''r and you'll see that
the AZ
SJD new web app app that we created it
does exist there now right now we don't
have any code to put there I'm going to
create I'm gonna use one of the default
as your web apps to deploy there okay so
I'm going to say new project a Visual
Studio web and I'm going to see not core
but web application and I call it like
test web app okay create directory but I
don't need to put it on to source
control now I'm going to
and I'd create a default I'm going to
create a single page application just I
guess it doesn't matter if the webform
or single page application it'll add you
know MVC and web api and things like
that okay this is basically the template
it's going to grab a template of a
single page application you'll see that
it's installing the template here
now if we were to just build a solution
and run it locally we should be able to
see that see the build succeeded and
we're gonna see what a default
application looks like I just hit f5 on
my keyboard or I could have pressed this
application is starting you can see in
the background the application is doing
something and and basically here is the
application that we're going to deploy
okay so it's running on my local host I
can stop that now what I want to happen
is I want to publish this so I say
publish test web app you notice I
haven't made any changes to it and I
want to publish to Microsoft Azure and
I'm gonna say select existing I could
create a new web app directly within
Visual Studio but I'm going because I
already created one I'm going to say
select existing of course it's gonna
start up and it's gonna give me the
option so I'm going to publish it to my
web app that I created for this purpose
now we talked in the beginning about
deployment slots now I don't have any
all I have is the production slot so I
don't really have a choice but if I had
a staging slot or a user acceptance slot
or a development slide that's where I
would deploy to that individuals thought
and not into production this is gonna go
live as soon as it completes okay so I'm
gonna select that and I'm gonna say ok
it's asked it's downloaded the
deployment information and now I'm going
it's doing the deployment and if I
increase this page here we can see that
it's copying files to a temporary
location it's doing a web deploy it uses
a thing called SCM within Adger
to handle these deployments
so the deployment succeeded and actually
it launched it as soon as the deployment
succeeded and I can bring it over here
and we can see the webapp same as it was
running a localhost but this time it's
running in a Zed sjt new web app that as
your website subnet which is the URL so
this application has been successfully
deployed it looks like it's running the
way that I expect it to
I can click register I can go back to
the home page etc there's probably not
much functions if you don't log in but
now there's a help page so this is a
working functioning web app now it's
just the default template that came with
Visual Studio but I'm just demonstrating
that you can do a publish from Visual
Studio directly to Adger and don't even
need to login to the portal to do
anything once you've got your way about
creative we'll get back to the lesson in
just a second but first I want to remind
you that I have a number of courses on
Microsoft Azure on the udemy platform if
you're interested in learning more I
even have courses for absolute beginners
as well as a number of certification
courses there are over 40,000 students
in my Azure courses so I'm sure you're
gonna find something that you like click
the link in the video description to
learn more and now back to it so we have
now a functioning web app I'm going to
delete this resource group just as I did
for the virtual machine I'm gonna say I
don't need this anymore I don't want to
be charged for it we didn't really get
into the application insights but that's
okay but it's going to delete the app
service plan the app and the application
insights in one fell swoop
so we'll let that run now the final bit
that I wanted to talk about today was
storage storage is in my mind one of the
three core pillars of
the three core pillars are virtual
machines apps services and storage and
that's why we've covered this in this
video go into the new marketplace and
say storage we can see here there's a
number of features stuff I'm gonna say
see all and scrolling down we can see
all the different options that
Microsoft's recommending to us but what
we really want is a storage account and
that's sort of the first thing on the
top left so storage account I'm going to
say create now you have to give it a
name so azad SJD storage now notice that
it's got the court windows net all
storage accounts are publicly accessible
in terms of having a public domain name
that can be addressed from the web we
Microsoft does use security of course
and so that the contents of the storage
account are private generally unless you
open them or talk about the account kind
in a second
but the contents of the storage account
require from you note for you to have
authorization to get to it but the
storage account has a public URL so you
can write applications that access files
using this fully qualified domain name
or you could even use you know your own
domain name a custom domain name media
example.com to access your storage
account we're going to choose the
resource manager model of course now
account kind now a storage account is
the default and we would probably want
the Nuvi to kind there there I'll
explain the difference between v1 and v2
storage accounts the other type of surge
account is blobs now blob accounts only
allow blobs but this is the blob storage
is the account that you can actually
change the settings to public and it's
the only type of storage between the
three of them where you could have
contents available from the general
internet that do not require a special
key to access
okay so this is a wide open type storage
account for blobs for storage and
storage v2 you do need to have
authorization to see the files for a
regular storage account you're charged
by the gigabyte essentially for storage
for storage B to the per gigabyte charge
is a bit lower but there's an increased
charge for consumption in terms of bytes
in and bytes out okay reads and writes
essentially so if you've got data that
will be stored but not access frequently
storage v2 might be a cheaper option if
you have data which is stored and
accessed very frequently the v1 account
might be a cheaper option let's go with
the v2 account now Microsoft has a newer
thing that allows you to choose a
performance okay so this is again the
magnetic hard disk spinning platter hard
disk a little bit cheaper premium
storage is using the solid-state drives
SSDs okay you do have this concept of
replication for storage of e2 there's
only 3 replication options local
Geographic which is worldwide and read
only read access Geographic which allows
you to use this as a secondary backup a
storage account if we were to choose the
g1 storage we get a little we got an
extra option in terms of zone and
basically Microsoft's going to keep
three copies of your data by default in
a locally redundant storage and so if
the hard drive was to fail then
Microsoft's able to rebuild your storage
account without you even being notified
that basically they've got two other
copies of it and so you're they're not
gonna lose your data if you go into the
geo redundant storage that's six copies
three of them within a local region and
three of them stored outside of your
region so there's really lower less and
less chance that your data is going to
get lost of course there's a little bit
extra charge to use globally redundant
storage Mike rizal so recently
introduced this concept of hot in cool
access hot access means that the data is
ready for you and it's just sort of the
default what we've always been used to
the cool access is actually penalized as
you for needing to access the data and
with this and it's actually cheaper to
store your data but if you really need
to access it then you're gonna pay a
little bit more for those those access
and this is great for backups so you do
a lot of backups maybe you have lots of
data that never gets touched right so
you're gonna do a nightly backup of your
VM the only time you're really going to
go back and pull those nightly backups
of that VM is you know they're an
emergency or you've got some special
case that is not a regular occurrence
right so cool backups are great for in
frequently accessed data you're also
making a bit of a commitment there's a
penalty for deleting it so you've got a
30-day commitment or something like that
so but they're getting better for
backups hot storage is just for a
regular daily usage you can enforce
secure secure access eight says SSL
HTTPS why not
my subscription pay-as-you-go and first
storage account we can we can put in an
existing resource group or we can create
a new resource group again we can choose
the location for the storage account we
can block the storage to account to only
certain Narcis as an additional security
section setting and it's fairly new when
I create create then I will have a
storage account in my disposal it's all
that completed very quickly we now have
a storage account storage account
contains blobs blobs are basically
binary files and so any kind of file
that you can that you want
zip files or PDFs images videos you can
upload into your blob account files are
more like a traditional file server you
can actually connect to this machine
using Windows mapping and so if you've
got virtual machines and you need to use
the F Drive this could be your F Drive
and all virtual machines connect to the
same folder that's the kind of thing you
would put in their tables is a data data
storage similar to eight rows and
columns it's not exactly the same but
it's you can store data in tabular
format within a storage account and
finally queues we all know queues from
real life where you line up to go to the
bank
the first-come first-serve type of an
environment and so you can actually have
messages go into the queue and you have
a second application that reads from the
queue and processes those messages but
we're really much we're talking about
these types of things in a storage
account blobs being the most common if I
go into the blob service by default I've
got nothing in here we do we can create
containers okay so test container you'll
see here that
it's got its private so there's no
anonymous access blob allows read access
anonymously and the entire container can
be this is a public setting here okay so
I'm going to say that a fault is private
I don't necessarily want anyone to be
able to read my contents of my container
you go into the container and you can
upload files here
there's Mel you know you can do it
mostly programmatically but if you
wanted to upload your PDF your image or
video right within the portal you can
upload it into the container and then
you've got data files stored within
Azure that's accessible from your web
apps accessible from your virtual
machines accessible from anywhere you
need to access these files so that's
pretty much what I wanted to show you I
wanted to show you virtual machines I
wanted to show you a web apps and I want
to show you briefly how storage is
within Asher but there's so much more to
explore right there are if I said see
all in the marketplace there are
hundreds and hundreds if not thousands
of services hundreds of Microsoft
approved services and thousands if you
count the third parties that provide
services within the azure marketplace
and it's a big wonderful beautiful world
of data artificial intelligence Internet
of Things events security all sorts of
wonderful things
I do have a course as on Microsoft Azure
as you know and we just wanted to point
out to you here's my profile on
udemy.com
and I've got more than 65,000 students
15 courses in 12,000 reviews and you can
see that most of these courses are on
Microsoft Azure although I do have an
AWS one as well and the things called
TOGAF so if you want to check me out on
on udemy the link is in the description
below I want to thank you so much for
tuning in today much been my pleasure to
walk through asher try to explain cloud
to you try to show you some of the power
of azure and you can certainly have
rollback on this go back and watch it
again
try it yourself you know and if you're
really interested I have courses that
are beginners courses so Microsoft Azure
and cloud computing from absolute
beginnings to certification tests things
about serverless apps and all everything
in between so if that's your interest
please come and check me out on you to
me
thanks a lot and it's been a pleasure
talking today
