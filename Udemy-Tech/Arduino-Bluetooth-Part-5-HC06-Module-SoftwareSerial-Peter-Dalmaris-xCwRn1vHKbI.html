use the Bluetooth module hc0 six with
your Arduino and in each case we
connected it to the other owners
hardware serial port which is
implemented on pins 0 and 1 the problem
with this is that since 0 and 1 I are
also shared with the USB interface on
the other you know so each time we had
to upload a new sketch we had to unplug
the USB cable from the other you know so
that it doesn't conflict with the
Bluetooth module what I'll show you in
this lecture is how we can move the
Bluetooth module to any two of the other
digital pins on the Arduino and use an
alternative to the hardware serial port
which is a software serial port it's
essentially converting any two of the
Adina's other digital pins into another
uart port to another serial port and
therefore by doing that there is no
conflict with the hardware serial
interface that the USB port is using so
I'm going to unplug the battery and put
it aside and I'm going to use it for
this demonstration and I am going to
unplug the Bluetooth module from pins 0
and 1 and instead I'm going to connect
them just checking on my sketch to see
where I've implemented the software
serial interface and you can see here
that it's implemented on pins 10 and 11
and you can choose whichever ones you
like whichever hints happen to be
available in your circuit but in this
case we've got pin 10 which is they
receive and pin 11 which is the transmit
so I'm going to rewire the Bluetooth
module so that the receive pin which is
the red one will go to the new transmit
pin which I got into my sketch is 11 so
it's going to go into 11 and then the
orange wire which is connected to the
transmitted pin on the module that will
go to digital pin 10 on the other you
know it put the 11 back in there you go
dad so with this rewiring pin to 0 and 1
and no longer occupied so there is no
conflict between the Bluetooth module
and my USB interface so I can just plug
in my USB cable and it all works I'm
going to go ahead and upload the sketch
at this point just to make sure that
we've got that capability back ah sorry
I need to select the USB serial port for
the USB in which it was already set to
the Bluetooth module and then upload
again there you go all done now bring up
the serial monitor and it gives you that
we've got the readings and we've got a
hello world via the USB interface we're
not connected to the Bluetooth yet so
let's do that now then go to my
bluetooth preferences here's my hc0 6 I
will remove it
wait for my computer to find it again so
that I can connect to it they reduce
connect options and put in the code
and we are connected all right so we now
have both USB and bluetooth connections
available so to show you how the
Bluetooth connection still works I'm
going to close here do you know serial
monitor go back to tools change the port
to the Bluetooth port and bring up the
monitor again and you can see that it
work we're connected to the Bluetooth
device now and I can still control the
LED okay but what if we'd like to get
readings from the USB interface and from
the Bluetooth interface at the same time
well to do that we need to have two
serial monitors or two consoles
happening what I'd like to show you next
is how we can get data from both the USB
module and the Bluetooth module at the
same time using two different monitors
so on the Mac probably the easiest thing
to do is to configure the USB port for
the Arduino serial monitor just as per
normal like that so this one is coming
to us through the USB and then for the
Bluetooth to use the terminal and a
little utility called screen that allow
us to connect two serial devices just
going to move my windows down here for a
moment because I want to show you that
in the in the header of the example
sketch I've got information on how to
use the screen utility on Mac OS and on
Linux computers and if you're using
Windows then an alternative that you can
use is a utility should fix that little
typo called patty that allows you to do
the exact same thing and with patty you
can also have as many serial monitors as
you like so if you're using Windows then
I recommend
have a look at patty but I'm going to do
the demonstration using the screen
utility so it's very simple screen comes
with Mac OS and with Linux so you got to
do is to type in the name of the utility
and then see if you can find the USB
module to which you want to connect you
also need to specify the speed of the
connection so that is 9600 boards then
hit enter to connect via KHOU the
readings are coming through the USB
interface while I'm connected through
screen I can also type in my command so
H for example and the LED goes on any
other letter the LED goes off lowercase
H doesn't work it's got to be a capital
so as you can see now we've got both USB
and Bluetooth module operating at the
same time and on the computer I can
access both interfaces simultaneously so
in this lecture you learned about how to
use the simple low-cost hc0 six
Bluetooth breakout then our lives do
implement some pretty basic Bluetooth
applications in the next few lectures
aren't going to talk about the allele
Bluetooth Low Energy
it differences between ble and the
standard Bluetooth technology and of
course how you can use it with your
Arduino thanks for watching if you'd
