previous lecture we looked at least and
temples are very similar to lists the
only difference is that temples are not
mutable so you cannot change a table
these are used much more than tuples so
tuples are only using very specific
scenario so we will see some scenarios
throughout the course when we build the
real-world applications so you don't
have to worry about understanding when
to use a tuple in programming for now
anyway I want to show you the syntax and
so you can create a total like that so a
tuple just like lists they contain they
may contain different data types I say 3
4 and so on
oh sorry I was writing in the terminal -
shell so again you have strings numbers
and floats if you like whatever type
that you want you can pass in a tuple
and in a list and of course you can use
indexing for tuples as well so let's
access the last item and that will give
4.6 the difference is that you know
tuples they have some slight different
methods than lists so if you do dear at
least you see that least have much more
methods available than tuples so for
instance you can append items to list
you can clear the list and copy and
count count is available for tuples
because count doesn't change the data
type so it doesn't change the tuple it
just counts how many items are very
notable as I said tuples are immutable
so you cannot change them that's why
these methods that change the data type
like a certain new values
popping out valleys removing valleys
reversing and sorting so these are not
available and yeah this is more or less
about tables in case you need them later
they are there for you
hope you enjoy the course and I'll talk
to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
