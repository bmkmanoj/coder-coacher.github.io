the in package of Visual Studio and like
I said in the last lecture we're going
to disable collision on this mesh
component so I guess that collision and
nabel's and actually the visual assist
is not helping us out it's not showing
up and what I'm thinking I'm going to
include is the component slash static
mesh components now if we're to type
this again said collision enabled now
I'd probably see until I sense okay I'm
going to set that to no collision
because we don't want any collision on
the mesh component and on these sphere
components we can actually say we can
actually do it a little bit of a custom
setup so we we don't want any kind of
physics we only want queries and queries
is something like line traces like
overlap events those are our queries so
I'm gonna set collision enabled so I'm
gonna set it to query only and then I'm
going to set some channels so let's say
collision response to all channels it's
going to be ignore but now I will enable
it for one channel and that is gonna be
the pawn so that will be our player
channel so the collision responds to
channel and which search for pawn oops
pawn and we will overlap if you know for
example the projectile was hitting the
objective we don't want it to be
blocking we just want to have it pass
straight through okay so now we're going
to be creating a function so it can
spawn some particle effects whenever we
overlap with this objective so I'm gonna
head into the header file and we're
going to add a new function and again
we're going to have this in protect it
and not public and that is because we
don't want anyone else to be able to
call this function that we call spawn
effects or actually let's call it lay it
thanks
so once when something is more protected
and all of these things are then no one
outs from outside this class we'll be
able to call this function but you know
we don't want any of anyone to play this
that's it's just something that we will
handle ourselves so now we're gonna make
it implementation and with this
implementation ready we can now spawn
some particle effects now we let's just
start by going into you gameplays
statics and that's another class we need
to include so I'm just gonna go all the
way to the top and include and I know
this class will be in kismet
so I should game oops his net / gameplay
statics you see not colors properly and
then we will look for emitter so now we
have spawn emitter location and spawn
emitter attached now this this objective
is actually stationary so we don't need
to attach it to anything which is
respond an allocation now we have a few
variations I'm gonna press escape and we
can cycle with the up and down key we
can cycle through now the one I'm
interested in is the second one because
the first one has a transform now I
don't want to be making a transfer my
only want to specify location so this is
this one is a little easier okay it's a
first-world context object that is any
kind of actor in the world that will be
able to tell the the engine what world
you're in now usually you only have one
world but there you know there are
exceptions for example the static mesh
editor window I believe that is its own
world we're just gonna pass in this so
we're just gonna pass in this objective
actor and that will then be able to
figure out which world to register this
particle affecting okay and then we have
a emitter template to specify so I'm
going to call this pickup FX and then
the location is going to be get actor
location because we just want to spawn
it at our cells and then the
we don't I think the rest we don't need
to specify let's see oh no and with when
we had you as a third overload
so the overloads are different
variations of the same function they
have different parameters but the same
the same name so this will be enough but
we haven't actually made this as a
variable yet so I'm going to actually
copy this and head over into the header
file and now again as a protected but
I'm going to make a new variable and I'm
going to call that you particle system I
make it a pointer because that is a type
that that function is expecting from us
so we paste it in now you might wonder
okay how will I know you know be able to
fill this with anything because now it's
only a type we only know the type so
we're going to expose this again to
blueprint and we're doing that a lot and
I only want to be able to change the
default only so I'm gonna say add a
default only and I'm gonna specify
category again I'm just going to specify
this under effects now when we go back
into blueprints once this is compiled
you'll see that we can very easily the
assign content this way okay so we got
that okay so now we have this play
effect but we don't call it from
anywhere now I would actually like to
just play it on begin playing so can you
just already see this happen whenever we
start the game we also want to react to
this whenever the actor gets overlapped
now there's two ways to do that we
killed we could directly register to
this function to the function in sphere
components which will be on components
begin overlap this is the same you might
see in blueprints and if you have used
boobs before so we could you know
register ourselves to this but there's
another way and that is already in actor
which is a little simpler to implement
so we're going to be sticking to that
and that way I can also show you how to
make an new override if we just dive
into a actor with all G the
a lot of come here but I'm going to
search for actor overlap that's not aunt
I'm going to search for overlap actor
there we go we have the notify actor
begin overlap so I'm going to copy this
go back into our objective actor and I
believe that is a public so I'm gonna
paste it as the public we can quickly go
back in and check and yeah here we have
their public key word so this is a need
of public function so we go back now I
do have to specify the override keyword
here because we are overriding the
implementation that's already available
for us and the actor and then we create
an implementation there we go cool and
let's make sure whether whenever we
override something that we also make
sure that we call the base
implementation and now we do that using
the super other actor so now the base
guy did whatever the function is doing
an actor remains intact but here we can
now do our own thing so here we can call
the function play effects so now
whenever we overlap we play effects now
this is sort of like a catch-all because
it's it's basically actor wide and this
works because we have set up this one to
you know not collide and this this
component we set up with some some
collision so in this case it's sort of
like a catch-all in that it's you know
it collects any of the overlap events
from from the components that we got and
pushes it as a very simple simple
function like so so I'm just going to
compile this so we can see the results
okay now when we were back in back in
the editor we can just go into the BP
objective I'm gonna open up the full
blueprint editor again and now we have
this new property here called pickup
effects that's exactly the one that we
created so we can just go with that and
then we could pick any of these any of
these effect
now I'm going to use the or received and
now when we play you could see that it
was that it spawned that effect now we
can actually move this a little move
ourselves a little closer a little
closer so you can probably see that cool
and then when we overlap we can see that
we played it again we overlap it and we
play it again and so it and so it keeps
on going alright nice so that's all
working and now we're ready to move into
the next lecture where we're going to be
doing more of this objective and that we
let the player pick it up and prepare to
have it you know delivered to this
extraction zone that we're also going to
be creating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
