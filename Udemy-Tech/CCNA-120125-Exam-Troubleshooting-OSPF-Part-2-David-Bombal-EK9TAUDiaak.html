demonstrating how to troubleshoot issues
in preparation for the CCNA exam in this
example we've been told that PC one is
not able to ping PC - so let's verify
that 10 PC 1 pain PC to notice the U and
the dot telling us that it's unreachable
you means that the traffic is being sent
to a router and the router doesn't know
where to forward the traffic let's have
a look at the routing table on this
router acting as our PC notice in the
output we have a default gateway
configured so can the PC ping the
default gateway yes it can so PC 1 is
able to ping Radha 1 in this topology
I'm using Cisco IOS V routers in gns3 so
rather than trying to set up a physical
PC I'm simply using Cisco IOS v images
to act as our pcs so on Radha 1 let's
have a look show IP route no rats are
being alert through a routing protocol
we only see local and connected routes
on the router show IP protocols OSPF has
been enabled as a routing protocol on
Radha 1 a routing protocol would be
required to allow Radha one to route
traffic to this remote network so router
2 would have to inform router 1 about
that network using a routing protocol of
some description and in this example
it's OSPF on router to show IP protocols
OSPF is enabled on this router sure IP
rot it's not learning any routes however
from Radha one either so looking at this
output are you able to see the problem
this output should allow you to see
where the problem is in this network so
have you spotted the issue
rattle one has this Rada ID router 2 has
this router ID the Rada IDs are the same
on both routers in OSPF Rada IDs have to
be unique so show run pipe section who
is PF in the output we can see that the
Rada ID has been configured to one dot
one dot one dot one show run pipe
section OSPF the same thing has been
configured on router 2 so on router to
you let's configure the router ID is
quadrupled to you notice we're not
getting any output when we make changes
and that's because I disabled logging to
the console so let me enable logging and
enable logging the side
let's see if we get any output so show
IP ospf neighbor rather neighbor
relationship has been established on the
side show IP ospf neighbor neighbor
relationship has been established so
what I'll do just to show you the
problem is I'll set it back to router ID
of 1 and notice we told that we need to
clear the OSPF process so clear IP ospf
1 process
notice the neighbor relationship has
gone down and notice me being told that
there's a duplicate rudder ID and we see
that on both sides so I purposely
disabled logging to the console so that
you wouldn't see that
so before I fix it this is what the
configuration looks like at the moment
rod ID is set to one dot one dot one dot
one so what we should do is change that
to quadruple two in this case we didn't
have to reset to the process because the
neighbor relationship hadn't been
established yet notice now the
relationship has gone to full so we
changed the configuration from this to
this only difference is rudder ideas
being changed show IP ospf neighbor
neighbor relationship is established on
the side neighbor relationship has been
established if you see output like this
it makes it easy to find where the
problem is you may not have it that easy
in the exam as an example you may have
to discover where the problem is like
I've done here
so can PC one ping PC - yes it can let's
trace - PC to notice the trace succeeds
so we've successfully fixed to the issue
in this network I hope you've enjoyed
