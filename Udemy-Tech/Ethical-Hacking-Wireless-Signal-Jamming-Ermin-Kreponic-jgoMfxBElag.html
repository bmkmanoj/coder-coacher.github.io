tutorial today I will be talking about
dass attacks and how you can actually
deny wireless access to pretty much
anybody within the range of your
wireless card now your current range of
your wireless card is not your permanent
range or probably it's not your maximum
range because you can boost the signal
as well but of that I shall speak a bit
later on for the time being I wish to
focus only on the actual dos attack as
that can well not only can you deny the
service but as I stated in the previous
tutorial you can you are actually able
to trick a user into resetting the
router primarily because if you can't
connect your wireless what is one of the
first things that you do you basically
just reset the router even if you call
the ISP provider one of the first things
that they will tell you is reset the
router and these sort of attacks they
don't unless they're are going over an
extended period of time or something
like that they don't raise a lot of
suspicion I mean most people when they
can't connect wireless in their houses
or something like that
well reset the router if it works out
great if it doesn't
oh well call the ISP then they try to
fix it but you're not gonna be running
the Dossett ACK probably for that long
your idea is to force a reset however
you can run actually permanent dos
attacks and in such a way deny service
to a certain user or a company or
something of a kind there is no known
way to actually stop this you there are
as I've stated in the previous tutorials
as well you can use some paint or that
doesn't that doesn't allow signals to
pass through or you can use some tinfoil
or something like that and the walls but
you are effectively limiting what you
can do with your own wireless in such a
way and that's not really the best of
solutions anyway there are certain
things that a user can do on the other
side to mediate this sort of an attack
such as change the channel of your of
their wireless access point change the
MAC address but none of those things are
at
stopping the dass attacks all of those
things there are simple that they are
doing is simply hiding and buying for
time all you need to do is simply follow
up on the changes for example do a scan
again if you see that there is something
wrong and that's it you will find a new
MAC address you will find a new channel
and you will see the ESS the new ESS ID
as well so anyway without further ado
let's just go ahead and perform this
sort of attack see what happens and how
can we actually confirm it anyway the
first thing that we need to do is set
our wireless network card into moniker
mode I have a small script that I have
written for myself here I have explained
it in the previous tutorials if you're
just wondering why am I not doing this
via air montage in G so here Mon - ng
and you can also do it like this LP - s0
well I've discovered that on Fedora the
distribution that I'm using at the
moment and the one that I'm using for
the demonstration of this tutorial well
it just presents problems I mean it
creates virtual interfaces and I don't
know you get an error like name not
unique on the network and there's a way
to fix that or workaround something like
that but I've just written my own script
and that I'm going to use you can use it
as well I've shown it in the previous
tutorial all it does is bring the
interface wireless interface down
changes it state changes the changes the
state changes the mode to monitor mode
and then changes the state back to up
again here we can just see it one more
time quickly excellent perhaps I should
have add a Mac change here as well that
would be that would be actually a good
idea but for the time being I'm not
gonna do that primarily because there is
no need to hide as I am doing this to my
own wireless system however here doing
this outside definitely use mac changer
that are VLP to s0 you can only apply
you can only change the MAC address when
the interface is down you cannot change
the MAC address of the interface that is
up how to do this I have shown
in the previous tutorials as well anyway
I'll just go ahead and clear the screen
I usually run this command Ehrmann that
Ehrmann - ng
check the LD - s zero I use this not to
initiate the monitor not to set the
monitor mode but rather instead to
perform a check-up to see if there are
any programs any processes out there
within my computer that might cause
problems or interference apparently
there are none if there were once you
run this command it would give you the
pids of the processes and you could kill
them easily no problems there let's just
go ahead and clear the screen and the
tool that we need to use as part of the
aircraft package here is AI replay so
before we actually start doing that we
will of course need to perform a scan
with a tool that we have used previously
so air dumb I have no idea why they
quote so their dump - ng VOP - is 0%
oops I wrote dump its arrow them sorry I
always make a mistake there but you can
just use tabs I've shown and it's gonna
work out well for you so apparently I
have some open access points here as
well and I have noticed a very strange
thing when I do when I performed these
scans during different times of day the
signal strength varies and the amount of
wireless access point also changes I'm
just gonna stop this because there are
too many of them now the wireless access
point change the amount of wireless
access point changes and the signal
strength changes what I've noticed that
people are doing is that they actually
turn their wife eyes off during certain
times of the day when there are not
there or when they are not using it or
something of a kind and that is a very
wise precaution I mean that is very
that's a very intelligent thing to do
because if there is nobody in your house
if there is nobody using your Wi-Fi
there is literally no reason for you to
leave it online just pull the plug
simple as that you increase the safety
of your wireless of your home network
exponentially
primarily because not only are you
invisible permanently invisible during
certain periods of time but you are also
effectively limiting windows of
opportunity for anybody to attack you
and that can cause a ridiculous amount
of problems to an attacker anyway so
over here I have my wireless interface
it's called something it's on channel 6
and it's power it's relatively good but
look at my neighbors I did this I
conducted the scan last night and my own
Wireless was about 50 something and my
neighbors was 59 which was ridiculous
I'm guessing this guy is right next to
me or right below me with a with an
antenna attached to the ceiling or
something of a kind I have no idea but
he's getting like really strong wireless
signal I'm gonna have to ask him to see
who this is just to see what the just to
see what the signal strength is on this
router but anyway it doesn't really
matter let's just use let's just use the
a I replay
however in you can't I didn't find a way
to actually specify a channel in a I
replay perhaps there is an option there
or something of a kind but it doesn't it
doesn't really matter I didn't try too
hard what I wanted to show you is that
you can actually change the channel of
your wireless sensor network card
manually so just type in IV wait before
we actually do that lets just try random
scan and see what happens so a I replay
- ng and here we're gonna need to
specify - zero so - zero is one of the
lists is from the list of arguments that
I do believe that I've showed previously
but doesn't really matter so you see in
the help and you have the authentication
you can use - zero instead of that fake
identification you can use - one instead
of that and so on and so forth you don't
actually need to type in the whole
command rather instead you can
they've numerated them so it's a lot
easier to actually use anyway we're
gonna say - zero and space it says count
so how many the authentication the
authentication
Qwest you want to send you can specify a
number it can be very large number here
or you can just say one for single the
authentication for capturing the wpa2
handshakes well you're probably gonna
need more than one but doesn't really
matter I usually have a tendency to
place a zero here zero tells it simply
do it continuously so you can just do it
until you feel satisfied or until you've
achieved your purpose and then ctrl C to
actually cancel it no big deal there
anyway after that we need to specify a -
a option which is the beast's ID and
then in addition to that we need to
specify the interface that we're going
to be using press ENTER and there we go
so it says here on channel 3 but I know
for a fact and you can scroll up you can
see here something it says channel is
channel 6 so this is not gonna work
it says no such bssid available please
specify e SS ID so the name perhaps the
name of the network yeah that is due to
this channel problem so this is channel
3 and my wireless interface card is
functioning on why my wireless access
point is actually functioning on channel
6 while my wireless network card is
functioning on channel 3 in my laptop
what we need to do is manually configure
the channel of our network card so IV iw
sorry config vo P to s 0 which is the
name of our interface and then channel
and then just say 6 so it's very simple
it's like English language you have you
have a command so iw config the name of
your wireless interface just type in the
argument that you want to change which
is channel same thing with mod with mode
so just type in mod here and change it
to whatever you want but in this case
we're changing the channel so just type
in channel space and then just type in
the number of the channel you wish to
tune it you wish to change it to anyway
now our wireless network card is running
is operating on channel 6 and if we
repeat the command that I have
previously
oan you will see immediately immediately
it actually passes this attacks more
effectively targeting a connected world
yep okay so there is a there is a there
is this message that we're being
displayed here this is not an error
message this is just a note of a sort we
can also do tentacle individual clients
on the network so we don't need to see
this attack that I am performing now
this will be authenticate everyone on
that wireless card on that wireless
access point everybody will be do tenta
cated i mean you can confirm this by
using your smartphone or tablet or
another PC that is connected wirelessly
to your home wireless network and it
might show the status that it is still
connected but try browsing the net try
opening up a website or something of a
kind you will not be able to do it like
not in a million years also there are
some Mac filtering options that routers
attempt to impose but doesn't matter
I've shown you how you can change a MAC
address and you can also set a script
which will rotate your MAC addresses
periodically so that Ted can be a
nightmare also the routers have the
option to like adjust the MAC address to
adjust a certain range of MAC addresses
which can access it but again you will
be able to see the authenticated clients
on that network and just use their MAC
addresses instead and pass through as I
said this is ridiculously difficult to
stop and it's it's a it's really painful
when you're being tossed in terms of
wireless out there is very little that
you can do I honestly don't know of any
known method to actually completely stop
this but we'll see there are some there
are some enterprise type routers that
are actually able to fight this off to
an extent but we'll see what the future
brings anyway I will be doing more of
this in the follow up tutorial and I
will show you how you can do ten take a
single client plus we'll be writing down
some bash scripts and see how that works
out to improve our attack in any case I
bid you farewell and I hope
you in the next tutorial hello everybody
and welcome to this tutorial today I
will do as I promised in the previous
one we will do a bit of scripting and we
will see how that works to our advantage
now a client might try to hide so you do
need to key if you wish to perform some
sort of a long term wireless wireless
denial of service attack you will want
to be vigilant you will need to monitor
the status of the network you will need
to see when the MAC addresses are
changed when the ESS IDs are changed
when channels are changed and so on and
so forth now these things well you can
do to manually you can do them with
scripts the choice is entirely yours I
can't go into full bash scripting here
because that would be a tutorial for it
that would be a course for itself but I
will show you some of the basics and
what you can do with bash scripts I mean
it's a very powerful they're very
powerful you can do a lot with them you
can automate most of your tasks and on
top of that we need to see how we can do
tentacle particular clients on the
network so I didn't change anything so
I'm still in monitor mode if I'm not
mistaken I'm just gonna go ahead from
the previous tutorial that is I'm just
gonna go ahead and type in arrow arrow
dumb - oops
- ng LP to s0 and when I press this okay
I have my dad 4 here so I'm just gonna
go ahead and take its MAC address and I
want to do a more precise scan so here's
what I will do I'll do err dump - and G
and then I'll - - the SS ID which will
be the MAC address of this of this
access point and I can also specify a
channel with - - channel but I don't
really want to do that I just want to
scan him for this MAC address and see
that way I'll know if the chant if the
channel changes the scan is now in
progress I am at some point of time I'm
sure I'll get a client here or something
of a kind me just do 10 Takei tit and
authenticated on my cell phone we're
just gonna turn wireless on and off and
then I should get the signal
because there is no activity if I was
browsing the net on my phone or
something like that it would show up
immediately but I am not doing anything
and there we go simple authentication
will show a transition of packets
between this between the bssid of 90 f6
52 C 1 B be 18 and station is basically
a device which is connected to that
particular access point now I will go
ahead and stop this here and you before
I continue you can see in the upper left
corner it says channel 6 this and you
have seen that these channels change I
mean it's been going from 1 to 14 if I'm
not mistaken and when these channels
here change your wireless network card
is put into the mo entities is functions
in accordance with these channels and
functions on these frequencies so that's
might disrupt it and you might need to
for dos attack you might need to
manually reconfigure your wireless
network card as I've showed you before
just use iw config and set it to
whatever channel you want anyway client
as I said can change the MAC address can
change the SSID can change it even the
encryption method and can change the
channel so how can you know for sure if
somebody changes all three of these if
somebody changed the channel that the
MAC address and the SSID how can you
figure out what access point are you
going to continue dossing because you
might have like a hundred of them or
something of a kind that you captured
with this error with this airodump-ng
packet how will you figure it out well
simple same clients will be same sorry
same clients these are clients will be
authenticated with the same networks so
even if the society changes even if they
Lea society the name changes so even if
I've I don't know if I could change it
here something 1 2 3 4 5 or whatever all
of these parameters change the clients
which are authenticated to that access
point will not change
I suppose theoretically somebody could
go ahead and change the change the MAC
addresses of every single device
connected to that access point but think
of this but think of the following
scenario you're a company or your coffee
shop or something like that you cannot
go around changing everybody's
everybody's MAC addresses on everybody's
devices no way so just the first time
around see which clients are
authenticated to a particular access
point and then do a general airodump-ng
like this so airodump-ng really do a
general one do a general sweep like this
and then you will see there you go you
will see the authenticated clients down
below this is 4b0 what is somebody else
I suppose you will be able to see down
below who are the clients that are
authenticated to that particular network
and in such a way you will figure it out
you will figure out the new MAC address
and the new channel the newest is
society and the boss attack will be able
to proceed so as I said before there
really is no stopping it there is only
hiding from it just go ahead and clear
and I have made a very nice batch script
here which I want to show you well it's
not very nice but it's it does the job
so the signifies it's a bash script this
is a loop this is an infinite loop it
will do it will perform until I actually
put it to sleep until I cancel it
manually as a user so just go briefly
over it it says airplay - zero space
five so I want to send five authenticate
the authentication signals packets and
then - right - this MAC address from
this interface next up I windows for
Windows five the authentication packets
have been sent I want you to bring the
interface down so go ahead and bring the
interface down use mac changer chain
change the MAC address of the interface
to random so randomly changed MAC
addresses of my wireless interface just
print out the new Mac so I know that
it's that something is happy
and then after that oops let me just put
a space there we go so you can see it
better and then I want you to
reconfigure the mode of the wireless and
interface to monitor again bring it back
up tell me that it is tell me that the
mode is monitor when you grab it in
order to confirm it go ahead and sleep
for three seconds
and while that while you're sleeping
echo waiting I did I just I just wrote
this down for some strange reason anyway
what I what you can modify here is
following you can modify the sleep timer
so you can go to sleep for relatively
larger shorter periods of time depending
on how you wish to perform this Doss
attack you can also say something like
over here you can lo you can read values
from a file where you have a list of
access points which you wish to jam at
particular time intervals now that's
that's a bit more of a complex script
bash scripting method if you're
interested feel free to post it in the
question sections but you do need you do
need to have a certain knowledge of bash
in order to be able to do that in any
case there are some there are some of
the things that I would like you to try
and play around with if you succeed good
if not feel free to post to post it in
the question sections I will be more
than happy to help you out
anyway so as I said you can have a list
of IP out of MAC addresses here that is
loaded from I don't know from some file
that you've previously created and you
can jam particular access point wireless
access points in certain time intervals
when you do that you will also need a
command down below in order to change to
the appropriate channel because you will
also need to know the channels of those
access points so IV config field P to s
0 channel and then you will need to
specify a channel name here so seven or
it was 3 or 1 or something like that
p20 excellent
so not a bad idea you can you can
increase the effectiveness of your
wireless jamming you can effectively
basically jam your entire neighborhood
which I definitely do not recommend as
that is legal but people have been known
to do it I mean some somebody somewhere
figures out and figures out how to do it
and is genius enough to actually attempt
it there's literally no gain in it it
just just less just annoying the
neighbors I suppose something like that
but anyway you can as I said you can
change your time intervals that's not a
bad idea at all you feel free to play
around with this as much as you want
with this part here in the loop and if
you come up with any new ideas or
something of a kind feel free to post
them in a discussion section in the
discussions I will be more than happy to
take a look at it and see what you have
done on your own because that is really
one of the best ways you can learn
something anyway let's just go ahead and
apply the script and see what happens
no I do not wish to save any changes
anyway before you can run a script you
of course need to do CH monde I've done
this previously but let me just show you
plus X so to make it executable Jam -
dot Sh and then I'm just gonna take a
gem that Sh let's see I am again on the
wrong channel waiting for beacon from on
channel 7 GOP is on channel 7 but access
point uses channel 6 excellent so this
actually even tells you on what channel
is the e is the wireless access points
fantastic so IV config VLP 2 is 0
channel let me just quickly change this
6 excellent and now we can begin the
jamming process
excellent so you see here it sends 5 out
in the authentication attempts the one
that I have selected and then it changes
the Mac
dressed something I don't know unknown
and then it brings monitor mode back up
again says waiting when it says waiting
it's sleeping for three seconds or
something of a kind whatever you write
down and you see the process is just
going to repeat itself on end pretty
much until you shut the computer down or
until you terminate the process by
killing the PID or just pressing ctrl C
not a bad way to the authenticate at all
but there is another thing that you can
do
so you see here let me just see airplay
nope I don't phone I don't want arrow
dump X on so arid um and you can use
arrow dump in combination with Ehrmann
but there is a trick to it you have to
manually configure the channel for arrow
Dom - ng so it doesn't change the
channel if it changes the channel you're
the authentication attempts will not go
through oh and let's just tell it six
press enter excellent now it's
permanently scanning on channel 6 and
you are able to monitor any and all
changes that take place here so for
example if there are some changes that
take place you notice them you can
implement them elsewhere and by that I
mean if you simply lose this fireless if
you if you no longer see it perhaps the
channel has been changed or to be a
society has been changed you can oh
great I even got the handshake here
amazing oh well I suppose is because oh
no I'm actually not for even performing
get the authentication I just got the
handshake it doesn't matter anyway if
you lose it cancel it and do a general
sweep without bssid specified and
without the channel specified but you
can also try just with the bssid
specified and with the channel not
specified because somebody could have
just changed the channel and be a
society could have remained the same one
of the methods you can apply and I'm
gonna use this in conjunction I'm gonna
use the jam that Sh
which starts up error a I replay in
in conjunction with basically a road um
so I can monitor the status and what is
going on here in addition to that I can
actually Jam the signal as well and even
though it says that this this station is
actually authenticated with it believe
me on my Android phone or whatever this
is I would not be able to browse the
Internet there is no way I would be
continuously the authenticated it would
be impossible for me to even open up a
basic website that would be that would
be beyond the abilities of the device as
I said before you can actually use your
own phone so you can use your own
tablets or whatever other devices in
order to confirm this but you can see
that these tools can actually work one
with parallel to each other no problems
as long as they are all using as there
as long as you cannot you cannot tell
your wireless card function on several
channels at once at least I don't know
how to do that maybe you can somewhere
in the net it's a you can you definitely
can be at the same time they can be
modulated but you cannot have them at
running at the same time so you do need
to adjust the parameters a little bit
and then you can use several of these
tools at once you can monitor the status
you can jam it here you can you can even
get a DOP to handshake or something like
that
and you say it says here interfaces down
because I have brought it down anyway I
thank you for watching and I hope to see
you in the next tutorial until then I
bid you farewell and I urge you to try
to do things on your own as much as you
can as that is absolutely the best way
to learn okay so let me just do a quick
show here you can actually clear and
nano jam excellent so instead of
actually doing a general deal
communication here you are also able to
do this so space - see for client
and I'm just gonna stop this for now I'm
gonna take this client so just take the
MAC address of the client where it says
C based it ctrl o to save ctrl X to exit
and now wish to run Jam excellent
it says sending 64 Directory
authentication knowledge man whatever
this is all verbose output from from the
program that's all that it is and it
says which client specific specific is
it actually D authenticating that can be
a pretty big problem as C I'm gonna do G
channel 6 okay it says interface field
Peas down okay so sometimes it's not
gonna actually work out as I said before
primarily because I'm bringing the
interface down but the scanning is
actually in progress and even though
this station might show here as actually
connected or something of a kind try
browsing the net as I said try doing
anything with it on the Internet you
won't be able literally to move because
nothing will be able to pass through
that's gonna be a pretty big problem as
I said before you can confirm this with
any of your devices you won't be able to
do anything with them
I just wanted to show you how you can
actually jam a particular client
you can also set the rotations here - I
don't know Jam a particular client for a
while and then jam a different one for a
while again you can have a list of
clients here and load them up from a
file so they can modulate your jamming
this client for five minutes for the
next five minutes the next one and so on
and so forth in such a way creating a
bit of a chaotic situation anyway I hurt
I strongly urge you to track to try we
don't necessarily need to practice but
just to try to do something on your own
try to alter the code try to try to jam
something of course that you have a
permission to jam and try to do it in a
bit of a different way apply some other
arguments player
with things there really isn't much that
you can break here especially if you're
doing it on your own Wireless that you
have a permission to do it on and that
is really the best possible way to learn
but in any case I'm gonna bid you
farewell now and I hope to see you in
the next tutorial
