solution to that so within the severe
cluster there are two files marked py
which context eyes using rdd's filler
movie data frame dot p wah spark 2.0
same problem so let's take a look and
you can just edit the even Nano editor a
little Hadoop cluster thing I did was so
I have two RDD at this point of the
squeeze movie IDE Keeseville ratings now
before trading since starts sorting the
reasoning that had 10 or fewer I create
this new articles in count that filters
them out and that does takes and checks
whether X 10 so that because these
syntax there's a list so with filter
we're passed in you pair for each so we
first set just now remember we start
counting second field so we're saying
bull and take the second piece of it is
this rating what some of ratings total
rating so then one at this point we have
of ratings total ratings say I want
field of that tuple one gives us this
tuple at one gives us that second values
total ratings out of that and he's
saying filter it in 10 okay and from the
popular totals and count instead and
keep on doing things that we run that
and so again I'll log in to my fluster
script is already there so I'm spark -
seven its alert movie spark dot and
let's see what we get so now this Turing
things out to things that were readable
first of all we're getting they were
actually watched by more then we have a
little bit more statistical cool in one
person thought they were turns out the
worst of the worst is heathering from
1996 this says from 1998 I think whoo
bad movies these are also so if you were
going to be making something this might
be a good source indeed I do not
remember and like I said before of all
the people who watched it and three
stars body amityville too bad
Robocop freewill III should fourth man
now let's look at the spark to my take a
peek at the lowest rate in Python script
that I gave you and a nice little editor
here to make it a little only thing
different here isn't your command at the
same point I mean using getting my
average where I join together I'm now
going to filter out it's where the count
weighing filter on this one is greater
than the value 10 in popular averages
and counts results with a count
substitute that data for acting my base
I'm taking the top 10 pence there you
can see it's just a lot easier to wrap
your head or use you know very intuitive
out is greater than 10 instead of trying
to extract this field out of this new
pair so there's root bark - wave die as
well
I'm using spark to Courtin works about
that so let's spark underscore a major
it'll - and with lowest data frame dot
py or less the same results and there we
have ah children of evil - a large man -
you know same same energy you know we
read about this to come answer and I
think the data frame approaches a lot
when you're running at a large scale so
there you have it or spark section of
the course since so there you have it we
actually solved a few real promised of
its power with there's a whole lot more
I could tell muj area that that you can
and there are other courses available to
spark and also teach you how which is
really the language thanks for watching
check out my ultimate hat in it you'll
learn over all T's in the Hadoop
ecosystem Oh Arsenal against your big
pond code in the description below
