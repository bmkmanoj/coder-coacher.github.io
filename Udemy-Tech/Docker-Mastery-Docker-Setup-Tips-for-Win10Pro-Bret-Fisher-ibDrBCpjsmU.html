real install and first we're going to
download and install docker we're gonna
tweak some of the settings of it or
check in my at least and then we're
gonna go clone my repo we're gonna get
an editor in case you don't have a code
editor and then we are checking out a
few options if you want to tweak your
terminal and your shell setup we can get
to that too okay so here's my plain old
Windows 10 Pro machine and the first
thing we're gonna do is where I'm going
to store that bunker to come and I'm
going to click on docker seee here in
the middle and then docker Community
Edition for Windows now in here you'll
notice that by default when I click the
get docker it's going to download the
docker for Windows it says this requires
Windows 10 professional if I had an
older version of Windows that we'll show
in a few minutes I would click on the
docker toolbox but here I'm gonna say
get docker and by the fault by the way
this is installing the stable Edition
not the edge if I wanted edge I could
scroll down a little farther and I could
choose edge or if I was actually on the
server version I could actually do the
edge there as well let's save this I
personally save it before I run it
because it seems to work better that way
and then we're gonna run the install and
the install is pretty typical for
Windows it's gonna ask me if it's ok now
that's installed you notice it's not
running I would see a little mobi icon
down there so let me actually run it and
it's gonna ask me about hyper-v so if
you don't have hyper-v installed on your
machine then this will actually enable
it and reboot now that means you have to
have local admin I mean you had to have
local admin to install this thing and
you're gonna have to have local admin
for hyper-v
if you're on a laptop or desktop that
you've never done virtualization on
there's a rare case that you may need to
go in the BIOS
actually enable the virtualization
features in the BIOS and that's well
documented on the internet if you have
an error I recommend just looking at the
error up on the Internet and you'll
probably will find that everyone's
saying oh yeah go on your BIOS and find
the extensions and install the VTX
extension or whatever it is in the BIOS
you're not actually installing it you're
actually just enabling it but that's a
rare case most of the time people that
have problems installing it's either
because they're on a home edition but
they forgot to check and they thought
they had Pro so they try to install the
pro version or maybe they're running an
older version of Windows 10 doesn't have
the latest updates it is important that
you keep your Windows machine up to date
for docker because Windows is updating
their stuff as rapidly as docker is
updating theirs and they're both related
so you definitely want to keep those you
can actually now see on my machine I've
rebooted and docker is starting in this
little icon down at the bottom once it's
booted then I'll see this little prompt
and I can run my PowerShell as me not as
admin but just as me and I can do a
darker version and I should see it
running and this is the version I have
installed this is the latest stable
version and in case you were so inclined
in the background this is running
hyper-v so I can run the hyper-v desktop
app and I can actually see on my desktop
but this is running in something called
a mobi Linux VM and it's got two gig of
ram installed and it's uptime is just a
minute because it just started so real
quick let's just go into the settings
right click on that little icon down
there and we'll go up here to settings
and it's a couple that you need to care
about if you store your code that you
might use in this course on a different
drive you're going to need to check that
here I definitely want to check see
because that's where I keep a lot of my
code so I need to enable wherever I'm
going to have code running inside a
container you'll see more about that
later but you got to do that here and
the other thing is you might if you want
if you have enough resources you can
always bump up the memory
or the CPUs I think it comes pretty cool
out of the box I mean two gig and two
CPUs is a pretty good amount but if you
start hitting it limits and starts to
get slow you can always bump those up
depending on your hardware right and the
rest of these options you're kind of
kind of leave the same probably you're
not gonna have to mess with those too
much in this course but when I apply
these settings it will require
restarting of Ducker and while that's
happening let's go clone my repo and
remember that this is in the resource
lecture earlier in this section
now I'm gonna clone this but I want to
clone it in desktop if you've never used
github before then you can use a GUI and
that's probably one of the easiest ways
if you're not used to get up if you know
github then you get you got your own way
to do it but here what I can do is I can
actually use the github GUI to download
and clone my repo so I'm going to
install that alright and then I'm
actually going to put all of my code in
a directory called code so I'm going to
make a directory
so you'll see on my machine that I
actually put all of my software code
inside a directory called code on
underneath my user so that's where I'm
going to clone this from github app and
if you remember earlier I just changed
the settings so that the C Drive could
be where I store some code that docker
can see so I'm just gonna log in as me
okay now that I have github installed
one of the ways I can clone it is from
the website I can copy the URL and then
go back over to desktop and say clone a
repository copy that in and then
remember I wanted this is not going to
be under documents it's gonna be under
code that's where I put my stuff so
clone now the advantage of doing it this
way instead of downloading the zip is
that you can come in here and update it
because I do update this repo when
there's fixes or changes in docker which
happens pre pretty much every month so
now if I do adder in here you can see
that I'm in a Ducker that you to meet
dr. mastery directory and there we go
now if you're not savvy on code editors
a little tip here is the best one I like
for docker editing is Visual Studio code
I can you can just search vs code vs
code and you'll get the website coming
right up and then you can download it
and install it just like a regular
Windows app and it works quite well one
of the best parts about this editor is
that it has built in docker syntax so
it'll let me open up Ducker compose
files and docker files as you'll learn
in this course and it'll highlight the
code in them and give me actual little
hints about how to use it
and the last little tip here is around a
couple of options for your command line
so if you want over to dockers
documentation you'll see that they have
a whole section on setting up tab
completion in powershell and tab
completion in powershell is what we get
in linux and mac out of the box so
basically it means that when I type the
darker command I can actually hit tab
and it will fill out the information for
that command command depending on what
I've typed and you can see that I don't
have it here it just kind of lists
directories which is not what I want I
actually wanted to list things like
docker run or other commands well the
way you get that is you have to install
this and it's a couple of steps you'll
you can see both of these will actually
give you full steps to get it started
and running but I'll just show you the
quickest way I know how
so we're going to actually install the
module per the instructions on the
github repo and you'll see right here
that all I have to do is install module
with a scope of current user posh docker
and when I do that it's gonna actually
ask me to install a different option
called nougat and nougat is fine it's
actually from Microsoft it's partly how
you install modules on your machine so
just say yes there and say yes again and
now that we've installed it we need to
actually enable it and we do that with
import module posh docker and if you get
an error about your security scripts
disabling thing that is what is actually
happening is PowerShell is secure by
default and it's preventing you from
running an internet script so what we
want to do is if we go over here to the
docker documentation they have a little
more information on how to get this
going and what you can do here is you
can set an execution policy but what
that's going to mean is that you're
gonna have to it's not going to actually
let you do it as a non admin so what
you're gonna have to do is then
and start PowerShell as an admin if you
just saw I right clicked there run that
and then in that window I'm going to set
my execution policy to a little less
secure but it should be fine for remote
sign that's pretty reasonable and then
now we should be able over here to try
the import module again on this window
and there we go now the way I know it
works is when I type in docker and then
I hit tab it gives me docker commands
here so for example if I just typed in
docker help I get a list of all the
different command options but if I type
in docker and I hit tab it actually
starts going through those
however this module is a little bit
limited and it's a little bit dated so
unfortunately it's the best option we
have on Windows for PowerShell command
completion but if you'll notice it's
actually a little dated it hasn't had an
update in over six months so with the
current command line formats you may not
find it extremely valuable yeah I did
find it better than nothing but there's
a long way for it to go it's certainly
not as good as Mac or Linux but it is
the good thing is it's open source so
maybe when you have some time and you
want to get savvy at PowerShell command
completion you can go in here and help
out now I do want to point out that even
though we've installed the module for
the current user and enabled it it's not
going to automatically start every time
unless we add it to our PowerShell
profile if you didn't know what that was
it's actually very similar to a bash
profile a dot profile file or a bash RC
file maybe depending on which one you
prefer and actually on the darker side
it's really nice they give you this
little snippet which will check to see
if you have an existing profile file and
create it if you don't and so I didn't
have one
so what it did is it automatically
created that profile inside my documents
directory and then added this import
module posh docker to it which is pretty
cool
if you start to get into PowerShell you
learn that that PowerShell profile is
actually pretty powerful and you can do
some pretty cool stuff with it and make
your PowerShell setup pretty advanced
and fancy the other option is if you
want to replace this window right so
this PowerShell window is a terminal
emulator not the same as the shell
that's inside it because we still have
to use the PowerShell shell but what we
can use is a different GUI for that
shell and that might be commander dotnet
and commander is basically a console
emulator that gives you a huge amount of
features for free open source out of the
box and the way I install it is I just
download it it's a zip file and I
actually make sure that by the way when
you do this you right click go to
properties and unblocked so that you can
actually unzip it and then it works
doesn't complain to you alright now that
I've extracted the commander I'm just
going here and I'm going to drag the
commander a button down here the
commander exe is actually what that is
I'm just going to drag that down to my
Start menu or my taskbar rather and that
way I can launch it from here and the
first time it's going to do some stuff
that's going to set up some things
notice that it's actually got a tab down
here
and I can create more tabs and I can do
that over here this little drop down
menu there's actually several of them
here this one allows me to decide what
my next tab is going to run as is it
gonna run bash is it gonna run
PowerShell or is it gonna run the
command prompt well I remember I told
you earlier we need to run this as
PowerShell so we're gonna be in here and
then we're going to type in docker PS
and the way we go docker info works and
you'll learn about these commands all in
a minute but the point is it kind of
just works out of the box if you wanted
that posh to always work then what you
will you might need to do the posh
docker thing right
you might need to come over here and
come up into settings and then yeah you
know you look at this you're like holy
cow there's a whole lot of settings here
so what you need to do is come down here
to startup tasks don't be distracted by
everything else and over here under
powershell powershell we need to take
out this little option right here that
says no profile okay because that will
prevent it from loading the profile file
we just created and you can save those
settings and then you close the
commander and then you start it up again
notice it defaults the command by
default so you can always go in the
settings and change that if I go over
here and say PowerShell PowerShell then
I get this nice little PowerShell prompt
you can see that I have PowerShell
completion that if I do docker and I
have completion here as well look at
that alright so we got everything
working but this is a pretty neat shell
you do not have to use this for this
course I do expect that everything works
in here before
it works in here so if you're having
problems here don't come running to the
QA just yet actually just try it in a
regular PowerShell window to see if it
works because it might be something
messed up with commander but it's a neat
option and I tend to run it whenever I'm
using Windows
