exclusively about whole numbers numbers
that don't have any decimal points but
how do we actually deal with
floating-point numbers so in other words
if we want to use one or more decimal
points well in this video we're going to
make a start on figuring out how to do
that in Java so I'm going to create a
new project in IntelliJ select Java so
normally do and I'm going to create my
project from the template command line
app and I'm going to call this one float
and double IO set the package name again
we will be talking about the base
package of what this means a little bit
later so now you can set that to
whatever you like we're going to click
finish
okay so how do we go about dealing with
floating point numbers in Java so that
is numbers that have got a decimal point
so there's two data types in Java to
deal with floating point numbers and
they are called the float and the double
and the float is a single precision and
double is double precision
unsurprisingly given the name so
essentially the double data type has got
twice as much detail as to float so
let's start with an example we're going
to top some code and so we can compare
what a floating-point number does
compare to a whole number so I'm going
to create a integer variable type call
it my int value I'm going to set that to
the value of five then I'm going to
create a float and to do a float you
type in float and we'll call it more
float value equals five now you can do
that but the proper practice for
entering a float is to enter an F put an
F after the number whatever the number
is you put an F the enter denote that it
is a float value and because it is a
single precision number we can put a
decimal point so we could say five point
two five for argument's sake because a
float actually handles that precision
for us automatically but we're going to
leave it as five now and let's create a
double and we'll call the double my
double value equals five so we can do
the same for that and we can put ad
which is the proper way of defining they
double putting a D letter to signify it
but the other thing we can do is we can
put the decimal point like so five point
two five and Java will automatically
assume that a number that you enter with
a decimal point is a double and this is
very similar to what I showed in the
previous video where in an expression
the right hand side of an expression
Java would assume the number was an
integer in this case with a number with
a decimal point Java will assume as a
double so we're going back and set that
to a to do five D again so for example I
can't go it back and do this five point
four because Java saying require a
required a float and
found a double thinking back to the
previous lesson so here's a quick
challenge for you thinking back to the
previous lesson and how we used the cast
to convert a bite and a short how do you
think you'd go about converting this
value here 5.4 to a float go ahead and
pause the video and see if you can
figure it out and come back when you
finished and we'll go and I'll show you
what the answer is so how did you get
off the challenge did you figure it out
or the cast if you want to do force the
value would be the word float in
brackets much like we used by it and
short in the previous video but I
wouldn't generally recommend that it
would be far better normally to put an F
on the end like so because it's a little
bit clearer in the code that's what you
want but that is how you do it if you
wanted to do it but anyway I will change
that back so that's also five so we've
got three values now an integer a float
and a double and they're all equal to
five so let's go ahead and write some
code I'm going to print something out
for each of them so I'm gonna top the
abbreviation sou T and press tab that
creates that for us
saves us typing a bit and we're going to
put my int value equals plus y in value
hops out again and put my float value
equals my float value and by double
value my double value equals possible
double value so probably probably won't
be surprised when we run this to see
what was the result we'll get and I'll
just double click that and we'll run it
again
and you can see here to the right hand
side the values it way integer value was
five but notice how the float value and
the double value have got a point zero
on the end of it so it's actually stored
it as 5.0 and that's because it's a
floating point number so that's all well
and good but what do you think will
happen if we change this then put 5/2
those
run the first one for us just to see
what the integer value will come back as
bearing a - a whole number so you can
see what's happened there we've tried to
divide a whole number five by two and
the answers to and that's because it
hasn't taken into account the remainder
it's literally just said two goes into
five only two times so we're not
handling any remainder in that case but
let's go back and do the same thing and
we'll divide the floating value by two F
so divide divide the floating point
value of five by the floating point
value of two F and likewise for the
double we're going to divide that by 2 D
so this is to see what a gets returned
when we do that so that should hopefully
now clarify the difference with the
datatypes you can see that the float and
the double both give you the exact value
in this case two point five and because
the integer value is a whole number is
not retaining any remainders whereas the
float and the double is giving us the
complete answer the correct answer and
just to be sure that that is working we
could divide that by let's just divide
that by three run them again as you can
see the first one integer there was only
three goes into five only one so it
returned once so float has seven decimal
digits of precision
so that's numbers after the decimal
point and a double in fact has 16 digits
of precision after the decimal point so
you can see that double value is far
more precise and also as I showed you
before the default value for a decimal
point if you don't specify the F or the
D is actually a double and that's
another hint from Java that it
recommends that we use doubles so in
terms of space a float you remember we
talked about this in the previous video
the width of an integer it was 32 which
effectively is four bytes of float it's
got a width of 32 as well which is
equivalent to four bytes can you guess
what the double would be we would have a
double equals 64 which takes up eight
bytes
so a double takes up twice the amount of
memory that a float does but with that
said there's still really compelling
reasons to use a double whenever you're
using a floating point number in Java
first reason is that double precision
which is the use of a double data type
is actually faster on many modern
computers and secondly many inbuilt
functions in Java math functions that
you that like sin and cos and so forth
they actually return they actually use
doubles as their calculations and you
can understand why they want to do that
because it's more precise there's more
digits of precision so that's really
three reasons why you'd want to use it
the fact that the double is actually
faster on modern computers also the
inbuilt functions in Java usually use a
double and thirdly the double is far
more precise so it's actually as you can
see there's 16 units of precision
compared to just seven for that reason I
recommend using doubles and from this
point on in the course I'm only going to
be using doubles for mathematical
calculations so it's now time for
another challenge so the challenge is as
follows so here is the challenge convert
a given number of pounds to kilograms so
the steps to take will be to create a
variable to store the number of pounds
secondly you need to calculate the
number of kilograms for the number
entered above you need to store that in
another variable thirdly then print out
the result using the system dot out dot
print line and there's a note there that
should help you a lot to figure out the
conversion the one-pan is equal to zero
point four five three five nine two
three seven kilograms so go ahead and
try that now pause the video see if you
can figure that out come back when
you're finished
and start the video again and I'll show
you my solution so how did you go did
you figure it out let's make a start on
it so well step one we need to create a
variable to store the number of pounds
I'm going to call that double numbers
I'm gonna make that equal to 200 300 D
so it's 200 pounds next we need to
calculate the number of kilograms for
the number of pounds in this case 200
and store it in a variable something in
another one we're going to put double
we'll call it converted kilograms equals
so our hint is that one pound is equal
to zero point four five three five nine
two three seven or a kilogram so how
would we go about that well it's
actually pretty straightforward all we
need to do is multiply the number of
pounds by zero point four five three
five nine two three seven you want to
put a D on the end there just again to
tell Java that this is a double even
though it would default to it anyway but
just to be clear so we've now got our
converted kilograms and then we do
assist out kilograms equals plus
converted kilograms so now if you run
that we can see that the kilograms is
ninety point seven one eight four seven
four so let's check that now with Google
so we can easily do that so we can go to
Google and that will actually tell us
the answer so 200 pounds is ninety point
seven one eight five I'll just take a
copy of that so you go back to IntelliJ
and that was the result ninety point
seven one eight five in our case is
ninety point seven one eight four but
eight four seven so rounded up that
would be ninety point seven one eight
five so therefore our calculation is
correct so that's how you go about
converting pounds to kilograms and that
in a nutshell is the float and the
double for dealing with single and
double precision numbers in Java and
just one last thing now just to finish
off you remember in the previous video
we were able to use underscores when
defining a literal value so a literal
value for a float or a double can be
done the same way so we could for
example put double pi equals
now we could put 3.141592 7 like so or
with a D to make it precise but we could
also put if we wanted to 1 1 for 1 so we
could put numbers to find numbers like
that with underscores if he wanted to to
make it clearer or we're course can also
put them before they just report the
example 3 million so in that case the
answer the PI would be incorrectly
specified as 3 million point one four
one five nine two seven so just wanted
to make a point you can use underscores
to make your variables cleaner when you
are setting a value as a literal so
that's it we've now done we're now done
with floats and doubles in the next
video we're going to have a look at two
other data types the only the char and
the boolean I'll see you in that video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
