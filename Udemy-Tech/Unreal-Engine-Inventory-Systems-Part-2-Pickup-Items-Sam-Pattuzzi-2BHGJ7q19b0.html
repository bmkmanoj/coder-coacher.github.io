inventory systems in unreal if you
haven't watched part one then that might
indeed be the place to start so in this
video let me give you a taster of the
sort of thing that we're trying to build
here you can see we've got this first
person example Matt and I have got a
pickup here I can run up to it hit X and
I've picked it up and if I go and have a
look at my inventory which in the last
video we showed we figured out how we
could close the inventory and open the
inventory and in this video we're gonna
be looking at how we can make sure that
when we pick something up it disappears
from the world and we are going to then
later go on to be able to select use and
drop the items in the inventory but for
now we're just going to be focusing on
putting those items in the world and
making sure that we can make them
disappear from the world when we hit a
certain key so again our tool of choice
here is going to be unreal blueprint you
can follow along and C++ if you know how
to and if you don't have any programming
experience you are welcome to follow
along and just see how inventory systems
are created in triple-a game engines
that's what we're gonna do we're gonna
dive in and in this lecture focus on
picking up those items so without
further ado let's dive back in so this
is where we left a game last time as you
remember if you hit the I key the
inventory pops up like so and if I hit
the X on the inventory it disappears
again we're back into controlling our
game so how do we do the next bit
actually have a pickup in the game
now I'm gonna do this with a blueprint a
lot of people have for populating the
inventory use structs now the reason I'm
not going to use a struct is because if
I use a blueprint I can do thick clever
things like inheritance so that I can
have a drop functionality which is
common to all types of pickup but then I
can have certain pickups which are
equippable
certain types of pickups which are
usable like our Apple that I showed in
the example and that will be very very
handy and also I'll be able to put
functionality right in them so I can put
some blueprints in the pickup so certain
functionality if I wanted for example
the Apple 2
make me explode then I could when I use
it have an explode functionality set off
from that blueprint so that's what we're
gonna do we're gonna go to the root of
the content into our inventory folder
and I'm going to go to add new in here
we're just going to go and add in a very
simple blueprint class here and a base
is going to be an actor an actor is just
something that exists in the world so
I'm going to go ahead and select actor
is basically the most basic kind of
blueprint we can create and I'm gonna
call this item a pickup like so okay so
that's very simple and I want to go
ahead and actually create a more
elaborate pickup basic set up and one of
the main things that we're going to need
to know from a pickup is whether we are
overlapping with it or not we want to
know whether we can we're in range to
pick it up essentially and the way we're
gonna do this is with a Collider so I'm
gonna go through my components pane and
add a component and I'm going to look
for a spherical collision volume and I'm
gonna put it underneath the scene root
and that should do the trick like so and
I want to make sure that this spherical
object isn't going to block us we're not
going to we're gonna be able to go
through it basically now if you wanna
know more about collisions then I have a
series on collisions as well so we're
gonna go and have a look through our
details pane go to the collision area
and as you can see how collision preset
is already set to overlap all dynamic
which is exactly what we want so we're
gonna go ahead and compile that save
that and should be hunky-dory so at the
moment I'm not putting any functionality
in here we'll put more functionality in
as and when we need it so what I'm going
to do however is create a subclass of
this pickup for an apple so I'm going to
right-click it create a child blueprint
class and I'm going to call this my
apple and I'll just call it pickup a
pickup and in fact I'm gonna have a few
of these pickups so I'm going to create
a new folder and call it pickups like
that and I'm going to put the Apple
pickup in there moving it over rather
than copying it and if we open up an
apple pickup
then I should be able to put a mesh in
here so if I go click on the spirit add
a component look for a mesh and I'm
going to look for the static mesh and
with this static mesh I'm going to
select a mesh which is going to be our
first person projectile mesh seems to be
huge so I'm going to lock the scaling
and make it not 0.1 0.1 hopefully no
point I can't type one there we go and
I'm gonna actually make it in 0.1
across-the-board it looks like my
locking it did not work let's reset the
locking and try that again not point one
please there we go that's got it set
across the board I'm not sure about the
size of our sphere however so I'm gonna
go to the route pick up I have a look at
the sphere and see what size actually is
it so it's saying the radius of the
sphere is 32 that's going to be in
centimeters so I actually want to make
it radius of one meter so we can pick it
up anywhere from within one meter save
that and that's changed it in the Apple
pickup that is the beauty of inheritance
you can have a property in the parent
that is common to all of its children so
we've got our little apple pickup I'm
going to go ahead and stick said apple
pickup in the world there it is
now what happens if we go ahead and play
we can see it in the world we can
overlap with it but obviously we can't
do anything yet when we hit the X key so
the next step is going to be recognizing
that we have a pickup in a vicinity when
we hit the X key and to be able to do
something with it and in this case what
we're gonna do with it is we're just
gonna hide it from the world we're gonna
want to change that but initially we're
just gonna hide it from the world but
anyway let's start off by figuring out
when it's in our vicinity and I'm gonna
do this from our player porn class so
I'm actually gonna just go ahead and
select him in the world and then as an
edit blueprint button in the details
pane which I'm gonna use to open up his
blueprint editor here we go and I'm
gonna add in a key an X key for picking
up the item as I mentioned in the last
video you can do this with various
clever input bindings and if you're
aware and know how to do that
then please go ahead and
use those but I'm just doing this for
simplicity so with the X key what I want
to do is go ahead and find all the
pickups in the vicinity so how we gonna
do that well I'm gonna slip point there
take off the press key and I'm going to
look for overlap over that and we're
going to search down through this to
find all the overlap functions that
could be useful so I'm not finding
anything particularly useful in here so
what if we go ahead and just right click
without having pulled off the execution
pin and look for overlap there instead
sometimes this gives us different things
because we're in a so called different
context and unreal thinks that should
make a difference and here we can see
that there's a lot more stuff we can see
things like get overlapping actors which
is exactly what we want we want to get
all the overlapping actors of the
overlap with this actor with the
collision leche of this accent so we can
go ahead and do that and we can even
stick something called a class filter to
make sure that we only get a list of
actors of a certain class and we want
that we want to make sure we only get
things of type pick up I could further
restrict it to type Apple pickup or if
we had other intermediate classes like
an equippable pickup or a useable pickup
we could do it like that well but I'm
getting ahead of myself that's what we
are going to be wanting to do later well
not actually restricting this anyway
that's the point we are getting all the
overlapping actors of type pickup now
what we've got here is an array so it's
a list of actors that overlap and we can
do a for each loop on this one like so
which is basically going to mean that
it's going to go through with the
execution pin for every element in the
array so we're going to execute that for
each loop and in the body it's going to
have an array element which is each one
of the elements from said array okay
so we've got ourselves something which
is actually just a type actor we know
that because we've restricted its type
pickup we can cast it to type pickup and
it should be correct but just in case
it's got a cast fail we're not going to
write anything out in that case because
I'm fairly sure it's going to be correct
and then what do we do with the pickup
well I just said we want to make sure
that we can hide the pickup so let's go
into our pickup class create a new
function called hide and we'll worry
about the details of how to implement
that in just a second but we'll save
that and compile that and we'll go back
to our firstpersoncharacter and from
said pickup we are going to call its
hide function so let's just reiterate
what we're doing here when the X key is
pressed we're getting all the
overlapping actors of type pickup and
going through each one and casting it to
pickup which we shouldn't need to do but
we are having to do and we are calling
its hide function now at the moment this
is going to do absolutely nothing when
we go and hit it so let's make it do
something even if it's just simple the
hide is now going to call a print string
which is going to say hiding like so I'm
gonna compile and save that pickup and
go and hit play and now if I go up to my
pickup and hit X it says that it's
hiding now I don't believe it because I
can still see it so what are we going to
have to do to make sure this pickup is
actually being hidden well there's a lot
of different ways you could do this but
I think the two main things are the
visibility that we can't see it and that
it isn't gonna collide with anything so
I'm gonna drag a pin off here and just
search for visible and if I'm searching
for visible actually very cleverly
something that doesn't even have the
word visible comes up called sect act
act a hidden in game which is about
visibility so we're going to set the
actor to hidden true with the little
checkbox and we also want to make sure
that collisions are disabled because if
you don't disable collisions and you
might be able to pick up items you
already have and weird stuff like that's
going to happen so let's try and disable
the collisions as well and we can look
for stuff to do with collisions in here
and just go ahead and look through and
here you should be able to see set
collision enabled and actually that's
not the one I want let's have a look
enable collision set actor enable
collision is what I actually want so
it's for the whole actor no matter what
collision components it's got on it and
we're going
- said that's a fall sir no check in the
box so I'm gonna go ahead and save that
and hit play and now if we go up to in
our actor hit X it disappears and we
don't actually have it in our inventory
yet we're gonna look at how we're going
to do that in the next video but for now
that is pretty good what we do want to
tackle next however is making sure that
we can show it again basically do the
opposite of this and that should be
fairly straightforward for now I'm just
gonna do a little bit of a debug thingy
to allow us to show things again by
going to the first person character and
essentially just gonna have an extra key
in here so when X is released we're
gonna go through a very similar process
doing a for each of the overlapping
actors so let's just create a copy of
this I'm gonna release it two for each
and we're going to cast it to the pickup
and what are we gonna do with the pickup
we are going to show it so we're going
to create a new function in the pickup
call show and we're gonna call that when
it is released pickup show so now
obviously this is not how we're gonna do
it we're gonna do showing based on when
we drop the element but this isn't
actually important just yet now what's
the warning saying couldn't find a
function show called from show I think
that might just be a spurious warning
let's go ahead and just check does look
like it might just be wrong try and
compile again yeah it's just wrong let's
go back to the pickup find a show here
and do the opposite of what we did in
hide so I'm gonna copy oops not cut but
copy these nodes bring them over into
show and essentially what we want to do
is set an actor hidden in game it's a
false so uncheck that and set clabe
illusion to true and so that's the
inverse done right there so now
hopefully if we go ahead and hit play we
go up to pick up hit X and release X and
it should come back hmm isn't quite
working now it's probably because we're
getting all the overlapping actors but
remember when we hit it we disabled its
collision so nothing's gonna overlap
with it so instead let's get all the
actors of a type which is very
inefficient but we're just doing this
for debugging remember so the things
search for is get all actors of class
and we're going to make sure it's off
class pickup like so and we are then
going to just feed the all actors into a
for each loop and we need to feed the
execution pin of released to go through
and get all actors of class because it
is not a pure blueprint node let's go
ahead and hit save hit play go up to
pickup hit X release X and you can see
it shows and it hides which is perfect
so that just is to demonstrate that our
show is working correctly I'm going to
remove it so we don't get confused and
think that that's actually a
functionality of that game that we want
just want to make sure that our show
function was working correctly so I'm
gonna go ahead and save everything in
our project and we will be done for this
video so thank you very much Lee for
joining me through that video now it's
been very exciting because we've
actually got to a stage where we've got
something unique to inventory systems to
put into our inventory game now in the
next lectures where it's really still
gonna start to come together because
we're going to take those pickups that
we made disappear from the world and
actually make them appear in our
inventory with an icon as we've seen in
the example game so do bear with me for
that one do you like this video go ahead
and like go ahead and subscribe if you
want to see the next one and give me a
comment just to let me know how I'm
doing whether you'd like to see more of
this kind of thing if there's anything
in particular you'd like to see done in
unreal and I look forward to seeing you
in the next installment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
