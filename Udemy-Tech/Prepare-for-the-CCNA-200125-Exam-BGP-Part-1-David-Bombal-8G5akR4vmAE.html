added to the CCNA so it's important that
you have an understanding of the
protocol and know how to configure a
basic topology with BGP BGP is a very
large subject and you can spend a lot of
time learning the ins and outs of BGP
however for the CCNA it's a very much an
introduction to BGP when looking at the
CCNA exam topics in this case for the
200 - 125 exam we can see that one of
the exam topics is configure and verify
single home - branch connectivity using
ebgp IP version 4 the exam is limited to
peering and route advertisement using
the network command only
so again BGP is a very large topic I'm
going to explain a little bit more where
I show you the configuration of both I
BGP and ebgp the configuration is
essentially exactly the same at a CCNA
level in this genus 3 topology I have
two autonomous systems 65 thousand and
one and 65 thousand and two I'm using
public IP version 4 addresses in this
topology you can see the list of
assigned / 8 ipv4 address blocks on
Wikipedia
so in our topology I'm using Network
eight which belongs to level three I'm
using Network 15 which belongs to HP and
I'm using Network 17 which belongs to
Apple so Apple are connecting through
level three to HP in this topology I've
configured IP addresses on these routers
but nothing else
so show IP protocols BGP is not enabled
on this router and neither are a GPS or
interior gateway protocols such as AI
jarppi and OSPF BGP is an exterior
gateway routing protocol in other words
it allows for communication between
autonomous systems OSPF and EIGRP would
run within the autonomous systems hence
they called a GPS or interior gateway
protocols so on Rider one Rada BGP we
need to choose an autonomous system
number in this example I'm going to
choose autonomous system number sixty
five thousand and one BGP unlike other
routing protocols requires the
configuration of a neighbor you have to
manually and explicitly specify your
neighbor relationships they're not
formed automatically like they would be
in OSPF EIGRP so in this example we need
to specify that 1700 1.2 is a neighbor
and we use the command remote AES to
specify the autonomous system number of
the neighbor even though they both
within the same autonomous system we
still use the remote IAS number so I bgp
or interior BGP and ebgp or external BGP
both use the remote is number command we
need to advertise routes in BGP and to
do that we'd use the network command now
this uses a standard mask and not an
inverse mask and it's really important
that you have your masks set a right
show IP BGP
the show IP BGP command shows us that
the BGP table version is two BGP has its
own routing table so it has that in
addition to the IP version 4 routing
table the router ID is of 17 1.1.1 this
router only has that IP address
configured on it in the real world you
probably want to use loop backs but to
keep it simple I've only used physical
interfaces we can see that the network
is advertised into the BGP routing table
and that's what we're viewing over here
so show IP rot shows us the IP version
full routing table show IP BGP shows us
the BGP routing table this network has
been advertised m2 BGP with the next top
of 0.0.0.0 that means it's the local
router that's advertised the network
I'll discuss some of the other options
such as weight and path in a separate
video show IP BGP summary this is an
important command to remember it shows
us once again the road ID shows us the
local autonomous system number it shows
us the neighbors at the moment this
neighbor is set to idle BGP relies on
TCP in the same way that telnet does at
the moment we have no TCP sessions idle
means that we don't have a neighbor
relationship established to that peer
though TCP sessions have been
established the reason for that is we
need to configure the neighbor in BGP it
works as follows just because I want to
be your neighbor doesn't mean that you
want to be my neighbor both sides have
to agree to form a neighbor relationship
so both sides have to be manually
configured for the neighbor relationship
to be established so here we gonna
specify a neighbor 17 1.1.1 remote a s60
5001 and then we can advertise the
network into BGP
notice as I'm typing that the neighbor
relationship has come up so I'll just
complete this advertise that Network
into bgp advertise this network all
networks are using a slash 24 mask in
this topology so I'll advertise 8.8 28.0
into bgp so we saw the neighbor
relationship come up so we can use the
command show IP BGP summary this come on
can be very confusing notice the state
is empty or is blank
nothing's displayed here the output is
looped one prefix has been received in
other words the neighbor has advertised
a network to us show IP BGP summary
state is blank
that actually means established and here
we can see that two networks have been
advertised by the neighbor to us so show
IP BGP neighbor shows us that the BGP
neighbor is this it's an internal link
in other words we're using ibgp BGP
version used is version 4 that's kind of
like OSPF a version 2 or OSPF version 3
but this is BGP version for remote
router ID is 17 dot one dot one dot to
this router routed to only has these two
IP addresses configured and the address
for the highest number was used as a
road ID what's important to note here is
the BGP relationship is established
established means that the neighbor
relationships have been formed and the
routers are exchanging routes with one
another so show IP BGP summary the state
actually means established it means they
are advertising rafts to one another
show IP BGP the BGP routing table now
contains 8.8.8.8 vert eyes by routed to
the local router has also learnt about
17 1 1 0 from both itself as well as
router to the greater than sign means
that this is the best selection so for
this network the local router believes
itself rather than the other router it's
more likely that you're gonna believe
yourself then you're gonna believe me so
hence the local router selects itself as
the base
path to that network on rudder to you
let's configure the neighbor
relationship to router 3 so we get back
into BGP and we type neighbor 8.88 to
remote a s60 5002 so show run pipe
section BGP shows us the BGP
configuration we have configured to
neighbor relationships we're advertising
to networks into BGP on router 3 rada
BGP 65,000 and to neighbor 8.8 to date
at one remote AAS 65,000 and one network
and I'll advertise both networks into
BGP so network 8.8.8.8 and network 15 1
1 0 so show IP BGP summary let's do that
again
show IP v GP summary router ID is this
autonomous system is this neighbor
relationship is established to this
neighbor relationship show IP BGP
neighbor notice the neighbor 8.8 to date
at one is an external neighbor
we're running a BGP to that neighbor BGP
version is for once again router ID of
the neighbor is 17 one dot one dot one
dot two so show IP BGP the BGP routing
table contains these networks so at this
point we should be able to ping write a
one which we can
I'm going to turn off I P domain lookup
and trace without a DNS lookup
there are no DNS servers in this
topology so
first writer that we hit is H dot H
today dot one which is right at two and
then we get to router one in autonomous
system number sixty five thousand and
one so we now have connectivity between
Radha one router to and router three so
to prove that right at one camping
router three last rider to configure is
router for Radha
v GP sixty five thousand and two
neighbor fifteen 1.1.1 remote a s sixty
five thousand and to network fifteen dot
wandered one at zero mask 255 255 255 0
show IP BGP summary neighbor
relationship is idle we need to
configure the neighbor relationship on
Radha three son router three router bgp
65,000 into niba 15 1 1 to remote a s 65
thousand and two their relationship has
come up so on
Radha for show IP BGP we've learnt BGP
routes show IP rut notice the eight
network is displayed in the
writing-table and so is the 17 network
ping 17 dot one dot one dot one ping
succeeds so just to reiterate BGP uses
TCP so the command showed TCP brief
as you can see in the output here the
local router has a TCP session from
itself to router 3 and that TCP session
is established so we have a TCP session
that needs to be established for us to
receive BGP routes the neighbor
relationship needs to be established so
you see established with a show IP BGP
neighbor command the show IP bgb summary
command be careful the state is blank
when it's working if you see active it
means it's not working
BGP active doesn't mean that it's
working it means that there's a problem
BGP established means that it's working
properly so last test can be paying
router one year so we can can write a
one ping router for yes it can so that's
how you configure basic BGP in
preparation for the CCNA exam don't
forget that you need to manually
configure bgp neighbor relationships so
on each bgp router you need to configure
the autonomous system number you need to
configure the neighbor relationship and
you use the network command to advertise
routes through bgp that essentially
looks for rats in the IP routing table
that match that network command and then
adds those networks to the BGP routing
table for advertisement show IP BGP
shows us what the BGP routing table
looks like the greater than sign means
that that's the best route to the
destination network or prefix this means
that the network was advertised through
I BGP this means that the network was
advertised into BGP using the network
command I'm hoping that gives you a good
introduction to BGP in preparation for
the CCNA exam please let me know if
there are any other topics that you'd
like discussed as part of the CCNA vlog
if you enjoyed this video please like it
it means a lot to me if you liked the
video and especially if you subscribe to
my channel I wish you all the very best
