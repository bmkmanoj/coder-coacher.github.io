watched it I shocked you with how
complex it is to get this application to
run but now as you saw how it is and
that in the end we only use a couple of
these many files to do so namely the app
module the index.html the main TS and
the app component here since we only use
these files well I think we're now in
the spot that we can work on our
application and actually make it a bit
nicer or display more than just a Puerco
is i want to install bootstrap just to
get some styling and what this Eli
installing bootstrap is really easy I
can just download it with NPM install -
- save bootstrap we installed no chests
so we may use the NPM package manager or
the node package manager for this and
this will add bootstrap as a dependency
to this project with the safe flag I'm
basically telling it that I want this
dependency to have both in the
development environment as well as the
production environment now with
bootstrap install here you can see it
was added in the package dot jason here
with that installed i have to tell these
CLI that i want to use it to style my
application i can do so by going to the
angular CLI jason file which allows me
to configure my project fruity CLI and
here we get this Styles array here we
can add all the files we want to use as
global styles which means add them to
the index.html file because we want to
use them all or everywhere in the
application now besides Styles dot CSS
here we also want to use bootstrap
so let's simply reference it it was
added to the node modules folder and I'm
using two dots at the beginning because
we have to see this relative from the
index.html file on and indeed node
modules folder we have a new bootstrap
folder where we have a dist folder CSS
bootstrap CSS you can of course look
this up by simply having a look at your
node modules folder
and here at the bootstrap folder where
you will find exactly what I'm
referencing here there's bootstrap CSS
file so this is how we add bootstrap to
this project and with that it will
automatically use it as soon as we start
at Eng serve process here with control C
and then restart it and now we will have
the budget of styling available well
that's nice but I also want to add some
new components and so on we'll do this
next in case you forgot what you want to
build we want to build an application
where we have a collection and a market
where we can then add things from the
market to our collection so I will at
least need these two components
collection and a market now to create a
new component you get a couple of
options you could simply create a new
file on your own just try to keep this
naming convention of name dot component
TS you can also use this Eli it in this
Eli it's as easy as running ng then
generate or just G as a shortcut and
then component or just C as a number
shortcut and then I wrote the name of
the component you want to generate for
example here I want to create a market
component and I could now hit enter and
what this will do is it will create a
new folder in the app folder which holds
all the market component related files
now I can get rid of the spec file here
at the testing file and also of the CSS
file and also get rid of these style
URLs in the AB component ES file then
this created a new component and of
course you can also create these files
by hand there's nothing wrong with that
if you do create them by hand just think
about adding them to your app module
though here the CLI deters automatically
it will not happen automatically if you
create the files on your own so make
sure to add market component here to the
declarations array and also add import
to it at the top on the import statement
it's important that in typescript here
we don't add the file extension so we
only import market dot component and not
market component dot TS with that setup
we are able to now use this component
and we can use it by using its selector
which was set to AB market of course you
can overwrite this in our app component
HTML file so here I'll simply add app
market and save this which will trigger
a recompilation since the serve command
is still running and then on the page we
see app works and market works exactly
what I want this is how easy you add a
new component in your application now of
course this is not very beautiful and
not really close to what the application
looked like I showed you at the
beginning so let's fine-tune this a
little bit the first step is I'll go to
my style CSS file and add some global
Styles here just some padding to get us
a little bit more in the middle of the
page and not set it directly on the edge
thereafter I want to go to my app
component HTML file and work on that
here I'll quickly remove everything here
and add a container this plug-in i'm
using here which allows me to do this
trick here is called emmett and with
that i can just type the class name with
a dot at the beginning and then hit tab
as a side note nothing too specific just
a feature of my IDE so this is a normal
container class here using the bootstrap
framework and in here I want to load my
app market component as before now of
course I also want to work on this app
market component so in this market
component here I want to create a row
with a nested bootstrap column class
let's say like this to make it equal an
oil screen sizes not really creating a
great mobile first application here
and then I want to create a list group
so unordered list with the list group
class and in here a list item whips also
with the list group item class and this
will later on become the item where
I then will am able to click on add to
collections on right now it looks like
this a little bit nicer but not really
like the application at the beginning so
let's fight you need a little more in
this list item here what I want to have
is I want to have a span with the batch
class which should give me the type of
the item later on sold something like
photo I also want to have a button with
the but classes button and button
success to have a green button which
then says add to collection and finally
the name of the item so this could be
anything now if I say if this we should
be much closer to what we saw before
yeah definitely looks better we might
throw in an additional white space here
behind the button or after the button
just to get us a little bit further to
the right here but yeah looks great
of course this is a static content here
nothing dynamic about it the button
doesn't do anything and as you clearly
saw I'm not getting this data from
anywhere well we'll fix this in the next
videos for now I'm happy with the
current state of course I also want to
work on my upper component this
collection I do have two components in
the end so I'll create this component to
with ng gz4 generate component and then
collection and here since I won't use
these styles anyway I can add the - -
inline Styles flag or simply - is and
then spec false to not generate this
testing file and to not generate the CSS
file so with that you see I only got the
two files I need and then here you see I
now get these Styles array but no Styles
added so I can leave that there
so how should my collection look like
pretty much the same as the market so
I'm just going to copy and paste this
code in there but of course here I don't
want to add to collection instead I want
to have a class of button danger to make
it read with a text saying
remove from collection like this this
now gives me my collection and I can
quickly add this here let's say below
the market app collection like this and
if we now let this serve and again keep
in mind you have to add this to your
declarations every year in app module
collection component as well as the
import make this or make sure to have
this if you create a tiff file on your
own so with this in place you now see
the market and the collection of course
we don't have routing yet this will be
added in a later video but we got our
two components the next step is to have
some data to work with and let these
components communicate with each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
