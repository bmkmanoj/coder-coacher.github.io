number one in the Salesforce
administrator certification exam guide
and that first question says what should
a system administrator use to disable
access to a custom application for a
group of users now they specified to
choose one answer one thing to note
right off the bat and I get this
question often I want to answer this as
well is that in the actual exam they
will tell you how many answers you need
to select whether it's one two three or
four sometimes it's multiple select and
you need to select the three correct
answers this particular example there's
only one correct answer and so says
choose one answer in the actual exam and
will specify if you need to select more
than one answer and if so how many you
need to select so you won't be left
guessing so now our options here for
these answers are either a profiles be
sharing rules see web tabs or D page
layouts and remember we're trying to
disable access to a custom application
for a group of users and so if you think
about this we're trying to take away
access and that would be to a custom
application and if you think about in
Salesforce classic the application
drop-down in the top right of the screen
the way that you can control the access
to that is through profiles and so let
me pull up the system administrator
profile and show you where that's
actually done and another thing to bear
in mind is that sharing rules open up
additional access web tabs are tabs that
give you access to certain web
functionality or certain app
functionality and wouldn't relate and
then page layouts is where you can
control the page layout or how a page
appears but that wouldn't be used to
disable access to a custom application
alright so I'm in a Salesforce instance
and this is an instance that I use to
record my platform app builder course
and I've got a custom application opened
up called the IMDB clone app that's an
application that we built throughout the
duration of that course I chose to use
this particular ward because in that
particular course we did create a custom
map now in this administrator
certification course
we don't go through the process of
building a full-blown application
because it's not really relevant to the
admin exam and so I wanted to show you
how this works as far as restricting
access to a custom map and then as well
I recently logged into this org in order
to update a lecture and so it's in my
history and easy for me to access so
kind of killing two birds with one stone
here I wanted to show you this in this
particular org so if I go to profiles
and go to system administrator profile
which is my own profile that I have and
you could adjust this for any profile in
your org and we're just making sense of
this exam question this practice exam
question and I want to show you where
this is done in the real world in the
interface and we are in Salesforce
classic and you notice the winter 18
release here and so we've got our app
permissions and then we also have our
settings that specify which apps are
visible in the app menu which is
assigned apps now we wouldn't do the app
permissions that's permissions to
perform app specific actions within an
app for example such as manage call
centers we want to go into signed apps
and this is what controls what apps are
available to our particular profile and
so you notice we've got the IMDB clone
app here and it's visible as the default
app for my profile so if I click Edit I
can remove access by changing the
default app to a different app so I'm
just going to make that default app to
community app instead and then for IMDB
clone I'm going to uncheck that and I'm
going to click Save
so now I've restricted access to a
custom app for a group of users by
accessing the profile and going to
signed apps and unchecking the IMDB
clone app now you notice here that this
updated automatically took community and
so if I click on this down arrow here to
try and access time to be clone app I
don't have access to it any longer
and then as well the way this looks and
lighting let me show you that real quick
is you go to the app launcher and
lightning and so this works for classic
or for lightning and so if we click on
the app launcher we should not see IMDb
clone app
and I don't see it here anywhere and so
we've effectively restricted access to a
custom application by adjusting our app
settings and so we're going to go
through some of these other sample exam
questions in the duration of the
administrator course here where ever
they come into play and wherever they're
relevant to the topics that we just
covered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
