statements are very similar to our false
and else if statements it's just more
neatly organized and more efficient to
use let's take a look at what a switch
statement looks like right the syntax
for one is this here I'm just gonna go
ahead and remove these stars all right
the syntax for word is this so you have
a switch gets the keyword switch right
it's a see shove keyword and then you're
switching through some variable and what
you have here are case values so you use
the keyword case and then you specify a
value that that variable could be so for
instance for our example from the last
one you're calculating the average all
right and I'm gonna just leave this here
for now but just just know that what
you're switching through is a very worse
what you do and then you have a value
for what that variable is and if the
variable matches the value this code
gets ran and then you use the break
keyword to let it know that you're done
running whatever code you're gonna run
and then you have here a default case
which is like your else statement
all right so for this example here I'm
just gonna leave that syntax right there
but for this example it's gonna
calculate our average so if I actually
go over here yeah and if she doesn't
like them okay so if I go into run unity
it's gonna calculate our average all
right so let's go and run it see what it
is so the average is 16 okay so between
those three variables the average is 16
now what if I want to check the average
so for instance if I wanted to check if
it's 16 or if I want to check if it's 10
or 20 or for instance actually what if I
was yeah we'll go with this example what
if I want to check if the average was 16
so if I would I would say if average
oops go here and I'm gonna go ahead and
say if
I don't know why it's not giving you a
tortoise but if average equals 16 then
we're going to say P bug down log
average is 16 all right and then when I
hear an else--if and then say I want to
check if it's 5 else if average equals 5
so if the average is 5 I'm gonna say the
same thing here all right it's gonna be
average is 5 and then say I had here an
else clause or even another else if
actually let's add another allsafe
then we'll go ahead and say here that
average is 10 say we're checking for 10
so let's say debug log average is 10 all
right
and then here we can say else and we'll
have invalid all right and once I'm just
gonna get my tooltip back the way you do
that is you just got a resync
monodevelop and there we go okay so this
is an if-else statement I'm gonna show
you elf sorry it's an if-elsif statement
now this looks very very messy we have
four false statements here very messy
now all I'm doing is I'm just checking
the average and whichever one of these
conditions is true it's going to debug I
thought long that's the average now a
more efficient way to do this is through
a switch statement so for instance if I
wanted to I'm gonna go ahead and delete
all these if statements and I just want
to know what the average is so after
calculating the average I'm gonna use a
switch statement and I'm gonna say
switch then the variable I want to
switch through what very well am I
looking at that looking for a value for
it I'm looking for a value from average
so I'm going to put average in here now
I need some cases in a case is just what
values are you looking for so I'm
looking for a value of 16 or okay well
say I'm looking for a value of 16 and
then : and then code goes here so I'm
gonna go ahead and say debug log average
is 16
all right and then to let it know that
I'm done with this case I need to use
the break keyword which stops it from
running then I can have another case say
I want to check for ten
all right I'm say average is got a break
again all right now what if the average
is none of those well just like in an
if-else statement you have an else
clause we have a default case we can go
ahead and say default colon and then
debug log this is the default case you
could basically put whatever you want
there like invalid no selection no watch
no entry and what we can do now is go
and test this out see if it works okay
so check out this error
it says here control cannot fall through
from one case label to another the
reason why you'll get that is because
you forgot a break keyword you'll notice
in my default clause I don't have a
break keyword it doesn't know when to
end so add a break and you're good to go
all right so if we go and run this it's
gonna say average is 16
now what if I manually change the
average let's go and just make this like
a 40 here actually I do it in the
inspector
so that was 40 and I run it this is the
default case because the value was
neither 16 nor 10 so this is switch
statements it's the exact same thing as
an else if Clause no difference if you
guys want exercise what you can do is go
ahead and create a level selector which
is basically you know you have public
int I can do these strings too you could
say public int let's say public int
selected level all right and then you'd
have here public and selected a whole
and then you'd have three levels so you
would have like public and I'm sorry you
have selected level and then you could
have you know public and easy public and
easy medium hard by the way you can
write very
and a line like that if you're not
familiar with it just separated by a
comma and have the last one a semicolon
as long as they are the same data-type
this is completely legal
so yeah selected level and then you
based on your looking for easy medium or
hard
all right so 0 1 2 or or so you could
say easy equals 0
medium equals 1 and hard is 2 so what
you could do go ahead and try for an
exercise create a switch statement that
switches through this selected
difficulty so in the inspector you would
put a 0 1 or 2 for selected difficulty
and make these private and then go ahead
and debug log a message for this so if
you wanted to create an if-else
statement for it I would say if select
the selected level should be difficulty
so select a novel equals 0 then I would
get bug dialog you select it easy
alright and then you're doing else if if
it's one selected medium so forth so go
ahead and try and convert that to a
switch statement feel free to post it
down below in comments and if you have
more posts whatever you convert it into
comments and yeah I'll see you guys in
the next video thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
