hero courses calm and in this video
series I'm gonna talk about some of the
most frequently asked questions when it
cards to Asher Microsoft exam seventy
dash 532 developing Microsoft Azure
solutions in this first video I'm gonna
cover the overarching topic which is
what is it what is this exam what does
it cover who should take it what kind of
questions should I expect let's talk
about this topic so basically this exam
seventy dash five three two covers the
Microsoft Azure cloud platform from a
developer's point of view so this is
think of yourself as a developer this is
all the things that you need to know to
be developer Microsoft Azure if you have
any of the following rules or you aspire
to have any of the following rules this
could be for you if you want to design
Microsoft Azure solutions program for
Microsoft Azure implement Microsoft
Azure automation monitoring those types
of roles will be perfect to consider
this exam so what does the exam cover so
I said a couple of slides ago that this
is from a developer's point of view so
think about when you're developing code
whether you use Microsoft net or nodejs
or Java or any other languages that you
use that Microsoft Azure supports how do
you interact with the Azure platform how
do you use the databases how do you use
blob storage how do you use web apps how
do you use how does this run within
virtual machine how to use serverless
you know service fabric etc what is it
not cover this exam does not cover
networking that's a IT Pro and an
infrastructure type of job so Express
route and VPNs and SSL and all those
types of things not covered on this exam
does not cover backups and recoveries
again another type of job like that it's
also not a very deep database exam that
Microsoft does have a data exam for
Microsoft Azure but this this course
only covers data in so far as you're
inserting into tables reading from
tables from an application point of view
doesn't have data catalogues data lake
state of fact
and warehouses doesn't have some of
those analysis services for like for
data leaks and and as our sequel
analysis etc and even outside of the
single database advanced topics it
doesn't have my sequel doesn't have
Postgres sequel it doesn't it does have
tables and as your sequel and things
like that but but some of those other
topics are not on this exam it does not
have a lot stuff about hybrid the word
hybrid doesn't even appear on the exam
syllabus so you don't have to worry too
much about creating applications that
work in the cloud and also on premises
and cross those boundaries and I say
here it does not cover security it's
very important to split this it doesn't
cover security from the architect or
from the IT pros perspective in terms of
intrusion detection and the Microsoft
security suite and those management
tools but it does cover your application
security
it covers identity and authentication so
when it comes to having applications
that integrate with multi-factor
authentication or use third-party
authentication right so basically that's
the type of things that covers identity
authentication but not you know
intrusion detection or that kind of
stuff now going right into the syllabus
this exam has stuff about virtual
machines and so Mike virtual machines
are Microsoft's infrastructure as a
service offering and you could have
either Windows or Linux virtual machines
and a virtual machine is just like
having a physical machine in front of
you it's a little you know slightly
different but you can remote desktop
into it or you can SSH into it you can
install software set it up to configure
the way that you want
once you've reserved that virtual
machine and you're charged by the hour
for it you basically do whatever you
want with it you can reboot it you can
run applications you can monitor the CPU
and if you install too much or you try
to push it too much you'll have those
same situations and problems that you
have when you overload
server on your premises it talks about
data and storage and so we already
talked about the data stuff storage is
typically blobs you know Azure blob
service and the file service how you
store and and secure files from the
outside world how your application
accesses it some of the limitations you
know how how many files you can store
how quickly you can access it I ops
things like that how to scale that
identity we talked about which is a sure
when you tear about identity with
Microsoft Azure you're usually talking
about Azure Active Directory so one of
those Active Directory products whether
it's the core as your Active Directory
b2c and b2b also you know so so in
multi-factor authentication third-party
authentication any of these what they
call application and network service ism
so Microsoft provides messaging you know
communication notifications other types
of services that your application can
use and leverage and finally we're
talking about apps services Web Services
API services mobile services all of
those a platform as a service and server
lists service fabric and and things like
that functions logic apps all of those
other types of compute services other
than virtual machines that's also
covered on this exam whoo that's pretty
much it I mean it's it's not a terribly
difficult exam if you've got experience
in this you do need to study for it
because you know you can't just walk in
there and expect to pass there's a lot
of code on this exam and so you should
get some practice in but it's not the
most difficult of the Azure exams either
I do have a course on it yeah you knew
that was coming so if you are interested
in my courses on udemy it's a 70-53 to
divide as developing Microsoft Azure
solutions exam preparation course the
link is in the description now I have
various Azure courses there's as your
courses for beginners if you've never
you don't even know what cloud computing
is or you have not used Asher before
I've got courses for that and all of the
various certifications I've got more
than 40,000 students tens of thousands
of reviews so check out the link in the
video description for details and I
would love to see one side of one of my
courses Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
