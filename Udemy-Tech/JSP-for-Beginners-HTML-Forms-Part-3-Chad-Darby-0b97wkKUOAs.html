how to build drop-down lists with HTML
forms
so we'll cover the following topics
first off we'll see drop-down lists in
action and then I'll show you the HTML
code to build a drop-down list and
finally we'll pull it all together with
a full JSF I page example alright so
let's go ahead and get started
so first off here's a drop-down list in
action we have a student and they can
select our country and so we can give
them all the different options of the
countries here and so this is an example
of a drop-down list and I'll show you
the HTML code on how to build this type
of drop-down list
okay so let's look at the HTML code for
building a drop-down list
so basically you make use of a select
tag so here we have select and we say
name equals country and then you drop in
all the different options that you'll
have here for the drop-down list so here
we have option Brazil France Germany
India and so on and this will actually
help us build the drop-down list for our
application
and note here where we have a select
name equals country country that's the
name of the form fill you using your JSP
page to read the forum data and I'll
show you that later in the demo
all right so let's pull it all together
so we're gonna have an HTML form that's
gonna request a student's name first
class and also their country they're
gonna submit their form data and then
we're gonna have a JSP page that'll
actually process this and will display
the student's name and also display the
user's selected country
so I always like to have a to-do list so
the first thing we're going to do is
we're gonna create an HTML form and then
the second thing we'll do is build the
JSP confirmation page all right let's
move into eclipse and try this out
all right so we're in Eclipse what I'd
like to do is to continue to use the
existing project JSP demo
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
actually gonna have a form so the form
is gonna be very similar to the previous
one so I simply want to copy our
previous form and use it as a starting
point so select student form that HTML
just do a right-click and choose copy
and then right-click and choose paste we
simply want to paste a copy of this so
just do a paste
and at this point eclipse will prompt
you for a new name for the form so the
name we're gonna use here is student
drop-down form dot HTML so student
drop-down form dot HTML that's the new
name of our form once you have it with a
name go ahead and click OK
okay great so now we should have this
new form here a student drop-down form
dot HTML let's go ahead and open this
form up and take a look at it
the window here for a second
okay great so the first thing we want to
do is on line seven we want to change
the actual JSP page is gonna point to so
we wanted to point to a student drop
down response dot JSP
again student drop down response dot JSP
that's the new page that we're gonna
create in this video for actually
processing the form data from the drop
down list
there everything else here is the same
let's move down the line 16 and let's
add in first off let's just do some
white space here and let's add in the
actual tag for that drop down list using
a select tag so I'll say select name
equals country
and now here I'll go through and all
different options for the countries
so I'll start off with the first country
here Brazil
France
Germany and just more of the same I'll
just repeat this for all the other
countries here I'll speed the video up
just to list out all the other countries
here
okay great so these are all the
countries and this is our drop-down list
so this is great this kind of wanted to
do for building the HTML drop-down list
good job so far
all right so now let's go ahead and work
on on JSP page again our JSP page is
gonna be very similar to a previous page
we created so we're simply gonna copy it
so choose Student Response JSP right
click and choose copy
and then do another right-click and
choose paste
and we'll give a new name for it here so
we'll call it student drop down response
dot JSP
student drop down response dot JSP
we'll hit okay and
we have this new page that was just
created student drop down response.jsp
let's go ahead and double-click this
file and open it
all right so this had the very basic
page confirmation from the previous
video and now what we're gonna do is
just add information about reading from
that drop down list that drop down list
with the name of country so here I say
the students country
and I'll use that dollar sign
curly-brace program country and that
will read the information from that
drop-down list so good job
all right so let's go ahead and try this
out so how to test it we'll select our
form student drop down form doubt HTML
we'll do a right click and we'll choose
run as run on server
and this will bring up the form and we
can enter the users first name and last
name AJ
rau and will chooses country of India
and once we're happy with everything
we'll hit the submit button
okay great so we have a student's name
and also note here the students country
and that's all based on us reading that
drop-down list from the JSP page so good
job we were successful with that
all right well this wraps up the video
in this video I showed you how to build
drop-down lists with HTML forms and also
how to read that form data with JSP
great job
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
