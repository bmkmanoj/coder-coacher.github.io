to have you on board you're probably
watching this because you want to learn
and not you or at least learn what's new
web the final version of English you and
this and the next videos in this series
we're going to build this application
here a really simple application which
yet uses a lot of features of English
you like components modules routing and
much more in this application we get a
collection and a market and on the
market well we can add certain things to
our collection like let's say a box with
All Souls younès
awesome and then of course we see them
in a collection where we can remove them
so while this might look simple we're
covering a lot of key concepts of
English you in this application and I'm
happy to have you on board throughout
this series
let's directly jump in with setting up
our development environment now I'm
going to use the angular CLI the
command-line interface as it makes
setting up a what you project and
managing it really easy as you might be
aware setting up a go to project can be
a bit more complicated since we use
typescript and we need a compiler for
that
and if all that is brand new to you I
recommend checking out one of my basic
videos here on the channel where I
explain why we use typescript and so on
but basically we do use it so we're not
writing JavaScript code directly instead
we use typescript which is compiled to
JavaScript and therefore we need a more
complex project set up this Eli max
setting up such a project very easy but
to use this Eli we need node J s now
we're not going to write any node.js
code we're not writing server-side code
here we only need it for a a development
server which is automatically run by the
CLI just so that we can test and see our
code and be because of NPM it's package
manager which allows us to install these
CLI as well as all our dependencies we
may need in our project so make sure to
download the latest version here on
node.js org
6.6 at the point of time where I record
this video and once you download it and
install it head over to the command line
on windows or terminal here on Mac and
then install the angular CLI
you do this by simply running sudo on
Windows you won't need sudo and then npm
install - g2 install it globally angular
CLI at latest which will pull down the
latest version now once you hit enter
this will download the CLI and install
it well at least offer you enter your
password and then you're ready to use it
now I'll skip the step since it takes a
couple of seconds and I'll be back once
it has finished if you encountered any
issues during the CLI installation as
dumb as it might sound I strongly
recommend googling them to seal I still
in beta at the point of time where I
record this video and a lot of the error
messages you're getting are also there
for other people so googling them will
probably find you a solution really
quick now if this finished all
successfully you should navigate to a
path where you want to create your new
project and then you can quickly create
it by running ng which uses the CLI we
just installed new and the name of your
project now I'm going to name my
collection app but of course choose
whatever name you want and what this
will do is use the seal I to scaffold
out a finish pre-configure project which
we're going to use now if you don't like
the CLI of course you're free to use any
other C project or your custom workflow
you want all the rest of this course or
of this video series will barely use TC
ly I really only use it to set up this
project and have a development server as
well as a workflow to compile everything
and manage my files but if you prefer a
different approach do it like this I'll
be back once this is finished I hope tap
this newly created project in webstorm
which is the editor or the IDE I use but
of course you may use any other Eddy IDE
like Visual Studio code or an editor
like sublime or atom now in this editor
on the left you see the folder structure
and the files to see like rated for us
well the e to e folder here is important
for running end-to-end tests something I
won't cover in this videos here so we
can ignore it the source for
here holds all our source code and now
this looks like a lot especially since
we haven't written a single line of code
yet but that's basically just default
setup which we will use and in most of
these files we won't work for example
here in the top level while these Styles
the CSS file would allow us to create
our own global Styles which should be
added application white so this will
just be added to our index.html and this
index.html actually is the first very
important file here let's have a look at
it it's a default html5 skeleton here
and let's ignore this a bruit thing for
now this will be the only page which our
server DC lie ships with will ever serve
and the same is true if you were to
deploy this application on a real server
you only deploy or you only ship or surf
one page this index.html now what's the
sense behind that the idea behind this
is that angular 2 allows you to create
single page application which means you
only have one page and thereafter
angular 2 will re render the Dom add new
HTML elements remove existing ones
change some text and so on to give the
user the illusion of new pages being
loaded but actually it's one in the same
page which constantly gets changed and
this is not angular 2 specific there are
other frameworks for creating single
page applications as well you could also
create a single page application with
react.js for example so does the single
page we're loading and you won't find
any script imports in here because web
pack which is used by the CLI in the
background to manage our project will
inject these script tags automatically
so when we actually serve this
application we will see some well
something happened because actually
scripts will be added and we need these
scripts to run our angular 2 code which
you write because in the end that's just
JavaScript code getting executed in the
browser
well let's simply have a look at this in
terminal
and it's just a normal terminal
integrated in my IDE you can run ng surf
inside of this project folder that's
important to serve this project with the
angular CLI as I mentioned before DC Lai
ships with its own server so let's wait
a couple of seconds until this is all
built and thereafter you may head over
to a browser and open localhost 4200
which should give you app works which
means everything's working behind the
scenes this index.html file was loaded
as I just said some scripts were
inserted automatically by web pack and
these scripts happen to hold our
application even though we haven't
written anything yet but as you can see
default basic application was created
for us here now if you want to dive
really deep into the sea like structure
here I recommend checking out the
official github page of the CLI to which
you'll find a link in the video
description I'm going to focus on our
app which we can find in the app folder
now here is where we will write our
angular 2 related typescript code and
DCI happens to create as a very simple
app which holds a app component which is
kind of the root component of our
application I'll come back to the idea
behind components in the next video
which will show us this app works
content here we can see this if we open
it here we see that even if you don't
understand the rest but we have a class
which has this title property which says
app words and it seems like we somehow
reference a template here with template
URL and this template here points to the
app component HTML file which kind of
seems to output this title property
again I'll come back to this or what
happens in detail in the next video so
overall this is what we're seeing where
somehow rendering this app component
HTML file template we're displaying the
content of this title property and all
of that gets inserted in the index.html
file this is our first application and
how we set it up with the CLI in the
next video in a serious
I'm going to explain what actually
happens when we visit this index.html
how our angler to application gets
started and what makes opening a to
application see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
