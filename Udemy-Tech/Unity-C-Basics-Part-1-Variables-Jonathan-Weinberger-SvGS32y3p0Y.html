tutorial series is going to cover the
fundamentals of programming and I know
that there are tons of resources out
there already that cover this and I've
actually directed people to resources
that I believe are quite decent but for
whatever reason one of the most popular
requests that I've ever received is can
I do my own fundamental series so after
thinking about it that's what I'm gonna
go ahead and do and what this course is
gonna offer is it's literally gonna
cover the fundamentals of c-shape
programming and we'll go through
project-based examples and it's gonna
get you comfortable so that you can self
educate yourself continue moving forward
give you an easier time on my tutorial
series and then we also be able to adapt
what you learn here to different
scenarios so the way it's gonna work is
with each lesson might be a little short
because today's lesson is going to be
variables but going forward with each
lesson you'll have a practical
application to use it with then
basically I'll go through a couple
examples and it'll leave you with one to
complete on your own and we'll go
through those but basically we're gonna
be covering you know what you typically
find in the fundamentals we're gonna do
variables go into if statements arrays
for loops for each loops and we'll
probably get into some advanced stuff as
well like design patterns like the
singleton manager will probably cover
delegates and events at some point event
actions and lambda expressions those
last three are very advanced but there
are awesome features that are part of
the.net framework so pretty much that's
where we're gonna go ahead and that's
what this series is gonna be about it's
basically getting you comfortable with
the fundamentals so that you can self
educate yourself and learn to program so
what we're gonna be covering today are
variables so what's a variable they will
store information we assign values to
them available as the requirements with
an optional fourth in order for a
variable to be valid it must have public
or private identifiers as to have a data
type so like for instance
in this variable you can think of my
variable is like a box that has
information what's assigned to that box
or what's in the box and it must have a
name every variable has a name all right
and the fourth option is to assign a
value to that variable now that's
optional all right so the syntax for a
variable goes like this so for instance
if I wanted to create a variable for my
name which is Jonathon I would mean to
required three required components with
an optional fourth so I would have to
have a public or private identifier so
for instance if it's public it means it
can be changed
outside the script it can also mean I
can edit it in the inspector if it's
private only this script can access it
it's not available in the inspector it's
and nobody can see it so it's a private
variable that only works in this script
so I'm gonna say public now the data
type which is the next thing is what is
in this variable what is this variable
gonna hold it's gonna hold my name which
is a string of text okay so the
continent's for common data types are
typically work with and they are int
which is integer whole values so like 1
2 3 negative 3 negative 2 negative 1 0
you have float which is decimal numbers
which requires the suffix of F lowercase
F at the end and that's like any decimal
five point five six point three nine
point seven and so forth then you have a
string which is contained in quotations
and it's characters of text things like
what I'm saying now is a string hey and
John whatever you know what I mean so
then you have a bool which returns true
or false it's used for checking things
like is the player dead it's a true or
false value all right so using variables
we can create game logic so if I want it
available for my name it's a string of
text so I'm gonna say straight and then
every variable needs a name so my name
and then I could leave it like this and
if I do I can come to the inspector and
I can assign it right then and there my
name I could put John --then right so I
could put Jonathan here
or I can go into the script and I could
simply just say in strings and in
quotations say John alright now if I
wanted a variable for my age that's
using an instrument
which is a whole number right I'm not
22.5 I'm 22 so I'm gonna go ahead and
say I can make it public can actually
wanna make it private so I'm gonna say
private and then int we'll say my age
equals 22 now because it's private no
other class can access this variable
only this script can access it and if
you're not familiar with what a class is
you can think of a class is almost a
blueprint for your program it's
basically what holds instructions for
what your program should do so I have a
private variable which means it only
works in this class so if I go to unity
you'll notice I see my name variable
here but I don't see them my h1 because
it's private so let's move on so let's
go into at a speed a float value so for
instance let's go and say in public
let's go in so you enjoy keeping
together so let's go ahead and say
public float speed and say my speed is
five point five now if I just leave it
like this I'm gonna get an error because
it's a float it's a decimal value and
you have to specify it with a suffix of
death just the lowercase F like that if
I didn't do that
you'll get an error and I will just say
are you missing a suffix F at the end
right so you always remember your F and
your semicolon at the end all right
let's see now we have a ball so a ball
was like a true or false so I'm gonna go
ahead and say here you're gonna say
public ball all right boys true or false
value and I'm gonna say is cool all
right if I leave it at default like this
the value is false and I can see it in
the inspector as a little checkbox if I
want to that I can assign it it's
optional and I could say true it's cool
so these are the four common data types
that you'll work with in a scenario
where you want to decide if something is
going to be public or private
it would typically do that with based on
with the information it so for instance
in a game related scenario if I have a
variable for my health which is gonna be
an int because it's a whole number you
have a hundred health not a hundred
point five or ninety nine point two
health right so sad public in hell and
then equals 100 that's gonna be public
because think about you're gonna have
enemies in your game and those enemies
need to damage you well what is damaging
damaging is subtracting your health
right well your enemies have their own
class
so eventually when we get into class
inheritance they need to access this
variable here which is public and
decrement the health great that's in the
video so so basically you want that to
be public now things maybe I don't want
public what would those be those would
be things like the minimum health for
instance say you had a very bored out
here say you got a variable for max ammo
right so say you had a so we had a
variable called private int max ammo
count max ammo count equals 100 the
reason why it's private is because I
don't want any other script to change
the max ammo count of my weapon if my
weapon was designed to hold 30 bullets
it's gonna hold 30 bullets nobody should
be I'm gonna say that hey instead let me
go ahead and make it like 50 bullets
right one also important thing to know
about variables is that they're called
variables because they can vary right
for instance with these public variables
right now it's a hundred however in
about five minutes from now it could be
50 so variables vary that's how they get
their name all right they can change for
instance I declare it my age is 22 up
here however if I were to create the
void start function which is part of the
mana behavior and I were to say here my
age equals these teen right now it's 22
but right when I start my game it's now
18 so what you guys can do is I you can
mess around go and create some variables
if you want an exercise go ahead and
create go and create three variables
that describe your your ASL so age sex
location and feel free to post it in the
comments if you're not if you're not
following me on Facebook or Twitter or
subscribe to DG I I recommend you do so
you can go to digital gaming Institute
comm you get the links alright guys I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
