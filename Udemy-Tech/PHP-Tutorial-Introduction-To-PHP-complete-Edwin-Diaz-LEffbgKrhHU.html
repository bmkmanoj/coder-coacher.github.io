are ready to learn PHP I'm ready to
teach let's get started hi welcome my
dear students so here in this lecture I
want to explain to you what PHP really
is I'm now going to give you some really
hard to grasp
concept on what it is or answer I want
you to understand it in a very simple
manner PHP is a server-side scripting
language or programming language it's in
the server now we got languages
programming languages that are used in
the browser
we've got programming languages that are
using your client like for example
JavaScript we got stuff like HD
now in CSS that are used on the client
decline when I say climbing means the
browser you see this is a program in
your computer the browser is a program
ok that's created using a language like
C++ and this program this program's job
or the browser's job is to to do a lot
of lots of things
if buddy works with JavaScript HTML and
CSS okay so when you see stuff like you
know when I click here JavaScript is
creating all this effects ok
for example I'm just giving you an
example the stuff that it does all these
stats is being outputted by it's using
HTML and all these colors and stuff is
CSS and stuff like that ok so the
browser's job is to communicate across
not only from where you are if you if
you have internet but also display
certain things that you have in your
computer for example if you have an HTML
page you can display that in your
browser but that would be an HTML page
you can put CSS and you can even put
JavaScript so those are client-side
programming languages well the HTML is a
markup language ok but javascript is a
client-side programming language PHP is
not you cannot run PHP in your computer
unless you have a program that we are
going to be installing in the next
lectures ok so we are gonna make our
computer a server by using another
program and don't get don't be scared
don't worry it's not something that's
going to messed up your computer
anything like that it's just a small
program that is going to act as a server
so that way we can run PHP and show you
what this is all about ok so PHP like I
say it's a server-side language and now
when we talk about PHP we send a
requests when we type in address for
example I come here to my website and I
say and I click contact right
this is sending a request to where my
domain is located to where that server
is behind the scenes
okay so he's sending a request to the
contact page so because this is rating
in PHP okay he goes to a PHP server in
the backend and that server executes
okay I'll process that PHP and process
all the data you send it in that request
and then it sends back what you see in
front of you it sends back HTML
Javascript CSS sends all that stuff back
to you to the client to the browser okay
because that that server has to be a PHP
server in order to receive PHP so every
time we send that request when we send
it from our browser okay
we have said we are sending PHP stuff
and it needs to be processed and then
sent back as a HTML CSS because browsers
cannot understand PHP so it needs to be
processed on a server or some type of
program in your computer like you will
see in the next lectures okay so that's
it that's what PHP is okay and there are
many hosting providers out there that
can actually run PHP and here is a
couple different images that I found
when you type in why is PHP you can look
at it and get a better idea with some
graphics you can see that from a laptop
here we send the web page request which
is in PHP this is the server here it
will process a PHP transforming to HTML
and send back those test files okay HTML
CSS and text files back ok in PHP s
stands for hypertext preprocessor and it
also stands for personal home come
personal home page or something like
that that's that was the first the first
meaning of PHP back in the day when
creator the developer of PHP made it
happen okay so that's it I don't want to
make this you're a lot more complicated
than what it is that's all is a
programming language on the server we
need a PHP server to understand it or we
need to process PHP or we need some type
of programming or computer to develop
PHP programs like angle like I'm about
to show you in the next lecture
okay so anyway you guys ready okay let's
continue with this now I work on my dear
students so it's time for us to start
playing around with PHP but before we do
that of course we need to download some
type of program to allow us to run PHP
remember that PHP is a scripting
language that works in the server okay
is it some some people or some
developers call it a programming
language as well because you can do a
lot more than just scripts with PHP okay
so you're gonna hear those terms scripts
a scripting and programming so that's
okay now to run PHP we need a server but
because we are in development we can
take advantage of some free programs out
there that we can download to our
computer and those programs will act as
a server so we can develop our programs
there or websites or applications and
then we can export that to a hosting
company out there like maybe GoDaddy or
there's so many different companies that
you can run PHP as a matter of fact it's
you know ninety ninety percent of the
web runs on PHP so you can find a lot of
hosting companies out there and I will
give you some recommendation later on
but right now you're learning so here's
the deal we need to run PHP so what do
we need well I'm gonna show you a couple
different ways of running PHP in your
computer
the preferred way that I did I use for
my students that I recommend my students
to start with is MAMP okay he has Apache
MySQL okay hanging Apaches assert the
software or the little program that runs
right at the server that runs the PHP
okay this is what process PHP and MySQL
runs the databases okay so you're gonna
have a my SQL data server in this little
program remember the program is going to
be acting like a server so it's now
really a server it's just acting like it
inside your computer okay so you can
download mam for Windows and Mac OS and
if you click on any of these links here
you can see the options right here now
this interface of this website could
change in will change in the future so
don't worry as long as you download the
latest version of PHP you're you're good
to go okay doesn't matter what version
you download after seven really I
haven't seen any more change
big changes okay after seven to seven
point two but remember that you know PHP
the community community keeps adding
features and make it making PHP faster
and faster so downloading the latest
version would not hurt you okay
sometimes I prefer to download something
in the middle okay just to make to play
safe but anyway so you can go ahead and
download it just like you download any
program and just follow the prompts it's
very easy to install
okay so MAMP is one way of that of
installing PHP on your computer or
playing around with it I'll show you the
Installer right now I'm using a Mac
right now but it should be very similar
to Windows you open the Installer once
you finish downloading it and you're
gonna have something like this you're
gonna go through the prompts continue
continue agree continue continue
continue and install it okay I already
have it so I'm not going to play around
with it okay so once you install it it's
going to look like this you're gonna
open your control panel you're gonna
find it in your programs in your
computer just like a regular program you
click on it and you open it up okay you
can stop right now mines are running
okay you can see it says Apache server
this is what runs PHP MySQL is what runs
the databases we're not using any of
them right now but the environments
running okay so for those of you using
Windows you're gonna have a folder
called MAMP
in your programs okay in your c drive so
go to your c drive you're gonna see a
folder called MAMP and inside of that
folder okay let me actually show you my
folder so that way you can get an idea
even though I'm in a Mac operating
system for Windows users it should be
very similar to that
show you applications for Mac users and
I'll show you right now if I can find em
right here okay and you're gonna have
inside this map folder for Windows
remember is on your C Drive okay and for
Mac user since you in your applications
ma'am and then you're gonna find this
folder is called htdocs this is where
all your projects are gonna be located
okay
as a matter of fact I'm gonna create a
folder right here in htdocs' and I'm
gonna call this PHP okay
enter that's gonna meet my folder there
and inside there I'm gonna create a file
but I'm gonna show you that later on so
this is mam there is also another
program if that gives you a problem we
also have zamp okay this is another one
as you can see just download it very
similar to that one there is also
another one called wemp there's a whole
bunch of them one server right here so
if any of those gives you a problem you
have many choices and if for some reason
you can't download any programs in your
computer and you're doing this from some
type of mobile device or something like
that you can run PHP online ROM PHP
online okay now show you a couple of
different ones this one here okay as you
can see you can run PHP right now this
echo means this little word and this
means display okay so if you run that
you can see that you're gonna see the
display that's in the bottom there
there's a different one that's actually
better let me show you run PHP online
this one I like this one because you can
write your PHP and I'll show you I'm
just gonna you don't have to actually
pay me a lot of attention to this I'm
gonna create a variable which I'm going
to explain later on what they are well
look at it as a container okay I'm gonna
put my name Edwin Diaz in here
okay and then I'm going to use echo to
display that variable remember that the
variable is a container okay so remember
now I put the value I assigned a value
to this variable and now I'm displaying
with echo the variable that has this
value there right okay now I can run the
code and this is the output right here
just taking a little bit because maybe
some people are already using this okay
shift enter will also execute this code
if for some reason you find it that this
is taking too long there are other ones
that you can use but as you can see we
are displaying what we wanted here okay
and just to give an example that is
working perfectly I'm going to create
one variable here and I'm gonna create
another variable one is call number one
the other ones call number two and what
I'm gonna do is I'm going to add both of
them together okay plus the variable
number two put the semicolon there to
finish the statement then I'm gonna run
the code this is just taking a little
bit let me just go somewhere else PHP
runs PHP online okay this is another one
right here fiddle this is a and this is
a good one here too so little bit more
complicated but as you can see right
here I was able to add two numbers one
and ten and display it we echo see that
so anyway that's another option for you
guys that don't have that you know at
the ability to download some type of
program to you in your computer but
anyway so I'm done showing you ma'am
zamp lamp and running
PHP online so are you guys ready to go
to the next section let's do it so I'll
see you in a couple seconds where we are
going to be enjoying PHP real-time take
care guys see you net okay so after we
download our programs to execute PHP on
our computer we need to test it to see
if it works right so for those of you
that downloaded mam all you have to do
is go to localhost on top here okay
first of all open your mam control panel
okay and then you can click on this open
web start page okay now this is the
program working on your computer and as
you can see right here on top it says
localhost this is the address the name
okay off the port of the address that
you're going to be using for your
application for example if I type in
127.0.0.1 is the same thing as typing
localhost so these programs they all
take the internal address 127.0.0.1 as
the address of that your development
environment now what differs is the port
number right here as you can see it says
: eight eight eight eight yours might be
different so you got to look at your
control panel
okay and look at your preferences and
make sure that your ports okay
all right exactly like that now you can
change the ports I can change my Apache
ports to be whatever I want I can put a
777 here click OK restart my servers and
type in a 777 here and I will get the
same page right here okay so those for
those of you that are actually having
issues with your porch you can change
them right here the Apache remembers for
PHP MySQL is two
two databases okay and that's it you can
stop your service and we start them
again and then your porch with will
change okay so anyway so once you have
your program downloaded for some of you
is gonna be a eight like mine for some
of you is just gonna be localhost like
that or I mean 127.0.0.1 or just
localhost like this okay so where's this
coming from you might be thinking okay
he says it says it works so something
must be working well you got that right
we have this map this folder right ma'am
htdocs in PHP now that it works is
coming from our program okay we have
many different files right here look at
that all these folders all these folders
carry everything that that program needs
to work ok look at this so this is where
all that is coming from now in order for
us to start working on our project
remember that we created this folder
called PHP right there that's actually
the me get put another view in my
computer already inside this is where
I'm gonna create a new folder actually a
file so here's the deal before we get
into creating projects or anything like
that we need to find a way to execute
PHP not only to execute it but to edit
our code ok so we are seeing things here
but this is the browser showing us some
information some data we need some type
of editor so we need some there are a
couple different editors out there they
are
Ted's editors okay
editors are editors that we can use to
execute to edit code okay this is a very
popular one sublime
okay now this editors some of them have
many different plugins that you can use
it for different languages okay you can
use sublime for PHP for JavaScript for
nodejs but you need to store different
plugins for to make the support better
and when I say support means that this
editors will recognize the programming
language that you are using and will
highlight certain things from that
language okay we don't need a data
editor because sublime actually it's
something that you have to pay for so
I'll show you a free one that I like to
use for PHP I'll show you PHP it's
called brackets okay brackets that I owe
so you can go ahead and download
brackets is a free open source okay
editor which is super awesome for HTML
Javascript and even PHP and then you can
also use it with with different world
languages so if I open brackets I'll
show you I probably have some type of
file here okay this is actually the
index of brackets says me with love and
JavaScript okay
so anyway we created a folder in the map
in the htdocs directory right we created
this PHP folder so what I'm gonna do
with this PHP folder that we created in
the htdocs is I'm going to drop it in
there
inside the brackets and that's it now
keep this in mind okay download it
download brackets and install it like
you installed any other program okay
I'm going to click it here just to show
you real quick
super easy to install guys it's just
like install any other program okay
let's wait for it
let's wait okay and in the Mac of course
we have to drag it here but anyway so
it's very easy to installed and then the
next thing you know you will have it
installed in your computer go to your
programs double click it or if it
installs an icon here on your desktop go
ahead and double click that and you
should have brackets okay so anyway this
is my new version of brackets I guess so
let's use the new version so now that we
have this editor here we have the folder
open right here I'm gonna right-click
and I'm gonna put index dot PHP now when
we are actually writing HTML remember
that PHP is a language that we embed
with HTML he works with HTML it gives
HTML superpowers ok so in order for the
browser to execute PHP in order for the
server the little program that we got
right here ma'am in my case to
understand that we are creating a PHP
file we need to give it an extension in
that or whatever name you want dot PHP
that way this program here knows okay we
are expecting PHP stuff here okay so we
are going to be executing PHP so now we
need to create some type of PHP code
here so I'm gonna use a less than symbol
question mark PHP space question mark
greater than symbol so less than symbol
question mark PHP all together and then
space question mark greater than symbol
I'm gonna put my the cursor
here and I press ENTER I'm gonna put it
down a little bit and I'm just gonna do
right echo right here between here
anyways white spaces that you type in
before this line it really doesn't
matter
okay so echo I'm gonna put two quotes
shift and I'm gonna put Edwin Diaz which
is my name and then a semicolon at the
end of this alright write everything
exactly like I'm doing it right now I'm
gonna do command a so ctrl s to save it
or you can just go to file and then save
now let's open up our browser we should
have our browser somewhere here remember
localhost okay so for some of you you're
gonna have a 8 8 8 or whatever port
number and for those of you that have a
port number just type in that port
number and PHP ok and then enter and I
want you to look out see what happened
you see my name now so this code right
here it's the same as this okay look at
the folder structure here PHP and then
we have this file index we don't you see
this program right here ma'am or any PHP
server knows that index is the root it's
the home page so it does not display
here you can type it in if you like
really doesn't matter but the PHP server
knows which is Apache right now ok very
very simple now if I create another file
I'm gonna create another file I'm gonna
call this example dot PHP and I'm going
to copy what I got there here paste it
there and I'm just gonna put example
here safe now in this here on top I need
to put the name of the
file with extension and you can see now
that we are executing what's here okay
see how simple that was so you can also
come here and for those of you that
don't need to type by a port right and
do something like this but mine I need
to type up or in mine
okay mine in support but the some of you
might not need a port and you just go to
local host PHP name and the name of the
other file okay so let's go back here
very easy to execute PHP so we are done
with this lecture I'll see you in a
couple seconds in the other lecture guys
take care welcome back my dear students
I know for some of you it was probably a
couple seconds but I did post a video I
had to take a little break but anyway
are you guys ready okay let's do this so
we're learning a lot of cool stuff here
with PHP we you know we were able to
download a program and we are able to
execute PHP if you have any issues you
can make a comment and we can help you
fix it remember that I also have this
full course that I created in entirely
on PHP where we build you know a content
management like WordPress from scratch
the link is in the description but I
take you from not knowing anything to
becoming a master in PHP you're gonna
love that course so anyway so one of the
things that I wanted to show you with
this editor that we downloaded called
brackets is that we can have extensions
okay so go to brackets you know open
your program and you can go to extension
manager right here and I like to
download this extension called Emmet
okay and I already have it installed but
if you don't have it go ahead and click
installed and restart brackets again you
know go turn it off right here and find
it somewhere in your computer click it
double click it and drop the folder and
get that folder PHP in there again
and you're up and running again with
this okay so with this I can do
something like this I can put a
exclamation here with shift and my
number one right in my keyboard and then
tab and that would create a skeleton
HTML skeleton file that we can use to
build our applications okay this is the
structure that we need for any HTML
document this is a html5 structure okay
html5 is the version is the duck type
okay this is the version that we're
using and this is a modern version of
HTML and if you don't know HTML you
should take a course on HTML my name is
Edwin Diaz and I do have a free course
on HTML and CSS okay but PHP runs on
HTML as well and I'm gonna show you how
that works right now so this is the file
I'm going you know I put an h1 tag here
meaning that I'm gonna turn these tats
into an h1 I'm gonna click here and it's
telling me a listen you need to type in
this address YouTube for this to work
I mean I'm gonna say ok I'm gonna do the
address that I have on top here
localhost colon 8080 8 okay
and then believe it was PHP when my
project was located now if I click here
I'm actually getting this right here see
that so it's working now let me actually
take this browser out and let me put
this in the side right here so you guys
see what I'm doing
let's come back here now I can't
actually launch everything from here
so now like I was
before we can embed PHP into HTML they
both work together it's like having HTML
with steroids it's like giving HTML on
steroids let me let me show you so I'm
going to create right here on top of the
file some PHP come here so remember that
we we need to have an opening and a
closing tag for PHP to work this less
than symbol question mark PHP all
together is the opening tag and this
question mark greater than symbol is the
closing tag so we're telling here it
start PHP okay and then you end it right
here so that way you can start HTML now
I go into more details in my full course
I take you from all the way from scratch
but in this course in this series here
I'm showing you this examples so what
I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna create a
variable with a question with a dollar
symbol I'm gonna name the variable
whatever I want to remember the dollar
symbol and the name of the variable they
need to be together then we have this
equal than symbol to assign a value we
can assign assign strings a string
meaning tetes with double quotes or
single quotes or numbers without them
okay so I'm gonna use double quotes or
mine and then I put Edwin Diaz okay so
now if I wanted to display this right
now I'm gonna take this off I'm gonna
save it and when I say that you can see
this live preview with brackets this one
of the things I love about brackets it
will show you right away
what's doing now if you for some reason
cannot get this to work remember that
you need to save your document and
refresh okay so if for some reason this
little
thunderbolt pain doesn't work for you
all you have to do save the document
save and refresh your browser and then
you will see the value change but anyway
I'm gonna take that off and then I'm
gonna I'm gonna do command S or ctrl s
to save it and you see that's out of
there if I wanted to display this value
my variable name and you can name your
various whatever you want I have to put
your PHP code opening tag right here so
any closing tag PHP tag so let me close
it to start HTML again and I'll do echo
cause echo is a little word that we use
to display stuff and the name of my
variable after and then after a
semicolon and then I'm going to do safe
command s or ctrl s and now you can see
the value again right here so you can
see now that we're using PHP right here
which is really awesome right I can do
first name if I do this you see now that
I'm getting some type of error this is
actually our little program here called
mam giving us this error in selling us
on licensing on line 16 there is a
undefined variable that's there correct
we don't have this variable anywhere so
I'm gonna create another variable here
and I'm gonna call this last name okay
and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
put together first name here let me just
take this out command S or controller s
to save it and I'm going to concatenate
this is Co concatenation a dot and the
next variable name which is last name
enter and as you can see we have those
together there now there's no space
there so we need to actually tell PHP
listen I want you to put a space there
so we need to concatenate a space and we
do that by putting this single quotes
here you can put double quotes it
doesn't matter safe and now you can see
that it does have a space okay
pretty awesome stuff right guys and
always when you're writing HTML you
always write it on the top of your when
you're writing PHP I'm sorry you always
write it on the top of your HTML okay so
that way you can start using it inside
here as well but you want your PHP to
execute before your HTML when the
browser sees it thank you so much guys
and I'll see you in a couple seconds in
the other lecture welcome my dear
students I hope you guys are having a
lot of fun in in this most series in PHP
remember that the link to the full
course is in the description of this
video ok so I start you really quick on
PHP I gave you all the information in
all the knowledge to start PHP right
away to start coding in PHP in your
computer this was a fast track very fast
so that way you guys can get up and
running with PHP but now I'm gonna take
it down a notch and I'm gonna show you
some of the things that you need to know
in order for you to be coding in PHP
besides just getting started ok some of
the major components of PHP are going to
be variables arrays control structures
like if Conda if statements ok switch
statements loops things like that things
that will actually help you create
programs in PHP okay so let's start with
variables I'm gonna create another file
here I'm gonna call these variables dot
PHP okay remember that PHP the extension
remember you can get HTML and PHP
working together without extension so
variables let's go ahead and play around
a little bit with variables we already
saw seen variables right we've seen that
before but now let's play a little bit
more with them let's go ahead and create
a variable called name we already did
this right let's let's call it first
name we know that we can do this now you
might be noticing on some of the things
that I'm doing actually here I'm gonna
make this a little bigger
I'm actually using something called
camel case I'm using lower case in the
beginning and the second word would
upper case and I'm gonna keep doing that
every time I have a new word lowercase
uppercase lowercase uppercase this is
called camel case and this is very good
convention for naming your variables
okay don't ever name your variables like
this let me actually open a PHP tag here
less than symbol question mark PHP all
together I don't need to close it if I'm
not going to be writing HTML okay but
get in the habit of closing it anyway
but as you can see I got a red line
right here this is not a very good sign
okay don't ever write your variables
with a hyphen you can use on this course
that's acceptable
okay so I'm gonna show you some of the
good conventions here and some of the
bad conventions okay we got the first of
all we got the camel case right here so
I'm showing you how to define your PHP
variables okay we got the underscore you
can also use I'll show you upper case
there's nothing wrong with that okay
these are the three most common use ways
of defining variables with PHP what
happens if I come here and I try to echo
one of these guys out and I say I want
to echo first name first name what do
you think this is gonna happen let me
come here actually let's go back make
this bigger so that what you guys can
see what's going on
I have on the farm right because we
we're not really we don't have a
variable with anything it doesn't have a
value right so why don't we give it a
value I'm gonna use single quotes in
this case as you can see it works okay
so what happens if I use this variable
down here again and I put another value
let's put my last name enter well right
now I have a syntax error meaning that
something is wrong with the st. adds
something is wrong with the way I'm
writing it right well I'm missing a
semicolon at the end here just call the
statement when you write your your code
and you finish it's a statement so I'm
gonna put a semicolon and I'm gonna do
ctrl s or command s to save it and now
it works but now look at the value that
I got I got a DS now even though I have
Edwin as the first value when I declared
the variable the next time with the same
name when I declare another variable
with the same name but I give a
different value you overrides the first
one remember programming starts from the
top okay so the process or the PHP
processor in the server starts reading
line by line from the top down okay
until it reaches the last line okay and
I'm overriding that first variable now
if I have another variable down here
with I just make a little I put the
upper case there and I give it let's
just give D as two to to enter nothing
happens here right because this is a
totally different variable this remember
variables a case sensitive so if you put
any words very different than the next
one in lowercase or uppercase the
variable is totally going to be a
different variable
okay there are very case sensitive now
this is just a little bit of overview
with variables okay we also have a race
okay in a race are another type of
variables so I'm just I can name my
variables whatever I want I'm gonna say
some variable like this but now a race
can hold more values instead of using a
string or a number or something like
that we use brackets oh we use this
array like this you might see this in
old PHP versions okay and then you write
your values there but I'm gonna be using
a new way of actually declaring or
defining a race so we got variables like
this and then we got a race which are
the same things as variables but with a
race we have different different syntax
different ways of writing things I'm
going to say Edwyn here and we're gonna
put a coma single quotes again and I'm
gonna do des you can put double quotes
if you want I'm just using single quotes
because it's just a lot easier so I want
you to look at this the Saints at here
the way we are writing it we got square
brackets this is how we define a
variable this is a million array this is
an empty array here we don't need to do
anything else that it's just empty right
now we put in values in there so we put
a string okay if it's a string we put a
single quotes div separated by a coma
and then single quotes again for the
second value and so on and so on if we
had numbers we don't need the strings we
can just put the numbers there we all.we
we don't need this single quotes I mean
so with a race you can have different
values separated by comas okay like this
just gonna put this a little bigger here
so that way you can see it okay
so now you might be thinking so how can
we display the value use the values in
here well if I do echo right well look
what happened now when I do when I save
my file I ready to string conversion is
a notice telling me I cannot do that
okay
and it's actually echoing out the array
and this is the line right here I go
line 15 array but it doesn't display the
value that's because we need to tell it
to
we need the square brackets each of this
value have an index and number okay this
is 0 index
this is index number one index number
two arrays star in zero index the first
value is always gonna be 0 okay safe and
now you can see that I'm displaying the
first value of that array there if I
want the second value I know it's kind
of confusing right I would have to do
number one enter and you can see the
second value right here super confusing
but that's the way it's done
okay now you can save different data in
your race
okay don't get me wrong this is not the
only thing you can save there we can
actually come here and put this variable
inside there now if I do the 0 here and
I press save I get the same value
because this thing is overriding it so
let me just take this out of here and
I'm just gonna put Martinez here press
save and now you can see a different
value so we can not only put numbers but
we can put other variables inside race
okay so now with this way of doing a
race it's this is a simple the simplest
way of doing a race there is also
another way of doing array
which is call associative arrays okay
and those are a little bit more
complicated okay this have keys that you
can use okay so here basically keys work
like labels and we can name this keys
whatever we want
for example I'm gonna name this key
let's say I don't know Edwyn my name and
then we have this equal than symbol here
and then the greater than symbol all
together and then the next value let's
say the H my H or something like that
okay we can start to see how this is
becoming more complex now we have
another person here called Jose for
example then we go ahead and give us a
an H okay now if we want to displays
these values this works a little
different let's actually take the s out
of here let's come back here what
happens if we do zero what do you think
is gonna happen says on defying offset
what if we use the label what is what if
we use the name here oh look at that we
get the value so associative arrays can
be actually called by their label now
the difference between these two is that
this one doesn't have labels doesn't
have keys in this ones and this does
this is when you have more complex data
that you need more things to be named or
define okay now this by default does
have an index okay it does have an index
of numbers 0 1 2 3 whatever but this you
can actually name your labels you can
name your index you can go ahead and do
something like that okay and then do
this
okay and you can see that we actually
are doing the same thing we were doing
up here right we define we got a label
an index of zero but we're associative
array we make our own labels okay and if
you want to see the structure of an
array or you have to do is use a
prebuilt function we haven't got to that
yet but they are pre-built functions
that you can use in PHP okay print
underscore R and then you close
everything by parentheses you can see
the structure of that array say it's
array then we have the label the value
label and value okay and if you do this
one here in fighting have a syntax error
that would be so nice but it's not then
we go this is the structure of the first
array as you can see label is zero one
and two okay
pretty awesome stuff right guys very
easy to grasp once you start doing it
over and over again repetition is the
key to actually learning anything okay
especially programming because you need
to actually understand you know you
don't actually you know I take that back
you don't need to understand programming
a hundred percent to start programming
but to actually develop really cool
applications and things like that you do
need to understand it okay and this is
what I teach in my full course of PHP
how to build really awesome applications
okay from scratch you don't even need to
know programming to actually get into
that into that course so anyway I will
show you some some more things about PHP
what we're gonna be discussing about
functions and we are also going to be
looping through data and displaying them
so that way you can see how that works
we're also going to be doing a control
structures okay if statements thank you
so much for watching I'll see you in the
next couple seconds take care welcome
back my dear students so
I wanted to actually show you about
functions before we go ahead and go to
construct structures and and and so on
just because I already kind of showed
you a function here actually two
functions if you do not recognize this
echo is also a function but we don't
need to put the parentheses like we do
here so before we get too far ahead on
this and you get confused let me show
you what a function is okay and let me
show you why we use them so I'm gonna
create a file real quick here I'm gonna
call this functions that PHP guys any my
full course we go through a lot more
details than what I'm actually going
here for okay I want I want to get you
up and running with PHP as fast as I
possibly can okay but remember that you
still have the option to take the full
course which the link is in the bottom
of the description again so we got
functions here and let's open a PHP tag
and let's actually define a function so
what is a function a function holds a
piece of code or you know it could be a
very long code piece of code and we can
reuse it over and over again just by
using their name of that function so we
define a function like this with a
function keyword and we give it whatever
name we want I like to give the
functions and is recommended to give the
function a name of what is actually
doing like something that's describing
what it's doing for example this
function that I'm about to create is
going to display a name so I'm gonna
call it display or per case name I like
to name my functions like this and now
we put parentheses that left parenthesis
and the right parenthesis see that all
together now like this but like this
command S ctrl s to save and then this
too as well the left curly bracket in
the RAI curly bracket okay very simple
to get okay the shift key and it's very
close to your Enter key okay then you
put your cursor right in between here
and you bring it down
now you're going to see this written in
different ways like this with the
opening curly bracket and the closing
curly brackets in different lines or
this one very close to the parentheses I
like to leave them like this just
because I learned it like this okay now
these curly brackets is where you're
going to be executing code so remember
that this function is going to display
something so let's make it display
something I'm gonna echo out my name
Edwin Diaz
okay but now as you can see there's
nothing here when I do command s so ctrl
s to save the file remember that I'm
also saving the file guys when you see
this changing here I'm automatically
like typing in typing this in my
keyboard command s controls s or save
okay that's what I'm actually doing
right here you see so to execute what's
inside this function we need to use the
name of the function like this put a
parentheses and then save it and you can
see now that that code is being executed
now you might be in wondering why in the
world we use in parentheses this is just
in case we need to execute we need to
pass on parameters I'll show you that in
a minute but as you can see we are
displaying that function we can have as
many functions as we want and they can
be very long they can be very short some
functions can help other functions you
can embed different functions inside
other functions okay so for example I'm
gonna call this function process code
okay I should have left the other one
and do a copy and paste but this one is
going to be display name display name
like this okay now def this function on
top is just going to execute this
function right here so I'm gonna put
this play name right inside of the
function and instead of calling this
function I'm gonna call this function
down below you always do this below
press ENTER and you're gonna see this
the same I'm gonna change the name so
you can see that I'm not lying to you
okay here we go you see that and you can
do this as many times as you want okay
so as you can see you can divide your
code like that you can have let's create
another function to give me a
calculation let's do add number numbers
okay so this functions job is going to
just add numbers I'm going to use a new
keyword that I want you to be paying
very close attention this is very
important I'm going to return something
out of the function so now this function
I can do whatever I want with it at the
end when I'm calling it so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna pass a variable
I'm gonna put a variable here variable
adds and variable Y I can name my
variables whatever I want and I'm going
to return the X plus the Y okay this is
just a you know a shorthand for writing
you know something bigger like and now I
don't want to write longer names so
that's why I'm naming it x and y
remember that we funk with PHP you can
add you can multiply you can subtract
you can divide so divide the vision is
forward slash subtract minus asterisk or
the number a my keyboard is for
multiplication and so on okay so now
when I use this to call this function
okay I'm gonna do it down here it's
telling me that I can pass two
parameters this is what this means right
here I'm putting a variable that does
not exist anywhere okay it's just like a
placeholder for me passing parameters
here and inside the function these curly
brackets I'm using this two parameters
that I'm going to pass in and I'm adding
them so whatever parameters they are how
can we we don't know what parameters are
gonna come in this when we call in the
functions that's what we put a variable
and when we call it function here you
can pass whatever parameters you want
I'm gonna pass number five coma and the
number eight enter now or safe make sure
you save the files you see that I'm this
is actually not displaying anything like
this one was right that's because I'm
not doing echo inside a function I'm
doing return okay so this function is
returning the addition of this two
values added together so now I can come
here I could do echo okay well I'm
calling the function and it's giving me
13 because 5 plus 8 is 13 if my memory
serves me right so you can see and you
can pass any values you want guys this
PHP is very good adding stuff to see
that that's actually do multiplication
now 976 you see that but of course this
is called add number so we don't like to
do that right so this return value right
now let's just put a simple value here
five in a is 13 look what's what I'm
gonna do right now
okay I'm gonna create a different number
here number and I'm just gonna make it a
hundred just to make it okay I'm gonna
put a semicolon right here so I don't
get an error because if you notice it's
not giving me an arrow right here and
I'm saving the file it's because the
semicolon stops that statement okay so
if I don't have any in anything on the
bottom there it's you know it's really
not giving me any errors it doesn't give
me any arrows but if I have some type of
code below then that's when I get errors
because I'm not closing this semicolon
always getting the habit of doing that
so I got a different number here and
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna use the add
numbers which is 13 remember okay
I'm gonna add it and I'm gonna put that
there look look what I just did I put
the plus symbol okay and I'm adding
whatever is returning from this function
which is here whatever is returning
remember fiving a is what we adding okay
to a hundred I should get a hundred and
thirteen and all this values are going
to be stored in this number variable so
now here I can come I'm gonna put a var
tag because I want a separate line and
I'm gonna echo out that number variable
I know this might look confusing but
trust me look at that
113 so this is why we use this return
okay to return whatever calculation we
have here so that way we can use it we
can use that functions return value to
do whatever all the calculations we have
inside okay this might look very
confusing right now to you guys but I'm
pretty sure that it would get a lot
easier the more you do it okay
so keep that in mind that you can do all
these things guys and let me just take
this out okay just so this becomes a
little clearer for you okay let me recap
on what we did with function because
it's super important for you to
understand it okay if you already know
it forward this video so look what we're
doing here we are defining a function
code numbers we're putting variables
right here okay because we act we are
going to be expecting two values this
has to be in the same order by the way
so this five is the same value here this
a is here if we had another value here
we press ENTER save we get nothing here
okay but we have to have the other value
here let's say s okay now it's telling
me I listened yeah we don't have that
value where did you get that value
okay so plus symbol again s and now it's
telling me a you forgot the dollar
symbol there we go and now it's telling
me a you're missing like three four ad
numbers argument three so make sure that
these variables are all the same
okay and have another one here and there
you go okay so whatever you have here as
parameters make sure that you're also
using it down here if not you're gonna
get some type of error as we got right
here remember that okay
so this is how we use function guys is
super super cool to use them very useful
and you're gonna see them a lot in all
programming languages see you in the
next lecture guys take care how come my
dear students so in this lecture in this
particular section here we're gonna show
you about control structures and I'm
gonna show you why they're so useful and
why we use them a lot right and how to
use them how to define you how to play
around with them you're gonna have a lot
of fun where control structures now
while our control control structures
let's go and create a new file right
here I'm gonna call this control
structures if I remember how to spell
this correctly that PHP open my PHP tags
and close it let's start with the first
control structure that's very useful
let's say for example I want to find out
if I users logged in in my application
if they users logged in I want to do
something based on that condition so
control structures help us okay help our
programs make decision based on
something okay based on some value so if
something is true execute
I don't know if you write the execute
like this but there we go
okay and this is the structure of it and
then we have the else statement just in
case that condition doesn't pass and we
also have another one that we can do
before that one which is else else if
this is another another condition that
we can pass right here okay so I'm going
to show you the street you don't have to
put all of these three together there
okay so let's actually start with a
value here I'm gonna do x equals 10 okay
so I'm gonna say if it equals 10 I want
you to echo it and we are echoing X
which is which the value is 10 okay
now this is called the an operator okay
this is a equal operator this is a an
assignment operator because we are
assigning a value and it's just one
symbol but when you put them together
when you put two of these you make this
an equality operator and you can have
three to make it more strict okay so
this is a less than symbol if I do if I
could save my file which you see me
saving it every time you see me going
like this you see that flashing I'm
saving the file with my keyboard command
S or ctrl s as Sam s for save of course
so we're saying here if s s is less than
10 echo adds it doesn't echo it doesn't
display because it's not true but if I
do else this is the next condition just
in case this one fails
we're gonna say failed here see that
then we can do the other condition I'm
just gonna pull else statement here else
is the last Amen you want else else if
there we go and we put them right behind
each other like this okay and we can
just say if it is equal then eight okay
so right here we're saying if H is less
than ten let's just put is greater than
ten okay
and let's just put eight and as you can
see we are echoing Ed's when it gets to
ten right and of course it's 10 here so
of course it's being echoed right
because is equal to 10 okay but if we
put like say seven its else because it's
not greater than ten it's not equal to
eight then we get the else statement
okay and you know of course when we have
a program we are going to be doing a lot
more cool stuff cooler stuff than this
this is just an example okay so this is
the F statement pretty cool pretty
simple but now then we have something
called loops okay and PHP has a couple
loops and every programming language out
there has different loops
okay different ways of writing loops but
they all do the same this function
pre-built function what it does is that
it keeps executing the code it keeps
repeating or looping around the code
over and over again until the condition
is met okay for example right now it's
is equal to seven I'm gonna make X equal
to zero or let's make it equal to one
okay
it's telling me
my loop is not working right arrow
unexpected yeah I know that because I'm
not putting anything in there okay so if
I do echo okay let's make sure that this
is good anyway it's gonna give me their
own - I write something in mind inside
my loop so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna say while it's okay it's smaller
or equal than ten keep executing this
code right here and look what it's doing
here when I say the file this is gonna
crash a mine he's gonna crash my my
browser look look look at that you see
that unlimited infinity he's gonna crash
a browser I'm gonna take that off so
this is very dangerous this loop right
here because we need to tell it to stop
right now we're saying hey listen while
EDS is smaller or equal than 10 keep
executing this code and right now it's
it is smaller okay and it's always gonna
stay smaller than 10 because we're not
doing anything to increase the value of
x right now X is always 1 so that's why
this code is always executing while adds
is smaller or equal this is a greater a
less than symbol with an assignment
together is less or equal than 10 so
it's always gonna be less because we
because we're now incrementing it let's
go ahead and increment adds by doing
this x + + Enter or save c'mon yes ctrl
s okay and now let's go and you can see
now that s is being outputted a couple
times there let's actually make this
more understandable let's actually
display it let me do this so that way I
have the live preview available for you
guys and
you can see the H value gets to ten and
stops okay so I want you to see what
this is doing this starting at number
one so this function here is looping
okay it's grabbing Ed's
and say okay it's at smaller or equal
than ten
well it's smaller but it's not equal to
10 so and we can make it like this more
understandable
now we don't we don't have the 10 I'm
gonna explain to you why we don't have
it well right now we're saying if H if H
is less than 10 I want you to execute
Ed's so the first time he goes around we
execute number 1 now he's gonna go again
in and try to see if this condition is
true again and he keeps saying his ex
right now but once it it displays the
number one he increments their heads so
next time around H is gonna be equal to
2 but it's still not true right here
heads still well it is still true it's
still smaller than 10 right so we're
gonna keep executing Ed's
we go to number 2 if we increment H
again we go around and now H is equal to
3 it's at smaller than 10 yes and it's
gonna keep going and going and going
around and being incremented until stops
when he reaches 10 says it's it's
smaller than 10 yes it is so stop and it
doesn't display in the number 10 it
doesn't display ads again that's why it
stops at 9 because 9 is the last edge
that I display before he got to the
wrong condition now if we put the little
Simon here which makes it less than or
equal then when he gets to be equal than
ten stops because when it goes in
increments at and it becomes 11 it says
okay he's adds less or equal than 10 no
so don't go any further but it already
displayed ads
okay because we have the little Simon
operator here make it makes it equal all
right so very very very easy to
understand this is a while loop now we
also have another loop which is a for
loop okay and this one is very similar
to that one but we go ahead and define
the variable inside here and then here
we put this condition we do everything
in the first in the parentheses and then
here we do this condition here okay we
separate each of these values with a
semicolon by the way if you're not
paying attention okay and this is a
remember that this is a prebuilt
function and that's why you have
parenthesis but it is for the this
function is for the language itself
right PHP has it inside so we're gonna
echo it again okay
and right now saying Oh use of undefined
this is because we missed this there we
go
same thing is this okay we set the edge
to zero we give it a condition and we
increment well all in the same line I
prefer this approach a lot better than
the last approach okay so you might be
thinking why do we use loops well when
you want to loop through a big tons of
data and you want to display them we'll
do something we'll process that data
do you sloops you want to repeat that
code over and over again you don't want
to keep you know defining a function for
each of those steps you want something
to be repeated over and over again
that's why you use a loop then we'll
have another kind of loop it's called
the for each now the for each is going
to need an array okay this one you have
let's say for example some type of data
let's let's call it data here and in
this case is gonna be an array but it
could be some type of database and then
we have I don't know a B&amp;amp;W car here then
we have a
a Honda or something like that and then
maybe we have a to yura okay and we want
to displace those values okay remember
that we can't do this we can't do this
because we were not we're not going to
be able to display that data right if we
save our file and comment this out and
save it okay well and make sure that we
spell this correctly who is convert this
array into some type of string so it's
telling PHP is giving us some type of
notices we can't do that and it's
displaying it say it's giving us an
array but it will not explain the data
we need to do something like this right
zero right but what if we wanted to
display everything what we need to look
for that this one loops are useful so
I'm going to say I want to look through
the data array as I'm gonna give it this
key well here helps us give us some type
of name alias that we can call that
value once it pulls it out I'm gonna
give it a cart value or a variable name
car you can give this variable whatever
name you want this is a dynamic variable
it's gonna be equal to each of these
values you see this loop right here is
going to go inside this index and get
the value out and assign it to this
variable right here so we're looping
this data array as car which becomes a
value of each index and now we can come
here and can say display the car and now
we can see all the cars right here okay
now you can make this a little better
and you can concatenate some type of
HTML element here to have a line see
that so every time the loop goes around
we put out a new line break it break a
break example okay see how that works
so imagine this was some type of
database and you looping through all
that information maybe there were names
of users in your application and you
wanted to display their you know the
names in some type of chat application
that you have in your in your some type
of chat room that you have in your
application you will be able to do that
with a for each they're very useful
anyway I think we're done with this if
