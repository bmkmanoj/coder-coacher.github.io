creator of one of the most popular
Android n Java developer courses on
udemy so in this video I'm going to give
you a free preview of a lesson from my
android angel developer course on
udemy.com in this lesson I'll show you
how to set up Android studio and build
your very first Android application
alright so let's get to it
in this video we'll talk about our tool
here our IDE integrated development tool
of course there's a lot of things here
that we would have to learn but and it
will take a long time ok but the idea
here is just to get you started at least
uuuuu should have some a better
understanding of what are we doing and
what this tool does and main components
or the main functions that we will be
using the most you know so once you have
open the project this is what you should
be seen ok so you will see this toolbar
at the top with a lot of buttons but
don't worry of course this one here if
you hover over it will say save all okay
so that's save all button and most of
these are very self-explanatory
yeah but one or tools that we will be
using all the time will be the play or
run app tool if we connect it to the
emulator then it will run our app on the
emulator ok just like this here you can
see that's what's gonna happen and the
next one which is a newer item is this
if you hover over says apply changes
what this does is very simple if we are
coding and we run our application and
then we decided that we need to change
something real quick instead of going
back and rebuild everything again in
this case instead of going back and run
we can just click on this one and then
it will update your code right away
instead of you having to run everything
from the from the ground up again okay
so it's very important to okay and then
we have this one here which is for
debugging
so what once we start building
application we'll need a way to look for
errors and make sure our app runs
accordingly okay
and that's when we use this debugging
tool and we'll talk more about it of
course we have either our stop for this
will stop our app from running now going
down here will see them to the left if
you click on this it will hide our
project files right click that to hide
and this to open again so once we have
our project panel here opened and we can
resize it as well you can see here ok
and the other way you can if you want to
hide it you can just click on this
little hide icon here just click on that
that would hide so same difference same
thing we essentially could just click
here or if you want you can just go
ahead and click on this button here to
hide our panel here okay structure and
so inside here the first thing we'll see
it's gonna be this app folder and the
great old scripts we don't need to worry
about Gradle for now okay what we need
to concentrate on the app folder so you
click on that this will open so the
first thing we'll see is the manifests
ok this folder here has our Android
manifest file which we'll talk about at
a later time what an Android manifest
file is is an annex folder you will see
so it's Java you click on that to open
up and you'll see there's got three sub
folders inside ok we're very interested
in our first one here which is where our
Java main activity code is which is what
we have opened right now here ok and as
our applications evolve and grow this is
where we will put all of our activities
or our Java code next one that's where
we will put our test code how to test
applications and we'll talk more about
that and so is our next one the third
one as well ok but the most important
one for now is this one here ok the
first folder under our Java and you
notice also
all of them have this package name here
that we created earlier and then next a
Java will have the rest folder the res
folder it's where we will pull put all
of our images our layouts and many many
other things that are resources their
applications need okay because every
application needs some sort of resources
resources such as images or audio or
videos or whatever we are using to show
in our application this is where we put
so drawables it's same as saying images
okay or themes and many other things
that we'll be talking about okay but the
one of the most important one also is
the layout now the layout it's where we
have our layout our user interface guess
if you look back out at our first
application that I showed you here this
is what a layout is it's a screen right
this is what are you seeing so all of
this is actually being rendered from our
layout activity underscore main that XML
it will talk more about what this all
means but for now at least I want you to
understand that this is where our
layouts live okay so layouts everything
that we are able to show you know screen
that would be a layout alright and of
course we have this MIT map this is
where we'll put our Launcher icons you
can many other things we'll talk more
about later okay so for instance what
enough what is this launcher icon a
launcher icon is essentially this okay
this little image that users will see
once they install your app and they can
click on it to show your application
okay and then we have this values folder
this values folder that's where we have
where we can put our colors we'll talk
more about it later
our colors that will be used to design
our application to make our application
more alive and strings this is where are
we gonna put our texts okay and we'll
talk more about it and styles of course
because we can actually
style our applications so that the
entire application who has the same look
so to be very consistent ok so this is
what you have here and again remember
that we will as we learn more about
Android development we will obviously
touch more on each of these items so you
have a better better understanding ok
for now I'm just showing you around and
of course you will see right here this
is where we have our main editor ok this
is where we edit our text or code per se
ok so you notice if you click on any of
these so double click that will take you
to that file and you see everything is
shown here which means you can then
start editing ok adding your code and
all of that stuff now the other thing
you will notice that we have here at the
bottom a lot of different things ok one
of the things you will see all the time
once we run our application so ok and of
course we also get some messages here if
you click on this little tab that tells
you that build was successful the time
it took to build and all of that stuff
and we will we'll see more and more ok
and here we have the Android monitor so
these monitors everything that's
happening on your emulator on your
Android device in this case ok it tells
you a lot of information we will be
using this a lot because this is this is
what it's happening internally while we
when we run our application and don't
get intimidated like I said we will go
through all this as we keep building
applications and soon enough
this will be second nature to you no
problem alright so this should have been
a better a very quick introduction to
this IDE our Android studio here and
it's always changing because Google is
very adamant when it comes to making
updates and making this tool better and
better years ago this tool wasn't as
cool as it is today which is a blessing
which is a wonderful thing okay so next
video will continue looking around this
tool so that we have a better
understanding
of our tool that we're gonna be using
for all of our development here all
right so see in a bit thanks for
