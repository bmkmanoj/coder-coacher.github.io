Python do or why should I learn Python
you should learn Python because Python
is a general-purpose programming
language that means it can do anything
you want you can build games with it you
can build websites with it
you can build artificial intelligence
models with it you can build mobile apps
you can build any number of things
one of Athens key use cases something
that I always encourage my students to
learn a pound for a couple of reasons
but one of them is because Python does
it well is web development Python is
really great and building when
applications now there's a lot of a lot
of stuff going into building web
applications with Python you have to use
a few other programming languages as
well but pythons pretty good at that
something else pythons pretty good at is
building artificial intelligence models
machine learning things like that
there's a lot of tools around doing
machine learning with Python such as
tensorflow being one of the most popular
ones so python is really great and doing
that
by them however I found to not be so
great at building graphical interfaces
mobile apps desktop apps not so good
it can be done it's a general-purpose
language after all but I've not found
the support the tools to be quite there
yet that's why I think if you want to
build mobile apps and desktop apps using
Python I recommend you go and do web
apps instead after all both phones and
desktop computers can run web apps so
that's a good thing that you can do
instead
something else Python can do is games
although saying this I personally don't
have experience building games with
Python I believe that Python on its zone
would not be powerful enough to build
good good games with it essentially you
can build some simple games with Python
alone but if you want to build some more
advanced games which use Python also
you're gonna need a few more tools
you've got OpenGL which is a more
lower-level graphics library that you
can use to do like 3d and visualizations
and things like that you can use OpenGL
from within Python but you also have to
learn OpenGL as well and overall there's
quite good support for Python in games
development generally but of course
depending on other tools as well so
hopefully this was a bit of an overview
of what sort of things you can do with
Python from web development to machine
learning games you can also do things
like scraping you can do things like
browser automation you can do things
like testing you can do a lot of stuff
with it
and of course if you're not building a
massively complex and really an
application that really needs a lot of
performance Python can be the right
choice in almost any scenario just
remember that our programming languages
are slightly better for some things and
the other programming language is a
slightly but I thought other things so
make sure to research that and I guess
that what you hear and here's why I
think you can use Python for nearly
everything but possibly try to avoid it
when you need a lot of performance
because pythons do not the fastest
language around so hopefully this was
helpful and again I'm gonna steer you to
web development I've got a udemy course
down below I don't know how much of my
hand you can see by the way and so
hopefully my hand movements that I've
been doing here I haven't haven't gone
unnoticed and but I go back on track if
there's a link in the description below
you can click on that go to udemy and
look at my web development course built
using flask and Python and that's going
to guide you through doing basically
anything you'd want using flask on
Python you've got 30 days to get your
money back if you don't like it and it's
pretty cheap right now so you can go on
how about we look and see if you like
that's it from me for this video hope
that was helpful I'll see you on the
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
