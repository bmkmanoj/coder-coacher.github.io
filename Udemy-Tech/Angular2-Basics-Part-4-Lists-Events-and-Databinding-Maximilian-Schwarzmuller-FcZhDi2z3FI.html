look like the one we saw at the
beginning well let's work on this and
replace our static code here a bit I
actually want to render lists of items I
got on the market so in my market
component here I'll add a new property
to disclose which I'll simply name
collectibles for example and there
should be an array of items we can
collect now how might satchel item look
like let's say a item is a JavaScript
object which has a description saying
whatever is something and then a type
like book this is how a collectible
should look like in this application at
least of course you may configure this
in a different way I created some
collectibles in advance and I'm just
pacing them in here so that we have some
data to work with so these are my
collectibles here now I want to output
these collectibles here in my HTML
template of this component so somehow I
need to loop through them and then
render the same code over and over again
for each collectable I'm talking about
this list item here this code should be
copied for each item in my array here
turns out Anglet who makes this really
easy I can add a so-called structural
directive Judah's list item directives
are just little commands so to say we
can place directly in the HTML code
which Anglet you will identify at
runtime and then do something based on
the command now we can write our own
ones but I go to all the ships with a
couple of built-in ones the directive we
add here is ng 4 and ng 4 is just a name
of it to star signals that this is a
structural directive it belongs to this
directive here and between the quotation
marks we write our loop logic now the
logic here follows the syntax of a for
off loop in es6 or typescript code so
the latest version of JavaScript here
the some text there is let to create a
local variable then
any name you choose item for example off
and then the name of the array you want
to live through collectibles this will
loop through all the collectables and
assign each collectable to dislocation
in the current iteration it will then
recreate this list item here as often as
needed to cover all the collectibles now
if I save this and we have a look at
this application once this reloads you
will see that it does rerender this four
times which makes sense since we got
four items in the collection here but of
course the content hasn't changed so
order to output dynamic content we can
use string interpolation one form of
data binding support supported by
angular 2 here we do this fire using
double curly braces opening and closing
and in-between we can output JavaScript
code though only one-liners and no block
statements like functions or if whereas
something like that though you could use
ternary statements here but for now what
I want to output in the batch here is
the type of my item so item dot type so
you see I can access my item variable
here directly between this between these
curly braces like if I were in normal
JavaScript code I also want to output
the title here so let me add or the
description to be precise so let me add
item description here and with that if I
save this you will see that once this
reloads now we're outputting the actual
content of the list this is how easy
this is with angular 2 very easy to leap
through it very easy to output dynamic
data all we did here is use the energy
for directive and the string
interpolation Anglet who offers us to
output the content directly in the HTML
content here with that we're of course
outputting our list here but we're not
really able to add at your collection
that doesn't work
for that we need to hook up these
buttons here we can do this by adding an
hour form of data binding
we already saw string interpolation
which we double curly braces this is
useful if you want to output something
in our HTML code
we also would have data by the property
binding for a similar approach but here
I'm going to cover event binding which
is for the opposite to get something out
of the HTML code of the Dom to listen to
events I want to listen to events
happening on this button here and adding
a event binding is very easy you specify
the name of the event here click and
then you put it into parentheses like
this this is also a syntax known by
angular 2 and it means whenever a click
happens do whatever I now write between
the double quotation marks here now here
I want to execute a method which I'll
call on add to collection and add
parentheses here Q so this method which
I haven't created yet will be executed
whenever I click this button now how do
you know which events are available well
you can basically look up the default
lists for HTML elements which have all
the events like on click on focus on
blur depending on the element of course
and then you leave away the on part and
just have the UN name like click instead
of on click and so on so this is how we
can listen to an event of course and now
we need to add this method to my
component body here so here in my
component I'll add on add to collection
the method I set up in my template here
and you may ignore the constructor and
ng own in a method for now the
constructor is the built-in constructor
every type of class has and entry on n
it is a certain life cycle hook when a
component is created engli to reach is
served several phases in this lifecycle
of component creation and this would
allow us to execute some code in one of
these phases but for now let's focus on
tree
the on add to collection method here
well to see that we actually did
something let me simply alert hello here
so that we can see that our event
listener works now once this page
reloads if I click any of the green
buttons you see the hello alert here
great so this is working of course with
that we're still not adding it to our
collection though because for this we're
going to use another piece or concept
Anglet who offers us we're going to have
a look at this in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
