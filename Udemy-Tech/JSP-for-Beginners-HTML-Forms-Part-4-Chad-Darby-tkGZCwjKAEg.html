how to build HTML forms with radio
buttons
so we'll cover the following topics
first off I'll start off with a radial
button demo then we'll look at the
actual HTML code for building radio
buttons and finally we'll pull it all
together with a full JSF e page example
so a lot of good things here let's go
ahead and get started
all right so here's the radio button
demo so we'll have a students first name
and last name but now we want to have
the student choose their favorite
programming language so here we'll give
the first name and last name and then
they can go through and select their
language Java PHP c-sharp or Ruby once
they have their favorite language
selected then they can go ahead and hit
submit and what we'll do is we'll
actually generate a confirmation page
with the language that they selected
so here I give the students favorite
programming language in this example the
user chose PHP
so let's go ahead and look at the HTML
here for radio buttons you'll set up
your input type of radio and the year of
the name favorite language and then the
value Java and then an actual label for
the user to see and you repeat this for
each one of the languages here for
c-sharp PHP and Ruby so the key here is
that the input type equals radio and
that will give you a radio button
all right so let's go ahead and pull it
together with an example so we'll have a
student radio form whether user will
enter their information and it can
choose their favorite programming
language they'll hit submit and a go
across to a JSP page that'll actually
process it and display the students
favorite programming language
okay and as you know I love to do lists
here so the first thing we have to do is
create our HTML form and then the second
thing is create the JSP confirmation
page alright so a lot of good things
here let's go ahead and start coding
okay so let's go ahead and move into
eclipse just like all the previous
videos will continue to use the same
project JSP demo
like the previous video we're gonna make
use of the student form as our starting
point and we're gonna simply copy it and
rename it so I'll just right click on
student form dot HTML
I'll select copy
and then I'll right-click on it and
select paste
and when I paste that I'm gonna give it
a new name so the new name I'll call it
a student radio form that HTML
and once I'm happy with that I'll go
ahead and click the ok' button
all right so here's our form a student
radio formed at HTML let's go ahead and
double click this let's expand the
window here for a second
and the first thing that we need to do
on line seven is just update the
response page so the response is going
to be student radio response.jsp all
right we haven't created that page yet
but that's where we'll actually send the
data when we submit the form
all right so a lot of this stuff is from
before what I'd like to do is go ahead
and enter the HTML here for the radio
buttons so I'll start off here with the
favorite programming language
and then I'll set up the input type
so the input type equals radio
and the name equals favorite language
so that's the actual form Phil name and
then the value equals Java so this is
for this given radio button and I also
just put the label out there to the
right
and now what I can do is just copy this
X number of times for all of the other
programming languages
here real quick and just updated for
c-sharp PHP and Ruby
but now here's the end result so
basically we have 4 radio buttons here
and therefore each one of the different
programming languages and the key here
again is the input type equals radio
okay so this looks good so far so now
let's go ahead and work on our JSP page
so again we're simply gonna copy our
student response dot JSP from the
previous video and we'll simply rename
it so I'll just right click ouches copy
and then I'll do a right-click and I'll
choose paste
and for the new name I'll call it
student radio response that JSP
and then I'll select okay
nice so now you should have a new page
here student radio response.jsp
let's go ahead and double click it and
open it up
I'll expand the window here for a second
and let's go ahead and enter in just a
little line break here for it
and then I'll simply say the students
favorite programming language is X
whatever the formdata they were supplied
so here I'll use the dollar sign curly
brace per am dot favorite language
and that's it so it looks pretty good
right now so this will basically read
the form feel for a per am dot favorite
language
all right so this looks pretty good so
let's go ahead and run this application
so I move over to our forum student
radio forum dot HTML I simply do a
right-click
I choose run as and then choose run on
server
okay great so here's our form we can
enter the students first name and last
name
and then our new piece here is the
actual art radio buttons here so they
can choose either one either one of the
programming languages and then we could
actually hit submit
okay great so here's our confirmation
page so here's the supers favorite
programming language and in this
scenario they chose PHP but basically
that's the result of that form filled a
per am not favorite language so we're
successful here in writing a JSP for
reading that form field data
okay great so let's go ahead and wrap up
this video in this video I showed you
how to build HTML forms with radio
buttons and then also how to write JSP
to read that form data good job
