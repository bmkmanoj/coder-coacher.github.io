about variables so what is a variable
well a variable is like a container
where you can stole various data types
in Python for instance this program now
this doesn't have any variable in it for
now
the so let me try and execute it and
you'll see that this prints out of the
hello string string is a data type but
we'll cover that later now what is a
variable
well the variables will keep your code
more organized let me create a variable
here greeting so you can call your
variables whatever you like you can give
them any name however there are some
naming rules which I'll mention in just
a bit so let me create this variable for
now I'll stroll in this variable I said
variables are what containers so also
this text in the variable greeting and
then what I do is instead of doing print
hello I'll do print greeting and save
the script control s and then go through
the common line the upper arrow key
enter to execute and you get the same
output so this is how you create a
variable you don't use any quotes
because when you use quotes you are
creating a string datatype not a
variable and you can also use a dash
before the variable that would also be
fine so you got the output correctly but
you cannot use numbers before the
variable so ctrl s to save execute and
you get an invalid syntax so this syntax
is not valid in Python but you can use
numbers after or between the variable
name let's say here greeting to
so that would be fine to use so that's
the condition about naming your
variables you can sort them with a
letter or a or an underscore now if
you're not experienced with programming
you may still be confused on why do we
use these variables well this is a very
simple program actually very useless but
normally your programs will interact
with the users that is what we call a
real program you create a program to
give it to people so they can interact
with the program they can generate all
different outputs and so on so let's go
ahead and make this program more dynamic
so what I'll do here is I'll get the
text from the user interactively to do
that you need to use the input function
this is also a Python function it's not
a function you can enter a message to
the user so let's say write a greeting
a column and make some space there then
you print greeting to save the script
executes and now the program is asking
us to enter some inputs so let's go
ahead and say hi this time and we get
the odd foot print adult in here hi so
what happened here is we created a
variable and that variable will store
the value that the user submits in the
common law and here in the terminal so
the user submitted the hi text this text
will be stored in this variable so as I
said variables are like containers and
then you can use this text in various
ways but in this scenario I'm just
passing it to the print function so I
want to print it out on the terminal
here our print function will get the
value that is stored in the greeting to
variable and print it out on
terminal that's it Enya I'd like to
close this lecture now and I'll see you
in the next lecture
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
