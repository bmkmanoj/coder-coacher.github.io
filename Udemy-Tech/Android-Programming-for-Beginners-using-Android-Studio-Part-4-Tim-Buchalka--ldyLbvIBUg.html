over here wrap content to any size and
also fixed so I'm going to go through
and just discuss those in more detail
shortly but at the moment looking at the
image on the screen we're working with
an image that's actually bigger than the
device screen so the image itself is 640
by 480 and our screen isn't that wide so
it's going to be easy to see a lot of
this and how the wrap content and the
other types actually make change to
images if we use a smaller image so what
I'm going to do is change the image
views source property which is
abbreviated to SRC now because we're
using the app compat library to make our
app compatible with older devices the
property is actually called source
compare and you can see it over here in
the properties section and it's one of
the most commonly used properties that
appears on the right-hand pane and
that's why Google has put it on there so
we don't have to click up here to these
arrows to get into access to them as we
do certain other extended properties
that perhaps perhaps aren't used in
Google's eyes as much as these common
properties here and incidentally this
pane is dynamic so if you uncheck the
compatibility option when we created the
project this will be labeled SRC rather
than SRC compat as I'm talking about
this field up here this property now
unless you've got a good reason for
doing so and one example might be if
you're producing a corporate app
targeting a specific version of Android
that perhaps your company has settled on
so unless you're doing that you should
probably use the app compat library and
you should be seeing source compare in
the properties pane as I've got on the
screen here now so let's go ahead now
and use the smaller ball image and we
can do that in a couple of ways as you
can see we've got the name here and I
can just click into that field then I
can move my cursor to the end of it just
with my arrows and you can see it says
ball underscore 640 by 480 so we could
just change the text there I could just
overwrite that with the new
name that a better way of doing it is
just to come over here and click on the
three dots to the right of the property
field if you saw the tall tower a
toolbar tip pop up and we get the box
here where we can select the image that
we want to use at this point going
forward so I can just come over here now
click on ball the other ball the ball
underscore 100 by 100 click on OK and
you can see the ball has now updated the
image is updated in our design and
blueprint areas and we're good to go
so I'm just gonna come over here making
sure that this is selected and change
this also to 160 DP instead of wrap
content as it currently was from what we
were doing in the last video and I might
just click these off as well and take
those back to that mode as well so we're
basically back in fixed mode now for
this particular image so looking at it
we've got 160 by 160 image view
containing a hundred by a hundred image
of a ball and you can see that when I
move my mouse over the image view we've
got a lot of white area around the ball
and that's because the image doesn't
fully fill the image area at this point
in time because of the sizes and what
I've done is I've given the ball a green
background so that you can easily tell
when the image is smaller than its
container which I've just done on the
screen there now and I also chose a ball
not because I'm mad about soccer I know
it's called football in other parts of
the world but in Australia it's called
soccer so it's not that I'm a man about
soccer but it's because it's easy to see
where the image gets skewed when it's
resized which we're about to do and the
reason that the image will get skewed is
is a visual representation that the
aspect ratio isn't being maintained so
to get a bit better understanding of
what I'm talking about we're going to
set the scale type and where it's
currently set to centre inside I'm going
to change that to fix ex-wife and you
can see just right away that we've got
to change and now the image actually
occupies the full 160 by 160 yeah area
of the image view and at the moment over
here again we're using a fixed width and
height so the values for layout width
lay out height are being used and
obviously 160 by 160 so I come over here
and change the layout width to any size
by clicking on either of the horizontal
inner lines like so and you can see what
happened immediately with our image the
image is now been stretched and to fill
the screen left to right now if you've
designed Android layouts before this may
look the same as match parent but it's
slightly different because it considers
the constraints in determining the size
now if you're new to android layouts
match parent is a way of sizing a widget
so that it fills all the available space
in its parent it's a parent being the
layout that's been planted that it's
been placed into any size looks exactly
the same as much parent here because
it's causing the widget to expand to
fill the width of the screen allowing
for the left and right margins and you
will see slightly different behavior
once we've once we have some more
widgets on the screen so if I click on
the inner lines again now that's going
to change it to wrap on a school content
you can see the brat panel is called
content showing and layout with now and
that makes the widget now become as wide
as it needs to be to fit whatever it
contains now because we're using a
hundred by a hundred image the image
view itself is now a hundred DP wide and
we can't see that directly because
layout width is set to wrap content but
that's essentially what it means it's
just expanding it to be just wide enough
for whatever the the images within the
image view itself and because we chose
fit X Y is the scale type over here to
the right the image is scaled vertically
to fit the fixed height of the image
which is still a hundred and sixty DP
and that's why the football now becomes
a football like a rugby ball or AFL
rules of football
alternatively if you're not in a sport
Easter Egg that's how it looks more like
an Easter Egg than a regular soccer ball
so I'll come up here and you just just
do the same thing to vertical sizes and
then we'll explain a little bit more
about what these strange units out of
this but this DP means so I'm going to
click on the vertical in
lines click up here either one of the
top ones doesn't matter which one click
one of those you can see now that the
imageview stretches to fill the height
of the layout and frankly it looks a bit
frightening now rather than a rugby ball
or a chocolate egg but if we click it
again now you get the chevron showing
we've now got rap content in both fields
and we've now got a perfectly rounded
football and our image view is now using
a hundred by hundred which is exactly
the same width and height as one hundred
five hundred image now at this point
there's still a lot to look at in this
designer and if you've if you used to
the older layouts that were available
previously you're probably already
getting are getting pretty excited about
the way this constraint layout works but
before I go on to the really exciting
stuff where we constrain widgets to
other widgets though I should really
probably explain what these
device-independent pixels or DP units
are and remembering that we had it just
before I change this to wrap content we
had 160 DP showing there so our image
currently is a hundred pixels wide and
100 pixels high and the previous image
we were using was a more usual 640
pixels wide by 480 pixels wide
now 640 by 480 is a common size because
and he may not believe this that was the
resolution of early computer screens I
can still actually distinctly remember
how excited I was when I first got my
thousand of 24 by 768 monitor the aspect
ratio was one on the third so the screen
height was three-quarters of its width
the current trend is four screens to be
much wider so we now tend to have
resolutions of 1280 by 720 or HD screens
of 1920 by a thousand and 80 and in my
case on this Mac that I'm recording
these videos on the resolution is to 560
by 1440 so sort of double the 1280 by
720 obviously a lot wider and that's an
aspect ratio of about 1.8 but that's
computer screens though and mobile
phones are generally the other way
around so computers
are in landscape and mobile phones are
in portrait now different screens have
different resolutions as well and modern
screens are managing to pack in far more
pixels per inch than was previously
possible now that's the pixel density so
if you specified dimensions in pixels
your images may look okay on one
particular device but they look a bit
grim on something with a different pixel
density the number of pixels per inch
varies from one device to another and
that can result in our ball appearing at
different sizes relative to the size of
the screen now the Android layout
designer makes it easy to see how things
look on different devices so what we're
going to do in the next video is we're
going to add a button to our layout to
demonstrate this and then start showing
this revised layout on different devices
to see what the differences are so I'm
going to finish this video now and let's
move on to doing that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
