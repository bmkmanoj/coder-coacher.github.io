tutorial today I'm gonna go ahead and
talk a little bit about MAC addresses
what they are why they are important to
us and how can we change them this is
all in order to increase our level of
anonymity so to put it you might amongst
other things you might notice that this
is a bit of a different interface and
this is an update updated version of
this section as there were a lot of
people who have requested it so I
figured I would update this part with
the Mac changer and simplify it a little
bit also include some additional
explanations before we before we
actually begin let me just go ahead and
tell you my setup I have a virtual
machine running just as before it is
setup this is a yep there you go you can
see this is a virtual machine my host
operating system is completely
irrelevant in this case it is Fedora 22
but completely irrelevant just noted
this is a virtual machine of kali linux
operating within VirtualBox and it does
not matter if you're using a host if
your host is Windows or Mac completely
irrelevant oops
so just go ahead and open up a terminal
that is the very first thing that we
will need to do and let's go ahead and
take a look at our MAC address here so I
have config press enter and you will see
that it says hardware or Hardware
hardware address or burnt in address
there are multiple names by which it is
referred so no big deal there you can
see that this is it the first the first
portion of it the first three sets they
represented the manufacturer so the MAC
addresses are something are your
hardware addresses so this is not the
hardware address of my machine this is
the hardware address of my
network card apply integrated network
card it can be either your Ethernet card
or your wireless card or wireless
adapter whatever these things have MAC
addresses and by them you can you can be
identified on the network as I said the
first three the first three sets
identify the manufacturer of the of the
particular hardware in question so by
just looking at the first three sets you
can search it on the net and see who the
manufacturer is just type it into Google
manufacturer manufacturer with MAC
address and you will get a list or
something like that doesn't really
matter you will get like a hundred
thousand results and you will be able to
figure out who the manufacturer of that
particular card is now the last three
the last three sets they are left to the
to the will of the manufacturer they can
do with them pretty much whatever they
want and you cannot really utilize them
yourselves for any further
identification in that sense they won't
be able to see which device in
particular is being used
however this MAC address is visible on
my local area on my local network and
somebody can use it to restrict access
to completely ban me from the network or
to identify me any way to identify me by
name that would be that would be very
difficult but they will be able to you
somebody who would be doing the
investigating or the admin would be able
to see this hardware address and then if
somebody takes a look at your laptop
they will be able to see the same
address which is a problem because then
there is a direct link now they can be
changed they can be altered to your
heart's content which is a very good
news indeed
but please keep in mind just understand
that this address
does not leave your local network it
does not go further if I was somewhere
on the net out there on the internet I
would not be able to see this MAC
address nor would you be able to see
mine this is only for local network in
fact it does not leave the first jump in
your house this network does not leave
the default gateway at this ad this
address does not leave your default
gateway which is your ISP router so your
connection goes to your ISP router your
ISP router has this MAC address but it
does not go any further than that it
stays there so there is no way for me to
actually see it directly unless I did
some shenanigans and went into the
router itself grabbed it from the router
itself anyway keep in mind that changing
a MAC address in a virtual machine is
rather pointless I would say but it is
very useful if you have a USB
installation or a USB bootable USB or if
you have installed this on your physical
machine and it is very useful in the
real world to know how to do this but
since we have a virtual machine for
learning purposes we are going to use it
as our test subject and in the real
world after you have mastered this of
course you won't be using a virtual
machine you'll be using a real machine
not to say that all machines are useless
by any I'm not saying that the virtual
machine is useless just saying that we
are using this one for learning purposes
and then at some later point of time and
all of this is mastered you will be able
to switch to a bootable USB if you
haven't already or to a physical machine
but the way to change an address is to
you can do this manually but you can
also use a Mac changer so with a Mac
changer you can change the it's a tool
to change the MAC address so let's go
ahead and take a look at this tool type
in Mac changer
space - help - age for help so the first
option just prints this help menu the
second one's gonna give you the version
and this is gonna tell give you the MAC
addresses in fact let's go ahead and use
this option so dude yes okay fine sure
have I missed type something H zero okay
so I didn't pass the interface along
sorry so type in I F config and you take
a look at the interface or you know the
interface in advance you can of course
see the address here as well but if you
just want the Mac changer to show it you
would just use Mac changer and type in
the name of the interface here and you
don't need this whole thing you just
need a - yes and there we go it says the
that the current Mac is this one and the
permanent Mac is this one the MAC
address so you might wonder well why why
would I want to look at it here if I can
just type in ifconfig and look at it and
take a look at it here well you want to
when you change it you want to be able
to see what is your current MAC address
and you what is your permanent MAC
address so when the MAC address is
changed here in the in the output of the
ifconfig you only see the changed one
you won't be able to see the original
one if you want to see if the original
one you can have a look at it here
that's the permanent Mac so no worries
there let's go ahead and clear this Mac
changer - H there we go
and this is e ending don't change the
vendor bytes okay fine whatever we don't
fly you're rarely going to use I mean
we're gonna go ahead and skip that
really there's no point another set
friend of a vendor Mac of the same kind
okay so this is actually not a bad idea
sometimes in some cases so it says set
random vendor Mac of the same kind so
for example if on the network only a
certain type of devices are allowed from
a certain vendor you can and if you're
you can actually go ahead and change it
change the Mac off your card and have it
stay within these parameters of the same
vendor even though it will be a
completely different MAC address this is
for example if you're in an office
building or something like that and they
only allow certain hardware to go and
function there from a certain vendor you
can go to that particular machine it is
possible to go if you have permission of
course
to that particular machine and actually
change the Mac Mac address to and have
it stay within the within the confines
of the same vendor so it will be
completely different Mac and it will
help in terms of anonymity and you will
still have connectivity on the network
but these are rather rare cases and
again you won't actually need to use
this one this is - a set random vendor
Mac of any kind pretty much that is
pretty much self-explanatory and this is
this is an option which you will use as
well this is - be quite important
actually it will reset the original
permanent Hardware Mac so it will bring
about your original MAC address if
you've changed it or if you've changed
it several times it will restore the
original one undemanding are is just
to set fully random MAC addresses this
is something that you're going to use so
- be and - are our good options so this
is a fully random Mac and if you're
wondering what the - a is this will give
you a random MAC address but it will it
the this MAC address will be in the pool
that has been assigned to vendors so it
will identify you as some you will be
identify your network card will be
identified as belonging to at least some
vendor as opposed to this this is just a
a random set completely random set it
doesn't necessarily need to belong to
any vendor or anything like that what do
I mean by that well - a for example if
you did this like real tech a company
that produces networking network
hardware they have a fixed amount of MAC
addresses that have been given to them
that they can use to identify their
devices and if you say - a for example
you might get the first three sets from
the realtek and then the last three sets
will be completely random again so you
will still be identified your card will
be identified as being from real tech as
opposed to being and as opposed to
belonging to some other company and down
below this will just our all all six
sets will be completely random so - a
will be will ensure that the first three
sets belong to a vendor and then the
last three sets are completely random
with - are all the sets are random - L
okay so this will print known vendors I
can type in Mac changer - L and there
you go so these are all the known
vendors there's quite a bit of them and
these are vendor bits so the first three
sets
you if you generate a random if you use
the - I you will fall within one of
these you will be identified as having a
network card that belongs to some of
these vendors which is not a bad idea at
all you could actually use these bits to
fake your fake that are hardware
fake the MAC address of your hardware as
belonging to some of these vendors if
you wanted to pretend to be a Belkin ah
you could use these first these bits to
actually pretend to be Belkin if you
want to be Netgear you could use these
and so on and so forth I'm sure you get
the idea here there Mac - H and K so
pretend to be burnt in a dress you can
use that as well
but down below you have - M and - M
actually sets the MAC address which is a
very very very nice option it can be
extremely powerful him it can have
tremendous effect why well here's
something that I will share from my from
well it is my experience because I have
seen it happen and I this keeps
happening on end and there was there
very there are tools to combat it but
yeah it's the yeah it's just the price
and the amount of effort that you have
to put into fighting it it's difficult
here's what I mean let's say you are on
a school network so in some facility and
some building in a school and during
lectures during some of my lectures I've
seen people I've seen this done let's
put it like that basically we had these
wireless projectors and people would and
in the beginning people would just jam
the wireless and they notice and when
they jammed the wireless
the problem was that the professor's
computer could no longer connect the
wireless projector so the lecture was
hindered it was very difficult to
perform because the connection would
break every every minute or so and yeah
the professor didn't figure it out it
just figured oh must be some sort of a
technical problem or something like that
then he went to the administrators and
administrators have taken a look at it
and they realized that they were being
jammed so what they did was implement
Mac filtering and this caused further
problems
why because anyone caught jamming that
MAC address would be permanently banned
however somebody came up with an idea I
mean it's a fairly simple idea it's a
very old idea they didn't come up with
it they just used it to actually scan
the network figure out the hardware
address the MAC address of the
professor's computer just take a look at
it and then set that address as their
own address so they've taken a look at
his at his MAC address they've taken it
and then they've used the M option with
the Mac changer to set the interface MAC
address of their own computers to be
exactly the same as the professor's and
then they began doing shenanigans
pretending to be the professor's PC
while the administrators would do then
is permanently ban that MAC address
which would create a very significant
problem because not only could he no
longer connected a projector not only
could the professor no longer connected
a projector but the professor could no
longer connect to pretty much any
wireless network or any network at all
within the school facilities because on
every router in the school that
particular MAC address was banned so
this created an even bigger problem so
now you see how the - M function how the
- M can be extremely useful and
extremely powerful anyway I'm running a
little bit short on time here so I will
cata tutorial here and we will elaborate
further on this matter in the follow-up
tutorial welcome back all today I'm just
going to go ahead and continue with the
Mac changer now in this lecture I will
actually use it and I will show you how
to change your mac address this is
primarily meant to be applied in real
life circumstances and but since this is
since these are only training and
learning video so this is for learning
purposes and these are only training
videos we're going to do it in the
virtual machine keep in mind that even
though this is possible to do from the
Linux command line within the virtual
machine it will effectively kill your
internet connectivity on the virtual
machine in unreal machines or bootable
USB x' it won't because that is how it
is meant to be used I will show you how
you can also change a MAC address in
virtual machine in VirtualBox without
actually losing Internet connectivity
anyway I'll just type in Mac oops Mac
changer space - our space eth0
which is our interface actually before
that let's type in ifconfig eth0
and we see the MAC address here I have
already changed it but let's revert it
back now let's just go ahead and
continue let's change it again so let's
type in Mac changer space - our space
eth0 Enter so it says permanent Mac this
is our original MAC address
this is the current MAC address which I
have changed it prior to the beginning
of this tutorial and this is the new MAC
address the one when it says a new MAC
address yep there we go this is the this
is the one that shall be used so new MAC
address is the one that will be used
permanent MAC address is the original
one and the current ones are the one
that is currently being used is this one
but as soon as you have a new one then
this one will be applied let me show you
so I have con fig ATH zero and you can
see that this one that this output and
this output are completely the same but
as you can see I can type in ping
google.com and this is not going to work
if I type in Mac changer - B to restore
the permanent one oops if I type in ping
google.com you see that the internet
connection does a work so you won't have
this problem on a physical machine or
with a bootable USB there will be no
difficulties thereof whatsoever but with
a virtual machine it's a little bit
different if you wish to change it in a
virtual machine and if you're using
VirtualBox it's fairly simple but as I
already stated it makes little sense
because the address is already fairly
rent
I mean it's basically the MAC address of
the virtual machine
who cares it's not like it's a machine
that you bought for your with your own
money somewhere or something like that
it's the MAC address of the virtual
machine so who cares so just from a
logical perspective it makes little
sense but here let me show you in case
you still really want to can go ahead
and clear the screen and I can type in
so the this one is zero eight zero zero
two seven zero three five
7:5 feel free to memorize it or feel
free not to memorize it you can remember
the last set so it's seven five and
let's see how that changes so the very
first thing that we need to do is
completely power off our machine power
off the virtual machine that is just
wait for it and there we go so let's
right-click on our virtual machine go
into settings go into Network okay so
this is enough let's change it to
bridged go into advanced it doesn't need
to be in bridge you can leave it in that
if you wish so just so you know this
promiscuous mode allow all and down
below I have a MAC address and now let's
go ahead and rotate it let's change it
to something else so you see the the
it's randomizing these bits here but I
can't 0 nah oops
yeah in little settings detected you
won't be able to change the manufacturer
from here you'll just be able to
randomize at the device bits so the
manufacturer will still remain the same
but the device bits will change
completely but either way you are fairly
anonymous anyway by using a virtual
machine so no worries there just go
ahead and click on OK
you serious oh please
the second digit in the MAC address may
not be odd on the unicast addresses very
loud are you see I love it when it bugs
off like this it's something that I love
the most
okay so once again go into settings and
go into network I'm gonna go ahead and
switch to bridged go into advanced click
on this green circle to change the MAC
address click on OK and then you can
power the machine back on and the MAC
address will be changed so you can't
change the manufacturer but you can
change the you can change the bits that
identified the machine however as I said
it's just a virtual machine so no need
to pretty much worry at all
you can delete this any time you wish
and you can create a new one at any time
you wish but on a an a real system and
on a bootable USB this would make a lot
of difference so every time you're gonna
use this in the real world this would
make a lot of difference but on a
virtual machine which were using now for
learning purposes it is just here I'm
just demonstrating it so you know how to
do it
okay so booting in booting and booting
and booting very slowly I've always
loved the speed of virtual machines just
close this and close this and open up
our terminal there is another thing that
can be implemented and Linux allows for
scheduling of tasks so you can schedule
a task to run at boot time so you can
have your MAC address changed every time
you boot your machine so if we type in
cron tab space - II in kolonics 2.0 it's
gonna ask you which which editor would
you like to use so I'm always like to
use VI em but I've noticed that people
have had problems with it on udemy
because it can be quite a bit
complicated but it is very powerful
however for this purpose I'm gonna use a
nano as it is a lot simpler and easier
to use and but far less powerful and
although for this purpose we just need
basic editor to change a few things so
there's no need to use a very powerful
tool in the first place
so let's go ahead and let's pick an
option number one and let's go down so
at the bottom you have MH d om mo and
DOW
and then the command so what are these
options so this is these M stands for
minutes H stands for hours do M is day
of the month mo n is just month and DOW
is day of the week and then the command
that you wish to run so on a physical or
a USB device you can run something like
this so at
reboot so you disregard these options
completely and you just state at reboot
and then you could type in something
like Mack changer - our eth0 you could
also bring the interface down and change
the Mac add MAC address if that doesn't
work so for example so you have at
reboot Mac ginger - our eth0
this should work if it does not you can
do the following
so we're somewhere on the file system
let's go into documents and we can type
in m'kay dear I don't know how shall we
name this file whatever dot Sh
then we're gonna type in Nano whatever
dog Sh
ah wait wait wait wait wait m'kay dear
creates a directory my sincere apologies
to that for that I'm just gonna go ahead
and type in nano what ever dot Sh and
that I'm gonna create a small script for
myself here bin bash and then you can
type in a set of commands basically the
exactly the same thematic you would use
in the terminal so I have config eth0
down
I have config up sorry notice also that
this is primarily used for wireless
interfaces and I am using a wired
interface for eight for this test so
also you won't generally change a MAC
address on a wired interface you will
generally change it on a wireless
interface but the procedure is exact
the same the only thing that differs is
the name of the interface so you don't
need to copy this part or anything like
that I'm just doing this I'm just
creating this script for demonstration
purposes of what you can do so you can
create entire sets of commands but you
want to be executed at boot time to
configure your system to to tune your
system the way you want it to be tuned
at boot time so you wouldn't have to do
it every time manually so you could
automate the tasks that feel Mac changer
- are th 0 and then I have con fig eth0
up and you can also to ensure that it
all runs smoothly you can type in is it
hold on a keyboard is getting stuck a
little bit sleep I don't know - and then
we can do this as well
leap to sleep just puts it just puts the
execution of so it executes seif config
then it sleeps for 2 seconds then I take
accuse the Mac changer then sleeps for 2
seconds and then it brings the interface
back up this is just to ensure that
everything runs smoothly so ctrl o to
save enter ctrl X to exit now we do LS
we see the script is there and now we we
need to give we need to make it
executable so type in CH mod space + X
whatever dot sh and if we do LS again
you will see that it's as a different
color and you can see that it is indeed
an executive pool file this X symbolizes
that it is executable so the first three
are for the user the second three
permissions are for the group and the
third three permissions are for
everybody so the user can read write and
execute the owner of the file
that is the owner of the file is a route
the group to which the route belongs is
called route as well so the route group
can read and can execute but it cannot
write or yeah but if your route can do
pretty much anything so if there is
another if there's another if there's
another user let's say user called test
that is a member of the route group he
would be able to read and execute the
file so read and execute but it wouldn't
be able to write anything to it and the
world also can read and execute so
everybody else who belongs to any other
group anyway and not--it I perhaps lost
you a little bit there but no worries
this will clear out as the tutorial
progresses and let's go ahead and type
in from tab - e notice how I didn't get
prompted for a editor this time scroll
down to the bottom type in asked re-ups
control X to exit one more time no I do
not wish to save anything p WD to see
the work currently working directory so
it's root and then documents feel free
to copy this so ctrl shift C and then
let's go ahead and type in crontab -
oops cron tab - e once again scroll down
to the bottom F in ass reboot space
control shift V slash what ever dot sh
so I haven't really tested this out in
this machine but it should work without
bigger difficulties and you can press
ctrl o to save enter to right and ctrl X
to exit if I type in I have config I can
see that the that the last set of the
address is
7:43 let's test the script out to see if
it actually works
sleep is not functional okay no big deal
but you can see that it works even
without sleep quite well so the current
pack and the permanent pack and the new
back you can see that it has indeed
changed it
let me just reconfigure this a little
bit I shouldn't use a capital S just
lowercase s if I'm not mistaken if it
doesn't oh well no big deal and there
you go
you have noticed that the execution of
this trip was a bit slower because you
had sleep intervals off two seconds but
indeed again it changes and it will
change it every time it reboots we can
make sure of this by just typing in
reboot I'm running a bit short on time
here but oh well
we shall wrap the tutorial up fairly
fairly soon you can put in anything you
want in that script so it will run every
it should run every time that the
Machine reboots which is very nice as I
said you can have a pre-configured
machine in one single script so you can
change your DNS settings you can connect
to a VPN you can do whatever it is that
you want to do and put it in one script
that will run every time that you boot
so everything will be done in like two
seconds instead of you going manually
from here to there configuring that etc
so going going booting give me the
terminal zoom and let's type in Mac
changer - s eth0
and there we go so it says that the
current Mac is this one and that the
permanent Mac is this one so it indeed
has changed it at reboot anyway I thank
you for watching this will conclude the
Mac changer section I hope that you have
enjoyed it and I bid you all farewell
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
