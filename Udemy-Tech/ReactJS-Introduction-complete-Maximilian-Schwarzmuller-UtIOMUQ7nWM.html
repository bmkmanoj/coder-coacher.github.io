here this video here is a collection of
my extremely comprehensive react course
I offer on udemy a link to the course of
course can be found in the video
description with a nice discount this
course on udemy is an extremely deep
diving react course starting at the
basics and then moving through all the
core topics like reactor outer redox
animations authentication and much more
in this video here I give you a very
extensive sneak peek into the course
covering the entire first and second
module of my react course I hope you
enjoy it and I hope you learned a lot
about react obviously would be great
to also welcome you in the udemy course
if you like this
welcome to discourse about react it's
great to have you on board
my name is Maximilian Schwarz Mullah and
I'm a freelance web developer and react
developer I worked with react a lot and
I can tell you it's an amazing library
for creating highly reactive and super
fast JavaScript driven web applications
the JavaScript driven part is especially
important because since react is a
JavaScript library it's of course about
writing your web apps in JavaScript and
dead and turn is amazing because since
JavaScript runs in the browser it allows
you to create super fast web apps that
feel like mobile apps users don't have
to wait for page reloads
now react is probably the most popular
JavaScript library you can learn these
days and for a good reason you will
learn all of its core features
throughout this course and way more than
that you will learn what reactor's about
how it works and why you might want to
use it you will learn how to build
components with react how to use read
acts for better state management how to
use the react router and you'll not just
learn this in simple projects or theory
no we will build an entire react
application throughout this course the
Burger builder which is an amazing
application utilizing all the concepts
you'll learn in this course so that you
have a really solid understanding of all
the concepts taught throughout this
course by the end of the course you'll
therefore have way more than just a
solid understanding of react and you'll
be able to dive deeper into more
challenging projects and apply for react
developer chops or become a react
developer as a freelancer whatever your
goal is
so let's get started with react what why
and how let's start with the what is
react question and let me cite a phrase
from the official react page react is a
JavaScript library for building user
interfaces now that's a nice sentence
but what does it mean
the first important part is the
JavaScript library part it is a
JavaScript library it is about building
JavaScript driven apps react apps run in
the browser they don't run on the server
they run in the browser and that gives
us a great advantage things happen
instantly since they happen the users
browser we don't have to wait for a
server response to get a new page or to
render something new the other important
part in that sentence is the user
interfaces part user interfaces are
basically what the user sees and react
is all about using components for
building these if you think about it you
can split up any web page into
components here's an example this is
just any random web page we can think of
we might have this header area a sidebar
and then on the right some content now
we clearly can split this up into
components we would have a header
component a sidebar component and then a
headline in the article content
component now why is thinking like this
important or useful because if we split
up our web app our website into such
components we can't build these building
blocks these components as contained
pieces of code we don't have to build
our entire web page as one bigger
picture we can build all these tiny
things on their own this of course makes
working in teams easier but even if
we're working alone it makes it easy for
us to keep our code manageable if we
change the headline later on we only
have to go into that component and
update it and we don't have to find that
code on our entire web page code we also
can easily reuse components then if we
have a list item component and we want
to output a list of these well list
items
we only have to write the code once and
can then easily reuse it because and
that's important
react components can be thought of as
custom HTML elements in the end you're
just writing custom HTML elements this
is what react is about and it therefore
solves the problem of having to build
complex user interfaces with what HTML
and JavaScript gives you by writing
maintainable manageable and reusable
pieces of that code which you then can
throw into your web app wherever you
need to use it let's have a look at some
examples
so in the last lecture I explained that
reacts all about components and that
components are awesome let's actually
see this on a real webpage here's
react.js org which is the official web
page of the react team and if we have a
look at it it is actually built with
react of course this looks like a normal
webpage and it is of course but we can
split this up into components we got
this header component and in there we
got these single navigation item
components we got this starting image
call-to-action component here and we got
all our elements down here where they
advertise react and what it is about we
see more components here like these
image code snippet components here with
some descriptions to the left of it all
these things are basically building
blocks which we can of course easily
consider as reusable pieces and actually
they are reusing this element here we
got one element here and then the same
element with different content being
used below it now of course you can hard
code all that with just HTML Javascript
and CSS but then you will have to repeat
your code over and over again here with
components you build your own HTML
element so to say and then you just
reuse that element and behind the scenes
this HTML element has all this content
already inside of it and we'll see this
in detail in a second another good
example would be udemy here on the udemy
page where I searched for UK s an
alternative to react there we see we get
a lot of components to we got that whole
header with the search bar component
then we got these search results summary
component here where it also allows us
to filter the search results and then
the search results themselves we get
reused list item components here each of
them has an image and a different title
but in the core they all are the same
they all have the same structure and
udemy all the uses are JavaScript
framework to achieve this and to have an
easier time developing and then that's
important
maintaining and updating this page so
this is why components are awesome and
why we as a developer probably want to
use components and datos y react is all
about components
now that we know what react actually is
it's time to get our hands dirty and for
that I was at code pen dot IO that is
like a web editor which allows us to
write very simple HTML CSS and
JavaScript apps or really more like a
playground we won't really use that to
build real projects in this course we
will use a local set up for that but it
is great to dive into react so on code
Penn dot IO you can click on create and
create a so-called pen that is simply a
workspace where you can write HTML CSS
and JavaScript code now in this editor
you've got three areas for HTML CSS and
JavaScript and now let's write a very
simple application a demo to see how we
write something with normal HTML
javascript and so on and how we then add
react you maybe have an easier time
creating such an application for dad in
the HTML part of this editor author than
you div and you can quickly create this
by typing div and hitting tab this will
automatically expand this and then there
I will now add a h1 tag and somebody
output max my name and below that a
paragraph raise say your age 28 this is
my age and of course feel free to use
your data here so this now leads to the
output below it updates automatically
now let's quickly give to some styling
let's simply give to stiff maybe a class
of let's say person the name is up to
you and add this person CSS class with
some normal CSS code where I simply give
this say a boarder one pixel solid int
is gray with CCC and a box shadow of 0
two pixels two pixels and let's say the
same gray let's maybe lose us use a
slightly brighter one here ie for the
border let's now also gift us a width of
let's say 200 pixels and a padding of 20
pixels and now we have this card like
look you see below there now that is
such a person card information
holding information about a person let's
say we can also set this to
display:inline-block and give it a
margin of 10 pixels because now what I
can do is I can of course replicate this
and add a second person let's say man
you who has a age of 29
that's my colleague so now we've got
these two person cards and you could
easily think of this as a normal web
application where you output some
information about users or about the
team behind your blog you're creating
something like that we're using only
HTML and CSS here now we can already see
one limitation kind of we're always
reusing the same HTML code here now that
isn't too problematic here it would be
more problematic if we would do
something with each of these snippets
with JavaScript even but even without
that we can think of this part here as a
component this person did always is
structured in the same way just the data
inside of it varies this is where react
comes in though
react shines the most as we connect this
to JavaScript logic - but still we can
already use react to create reusable
components here for that let's add react
I'm going to shrink this CSS part a tiny
bit and any JavaScript area I first of
all have to import react you can click
on that gear icon next to JavaScript and
then you can download or import some
external JavaScript libraries and react
is such an external library actually
it's so popular that on code pen you can
go to the quick add drop-down and simply
scroll to react and this will add it now
here it adds version 15 dot 6.1 might
differ at the point of time you're
viewing this in this course I will cover
version 16 so you're learning the latest
react and then the local setup we'll use
in this course we'll also use that
latest react version no worries
here however we're using an older one
but for the demo here this does not
matter at all we
two quick add reacts Dom that is another
package from the react team react itself
kind of histologic we need for creating
these react components I told you that
react is all about components react Dom
is then about rendering these components
to the real Dom with these two packages
added were almost there but react uses a
special JavaScript syntax and a lot of
next generation JavaScript features I'll
come back to this later in the course
I'll have a whole module where I
introduce you to the most important
next-gen features react users so to
unlock the usage of these features enter
special syntax in the JavaScript
preprocessor drop-down you have to
choose babel that simply is a tool which
compiles the next generation JavaScript
code you're writing here to code that
runs fine in the browser so that we
write code with all features we want but
ship code that works in the browser and
with that you can click Save and close
and now we can start writing our react
app here in the JavaScript section so
why don't we do that let's create a
react component so that we have a
reusable custom HTML element we can use
instead of repeating this HTML code here
on the left in its most basic form and
you're going to learn about a different
form in this course to its most basic
form a react component is just a
function so we can create a new function
and maybe name this person make sure it
starts with a capital P this is require
to use it correctly with react this
person component is a normal function
but it has to return the code you
actually want to render to the Dom and
here react uses a special syntax which
is called JSX I'm using parentheses here
to be able to write or to return some
multi-line code and now I'm going to
copy the code here from the left and
paste it into my return statement here
and this certainly looks strange now it
looks like HTML in JavaScript which
wouldn't work normally and it wouldn't
if we hadn't
Babel here as a preprocessor Babel if
configured correctly which it
automatically is here allows us to use
this special syntax which looks like
HTML but which isn't and it will dive
deeper into that syntax in the next
course modules it's called JSX and it's
just some tactical sugar behind the
scenes this gets compiled to normal
JavaScript code we can use it here
though to have an easier time writing
what we actually want to render fine so
now we got that function and I said that
this is a react component but of course
right now it's just a function to turn
this into a react component we actually
have to use react to render it to the
screen so I'll get rid of my purse here
on the left and instead I'll add a new
div here and I'll give it an ID of let's
say p1 you can choose any ID you want
though now the react package we imported
is responsible for correctly parsing
this code here this JSX code the other
packet we imported was react Dom if you
remember you can always check here on
the gear icon react on this actually
exposes an object react Dom written like
that with Dom all being Capitol
characters which has a render method
this method allows us to render a
JavaScript function as a component to
the real DOM and that treat it as a
component part is exactly what react
takes care about we can then render this
function but not by referencing it like
this but by actually turning it into a
HTML element again behind the scenes
using this JSX syntax which is
understood by react so I write this as
my custom self closing HTML element and
render then takes another argument where
I specify where to render this there I
reach out to the document and I can use
a query selector so normal JavaScript
code to select any element with the ID
p1
and that again is normal javascript code
the normal query selector with that
I'm telling react that I want to render
this function the person component in
this place here on the left and it does
now the styling is lost because class
actually is a keyword in JavaScript so
react turns this into class name and
that's the best proof that this looks
like HTML but isn't it uses a custom
certain text which in 99% of the cases
is like HTML but behind the scenes it's
transformed JavaScript and now you see
we have our person class here again max
treat it as a custom component which we
can also verify by the fact that our
inline block styling here is kind of
ignored because we're wrapping this in a
custom element which is treated as a
block statement now I'll dive into
styling in this course for now let's
just be happy that we got our component
rendered here it's not really reusable
though if I had a second hook in my HTML
file here in my HTML part let's say with
ID p2 and I wanted to render a different
component a different person I would
have to hard code the values into that
and actually create a new component the
great thing about react and why
components are so awesome and save us a
lot of time is that we can configure
them dynamically as we need them so here
what I'll do is I'll actually add an
argument to this person function which
I'll name props you can choose any name
you want but the concept I'm using here
is called props react automatically
gives me an argument in that function I
turned into a component with this syntax
down here with the person JS Xcode and
prop simply contains all the attributes
I add to my own component so I could add
name max and age let's say 28 like this
and if I do this now we can output this
in our person component
we just need to dynamically access this
props element this props argument we
output dynamic content in react with
curly braces opening closing and only
one pair no double curly braces only one
pair of curly braces and there we reach
out to props and then dot name to get
this name attribute I passed and props
age to output that age property I pass
the props age and now we're using the
properties the attributes we're passing
to our own component and that's pretty
cool because now if we repeat this react
Dom render call here for p2 so make sure
to exchange this in the second query
selector we can pass different props to
that component like menu and 29 and now
both components use the same base as you
can see they use the same function which
is turned into a component by react but
we're really taking advantage of the
component concept because we only wrote
the HTML code once and now we can reuse
it over and over again and I bet you can
see the potential of this in very big
applications you can compose the entire
application of reusable pieces and this
component isn't even using any logic it
does listen to clicks or stuff like that
in apps such as the app we build in this
course we will of course do that we will
append our own logic to our components
and then we have small reusable
maintainable and easy to manage pieces
with their own logic contained in them
which we can use anywhere to build
amazing applications that's the idea
behind react and that is why it's so
great and why this component concept is
so great now let me do one more thing
though right now I'm calling react on
render twice there's nothing wrong with
that but actually we can also do this a
bit differently we could have one div
here in the HTML part which has an idea
of app or route doesn't matter any idea
of your choice now I'll get rid of the
second react Tom render call and I will
add a variable here this variable I'll
name app but this name is also up to you
but this variable also will hold some
JSX code and I'm just wrapping this in
parentheses so that I can write this
code over multiple lines now here what I
can do is I can now output my person
component as I did before we have to
wrap it with a diff though because JSX
has the requirement of only having one
root element so adjacent elements are
not allowed I will also talk about this
and of course though there are ways
around this limitation so now I added
two person component usages to my app
variable here and now I simply mount the
app variable in the place of this
element with the ID app which I select
by adjusting my query selector and now
you see I got the two elements now next
to each other because now they're
rendered in the same hook in the same
element so to say in the same death and
this method of only having one hook one
react on render call and then creating a
up there with nested components is the
far more popular way of creating react
apps it is the way I will use in this
course and in the next lectures I will
talk about this where is this the
alternative with multiple react on
render calls but be aware this is the
way you will see far more often with
this approach you create so called
single page applications now this is our
first react app now let's dive deeper
into react and let's continue with the
course and really get started with react
so we already got our hands dirty and we
saw how we build a react app now this
already answers a bit why we might want
to use react there's also more there are
more reasons why we want to use react
react helps us with a problem we'll
encounter with normal JavaScript DUI
state becomes difficult to manage in
bigger JavaScript applications you have
to manually target elements in your DOM
and if you then change the structure of
your HTML code chances are you need to
change the way you targeted your
elements because you used query selector
or even if you use jQuery traversing the
Dom is easier but it's still always
something you have to keep in mind and
if you got more complex web apps where
you dynamically add and remove elements
this quickly can become cumbersome in
our course project we build app which is
highly dynamic where we are able to
build a burger and dynamically add and
remove ingredients if you write this
with normal JavaScript code it's going
to be a nightmare so react helps us by
making this whole UI state management a
non-issue it allows us to focus on our
business logic instead of keeping our
application from exploding
and additionally react is maintained by
a big community so chances are the react
code is written better than we could
have ever written it so therefore it's
highly efficient and fast and the bigger
your application gets the more this
matters too and finally react features a
huge ecosystem and an extremely active
community which means that there's a
great chance that for a given problem
you face you'll find a solution or an
extra package you can add to fix it all
these are reasons why react is awesome
and why you definitely should consider
it for your next project and why you
made the right choice to start with this
course
now there's not just react there are
also alternatives react of course is
what we'll cover in this course but
there also is angular and there would be
view KS and there are others like
backbone or ember but angular and view
are the most popular alternatives and I
can only recommend diving into these two
to really pick your favorite I also got
courses on them if you are interested
all three of them are great at creating
highly scalable web applications that
look and feel good to the user not so
much an alternative is jQuery you might
think it is one but jQuery is really
only about traversing the DOM and
targeting elements in the Dom now as you
saw in our example react is about just
declaring what you see and focusing on
the logic instead on focusing on the how
and therefore react angular and view
allow you to create more powerful
applications because you can focus on
the logic and your business model and
not so much on the technical side of
actually reaching that element you want
it to change
when we talk about react or also about
angular and view as a side note we also
have to keep in mind that we can
essentially build two kinds of web
applications with all these libraries
and frameworks we can build a single
page application or a multi page
application now what's the difference in
a single page application we only get
back one single HTML file by the server
and we get back this fall at the first
time the user Wizards the page so the
first time the user wizards example.com
thereafter everything is managed with
Java Script with react the entire page
consists of components which are
rendered and handled by Java Script on
the other hand in a multi-page
application we get back multiple HTML
pages where each page has the content
for a given route a given URL we visited
for example.com an example that come
slash users we get back two different
pages that's important now on multi-page
applications we might all use react but
only to create little of widgets so to
say so individually contained components
we dump into that page but not the
entire page is managed by react we also
see this on some pages but the more
popular approach these days is the
single page application approach because
if you manage the entire page with Java
Script you never have to go back to the
server and reload the page and that is
an amazing user experience because
everything happens instantly and even if
the user needs to wait you're showing a
spinner or you're still presenting a
reactive web app you're not just showing
a loading page where the user can't do
anything so in single page applications
our page is built up with components and
every component is a react component and
the entire page also is managed by a
root react component and is just under
reacts control in the multi page
application on the other hand we also
could split up our app into theoretical
components but actually a lot of the
page is just going to be normal HTML and
CSS
and some widgets we dump in like an
image gallery or something like that is
managed by react so the entire page is
not under react control the individual
widgets don't know of each other's
existence therefore in the single
application case which is the case we'll
cover in this course we typically only
have one react Dom render call this
method you saw in the previous lectures
where we trained our first app now we
only need one because we have one root
app component there which is mounted to
the Dom which hosts all other react
components in the multi page application
we would typically call react on render
more often to render our different
components in different places of the
app you saw that react on render allows
you to pick a place in your HTML code
where you want to render your app and
therefore you have these widgets which
don't know of each other's existence now
you can build such an application to you
and the react code you write won't
differ so this course actually covers
both but I will focus on a single page
application case since Ted also allows
us to use some libraries like react
router and is the most popular way of
creating web apps these days and also
the approach I can only recommend to you
so now that we had a look at the basics
of react what reactors about let me
explain what this course is about and
what we're going to cover in this course
we're almost done getting started only a
couple of more words I want to spend on
how you get the most out of this course
and then we'll be leaving this module
thereafter you'll actually find an
optional second module in this optional
module I will walk you through the most
important next-generation JavaScript
features we're going to use in this
course when writing react applications
you typically use quite a lot of these
next-gen features like arrow functions
or classes you do this because this
allows you to write cleaner react code
and it's the de facto standard to use
all these features if you already feel
comfortable using next-generation
JavaScript features so if you already
know yes six and so on then you can skip
the next module and I will mention this
there too otherwise you've got a nice
module we're all ensure that we're all
on the same page and that you got solid
fundamentals about all these features
we're about to use and you can always go
back to that module if you later in the
course encounter something that looks
strange or new to you after this
optional module the real second module
is the module where we dive into the
react basics that's of course a super
important module you will learn how you
can create react components that there
is more than one way of doing so and how
you can communicate between components
how and react application is generally
built this section also includes things
like how can we output lists or how can
we render some content conditionally
there after it's time to dive into
debugging because we all make mistakes
you will write code that fails that's
natural that happens to everyone it's
super important that you then know how
to recover how to debug your application
how to find that error that makes your
program crash we'll have a look at this
in this debugging module after debugging
will dive into styling how can we style
our react
and how can we make sure that the
styling we apply to a component only
gets applied to that component and not
to other components as well we'll take a
look at that in this module thereafter
we'll dive deeper into components will
already have learned a lot about them
but here we will learn which lifecycle
they follow we will learn how we can
cleverly control whether react should
check for updates often component or not
and much more
so that is truly an important module
which will make sure that you understand
the internals of react and that you got
the tools you need for bigger or more
advanced react applications after that
you will have learned a lot about
components but we're far from being done
well then dive into HTTP requests how
can we connect our react application to
the outside world how can we fetch data
from a server or ascend it to that
server how can we do all of that in a
single page or all's in a multi-page
application with asynchronous HTTP
requests Ajax that is what we'll have a
look at in this module and thereafter
we'll dive into routing routing is a
core feature when building single page
applications because with routing we can
actually handle different URLs like
slash user and slash products and render
different pages even though technically
we only have one HTML page and we simply
parse the URL with JavaScript and
rerender the parts of the Dom that need
to be rendered to display a new page
that sounds very complex and that is why
we will use a package for this routing
is a super important and key module of
this course therefore now one important
note at this point all these concepts
are always taught in theory and with
tiny demo projects we will also have an
overarching course project the Burger
builder and we will regularly go back to
that project and apply the features to
learn the previous module to the course
project so we will start by planning and
Cree
getting it then we will use advanced
component concepts we will apply styling
and will also apply routing there so
that we can gradually see our project
become better and better and so that you
always have a great way of seeing all
these things not just in theory or in
tiny demo projects but in a real project
so the things I mentioned here are only
the overarching topics this course
actually has more modules because we
have all these in-between practice
orientated modules back to the outline
here though after routing will dive into
forms and validation in almost any web
application you build you need to fetch
user input and in this module I will
show you how to do this in a dynamic way
and how to also validate user input and
thereafter it's time for Redux redux and
more Redux will dive deeply into redux
which is an independent third-party
library but which of course is used in
many react projects we'll start at the
basics we'll learn why we might want to
use redux and then we will learn more
advanced use cases like using
asynchronous actions in redux and way
more this is an important module and I
can't wait to dive into this and then
also apply to the course project
together with you after Redux will dive
into authentication probably every web
application has some sort of
authentication allowing users to sign up
and sign in here I will show you how to
implement this I will always as an all
these modules focus on the client side
so on the react side and not on the
server side but of course I will explain
how to implement authentication so that
it works with any back-end that supports
this kind of authentication will of
course also apply this to the course
project after authentication will dive
into testing only an introduction to be
honest because testing is enough content
where you can create enough content
about testing to fill an entire course
but I want to introduce you to how your
tests react applications which tools you
use and how to think about testing react
apps after testing will of course all to
learn how to deploy and react
application so how to reshare
to a real server and thereafter I got
loads of bonus content for example a
whole module about animating react
applications possible next steps where
you could dive into after finishing this
module a module about next j/s which is
basically a library building up on react
and making server-side render
applications a breeze module where we
will build our own workflow our own
project from scratch with web pack and a
couple of build tools and way more so a
lot of content in this course it has the
length it has for a reason in the end
and I can't wait to dive into it
together with you so why don't we do
that and just start with the course
now that we had a look at what reactors
and why we might want to use it as well
as now that we built our first react app
let's dive into all the cool react
concepts and the base syntax of react in
this module we'll have a look at what it
takes to build a real react app and with
that of course I also mean locally on
our machine and not on code pen and you
will learn which core features react
offers and how you use them so let's
dive right into that and let's learn how
we set up a local react project on our
machine
so we want to set up a local react
project with local I mean we don't use
coat pan but instead we will have a
project on our machine where we can work
in with our own IDE or editor this of
course is the way we want to work with
react we want to have it on our machine
we have more features available there
it's more convenient than using some web
editor and code pen which we use before
or jsbin which we used in the optional
second module are really more
playgrounds than real work environments
for real projects so we will set up a
local project and react is actually more
than just importing the two files we
imported in code pen we need a more
elaborate workflow for real projects and
this is recommended for both single page
and multi page applications the question
of course is why do we need a more
complex workflow and how do we then
achieve it let me start with the why we
when building a real app we want to
actually optimize our code we didn't
care about this in the demo project in
the first course module on code pen but
for a big react application we want a
ship code that is as small as possible
and as optimized as possible obviously
because that increases the performance
of our app additionally and that is
super important we want to use these
next generation JavaScript features I
taught you about in the last optional
module now we want to use that because
it makes our life as a developer much
easier and that's the de facto standard
for react apps to use all these next gen
features the cost to code is leaner
easier to read faster less error-prone
and many other reasons so you should
really use these features it's not just
something nice optional I strongly
recommend using these features it is
considered the best practice and it is
what I teach you in this course because
obviously I want to teach you best
practices so we want to use next
generation JavaScript features to have
an easier time to write less error-prone
code and with all that we need a word
float that supports these features even
on code
we implicitly did this remember that
preprocessor drop down where we switch
to Babel that behind-the-scenes unlocked
a couple of built tools that would parse
our code and support JSX this HTML in
JavaScript syntax for example so we want
to use these next-gen features
essentially we want to be able to write
es6 or above code and still ship code in
the end that runs on as many browsers as
possible and not that many browsers
support all these next-gen features that
is why we need a build workflow that
actually compiles these features finally
in the end we want to be more productive
this includes next-generation JavaScript
features which often allow us to write
more condensed code but it also includes
things like CSS Auto prefixing you might
know that CSS prefixes are a think you
achieve the broadest possible browser
support for CSS features now manually
adding these prefixes is quite annoying
so automatically adding them is nice or
consider linting so a tool which
actually warns you if you are writing
sub-optimal code that would be nice to
have to not strictly required but a nice
feature and all these things should be
part of a build workflow now to
implement them there we need a couple of
tools that actually let them run over
our code to either warn us in the case
of linting or to compile the code to
code that runs on as many browsers as
possible whilst we as developer are
writing very modern code that would on
its own not run on that many browsers so
that's the why a couple of reasons why
writing this kind of code is desirable
and why we need a more complex build
workflow that actually allows us to
write this code that actually optimizes
the code for us and for that the how of
course is relevant how do we achieve
such a workflow we first of all need a
dependency management tool dependencies
are simply third-party libraries
third-party JavaScript packages
react for examples of dependency react
Dom as a dependency and also all the
build tools we will need in the end our
dependencies so the compiler for
next-gen JavaScript - current gen
JavaScript dead is a dependency and we
will use npm here yarn would be another
tool you could use but we will use npm
nodes package manager a tool which just
allows us to manage packages and which
is the de facto standard for managing
dependencies also on front-end projects
besides that dependency management tool
we need a bundler because we want to
write modular code and split it up over
multiple files so that each file has a
clear task a clear focus and therefore
it's easier for us to maintain and
manage but then we want to make sure
that all this code gets bundled into a
couple of files in the end when we ship
it because browsers don't even support
split up files older browsers at least
don't do and it might also even if they
did support it not be that optimal to
make thousands of requests to all these
tiny focused files so we want to have
that bundler and we will use webpack
which is the de facto standard for
bundling these days the cool thing about
WebP egg is it doesn't just bundle files
it also allows us to apply a couple of
other build steps before it does this
bundling for example dimensioned
compilation of next-gen javascript that
requires another tool Babel
we need a compiler that does this
javascript compilation which means
translation from modern features to
workarounds that also work on older
browsers and we will use babel plus
presets which can be hooked into the web
pack configuration so that they are part
of this bundling and optimization
process and finally in the end we want
to use a development server to test our
app locally on our machine development
server is a web server but one running
on our machine we could open a HTML file
by double-clicking on it but this will
use the file protocol and would not
correctly emulate the app running as it
runs on a web server so we need a web
server and we
and of course run one on our local
machine the server is then only
accessible by us but that's all we need
as a developer and there we can really
see the app run as it will run in the
end on a real server we need all these
things and it sounds like that's super
complex to set up the good thing is it's
not I will present you a tool that will
create a project supporting all these
things out of the box with zero
configuration in the next lectures we
will install this tool together and it
is a tool created by the react team and
community and the officially recommended
way of creating you react apps because
that's the general theme of this course
I will teach you things in the best
practice and recommended way so all of
the setup is quite easy and as a side
note if you still want to dive into how
this works behind the scenes and you
want to set this up from scratch I also
got a module for dad towards the end of
the course where we will build a react
app a react project from scratch now
with that you know what we need and how
now let's dive into that tool I
mentioned and let's learn how we
actually get started with a new react
project supporting all these features
in the last lecture I highlighted why we
wanna set up a project which gives us
some additional features which make our
life as a developer easier now as I also
mentioned there is a tool which creates
such a project for us
it's called create react app and you can
simply Google for it to find a link to
its official github repository as I said
it's maintained by basically Facebook or
a community around Facebook so it's the
officially recommended tool for creating
react projects on that github page you
will find installation instructions and
a detailed explanation about what it
does and how it works
feel free to read fruited but of course
you're also going to learn all about
that throughout this course let's start
with the installation we install it
globally with NPM and NPM is simply
nodes package manager a tool you
automatically get when installing
node.js which makes it easy to manage
third-party packages other JavaScript
packages in the end and create react tab
is just such a package do you use NPM
you need to install node.js
which you can download and install from
node.js org now there you should pick
the latest version 8.5 in my case here
but if you're facing any issues with
that also try out words in the 6.11 or
whatever the long-term support version
is in your case when you're viewing this
page now no worries we're not going to
write any node.js code here you don't
need to know note J s we only needed to
use its package manager and also for
this development server which will be
spun up for us automatically so simply
click these buttons download and oat
noches and it will spin up installer
through which you can walk once you did
finish the installation you should be
able to run the npm command here on your
machine so let's do this together in the
next step to install create react app
through NPM you should go into the
terminal or command prompt off your
machine
and there you can outrun npm install'
this is available since we installed
node then create react app one word with
dashes between the supper words and then
dash G this flag at the end installed it
globally on our machine so that we can
run it anywhere on the machine which of
course is what we want to do because we
want to be able to create new react
projects wherever we want now on mac and
linux you might need to add a sudo in
front of all of that to get the right
permissions of running this command and
if you do add it
you're probably prompted for your
password too now once you did enter it
and again this is not required on
Windows you will install create react
app on your machine once this is
finished you can start creating new
react projects with it the command can
also be found on this github page I
showed you earlier here but will of
course run it together you simply run
create react app so the package name in
the end and then the name of the app
this will be the name of the folder
which gets created where the default
configuration and a lot of starting
files will be placed in I will name it
react complete guide but you can name it
whatever you want hit enter and this
will automatically create the folder and
install all the dependencies it needs as
you can see here already
that is react itself react dong to
access to Tom and react scripts which is
a package bundling all these different
tools I was referring to you on the
slide in the last lecture once this
setup finished you can navigate into
this newly created folder with CD and
then the name of the project you chose
in my case react complete guide and in
there simply run NPM start now for me
it's showing yarn start and all these
yarn commands because I have yarn
installed an alternative to NPM but you
don't need that you can just run NPM
start and this will now spin up a
development server and open a new page
already
this page here this is the starting page
this project gives you it is basically a
starting point we will start editing it
later on and you should always keep this
process you started with NPM start
running this is the development server I
was referring to which loads your
application on the browser simulates it
to run as on a real web page and reloads
the page whenever you change the code
you can also find the address where it's
serving it here in the terminal so
always keep this process running if
you're working on your application if
you want to close it you can always do
this with ctrl C but then you will not
be able to is it this page here again
now with that we got our project set up
let's now have a look at what's inside
there and what was created for us in the
next lecture
in the last lecture we created our
project with create react app and as I
mentioned make sure that npm start this
process is running whenever you're
working on your code i now open the
folder which was created with microsoft
visual studio code this is the ide i'm
going to use throughout the course but
you can use any ide or editor you want
to use for example also webstorm would
be an alternative or a sublime or atom
or any other editor you like now here i
installed a theme and some extensions
and you can find the exact configuration
I'm using here described in a PDF
document attached to this video just in
case you want to use the same but feel
free to use your favorite setup whatever
the theme and setup you use you will
have the same amount of files and
folders in your project so let's now
walk through all the files and folders
we have here on the root level we get a
couple of configuration files these
locked files here can basically be
ignored there just locking in the
versions of the dependencies we're using
the general dependencies our project
heads are the finally packaged up JSON
file there you can see we have three
dependencies in this project and this
was all created by create react app as
you can see we obviously import react
here I'm using a release candidate
version of react 16 at the point of time
you're viewing this this should be
released react Dom it's the same and
react scripts as I mentioned it's a
package offering all this build workflow
this development server the next
generation JavaScript feature support
and all these things we're using in this
project in the package to JSON file
there are also a couple of scripts
defined you can run these scripts with
npm run and then the script name the
exceptions start which you can also run
with npm start the command we execute it
and as you can see it uses this react
scripts package to then also execute
some start command there that's simply a
command this package makes available and
this command happens to start this
development server watch all our code
compile our code optimize the code and
do all these things once you
ready for deploying your app you would
run npm run build show optimize it even
more not launch a development server but
instead get your optimized code stored
in a folder because right now
you won't see your compiled code
anywhere here everything happens in
memory but i'll come back to deploying
the application later in the course so
let's close this package doc jason filed
for now the node modules folder holds
all the dependencies and sub
dependencies of our project this is why
we have that many we only had react
react Dom and react scripts but react
scripts has a lot of other dependencies
all these little built tools which
compiled code and so on you shouldn't
edit anything in the node modules folder
it's generated automatically if you run
npm install in your project folder and
this was automatically done by create
react scripts the public folder is more
interesting it's basically the root
folder which gets served by the web
server in the end though here it only
holds two files we can add it
these stripped files are edited in the
source folder here we got one important
file index.html this is a normal HTML
page and it is the single page we have
here we will never add more HTML pages
in this project if you're creating a
multi-page project you would create
multiple such projects here with create
react app you wouldn't add more HTML
files here or you need your own workflow
if you want to do that so this is the
single page where in the end our script
files will get injected by that build
workflow which is why you don't see a
script import here and you can edit this
file but we will don't write any HTML
code here I want to highlight this div
here with the idea root this will become
important because this will be where we
actually mount our react application
later and we will of course work and
react but if you need to add any imports
to let's say our libraries CSS libraries
or want to add some meta tags you can do
that here in the HTML file you could
also add more HTML here but again you
probably want to do this
in react the manifest of Jason fall is
there because create react app gives us
a progressive web app out-of-the-box a
very basic one at least and gives us
this manifesto Jason fall where we can
define some metadata about our
application interesting for us is the
source folder here we get a couple of
files and these are actually the files
we will work in this is actually our
react application most important for us
right now
the index.js file gets access to this
root element at our Dom in our HTML file
so the element with the ID root which of
course is this diff we saw in the
index.html file this one and there as
you can see it renders our react
application with the rendered method now
here it references some app object or
element which we import from an app file
the extension dot J S is left out
because it's automatically added by our
build workflow and if we have a look at
this app dot J's file therefore this is
where we see our first and only react
component we have in this starting
project right now here we see some JSX
and i won't dive deeply into what we see
here exactly in the next lectures for
now let's remove all the content in this
wrapping div and let's simply add a h1
tag here where I'll say hi I'm a react
app let's close it of course also and
then let's save it that's always
important don't forget to save your
files now since you have NPM start
running this will automatically trigger
a recompilation and it should
automatically reload your page too which
is why you should now see hi I am a
react app instead of the old content
with dad we can also remove this logo
don't SVG file because we no longer use
it in our project and now we got a bit
of a leaner source folder now what else
did create react app crate for us it
gave us this app dot CSS file which
basically defines some stylings we use
in this app dot J's file though I will
say that these are not scoped to this
file these are still global stylings and
I will actually remove everything but
this first app class definition init
file and save it thereafter we also get
an index CSS file which also applies
Styles Clovelly and which should be used
for some general setup as here for the
body of our application the registers
service worker J's fall is as the name
implies important for registering a
service worker which is generated
automatically that's related to this
progressive web app we get out of the
box it will basically precache our
script files we don't need to configure
anything there and the test file well
we'll dive into testing later in the
course it basically allows us to create
unit tests for the different units for
example components in our application
this is the general setup and for the
majority of this course will work in app
dot j/s or our new components we create
speaking off that let's analyze this
file let's understand the syntax we see
there let's get rid of that logo import
because we removed the logo file now did
I see it and let's dive into JSX what
exactly that is and how we add more
components to our application
in the last lecture I walked you through
the folder structure which was created
by a create react app and we added it
our app dot J's file let's now dive
deeper into what we see here we see a
react component as I explained react as
all about creating components basically
custom HTML elements you could say which
you can then use to construct your
application this app component actually
gets used in the index.js file where we
render it into the place of this route
element and we could be render a normal
HTML element here to test for example
this would work this is now no react
component if I save this I see this h1
tag but of course then we have no real
react application we're rendering a
normal HTML element but we're not
rendering our own react component now
you could of course use multiple react
on renders and render all the HTML code
you want to use in your app that's not
really how you create your react apps
bill
typically you render one route component
the app component but you can name it
whatever you want one route component in
our case it is the app component named
app and in there you would nest all the
other components your application might
need and of course these components can
then also be nested into each other but
all the way up to the top
you only have one route component you
could reach out to multiple nodes in
your HTML file and mount different route
components for different react apps all
in the same project that would be
possible but it's not what we do here in
the end you can of course simply
replicate what you learn in this course
for multiple applications in one at the
same HTML file but let's stick to the
general or typical usage of react we
have this app component which is to find
the app dot J's file here we see one way
one of two ways of defining a react
component we create a Java Script class
with the class keyword and then we use
the extends keyword to inherit
from this component object or class to
be precise which is imported up here
from the react library actually we
import two things react which is a
response alors required for rendering
anything anything to the Dom we always
need to import dad enough file where we
define a component and of course the
component class itself I will soon show
you a different way of creating
components though now this class has one
method the render method it needs to
have that because react will call this
method to render something to the screen
there's one important chop every react
component has to do it has to return or
render some HTML code which can be
rendered to Dom to the screen you can do
other things in there to reach out to
the internet do some calculations listen
to events whenever you need in your
application we will see all of that in
that course but you always also need to
render some HTML to the Dom this is so
important to keep in mind we then export
this app class as the default export of
this file this is a es6 feature and
simply means if you import this whole
file you simply import this class
because it's the default export we do
use this in the index.js file where we
import app from the app file again
omitting this extension because it's
added by our build workflow
automatically for JavaScript files this
app name here by the way is chosen
arbitrarily but typically you use the
name of the component you also use in
the file and they you also use as the
file name when sidenote you might also
see these components with dot j as x as
a file extension instead of j s the
reason for this is this code here I
refer to it as HTML which is returned
but in the end this is not HTML it looks
like it
it is JSX so it is JavaScript looking a
bit different and this can be confusing
at first when you're learning react this
might be one of the most confusing
things actually important to know is
this is just some some tactical sugar it
was basically invented by the react team
and we can write it in a JavaScript
files because of the build workflow were
using here it will basically
automatically transpile it to valid
JavaScript in the end it's not connected
to the file extension you're using it
works in dot J's and dot JSX files and
the convention nowadays is pretty much -
you always use dot J's files which is
why we do it here - and it simply is
code or a syntax we can use to write
HTML in quotation marks whilst in the
end not writing it sounds confusing let
me show you what this actually is
compiled - in the next lecture
in the last lecture I walked you through
and how it generally is structured now
let's dive deeper into this JSX
thing for this i'll comment out this
block here so that it's not used anymore
and i'll return something else i can use
the react object we're importing up here
and call a method on it create element
this by the way is also the reason why
we have to import react because this
code here isn't the end compiled to what
we're writing here even though we don't
see that create element as a method and
it takes free arguments actually takes
an infinite amount of arguments but at
least free the first one is the element
we want to render to the dom this could
be a diff
this can be a normal HTML element like a
div it could also be your own component
if you have one available here we don't
though because we're inside a component
we can't render that we could render any
other component we're importing but we
have no such component the second
argument is basically the configuration
for this and there we would pass a
javascript object this is optional we
can also pass null and we'll do this for
now because it don't one can do
configure it the third argument here
then is any amount of children and we
could have multiple arguments separated
by commas children means what's nested
inside this death now in this case we
want to nest h1 element let's try by
adding h1 and then as another argument
let's add this text here with multiple
exclamation marks and let's escape this
quotation mark here with a backslash so
that we can identify that this was
rendered by this create element method
now with that let me save this code
create element with four arguments div
now h1 and the text make sure you save
the file in visuals to your code you see
that it is saved if you see a cross here
and no dot and then let's go back to our
app
vacation here we see h1 hi I'll react
app and if we inspect this in the
developer tools and chrome here in my
case which I strongly recommend using
you see we got a div with two text nodes
inside h1 and hi I'm a react app so we
didn't render h1 element we rendered
text and this is actually the default
behavior each one here is interpreted as
text it's not rendered as element if we
want to render another element inside
the div what we have to do is replace
this code here with another call to
react create element to create a new
HTML element at the end here we now pass
h1 then null as configuration and then
the text we want to render so here let's
mix this up and say does this work now
now if we save this file and we go back
to the application we see a h1 tag does
this work now we can also see this if we
inspect it in the developer tools we get
a div wrapping an h1 tag now what we
don't see is two CSS styling getting
applied because we don't see the class
being added in our JSX code we added a
CSS class with class name not with class
by the name by the way I'll come back to
why we use classname in the next lecture
so we add class name in our create
element call we would simply not pass
null as configuration but a JavaScript
object and there we can define class
name and assign any CSS classes we want
to add for example app the same class
we're applying here we now save this
file again it reloads and we now see the
updated styling with the center text we
see this CSS class being applied here on
the dev tool this is super important to
understand the code we just wrote here
with react
create element and the nested react
create element is the exact equivalent
of this JSX code and it's actually -
what this code here will get compiled by
one of the many built tools we get out
of the box in this project it is the
reason why we need to import react even
though we're not using it at all when
using this syntax because behind the
scenes we will use it once it is
compiled of course writing the code like
this with create element is really
cumbersome especially as you add and
nest more and more elements this is why
we typically don't use this code but
instead this code we started with this
is the reason why we use JSX
but it's super important to understand
the internals and understand what this
compounds - and also most important of
all understand that whilst it does look
I like HTML it isn't this is JavaScript
in the end it gets compiled - this code
in the last lecture I had a look at what
JSX actually is and it's so important to
understand this now in this lecture I
want to highlight some of the
restrictions we face
for example this class name thing here
JSX clearly looks like HTML and it
should it should allow us to write HTML
as code in our JavaScript files still
since it is in a JavaScript file and
since it is JavaScript some words can't
be used class for example which we would
use in normal HTML to assign our CSS
class can't be used because as I
reserved the word in JavaScript we
already use it here by the way to create
a new class this is why we have to use
class name all these elements we can use
here like def and h1 are actually
managed or provided by the react library
we are not using the real HTML tags
react is converting them behind the
scenes and react the finds the
attributes in quotation marks I should
say we can define on all these elements
and we don't have the class attribute as
we have on the regular HTML element we
have the class name attribute here q add
a CSS class as you can see in our final
code disease translated to class though
it's not class name here once it has
been rendered now another restriction we
face is that when we return something
here let's say we also want to return
and never heading we actually can't do
this here our JSX expression must have
one root element now with react 16 this
is kind of loosened and we will see in
this course that we can actually return
adjacent elements in the end it is a
typical thing and a typical best
practice q wrap everything into one root
element per component though this also
makes sense since you typically want to
style your components and want to add
the CSS class which is responsible for
styling q
element as we do here so typically you
nest everything in one single root
element you return and if you're
wondering about these parentheses here
these are simply used so that we can
write the HTML and I'm always saying
HTML but keep in mind it's JSX it's
JavaScript so that you can return this
HTML code nicely structured across
multiple lines without receiving errors
this is why we use the parentheses so if
that I could add a paragraph here where
I say this is really working and that's
closer to now with that we see that
paragraph here Q and we have a look at
some of the restrictions or things to
watch out when using JSX
because again it isn't HTML but in most
cases it actually works just like it
we already learned a lot about the core
fundamentals of react especially this
JSX thing which is super important to
get right and to understand but I also
mentioned in the first module of the
course that react is all about
components you build your application
with components and react as a library
which makes building these components so
easy well right now we're only using one
component time to change this and for
this I'll add a new file in the source
folder of our project I'll actually even
add a new folder and I'll name it person
with a capital P this is kind of de
convenciÃ³n react you don't have to do
that but you give your components the
files where you create them capital
starting characters and you describe
what this component is basically
therefore and here I want to render some
information about a person inside that
person folder which is stored in the
source folder I'll trade a person dot JS
file again following this convention of
having a capital starting character and
describing what this component is about
now in there I want you to create a
component and we already did this
actually we got this out of the box in
the app dot JS file by extending the
component class from the react library
we can absolutely use this approach and
it will become more important later when
you also learn about state which
basically allows you to change your
component at the runtime you could say
but most of the time you should use a
different form of component or of
creating components a bare function a
simple JavaScript function because in
its simplest form a component is just a
function which returns some JSX some
HTML you could say now of course you
can't create a function with the
function keyword you could name a person
here with a lower case starting
character which all this kind of
convention your you could use a capital
one though and then you could return
some JSX here you can't absolute
do that you could also use the es5
syntax off creating a variable which
holds a function which in the end would
result in the same but I will use es6 in
this course which is strongly recommend
doing it is kind of the best practice
when creating react projects it gives
you access to many new and modern
features hence I will create a variable
not with the water keyword but with the
Const keyword because I don't plan on
changing this variable effectively
making it a constant and hence you
should mark it as such I'll name it
person with a lowercase character as I
said you could choose person with a poor
case P but you often see the function
name being all lowercase it should
otherwise be the same name as your file
name though or as the component name you
want to use then I will assign a value
to this variable or constant to be
precise and this should be a function
now I could again use function here but
actually I want to use the es6 function
syntax this arrow function syntax so I
will say equal argument list arrow
function body this is just the es6
equivalent to the function created with
the function keyword it holds some
advantages especially when it comes to
this keyword though so strongly
recommend using this syntax if this is
brand new to you now you know it and in
general you might be interested in also
diving into some es6 courses or learning
materials you will simply learn about
all the awesome features es6 has to
offer like this one back to this syntax
though we effectively have a function
here and as I said in its simplest form
a component as a function returning some
JSX
so let's do that let's return some JSX
and we could simply return a paragraph
here where I say I'm a person now this
alone creates a valid function which we
could use as a component but we also
have
to do two other things do you have an
idea what we have to do for one we need
to import react because keep in mind
this JSX syntax is transformed to react
create element and to be able to call
this method we need to import react with
a capital R from the react package like
this so just as we do in app J s here we
don't need to component though because
here we're not using a class which
extends component instead we're creating
a function we still need to export that
function though as default of this file
here we export this person constant
which holds this function with that
let's save the file so that this dot up
here disappears and we only see the
cross and now we can start using this
component in other files of our project
namely in the only other component our
route component we have yet in the app
dot J's file there I will add a import
and I will import person this name is
now totally up to you but it should be
the name of your components starting
with a capital character from dot slash
because it's a relative path the person
folder so referring to this folder which
is in the same path as the app dot JS
file and there the person dot JS file
though we can omit the dot J s because
it's added automatically by the build
workflow now it's important that you
gift is a name which starts with a
uppercase character you could choose any
other name it doesn't have to be person
though it makes sense to use the name of
your component but it should have a
appliques character because in reactant
JSX all elements starting with lowercase
characters like therefore h1 are
reserved for the native HTML elements so
you could create your own compose
which you named if with an uppercase D
and then react could use that because it
wouldn't interfere with the normal death
and for the same reason you should give
your person the uppercase character so
that react identifies it as a custom
component so let's use person here and
we can either use an opening and closing
tag like this or since we don't nest
anything between I'll come back to dad
in the next lectures too you can also
use a self closing tag with slash and
then you created then sign at the end
with that if you save this file too and
you now go back to your application with
NPM start still running in a terminal
you see ila person being rendered below
our app component content this is now
coming from our own component and if we
inspect it we see in the end we don't
see our custom element we just see the
paragraph we're exporting in the
function and that is actually how it
should be so this is now our own
component getting used of course using
it like this is already nice but what
exactly is to benefit of creating it
like this instead of simply adding the
code right into the app dot J's file
let's do more with this component to see
that benefit in the next lecture
in the last lecture we created our own
component the person component the
question is what's the big advantage of
this components are awesome because we
can focus our code in each file and
hence make it much more maintainable not
put everything into the after J's file
which can really get crowded for bigger
apps and this component is also reusable
and configurable now come back to the
configuring part reusing it is quite
simple we can simply copy it and paste
it as often as we want maybe three times
and by simply doing this and saving that
file we get the output multiple times
and that is a super easy way of reusing
it anywhere in our application and if
our application would contain more and
more components this would make it super
easy to build it up with all these
components and use them wherever we need
to use them in our app this is now
effectively our custom HTML element we
also can configure it though before we
do that let's change something else
about our react code because right now
it's all static still we have our custom
component but in there we still just
have some static HTML text some HTML
content at the end now oftentimes your
templates your JSX code should be
dynamic should output different things
depending on the state of your
application or on some user input now we
will do this a lot for the course but
let's lay the foundations for that in
the next lecture
in the last lecture we replicated the
person component let's now dive into
outputting some dynamic content in react
thus far we always hard-coded some HTML
elements and I'm always saying HTML you
know it's JSX just because it looks like
HTML I'm saying that and some text in
between now let's say we want to say I
am a person and I am X years old but X
should actually be a random number now
we can simply do that we can replace X
with math.random you get a random number
between 0 &amp;amp; 1
maybe multiply this with 30 and also use
math.floor to round it down now if we do
this and save that code well we see this
output as a text which makes sense how
would react note you execute this as
JavaScript after all maybe we want to
output it as a text if we have some
dynamic content in our JSX part which we
want to run as JavaScript code and not
interpret as text we have to wrap it in
single curly braces so let's wrap this
in single curly braces one in front of
math.floor and one after the closing
parenthesis now if we save this we let
this reload we see I'm 0 9 and 20 years
old and if we reload this again we see
different values because it's random now
this is super important because this now
shows us that we can output dynamic
content as part of our JSX content we
can't define a javascript class in there
or anything like that we can execute
one-line expressions short simple
expressions like simple calculations or
coaching calls here that is important by
the way I could call a function here and
this function might then do more complex
stuff will actually see us calling
functions once we add event handlers now
that we're able to output dynamic
content why don't we take it to the next
level and make our component more
dynamic so that we can leave outputting
some generic content like person and a
random number and instead do something
else
pass some configuration from the app dot
JS file maybe some HTML attributes we
passed a person to configure what we
want to output for each usage of the
person component
now that we know how to output dynamic
content let's make our component
configurable flexible and dynamic for
normal HTML elements we can pass
attributes like class name which we can
add to any HTML attribute input element
also would have the value attribute for
example now for person it would be nice
if you could say name and maybe pass Max
and H and maybe pass 28 and for the sect
usage we maybe want to pass menu and the
age of 29 and for the third usage we
maybe want to use Stephanie and pass an
age of 26
that's not my girlfriend by the way so
if we do that we want to output this and
maybe we even want to take it further
and for menu we also want to split this
in our opening and closing tag and also
output some additional information like
my hobbies which could be racing now
with all of that in place we have to
change something in our person component
to handle that input because by default
of course if we save this and we reload
the app our output is unchanged because
we're not using this information how
would we how would react know what to do
with that well it actually is able to
take these attributes and gives us
access inside our receiving component on
object named prompts now actually the
name here is up to you but you will
receive one argument in your function
one argument which is passed into it by
default by react which is an object with
all the properties of this component and
properties means the attributes you add
on your component now in react land this
is referred to as props which is why I
named this argument props and I strongly
recommend doing so so that everyone else
understands your code too
theoretically you're free to name this
differently though so now that we have
props we can get access to that name and
age thing so we could say I am and now
use single curly braces to output
something dynamic I am props name and I
am years old now here I will keep the
Equality braces but replace the random
calculation with props age
I'm props name and I'm props years old
let's now save this and let's see what
happens if this now reloads in our
application if it doesn't reload reload
manually you should see IMAX and 20
years old menu and Stephanie and all the
ages so now we're having the best of
both worlds we have a reusable component
which has a clearly defined template but
in there we use dynamic content which we
set from outside in the place where we
actually use our component this makes it
really real think about all the
possibilities which we will also explore
in this course having an input component
where you can set the type from outside
having this person component which might
be styled like a card to output dynamic
or different content for the different
persons that is truly an amazing world
of features we can access here and it's
one important step towards really
building great and flexible components
what about the hobbies here though let's
have a look at how we can use content
which is passed
not as a attribute but between the
opening and closing tags in the next
lecture
in the last lecture we learned how to
use props how to receive them as an
argument and output them dynamically in
our code now I also want to output
whatever we pass between the opening and
closing tag of our custom component and
this is actually super simple too
there is a special prop we can access
react gives us access to it to be
precise in the person component where we
want to receive it in the end I will
wrap my paragraph in normal parentheses
so that I can write this over multiple
lines because I now also want to create
a wrapping element simply a div and I
want to wrap the paragraph inside of
this div and also add another element
after this paragraph this our element
should also be a paragraph maybe but it
should be a paragraph which outputs this
part we pass in between we can simply do
that by using single curly braces to
output something dynamic accessing props
and then here the special children
property this is a reserved word we
didn't pass anything as children on our
persons we only pass name and age
children refers to any elements and just
includes plain text as we have it here
between the opening and closing tag of
our component and you could nest complex
HTML code in between - this doesn't have
to be just text could be a unordered
list with multiple list items could be
our react components anything can go
between here and these children are now
output with this syntax of course you
don't have to wrap it in a paragraph you
can't use it anywhere in your JSX code
and after saving this we see my hobbies
racing for menu where as Max and
Stephanie still output the outer content
only because there we don't pass any
children
we inspected we see that an empty
paragraph is rendered though so the
paragraphs there it's just empty because
props children is basically undefined
it's null because we have nothing
between opening and closing tag this is
important to know you can put your
content into your component from outside
not only by passing props like this but
if you want to pass some structured HTML
content also by placing it between the
opening and closing tag and accessing it
with props children
in the last lectures we had a look at
props props simply an object giving us
access to all the attributes we pass to
our own components now sometimes you
don't want to get some information from
outside but you want to have it inside a
component and change it from inside
there too so for example here in our app
JS file let's say we also want to add a
button which if we click it simply
switches one of the names we use here so
where we simply put a caption of switch
name maybe well we'll come to handling
this click event in the next lectures
but first of all we need to define these
names here in a non hard-coded way right
now it's hard-coded into our JSX code
and this is okay here but if we later
want to change it we have to store it in
some variable or something like that
well this actually is a class and a
class has properties this is not just
the case in JavaScript but in other
programming languages too you can kind
of think of a property as a variable of
class so in normal JavaScript code you
would simply write var something equals
some value this doesn't work in a class
there you can simply write something
equals some value so a bit shorter but
in the end the same you could say
there's one special property you can
find in any component which extends
component so you can't do it in person
you can't define properties here anyways
because that's a normal function so here
you would have to use some constants or
some variables still what we're about
you only works in components which are
created by extending component there we
can define a special property named
state where as props are set and passed
from outside like name and age into the
person component state is managed from
inside a component and state is only
available in components which are used
by extending component which is imported
from react it's not available in
function components still you should use
function components as often as possible
because you should use state with care
because having state and all your
components and manipulating it from
anywhere in your app makes your app
quickly unpredictable and hard to manage
especially as it grows of course it
doesn't mean you shouldn't use it at all
though here it makes perfect sense
we initialize it by assigning a value
and this value is a JavaScript object
again this is a reserved word and we
should use it if we want to manage well
some component internal data you should
say so now the state could have some
persons this is totally up to you
I simply create a person's property in
this JavaScript object and this will be
an array and you can set up any kind of
data you want in this state object you
could set up a name property which is
some name you can really manage whatever
you want here I want to manage an array
of persons though now this person's
array again is an array of JavaScript
objects where each object has a name
maybe max and a age maybe 28 a number
here not a string unlike down there what
we do pass a string but a number is fine
for me here I also want to have another
one here named menu and age 29 and a
third one you guessed it for Stephanie
which has a age of 26 now this is my
state we can now access a property like
this and that's not just true for state
but for any property
in our render method by simply
outputting something dynamic with single
quality braces as you learn it and then
the this keyword this refers to the
class due to our es6 syntax we're using
and on our class we have a render method
we could call we shouldn't do that
though react us that but we have a state
property and as I said you can also
define your own properties but State is
a special one as you will learn over the
next lectures so here we can then access
this state and on state my person's
array there may be the first element by
using index 0 and then the name so
instead of hard-coding it i'm now
accessing this property in this object
here in the person's array on the state
property now i'll copy this code here
and replace my age with it q there I of
course want to access the H property and
I'll replicate this for menu but here
it's of course the first element at the
second element with index 1 in this
array and for the age I'll also access
element 1 and of course the H property
and for Stephanie you probably guess
that index 2 and also for the H index 2
and H property with that if we save this
and we go back to the application we see
the button which doesn't do anything and
we see the same output as before this
time using a property the state property
though now I said state would be a
special property thus far we don't use
it in a special way though we can change
this state can be changed and if it
changes and that's the special thing
about it and it only works on that state
property if it changes it will lead
react to re-render our Dom or to update
the Dom I should say so if we change the
name of Max U for example this will lead
- this being rendered and let me prove
it to you by also showing you how to
listen to events like clicking on this
button
in the last lecture we set up state and
I told you that it would be special but
we don't really see that yet or would
you right now has managed our data there
and then accessed it in our JSX code in
the app dot JS file
let's now handle a click on this button
we do this by adding on click now this
is important in normal JavaScript and
normal HTML to be precise it would be on
click with a lowercase C now in JSX and
that is really important it's on click
with a capital C still we then assign as
a value the code you want to execute
upon a click and there we can use curly
braces to execute some dynamic code now
typically you want to execute a function
of your class a so-called method there
and there's a convention to give this a
name like the following switch name
handler maybe now the first part switch
name is totally up to you but you
typically use handler here to indicate
that this is a method you're not
actively calling but you're assigning as
an event handler it's not required you
follow this pattern though you can name
this whatever you want of course it is a
good practice to name it like this
though so switch name handler now should
be a function now if you just said equal
right now it is just the same syntax as
for the state property but if we assign
a function as a value here it becomes a
method basically it does a property you
could say but a property which holds a
function which can be executed here I'll
also use the es6 arrow function keep in
mind this is just a normal function the
end and there I now want to edit my
state well the furbies before we do this
let's see if we can call this
successfully I will say console.log was
clicked so that we can see something in
a console once this was clicked and I
will go to Michael
listener and between Akali braces I can
now run this switch name Handler and
don't add parenthesis don't do this
this would execute it immediately once
react renders this to the dawn because
you execute this function with the
parentheses we only want to pass a
reference and we do this by using this
and then referring to that property
which holds a function important if you
don't use the distant X here basically
where you assign a function to a
property you could say you will run into
errors if you try to use this as we will
soon do in this switch name handler
function because this will then not
refer to the class at runtime simply to
you how to this works in es5 JavaScript
by using this es6 syntax we circumvent
this problem which will become important
later for now important don't add
parentheses here just pass a reference
to this function with that let's save
this file and let's now open the console
in the developer tools and click switch
name and you should see was clicked in
your developer tools here now that's
nice now let's also change the state
we'll do this in the next lecture
in the last lecture we execute a switch
name handler upon a click now we want to
manipulate the state upon the click so
comment out this console log statement
and we could simply do this state
reaching out to this state property here
and as I mentioned this will only work
when using this syntax otherwise this
here will not refer to the class and
will therefore not be able to reach that
state property but here it will work so
this stay persons then maybe access
person 1 and set the name to Maximilian
my full name
let's safe doesn't let's see what
happens if we execute this code we
already get a warning here but let's
ignore it for now and let's click switch
name nothing changes we still see max
here well as I said we do get a warning
about this we shouldn't mutate which
means change the state directly like
this react will not recognize that and
will not pick up this change so don't do
this instead use a special method react
gives you you also access this with this
and then it's set state we haven't
defined this method but remember that we
extend component and this is made
available by the react library and the
component object happens to have a set
state method this is a method which
allows us to update this special state
property here and it will then ensure
that react gets to know about this
update and updates the Dom set state
takes an object as an argument and it
will merge whatever we define here with
our existing state so if I here said
persons queue an updated array it will
merge this with existing data so if we
had some other state here which is some
our value then this would not get
touched even if we only update persons
not clear what I mean let me show you
I'm copying persons and I basically
adding this as a property in the object
I'm about to use as my update here so
I'm saying this set state and set state
takes this new object where I update my
purses where I only change the first
person or maybe also let's change
Stephanie let's change their age her age
to 27 now what will do what react will
do for us is it will look at our state
and see which part of it were overriding
we're changing persons it will not
discard our state but it will simply
merge the old state with the new one
will overwrite persons since we clearly
define a new version of persons here but
we'll leave our state untouched because
we're not saying anything about it here
and it will not discard it which of
course is a good thing you don't want to
have to update everything about your
state whenever you want to change only a
tiny piece about it so with that let's
now see what happens if we save this
file if we save it now and reload the
app and I click switch name watch Max
and watch 26 years old down there you
see that it's Maximilian and 27 years
now the dom was updated because react
recognized that the state of our
application changes and this really is a
special thing there are many things
which lead react to update the Dom
they're actually only our to changing
state and what else you could already
see it in action props we change state
that's nice but keep in mind what we
actually output for each person is
defined in this person component and
there we don't use state and as I said
we can't use it there because this uses
this function syntax here we use props
and that's the our thing react watches
out for
if state changes or props changes it
basically analyzes the code it already
rendered to the DOM and the code it
would now render if it were to re-render
everything and then it updates the
existing Dom in all the places where it
needs to update it to reflect your new
state and props new state in app KS new
props in person Jas
in the last lectures we learned a lot
about state and props we learned that
these are the only two things which lead
react to update your Dom if something
changed now I also mentioned that when
creating a component as a function as we
do for person we can't use state in
there because it's just a function where
we returns I'm JSX code granted we could
run our code before doing that and you
often do that if you need to transform
your props first or something like that
but you can't set up a state property
here you can't call this set state
because it's no class extending
component the set state method is not
known and we don't have methods anyways
it's no class it's a function and still
I mentioned that you should use this
function form of components as often as
possible and then we'll emphasize it
here one more time why is this so
important because these simple
components which are just functions
receiving props are very clear about
what they do they only render something
to the Dom they are dynamic because of
props and you can add some additional
logic prior to calling return but and
that's super important they don't
manipulate your application state as
your application grows you will see that
this is not so unimportant this is
actually really important most parts of
your application shouldn't change the
application state they should just
render something to the Dom dynamic yes
but they shouldn't allow you to change
your application state your application
state should only be changed and handled
in a few selected components also
referred to as containers
yep J's would be such a container that's
just in our name it is a component but
we refer to it as container because it
contains some part of our application
state in our demo application actually
all of the application state here we can
change something about our app and with
then we passed these changes down to for
example the person component but that's
it the change happens in app KS and once
we start building the course project you
will see me use this pattern I will have
a few components where the state
actually lives and gets changed and a
lot of components which take some inputs
and then just render something into the
screen but which won't directly
manipulate the state still you might
have cases where maybe you also want to
listen to an event in the person
component or in any other component now
of course you could turn this into a
component which extends component so
that you can define methods which you
execute but maybe you want to listen to
an event here but execute some method in
app j/s so that you can keep that
pattern of changing the name in app yes
but actually listening to the event in
the naaru component let's have a look at
how we can handle this and change the
state from a novel component in the next
lecture
so let's say we want to call the switch
name handler which I recognized all
changes th so maybe the name wasn't
chosen perfectly let's say we want to
call that not when clicking this button
here or not only when clicking this
button but also let's say when clicking
any paragraph here the paragraph which
contain contains name and age inside a
person component now for dad in the
person component we could add on click
but now what we can't call that handler
method it's in a different file in a
different class well we can actually
pass a reference to this handler as a
property to our component and this is no
fancy heck this is actually a very
common pattern
I will first of all restructure this
over multiple lines for all these
components so that we have an easier
time seeing which properties were
passing and then let's say I don't even
want to pass this for all the components
but only for this usage off it so here I
will add a new property which I'll name
click and the name is totally up to you
here I will pass a reference to this
switch name handler so basically what I
also did here this switch name handler
on the click on the button here I'm
passing it as a reference to this click
property and now we can use this click
property in person Jas there I now can
simply call props click because click is
the name of the property I define here
and this will execute this function
which I pass as a reference so if we
save all the files fjs in person chairs
we should see that in our application we
can of course still click this button to
change the name of Maximillian and the
age of Stephanie but if they reload
again we can also click this paragraph
with menu here you also see it changed
the name and the years
this is something important to
understand an important pattern you can
pass methods also as props so that you
can call a method which might change the
state in another component which doesn't
have direct access to the state and
which shouldn't have direct access to
the state it's a common pattern and it's
important to know you can pass down
click handlers which allow you to change
data in the parent component in the app
component in this case for the person
component maybe we also want to pass a
value to our function maybe here's which
name handler should receive the new name
so that here where I hard-coded
Maximillian as the new name I actually
set name equal to new name now how do we
pass that data there are two ways of
doing that the first is that you call
bind here you may simply bind this this
controls what this inside the function
will refer to and by binding it to this
here outside of the function we're
binding it to the class might look
strange but as a typical way of handling
that this issue in JavaScript we
wouldn't have need to do that though but
we can use this syntax because I also
want to pass a second argument to bind
this now is a list of arguments actually
which will be passed into our function
and here this should be the new name so
here it does could be a Maximilian and
to really see a difference let's copy
that bind code and that's also find it
down here when we pass the function as a
reference to the click prop and let's
change this to max with an exclamation
mark here so that we can see a
difference depending on where we clicked
if we now save this with bind added and
this received as an argument of the
switch name handler let's see what
happens if I click switch name I'm still
changing it to Maximilian here which
makes sense because this is what I
found two but that it works conference
that it works with receiving an argument
and never click on the I menu paragraph
you see that it changed you max with an
exclamation mark so this is a way of
passing an argument it's not the only
way though I will leave one of the two
code snippets here with bind to show you
how this works I'll also show you an
alternative syntax though so a leave
point here will be passive as props but
we could use this new syntax I'm showing
you now also down there this new syntax
looks different here on on click I
actually execute a arrow function which
takes no arguments though theoretically
it would receive an event object by the
way but I won't use that here and then
simply as a function body returns this
function call now here are a couple of
things you have to understand first of
all when using an arrow function this
implicitly adds a return keyword in
front of the code which comes directly
after the arrow if it's all written in
one line the alternative is to wrap
those in curly braces and write a normal
function body so this gets returned and
what I return is a function call this is
why I added the parenthesis now in an
earlier lecture I said that you
shouldn't call this and that was true
but here this is not getting executed
immediately instead what we pass here is
an anonymous function which will be
executed on a click and which then
returns the result of this function
getting executed which of course simply
leads to dysfunction getting executed
this is useful because now here we can
easily pass our data maximally and we
have two exclamation marks maybe if I
now save this and I click switch name we
see Maximilian with two exclamation
marks now this is a very convenient
syntax but it can be inefficient
react can rerender certain things in
your app
you often so I don't necessarily
recommend using this if you don't have
to use the bind syntax instead if you
can still I'll leave it here you may use
it and depending on the size of your
application you also might not feel that
big of a performance hit but be aware
that this can be inefficient
we covered a lot and we changed a lot of
names here but what if we actually want
to change the name on our own so let's
say that in the person component here we
actually also have another element a
normal input element which is of type
text and that's it should be self
closing now whenever we type something
there we want to use what we type here
as a new name now for that we can listen
to a special event on change on change
will be fired whenever the value in this
input changes and here I then want to
execute some method which I need to pass
down from my app JS file we got that
switch name Handler and I will leave it
as it is and instead add a new handler
I'll name it name changed handler I
expect to get an event object here we
haven't used that before but in there I
still want to change the state now of
course theoretically you would want to
change the state or the name of the
person for which we type this this is
something we'll do later in the course
once we learned how to correctly render
a list of dynamic elements so for now I
will always change the name of menu here
so max will stay Max and man and
Stephanie should keep our age of 26
maybe even
but man you should change its name no
matter in which instance of this person
component I type again this is something
we will fix later so here I will get an
event and as you might know for
JavaScript events this event probably
has a target the target doesn't make for
a good name value though but the target
should be the input into which we typed
so it should actually also have a value
property which is to value
user entered and therefore this now
makes for a good updated value for name
so event target value is what I want to
sign as a new name for manual again for
the time being no matter into which
input of which component I typed name
changed handler is my handler now I need
to pass this cue a component to be able
to access it from there
and since I only can change menu I will
only pass it to the man you person that
we could pass it to any other of course
here I will simply name this changed and
pass this name changed handler following
the same logic as for the click event
inside the person I can now access this
changed property and simply call props
changed here or not call it don't add
parenthesis but simply pass the
reference to it and keep in mind this
refers to the method we declared in fjs
this name changed handler the event
object will actually be passed to it
automatically by react like a normal
JavaScript where you're also by default
get access to the event object with that
let's save this and let's see what
happens we got inputs below all
components but for most of them nothing
happens if i type in them for a man you
though you see with every keystroke the
name updates manual whatever i want to
type there this is because we bound on
change queue this prop changed which
holds a reference to the name changed
handler and we then use this default
event object to extract the target which
is the input element and then the value
of the target which is what we entered
this shows is actually two things how we
can dynamically update something
dynamically call an event and use the
things we learned before like passing
down event references or method
references I should say but it all just
shows us how we can handle inputs now it
would also be nice
if we would see the current value of the
name in the input right from the start
so we basically want to set up two-way
binding when we change it we want to
propagate that change so that we can
update the state but we also want to see
the current state right from the start
to do this I can set value equal to
props name this is the name after all
and now we have our own two-way binding
setup we listen to changes call the
changed method in the end which refers
to the name changed handler which UPS
updates the state and we pass down the
state to the person with name and age
and we output the name as the value of
the input this now allows us to show
that value right from the start and here
I actually get a warning this warning
theoretically makes sense because if you
provide a value prop without an on
change handler here you actually run
into problems because you're binding the
value to your property without allowing
yourself to react to changes hence you
would lock your input down I can show it
as if I remove on change now you'll see
we still see the values but if I type
there nothing happens I can't type
because we're not handling changes so we
always override whatever we try to type
with the existing name prop if I
reintroduce on change though the error
stays here which is simply a false alarm
as you can clearly see I can type
because I am hand able to handle my
changes update my state update my props
and hence reflect my changes in the
input here q so we got a working two-way
binding and we're able to change that
name dynamically now again keep in mind
only for manual because we haven't set
up the logic for the AB or inputs hence
we can't type there because we can't
update these names there and that is
probably why it's complaining here for
these other inputs for now we can ignore
this though
we will improve this once we have a
better way of dynamically rendering a
list of elements
we already learned a lot about the react
basics over the last lectures our
application still can use some extra
styling I'd say though for example these
person components would be nice if they
would look like cards and therefore be
more like closed objects right now we
can't really see the differences or we
can't really see the borders between
this component and dÃ®ablÃ¸ components so
styling components is obviously
something super important and right now
there are two ways of styling we can
implement I will show you both
first of all let's add a person dot CSS
file to our person component and I gave
this file the same name as the
JavaScript file just with a different
extension of course theoretically that
file name is up to you now one important
thing which ever CSS code I write in
here is not scoped to this person dot
J's component it is global CSS code so I
want to find a new CSS class which I
named person with a capital P still I
could add this anywhere in my
application since it is global but by
using my component name I can rule out
the danger of and accidentally using it
somewhere else so I will simply assign
it to my death here class name keep in
mind not class class name is person a
string person now down there in the CSS
file I can now change the styling maybe
give it a width of 60% and a margin of
auto to Center it maybe also give it a
border of one pixel solid EEE a light
gray and a box shadow of zero two pixels
three pixels and a slightly darker gray
and let's give it a padding of sixteen
pixels maybe finally let's set text
align to center to center all the text
if I now saved a CSS file and save the
person
J's file where I assign it as a class
nothing happens
do you know why well because we created
our CSS class here in the CSS file but
by default and this is maybe something
you didn't know because it's not
necessarily intuitive but by default no
file is included into your project into
you the code which gets created by that
build workflow
you always have to import files to add
them to the game so we import the person
component in our app J's file and we
also import the app CSS file here now it
might look strange to import a CSS file
into a JavaScript file like this but
thanks to web pack which is the build
tool which is in the end used by this
react scripts package were using
implicitly here thanks to web pack we
can actually import CSS into JavaScript
though it will not really merge the two
files or anything like that it is just
made aware of that CSS file and will
handle that differently will basically
import it into our HTML file so in
person GIS I will also add an import to
dot slash person CSS and here you need
the file extension you can only omit it
for JavaScript files now with that you
added this you made web pack aware of it
it will now add it to your HTML file and
hence if you now go back you see we have
this extra styling on our components you
can also see that if you inspect your
code we have the person class here and
if you scroll all the way up to the head
section here in the developer tools you
see that there we actually have these
style tags which you can't find in the
HTML file in the public folder there we
got no style tags in the head section
just some links to the manifest and so
on so not even two CSS files the reason
for this is that these style tags are
injected dynamically by web pack
this is the part I meant with it manages
the imports you add and this last style
tag here should actually hold your
person class and there you can also
clearly see it's a normal global CSS
class you also see that automatic
prefixing though which is very
convenient because it makes sure that we
don't have to do that we can write the
shortest CSS code possible or need it
and it will automatically prefix it to
work and as many browsers as possible so
this is the style we set up let's maybe
fine-tune it a bit more by adding a top
and bottom margin here so let's maybe
set this to 16 pixels so that we have
some separation between our cards looks
much better now we got the person's here
now let's also style it button and let's
style it differently because I mentioned
that there are two ways of styling we
know right now at least
in the last lecture I mentioned that we
have different ways of styling the
application let's style this button
differently in the apt of JS file which
is where we have that button I want you
style this button with something which
is called inline Styles there is nothing
wrong with using CSS files and classes
and just might even be the preferred way
but what you also often see in react
apps is that you actually design your
Styles in JavaScript how does this work
let's go into the render function and
create a new constant which we'll name
style the name is up to you this is a
JavaScript object and as you might be
aware these CSS style properties have
JavaScript representations for example
background color camel case instead of a
- because background color like this
would be an invalid JavaScript property
name you could wrap it in quotation
marks to use it though I'll use the
camel case representation though and
then I assign a value which is a string
which can be a color for example white
we can also set the font to inherit to
use our surrounding font we can also set
a border border color just a border of
one pixel solid and then maybe blue and
we could also add some padding maybe
eight pixels make sure to wrap all these
values in quotation marks because we are
writing JavaScript here this have to be
strings now I can go to the button put
on click into a new line to make this a
bit easier to read and add a style
property this is actually the normal
style attribute made available by JSX
and style as you can already see should
receive a dynamic value here all of
simply pass style here referring to this
style constant we're just defining the
render method of which this return
expression here is part so I can't just
use style like this it's not
property it's a normal variable or
actually since we never change it
constant of this render method let's see
if this has any effect if we save this
we indeed see the button looks different
now we can improve this a bit more by
first of all fixing this error and have
one pixel of a border so that this style
gets applied to you and setting the
cursor to pointer so that we get this
point recurrence or when hovering over
it right now let's say if this we see
that blue border and we see that cursor
again now it doesn't change upon
hovering and actually styling that hover
effect is pretty hard when using inline
styles this is one restriction already
but I got a hold module in this course
where I show you some clever solutions
to styling react components which really
can be something you can put a lot of
thought into it always be aware you can
use a CSS file though then the styles to
find here are global so if we change
button here all the buttons in our whole
app will be changed so this might not be
what you want but on the other hand you
can use the normal CSS syntax or you use
inline styles as you do here then the
styling is scoped to the component or to
the element you actually added to but
you have some restrictions of not being
able to leverage the full power of CSS
as I mentioned I'll have a full module
about this because there is a golden way
in the middle where you can scope styles
and still use all the CSS features more
about this later for now be aware that
we got these two different ways of
styling at the moment use inline Styles
as we do here whenever you want to scope
the style and make sure it only applies
to this single element and to non our
element in your app or even in the same
component
so you made it through the entire video
and I hope you had a good impression of
both the course and react and I hope you
learned a lot about react because even
though this is only a sneak peek some
import the aspects of react were already
covered would be awesome to welcome you
in the unity course but if you already
got everything you would eat well that's
great I hope you still stick around and
I see you in future videos here on
YouTube II I wish just a great day bye
