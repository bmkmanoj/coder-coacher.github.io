tutorial today I will start a chapter on
foot printing so I have explained what
the act of foot printing is before but
now we will actually go ahead and
conduct a few scans to see how it all
works and introduce you to the tools
that we will be using so first off we
need to find ourselves a target to scan
of course I could just scan myself for
something of a kind but that would not
be a realistic thing really because I
already know what I already know what
the results are going to be and plus on
top of that I'm not scanning long range
over the internet or something of a kind
I would be scanning within my own local
network so it the speeds of the scan
would not be realistic as it would be a
lot faster than for then say when you
conduct the scan over the net some
distant and remote server so what I did
was I went online and you can do the
same and I found on the official end map
on the official nmap website they have a
section devoted to actually allowing
people to scan them to test their tool
out now here is the I am selecting the
permission you there is a written
permission here that you can actually
scan this website and they basically say
I mean you can scan it to test it out a
few scans a day here is fine but do not
scan a hundred times a day or use this
to test your SSH brute force password
cracking tools etc so that's definitely
something you don't want to do but you
can run a few scans on this site per day
and according to them that's perfectly
fine it's you are not breaking any laws
or anything of a kind I'm just
emphasizing one more time that you do
have a written permission right here on
the site which is fantastic because it
gives us an opportunity to actually
simulate real time circumstances and see
how an map behaves now nmap is a
unescapable tool of pretty much any pen
tester out there
many people say today well that it's
pointless to
Sport scan doesn't do you much good and
so on and so forth well perhaps in terms
of exploiting the services running on
the poor stem cells it doesn't do you
that much good but just by seeing which
ports are open and which ports are
closed you can to a fairly good extent
determine what operating system or what
platform is being used on the other side
and then you can find weaknesses of that
same platform of course there are some
other ways in doing this I will show
them to you like banner grabbing or
something of a kind but let's just see
how nmap really works now nmap is known
to basically trigger quite a quite a lot
of alarms quite a lot of firewall red
flags so to say and you want to make
sure that your nmap scans are as quiet
as possible now there are tools to
actually figure this one to actually
figure this out but I will show you here
how to actually do it via terminal there
is also something called Zen map now Zen
map is basically a graphical user
interface of an map but we will not be
using that rather instead I want to
teach you how to use a terminal version
so an map is the one most commonly used
and it is always used in the terminal
text format rarely anybody uses the
actual graphical user interface in the
previous chapter we have also discussed
how to stay anonymous
so at the end of the chapter I will be
combining these things scan footprinting
the act of scanning and and non amaizing
your scans however you might think about
that before you get to the final
tutorial of this chapter and perhaps try
to do it yourselves it doesn't matter if
you fail or something all kind truly
doesn't what is important is that you
give it a shot and you try it once
okay failure find no problems try twice
thrice the four time you're bound to
have some sort of results as long as you
keep improving yourselves it's fine
in any case without further ado I'd you
let's just type in let's just mean just
an map and map - - help
oops I mistyped that of course
and map press enter and there we go
there are a lot of options here I mean a
ton load of options way more options
than we actually need for some sort of
basic things however eventually over
time you will come to understand that
all of these options are not here for
nothing they are here because they are
they were needed at some point of time
and they are pretty much all still used
so what you need to do is scroll down to
the bottom and here you have examples of
how and map runs so you type in and map
- we almost always 99% of times and 99%
of time is verbose output this basically
you're telling your system to give you
more information in regards to what it
is doing - a I'm not sure where this
function is okay here it is - a enable
OS detection version detection script
scanning and traceroute don't think
we're gonna need that immediately there
is one there is - Oh function which is
just for OS detection anyway and then
you can pass either this one UC scan me
and map org which is basically the
domain name which will get resolved to
an IP address or you can actually pass
it an IP address and if you're wondering
what this is this is a mask and it would
be very difficult to explain in great
detail what this is but for the time
being know that this is actually an IP
address range so it goes from a certain
IP address to a certain IP address
because this goes way internetworking
and binary numbers and so on and so
forth but you do not actually need to
use this format not that many people
actually use this particular format with
the mask they just tend to specify very
specific ranges because they don't have
they usually don't have the permissions
to scan the entire subnet rather instead
they have to what they have to create
lists and then skip certain IP addresses
and then continue again from a certain
point so you do need they do need to
create lists
and that can be a problem now up here
you at the top you have another very
important option that's gonna come in
handy you have - I L input file name so
you can actually create a list or in a
file a list of IP addresses and then you
can scan those particular IP addresses
there is also and they will also have an
ability to do this look at what's what's
written here so just take a look at this
segment and its 10th 0 and then this
segment here this octet here it's 0 to
255 and then the last octet is 1 to 255
if you're wondering why I'm calling
these these things octet it's because
they have because they have 8 bits each
one of these has 8 bits and it is
represented in a binary form so it can
have 8 zeros or I don't know 8 ones or
combination of ones and zeros but it has
8 bits so 8 positions that's why you're
called octet this is a very common form
that people tend to use and this is what
you will find yourselves using I did
this this would be a message which will
specify the IP addresses or you will be
passing files so these files usually
people well they either make them make
them themselves or they can find these
IP addresses on the internet so in a
different to this site and map org
you also have this one here major IP
blocks let me just see if I've typed in
that correctly and this is a fan tip
there it is
ok so this is a fantastic website the
entire range of pretty much all the IP
addresses are listed here
and it also says who owns what it
doesn't say for every one of them who
owns which one but for example you can
search and find and it's going to
you the the appropriate IP addresses for
that particular country and it's gonna
give you the owner of those IP addresses
usually it's just telecoms but you also
have other people who own them as well
so just give it a shot
search I don't know let's just type in
Germany or I don't know friends whatever
okay this is not the first search but no
that's not a problem actually you can
find it down here and I'm not gonna type
it in here where I could control left
France there we go down here just saving
myself a bit of time there and there we
go so you have a range this is a given
range here it's from 2 0 0 0 to 215 255
255 this is a massive range this is the
humongous range look at how many this is
how many IP addresses you can have in
total how many of them you can generate
within this range
it's quite a lot it's French Telecom I
don't know for some reason they need it
so you can sort them out by the owner
and you can see that a lot of them are
actually not listed here
Wow France has like a lot of IP
addresses assigned to it
they're not free they cost money we'll
just go ahead and see down down below
where is it where is it ok so you see
all of these IP addresses and this is a
pretty massive range so this is a
telecom in French in France sorry elf in
French in France look at how many IP
addresses IP addresses range is that
they have so that's quite a lot and this
site as I said previously we can use to
figure out which IP address range do you
wish to scan but you usually do not have
the permission to scan the entire range
you can scan certain IP addresses within
that range for which you have a
permission but also a very nice site to
determine where the IP address is from
or something like that however always
remember once you get the Nyepi address
your search engines
Danette are your best friends this is
one of major tech major I mean major
components of footprinting you can do
the following you can type in who space
is and then type in an IP address I
don't know I'm just gonna type in this
random IP address so if you don't want
to see it here you can have a look at it
here opes
who is and I don't know somebody's gonna
tell me who this guy is or whom is this
there we go so I've typed in who is and
I've picked the first website out that I
could find and here I have all the
information in regards to that
particular IP address I have a country I
have I have the username of the admin I
suppose have the status remarks source
even have a yep there we go there's
actually an address a physical address
of the IP address which is ridiculous
yeah so as I said search engines are
your best and I mean absolutely best
friends if you want to find pretty much
anything on the net or something like
that in regards to an IP address to do
any sort of research so those are the
two tools that I have showed you
actually three of them well one two or
two websites that you can the one to one
website and one search method which you
can use in order to determine where the
IP address is from or who is using it
and even to determine its physical
location although its physical location
can be assigned to a telecom and that
telecom can assign it to a city and to
to a specific region in the city or
something of a kind and then you can
find it on google map on Google Earth or
something of a kind but usually those
things are not that precise what is
precise however is that the IP address
belongs to a telecom or something or a
kind and they keep rotating them in
between the cities so if you have let's
say a hundred thousand IP addresses that
you scanned and if you wish to sort them
out by the city you will get like
seventy to ninety percent
see depending on which for which country
did you do it can be problematic because
you're gonna miss out on some things but
if you don't think the one hundred
percent accuracy you can get your
sorting done pretty well there are
databases which you can update I will
show you these things it's due oh it's
they're called geoip lookups but before
we do that you also have something
called NS look up up and let's look up
and I'm just gonna use this generic name
here scan me dot n map dot org let's
paste it and there we go I have
basically said I want I want to look up
this I want to look up files on scan me
dot and mapped org and okay this is my
DNS server which is basically my router
you see it says port 53 you know
immediately that it's a you know
immediately that's DNS because all DNS
traffic runs on port 53 and then we have
the results so that this is the domain
name and you get the IP address down
below so this is also one of the ways in
which we can get the IP address offered
the mate of a site with a domain because
once you know that the main you don't
actually know the IP address and feel
you look it up or something like that
but there's a far simpler method you
don't need to use and this lookup I'll
go by the way and let's look up what
also works in Reverse so just type in NS
lookup and you can type in the IP
address so just go ahead and press Enter
okay so this has run through a process
of some sort down below these are
authoritative answers from the says name
servers basically what that means there
are DNS servers and they are giving you
responses and telling you to whom the
domain belongs to and so on and so forth
but look ignore this part and for the
time being we can also ignore this part
until we get into DNS into into spoofing
the DNS and changing it and so on and so
forth what I wanted to show you here is
that you can actually get a domain name
by typing in MS lookup and then the IP
address and here where it says non
Ettore
give answer you get the IP address and
then you get the name which is the
domain name however you might notice
that there was a problem here that this
IP address does not match this one well
guess what it actually does try looking
at in Reverse so it's 74 74 here 207 207
here 2 4 4 2 4 4 here and 2 2 1 here and
2 2 1 here so when you do an NS lookup
and when you pass in an IP address it's
gonna do a reverse lookup in the DNS MX
records or something of a kind and it's
gonna it's gonna query the DNS servers
and the DNS servers are gonna give it a
response but in DMX records this is
basically how things are written you
write an IP address in Reverse and then
you put this in - a DDR dot R pop but
this part really is not that interesting
to us this is more interesting to server
admins who configure the DNS servers or
something of a kind in any case for the
time being but don't worry we will get
to DNS DNS servers in the later stages
of this tutorial once we are done with
these things in any case what is
important for you here is you've typed
in an IP address you've used the tool
called nslookup and you have gotten a
domain name in return and now you can
start doing some other things as well
but we will be dealing primarily with
nmap nmap is a tool in order to scan
that works and to retrieve information
from them but this what I've showed you
now is some basic information retrieval
and some basic external sources that you
can use in any case I'll see you in the
second tour in this in part two or the
second tutorial of nmap introduction and
there we're gonna actually conduct some
scans and see how it all works thank you
for watching and I hope to see you next
time hello everybody and welcome to this
tutorial today I will do some actual
scanning and for that I have picked a
domain outside of my local area network
you can find this on the nmap official
site so it's can me dead map org this
domain they have given and you you can
feel free to scan it well not as much as
you wish because you know a hundred
times a day it's not okay but a couple
of times a day is okay and you can test
out how whether your n map works and how
it works so I need to take this domain
you cannot use control C or control V in
the terminal primarily because control C
is the universal interrupt and control
we will simply not work you will need to
use a mouse and manually do it in any
case we need to trim this down we don't
need any of these things we just wanted
the main name to remain and now I'm
gonna go ahead and type in n map space
and there we go we're gonna now scan
this domain however if I just press
ENTER like this mmm it's gonna it's
gonna conduct some scanning it will do
the job I assure you but it will give us
no output of whatsoever so this will be
continuously empty until the scan is
actually complete now on short scan such
as these that's probably okay but if
you're conducting a scan that can last
up to a day or something of a kind it's
pretty worrying to see that there is
nothing here I mean you're not sure
whether it's working with is it bugged
or what not there that's that's why it's
always better to pass a V option for
verbose output I have a preference to
pass a double V option for extra verbose
output pretty much so it tells me pretty
much everything that it is doing and how
it is functioning and I can see it as it
goes on and I can see that some ports
are open a little bit earlier prior to
the prior to the completion of this cat
I'll just go ahead and start the scan
and you can see immediately before it
finished the scan it has told me that
the port 22 and that port 80 are open
now by default and map will scan for one
thousand ports you can tell it to scan
for more ports no problems you can tell
it to scan for the maximum range of
ports it's 65,000 something I'm not
exactly sure what the number is but it's
65,000 something
and you can find this on the net if you
wish you can specify you can pass an
option to nmap to do a full port scan so
all of the ports will be scan although
rarely anybody does that it's
time-consuming usually you have an idea
what sort of services you want to target
and then you scan for those for the
ports on which those services are likely
to run for example port 22 that would be
SSH and port 25 that's SMTP if you don't
know what that is it's a mail server a
DHT TP and you have a ping gecko as well
on port 9 9 to 9 and now these the
states of these ports are rather clear
so it's open open open and you can also
get a state to close it because it says
here not shown 996 boards closed they
are closed and when it says filtered
well usually there's a firewall setting
which is dropping the packets it's not
closing the port perhaps but it's
definitely doing something to the
packets coming on that port it's fill
it's perhaps blocking them from a
certain IP or something of a kind there
can be a lot of options here in any case
the general meaning of this filtered
flag here is that the end map cannot
determine where the port is open or
closed usually we want to stay away from
those ports or you can do some extra
research and find out how you can access
them maybe they require a particular app
or a particular protocol or something of
a kind to be accessed and that's why
nmap cannot actually figure pretty much
anything out of it that can be a bit
problematic I would definitely as I said
advised to stay away from them stick to
the open ones and see what you can do
with the open ports here now nmap also
has a option to create Grifball output
basically what that means is that you
can sort whatever this whatever you get
whatever result you get into a file you
can store it and sort it as well and
then what you what you gain you gain an
ability to actually extract
pretty much separate bits and pieces of
information for example you just want
the IP addresses of hosts that are up or
you want the IP addresses of hosts that
have 422 open were filtered or that are
running a certain service like SSH or
SMTP or HTTP or something of a kind
however I won't be doing that from for
scan me nothin ma'am org
I believe I haven't I have used your
system enough and for this for this
example I require a range of IP
addresses to to give you a meaningful
result so what I'm going to do is scan
my local subnet and if you don't know
what yours is well it's most it's most
likely configured as mine is but if it's
not just type in let's just clear the
screen first type in ifconfig and you
will get a result here for eth0
or for whatever interface you are using
just take a look at this IP address that
has been assigned to this interface so
the lowest and the maximum value of the
final octet here or the first sorry the
first octet here will be the range of
your local subnet so from 0 to 255 let
me just show you how that looks like in
case you did not understand here type in
nmap and then for a graphical output we
need Oh G space - and then we need to
give it a range of IP addresses so
192.168.1.0 - 255 so it's gonna scan for
all the IP addresses that have this and
that go from 0 to 255 now keep in mind
that I can customize the strange anyway
I want for example here where it says 1
I can type in - 267 so it's gonna it's
gonna use DS it's gonna use this octet
and this octet in combination and it's
gonna scan for all possibilities
although that might take a lot of time
because that's a lot of IP addresses
anyway I'm not just done yet
what I need to do is actually cause a
reader
so before I caused the redirect I'm just
gonna give it a double verbosity mode
and why am i redirecting my standard
output well I don't want all the
information to just be printed out on
the screen on the terminal screen where
eventually it will be lost pretty much
as soon as I close the terminal or as
soon as enough commands are passed that
the cache needs to be rewritten for the
terminal or something of a kind
furthermore if it's written out and
standard output and on the terminal
itself I can't do anything else with it
I cannot manipulate it it's not a file
that I can take or something of a kind
rather instead it's just standard output
what I want to do is cause a redirect
with a greater than sign into some sort
of file so I'm just gonna go ahead and
type in home and I don't know I can
maybe not home well not even not desktop
that's not a good idea let's just leave
it at home that's better and I'm gonna
name this file a scan excellent so all
the results that nmap gathers now will
be read will be stored into this file
here well into this file here with the
path and this is the path to the file
though since I have passed a good amount
of hosts here I mean I've given a 255
hosts because I'm in land it's gonna go
faster but you when you're doing this
over the Internet a very good idea is to
pass a port or at least a port range
don't let it scan or 1,000 ports or even
worse do not specify that it should scan
a full port range primarily because
regardless of what sort of internet
connection you have it will take a good
amount of time to finish furthermore I
mean you're bound to trigger some red
flags or something of a kind so you
should define a port here in order to
save yourself a lot of time and I mean
generally you will know which service
you want to attack you will have some
sort of an idea there I'm gonna go ahead
and pass port 22 that is the port that I
wish to scan
or and press ENTER and hope to god that
it works there we go it is functioning
but even it's it finished rather fast
but even though I pass the tumble
verbosity mode everything here is being
redirected here so I will see nothing
if this scan takes longer when you're
doing it over the Internet and it will
take longer if you're doing it over the
Internet
don't think immediately that something
is bugged primarily because nothing is
being written down below if we just
changed home and list what is there
there we go we have the scan so let's
just do this
Ellis now look what I'm doing here I'm
gonna do a very similar thing with our
scan file and I'm gonna type in your
grep scan press enter there we go
I have now real I have passed the LS
command to list pretty much everything
within the home directory and then I
have passed it I have piped the output
of LS to grep basically pipe means just
pass it I've passed the output to grep
and what grep does is basically pool
whatever you specify here it just pulls
it from the output I've I've told it to
pull whatever is in there that has a
name scan or that has a string scan
within it so I could have had a name
like AAA scan BBB it would still pull it
no problems this is one of the ways in
which we can make sure that the file is
located within a certain folder
especially because especially in
situations where you have hundreds of
files in a single folder and you just
can't go through them or manually use a
grep if you know the name or if you know
a partial name in order to figure out
what is where so just go ahead and clear
the screen and let me just show you what
is located within our scan file so less
scan press Enter and there we go so we
have pretty much all the hosts within my
LAN network within my local subnet
they're all down of course because I
don't have 255 computers or devices
within my home network rather instead
you see what it has found it has found
this is the router IP the router that
I'm using for this for this test and it
says port 22 filtered TCP SSH excellent
that one that one has an open port of 22
also the stay it's that it it's status
is up and I also have on 100 status is
up 22 is closed on 102 it's up it's
filtered and so on and so forth
so let me just go ahead and with this
and I'm gonna do a very similar thing
here because I want to leave it on the
screen so I can explain it to you the
less command is very nice but when you
exit it disappears cat however just
prints everything within a file to
standard output and it stays here pretty
much for the rotation of the terminal
the reason why did this will become
apparent quite soon so what you want to
do now is type in cat scan as before and
now we want to pipe the output of scan
to grab in order to pull something out
of here some sort of useful information
let's say that I want to pull all the
hosts that are up I want to fool all
live hosts I want to see their IP
addresses and when I type in grev what
what what is the universal mark asian
for all the hosts that are up well you
have a flag here next status and then
flag up I'll just go ahead and type in
up press Enter
excellent well just to give you a bit of
clarity there we go
you have state you have these flags
which are up so I have all the hosts
here that are currently up and running
that are alive on the network but this
isn't this is not what I want if I
wanted to pass these IP addresses to a
program to another program or something
of a kind I wouldn't be able to pass
this whole line because it would make no
sense if the other program is requesting
only the IP address of the host because
you can do one nmap scan to see just to
see which hosts are alive and then once
you figure it out which hosts are alive
then
can do a more detailed scan on those
particular hosts and in such a way you
would save a lot of time so we have
these hosts here but we want to pull
these IP addresses and I'm afraid I just
can't do that with grep perhaps I even
could but I mean it really would just be
too complicated and too too complex and
it really wouldn't be practical
that is why Linux has something that is
called awk so a wk it's a basically used
for formatting text and pulling out
certain parts of a file that you have
deemed that you need or something of a
kind now you can make a separate
tutorial on awk you can have hundreds of
hours and there would still be features
of it that you would that you would not
know I would strongly advise you to
familiarize yourselves with awk
take a look at the man pages for awk
however for the time being and for the
for the purposes of this tutorial we
will be using some basic or commands
which pretty much everybody uses and
which are a necessary part of pen
testing primarily because you need to do
stuff of a kind that we're gonna do here
so cats can print everything to standard
output
grep up so grab all UPS grep all lines
that contain the word up and then what I
want to do here is eliminate this part
leave this part in and eliminate this
part now how shall I do that well the
first thing that we need to specify is a
field delimiter what the field the
limiter is basically if you say that the
colon that the colon here is a field
delimiter this will be one field this
will be another field and this will be
yet another field so you will have three
fields in total however that that
doesn't really work for us does it goes
if we say that the semi colon is a
delimiter this entire for this entire
section that I've highlighted will be
considered a field and we will have
parenthesis and status the parts that we
don't really want what you can use is a
few
the limiter here is a space so space
here this is one field this is gonna be
another and this is gonna be again a
field the limiter because there's a
space and this will be a third one and
then you have a again space and the
fourth one and so on and so forth so in
order to specify a field the limiters to
be spaced well simply leave an empty an
empty plate an empty space in between
the quotation marks generally you would
put quotation marks and you would
specify a field delimiter in between
them if you wanted to some if you wanted
a colon this is how you would do it but
we don't want the colon we just want to
space and that's it open single
quotation marks open curly brackets type
in print space dollar sign and then you
just need to type in the number of the
field that you would like to print out
so we would like to print out the second
field to close curly brackets close
quotation marks press press ENTER and
there we go we have all the IP addresses
listed of the host that are up without
anything else
now what you can do with this is well
pass it to another file
it's called contains scan - press ENTER
and then you can type an nmap - i el
scan - then you can do a full and map
scan for just for hosts this might take
a bit of don't wanna do it like that we
just give it to top of the post - mode
excellent so now you can do a full scan
for just for hosts instead of doing it
for all 255 hosts just figure out which
posts are alive and you don't need to do
that with port 22 or something of a kind
just do a ping sweep and that's gonna be
yet you will be able to figure out which
hosts are alive perform detailed
analysis of this particular host and you
can see we're all I'm already receiving
information here it says 421 not a on
yeah that's not the best of five years
but this is my
rather than I'm using for these testing
purposes it is filled with holes and I
don't worry about it I'm gonna switch it
as soon as I'm done with the tutorial I
have some I have 443 on 102 so I
probably have some SSL going on there
480 here 423 we will soon see what all
these services mean however you can you
can experience these flags here and
usually you will get them delays because
you know there are some packets that are
being dropped some that are being
refused by the servers on the other side
you can also have time limiters and so
on and so forth so here you can see
scans and what they have revealed thus
far they've given me detailed scans and
they can tell me pretty much everything
that I want to know in regard to the
local area network it even gives out the
MAC addresses which I'm gonna cover up
and you won't be able to see them but in
any case you see how much information do
you get and how much time you can save
now I am gonna call the tutorial here
and we will move on to the next one I
hope that you've enjoyed this one and
I'll see you next time hello everybody
and welcome to this tutorial today I
will show you a little bit more a little
bit more stuff that you can do with nmap
but more importantly than that I will
show you a tool which you can use to
assign a physical location namely a city
to an IP address it's relatively precise
it's relatively good but the downside of
it is that you can only make 1,000
queries per day which is still which is
still very reasonable I mean 1,000
queries per day is a pretty good thing
however if you're doing some sort of
mass scanning or something like that it
won't really help you you will need to
go online and download the libraries for
that but 1000 is a very good number and
let me just show you how it actually
works so here I have a command this is
the
that I've used to scan scam eatin map
org and to get some information from it
so it's curl space IP info dot IO slash
and then you get an IP address here it's
a kernel script doesn't just copy paste
that here and this is the command curl
this is the argument that you are
passing to it along with the IP address
once you press ENTER it queries the
server and there you go you have an IP
and you have a host that you get a
hostname as well you get a city it's
Vermont its region it's California
country u.s. you even get some
coordinates here organization postal
code and so on and so forth so you get
some really useful information here in
regard to an IP address but as I said
the downside is that you can make only
1,000 queries per a day so you're not
doing anything illegal here or anything
of a kind
you are simply querying a database
somewhere in the world to give you
specific information on an IP address
you could have done this by simply
typing on the net who is however I wish
to teach you how to do these things in
the terminal so that you would be less
dependent on the browser or things of a
kind anyway let me just go ahead and
clear this now what I wanted to discuss
with you today are some external
resources which you can use in
combination with n map and map has a
wide variety of scripts that are
applicable to it and then you will be
able to use n map in order to scan for
particular vulnerabilities on the
servers elsewhere in the world so just
go ahead and open up your browser okay
so I have this websites can be no 10 map
org open here and on that website there
is a link it's and map org and then some
link here you can just copy paste this
if you wish or something of a kind just
read through it and then then navigate
over on their website but it's not that
it's not really that hard look I'm here
on an maps website and I have a list of
categories of what sort of scripts can I
run with and map in order to scan
four particular vulnerabilities so I
have some there are 490 scripts which is
a lot so I can for das for denial of
service attacks those sort of
vulnerabilities for exploits for I don't
know external for brute-forcing for
authentication etc anyway let's just go
and click on one of them pretty much any
will do it's not a problem I'm gonna go
ahead and click on Volm some general
general thing and now I have all these
things here so if you're wondering well
how can i bypass firewall rules will
simply use a script that says firewall
- bypass the text for mobility in net
filter and other firewalls that use
helpers to dynamically open port for
protocols such as ftp and sip
so this but this this is gonna help in a
good amount of cases you can go ahead
and let's open it up in a new link and
then you tab sorry and once you click on
it you get the exact syntax how to use
it so example usage it gives you the
exact syntax there is nothing different
that you need to do here instead of
lesser than target greater than sign
just type in the IP address and that's
it literally that is the only thing that
you need to change here just type in
copy paste this command so just copy it
and then just change the last thing into
the IP address that you wish to scan now
I'm not gonna go through all of them as
I said there are 490 scripts we will be
using some of them however in the later
tutorials where you will get some clear
demonstrations once we actually start
attacking particular services and start
exploiting their vulnerabilities however
again I won't go to OH 490 of them
because the the course would be
ridiculously long but you can go there
you can go to the nmap website find this
so look you have security tools security
lists scanners etc there are so
resources here that you can use and I
strongly advise you to go on to this
website and check it out but just take a
look this is probably the most important
part for you and for everybody on this
website is the availability the
availability of these scripts so just
take a look at what they do
and what you can do with them primarily
because you can save yourselves a ton
load of time by just conducting a scan
for certain types of exploits if I click
on exploits it gives me all sorts of
exploits so for example if I'm attacking
a very secure File Transfer Protocol
just read through it it explains in
great detail what it does and if you
click on it it's gonna give you the
exact syntax which you need to use
literally the exact syntax which you
need to use right next to it you just
type in the IP address of whatever host
you want and that's it there are no
changes there is nothing else that you
need to do you just copy paste this and
change the name here anyway I'm just
gonna go and scroll up and then I have
yet another website if I wish to show
you
it's called exploit DB so just type in
exploit DB and the first site that pops
up exploit database by offensive
security click on it this is pretty much
one of the largest databases out there
in regard to vulnerabilities you can
find them all in one place here they are
literally here there are some very nice
wireless tricks that you can do here
reverse shells privilege escalation
pretty much everything we will be using
this site extensively in the follow up
tutorials in other chapters as well but
I just wanted to mention it here
primarily so that you can explore it a
little bit then I strongly do advise you
to do it just go go through the website
for example take a look at the router
that you are using just see what sort of
a router you are using see what sort of
a router was provided to you by the ISP
provider and then go ahead click on
search in the upper right play in the
upper
on the top menu it's and right then
selecting it now so just gonna click on
it once again and search for the
vulnerabilities of your home routers see
what you can do with it
see you can you can look at it by app or
it there is a free text search
description order their platform look at
how many platforms are down there if you
don't know what platform it is just just
try a free search thing type in the name
of your router type that in free search
text and if it's bound to give you some
vulnerabilities because pretty much all
the home routers have more
vulnerabilities than they should so that
is the task that I leave you with I want
you to open up this website exploit
database find the vulnerability of your
router of your home router figure out
which one it is first budget usually we
can do this by just looking at the box
of the router and once you've done that
you can we once you found the
vulnerability there will be a
description how to use it try using it
try exploiting it if it fails and it
probably won't because all you need to
do is copy paste things into the Linux
terminal and we're gonna do a lot and
we're gonna do some demonstrations later
on along the way as we do some more
complex stuff but before we do it I want
you to try it and if you have any
questions post them in the question
section I will be more than happy to not
only answer them but also to help you
through the process as well in terms of
instructing you or something like that
you don't need to pay anything extra for
that I will do it gladly and help you
out but please give it a shot try it
first and then then continue up with the
tutorials see what I do then perhaps you
can fix your technique and improve
yourselves before I leave just one more
time over here you have scripts that you
can use with then map to detect
particular vulnerabilities just click on
it once you click on it you will get the
exact syntax all you need to do is
change the IP address and type in
exploit DB use this website extensively
it is very good there are lots of
vulnerabilities on it pretty much all of
them are located
there it's completely free you don't
need to pay anything for any of the
services that I have mentioned here open
free anybody can access no registration
required and with that I will leave you
today and one more time I will urge you
to try it yourselves and then continue
on with the course where I do it myself
and then you can see the particularity
and the fine details of how it is done I
bid you farewell until next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
