provides a very powerful tool to work
with spring applications and databases
now the usage of the spring JDBC helps
developers avoid a lot of boilerplate
code and automates a lot of mundane
database application development tasks
now you can get a good idea of what this
means specifically by looking at what
the spring folks have to say in this
regard so we're going to go to google
and we're going to do a search here do a
search for spring JDBC introduction okay
and we're going to select this first
link this 19.1 click on that you can see
here the value-add provided by the
Spring Framework JDBC abstraction is
perhaps best shown by the sequence of
actions outlined in the table below and
the table shows what actions spring
would take care of and what actions are
the responsibility of you the
application developer you can see there
that spring is doing a lot of things for
you automatically I don't mean the
connection preparing and executing the
statement setting up the loop to iterate
through the results if any processing
exceptions handling transactions
enclosing the connection the statement
and/or result set so you see from a
developer's point of view you're really
only left to define the connection
parameters to specify the sequel
statement to declare parameters and
provide parameter values and in they're
fine to do the work for each iteration
so basically the Spring Framework here
is taking care of all the low-level
details that can make the JDBC API such
a tedious API to develop with so
hopefully now getting an understanding
of the power and convenience that the
spring JDBC gives us by taking away a
lot of the mundane tasks we left us
developers to focus more on the core
business logic
let's talk about the spring JDBC
template so the spring JDBC template is
a powerful mechanism to connect to a
database and execute sequel queries now
internally the JDBC template framework
uses the JDBC API in dpi stands for
application programming interface and it
eliminates a lot of the problems
typically associated with using the raw
dated BC API directly now with the JDBC
template we don't need to create and
manage boilerplate code like creating
connections closing result sets and
interconnections
no exception handling becomes a lot
easier using the JDBC template now
whenever an exception is strollin during
the JDBC code execution they're actually
translated to exceptions to find in the
org that Spring Framework dot Dao
package so hits an application using the
spring JDBC doesn't need to implement a
JDBC directly or any specific DBMS
related error handling
now joanie bc exceptions are caught and
translated into a more informative an
expressive exception hierarchy and you
can find out more by checking at the org
dot spring framework dao package for
specifics but you'll be seeing how to
use that as we go through the course as
well
now the spring JDBC also hides
connection pooling in transaction
management related issues from the
database application code and if you
don't know our connection pool is a case
of database connections maintained so
that the connections can be reused when
future requests to the database are
required among the benefits of using
connection pools is a dramatic increase
in performance of your database
application
and there is some sample code that shows
the usage of the spring JDBC template
the notice the brevity of the code
especially when you compare this with
traditional plain JDBC code if you've
used that in the past to create generic
JDBC code not in particular the private
field JDBC template declaration and also
the list organizations method I'm sure
you would agree that is quite concise
so the spring framework provides
template api's that to provide JDBC
database access and again there's no
need for you the developer to write
boilerplate code to do things like
creating connections closing result sets
enclosing connections and the three
specific templates we're going to be
using in this course RS below we've got
the org dot spring framework dot JDBC
doc or docx JDBC template and we've also
got named parameter JDBC template and
finally a simple JDBC template and again
you'll be seeing those in usage in the
course as we proceed in future videos
all right so let's finish the video here
in the next video we're going to move on
we can actually start using the spring
JDBC to do that we'll need to create a
new project so let's start on that in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
