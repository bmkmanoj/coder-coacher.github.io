this video we are going to learn how to
download Xcode so we can actually start
building apps this is the very first
step and you can't really build apps
unless you have the tools to do that
so I'm gonna go ahead and open up Safari
now you can do this with Google Chrome
as well we're gonna go with Safari keep
it the Apple way and one thing I will
let you know is some of the Apple tools
and websites that they have don't work
unless you use Safari so whenever
working with Apple comm you want to use
Safari and what we've just done is gone
to developer.apple.com if you don't have
an account as a registered Apple
developer you need to sign up first it's
absolutely free and you can do that by
clicking account and then you can
register your account like so go through
those steps after you do have an account
already from developer.apple.com all you
need to do is click develop and you're
gonna see a few things here x codes with
documentation videos downloads and
they've done a really nice job in making
development really easy this didn't not
used to be like this it's much better
now okay so i highly encourage you to
read the documentation read these links
as a brand new developer you want to
read everything you may be used to speed
reading and going through things really
fast that's how i was you can't do that
any more
every single word matters and you need
to read everything but in this case
we're gonna download something so let's
go ahead and click downloads and after
you've signed in you're gonna see a
series of downloads here let's just talk
about a few things first things first is
you're gonna need xcode 9 beta okay this
is gonna require that you up light you
update to the latest mac OS okay now
don't update to the beta which is
currently high sierra ok beta operating
systems are very unstable ok but you are
gonna need the latest Mac OS in order to
download Xcode beta 9 now why didn't we
go to the App Store well we could have
we could have on our Mac did command
space and then type in App Store and
then we can search
for Xcode and you'll see there's Xcode
right here well the difference is the
Xcode that's available on the App Store
is always the latest release version
okay not the beta version we're gonna
use the beta version because it gives us
access to Swift for an iOS 11 now when
iOS 11 and Swift 4 are officially
released you'll want to download it from
here instead okay so if you're watching
this video and Xcode 9 is available okay
it's you're gonna get it right here iOS
11 is out come to the App Store and
downloaded Hillier here otherwise go to
developer.apple.com and we're gonna
download the beta one more thing I want
to talk about when it comes to beta
software there can be bugs and there can
be problems but they're pretty close to
the final result so you're maybe you're
asking well is it bad that I'm learning
these new things that aren't even really
as well no you're kind of ahead of the
game here and it'll at least give you a
chance to do some debugging and problem
solving if you do run into code issues
and of course we'll cover some of those
problems and issues as updates and
changes are made so nothing to worry
about here but you're gonna want to go
ahead and download Xcode 9 beta and
again I highly recommend that you do not
install the latest Mac OS i high sierra
or any beta version of mac OS because it
could destroy your computer it's it's
very hard to install sometimes as well
as the iOS 11 beta or any beta software
for iOS okay they're very well known to
break phones and cause lots of problems
and you can't install certain types of
apps and a lot of things will break so
if you have a test device and you really
want to get the cutting-edge beta
version of iOS you can do that but don't
do it on your main phone trust me now
okay trust me now I promise you you you
won't regret not installing this and
after you install it you'll come back to
me and you'll be like you were right
mark you know but for those of you don't
believe me just go ahead install it and
then come back to me in about a week and
tell me how miserable your life is so go
ahead and click download on Xcode 9 beta
and that is downloading now okay now
that it's downloaded wherever you saved
it ours is saved in downloads okay all
we're gonna do here alright is we're
gonna double-click the Xcode 9 beta file
it's gonna verify it's gonna take a
while and if your computer is a little
bit slower it'll take a great while
what's expanding again it's so part of
the process and may take a while ok and
Xcode beta has finished downloading as
you can see it's here my downloads
folder and all you have to do is take
this icon this is Xcode beta and make
sure it says beta on it if it doesn't
say beta you've got the wrong thing and
it has a little red icon badge at the
top left there and all you need to do is
take this and drag it into your
Applications folder now I've already
done that and so if we go into my
applications somewhere down here we've
got an Xcode beta and you can see the
difference there's Xcode and Xcode beta
they can run side by side without any
problems one more thing I do want to
talk to you about if you do have an
existing Xcode project let's say built
with some version of Xcode 8 you may
open it with Xcode beta and it could
upgrade your files on your Swift the
newest version and you may or may not
want to do that and it's hard to reverse
that so just be very careful opening
existing projects in the new Xcode beta
if you don't want to migrate them and
upgrade them and one more really
important thing you will not be able to
submit apps to the App Store with iOS 11
until it's officially released so if you
were thinking oh I'm gonna make this
cool iOS 11 app and submit it tomorrow
you gotta wait we got the early access
here so this is really cool but you
gotta wait till it comes out and then
Apple will accept those apps and so if
you do have existing apps you may want
to start upgrading them to iOS 11 so
they're ready on day one when iOS 11
comes out but just a few things there
Xcode is officially installed and to
test it out all you have to do is
double-click the icon that is now in
your Applications folder
and there you have it is loaded and you
are good to go so we've done a few
things in this video we've gone to
developer.apple.com we talked about
registering as an apple developer we
also talked about what the difference
between the Xcode on the App Store's
versus versus what's on the
developer.apple.com we've also talked
about how it's absolutely ridiculous for
you to install iOS 11 or any iOS beta on
your phone because it's probably gonna
break and then you're not gonna be able
to use any of your apps and things like
that trust me trust me trust me
same with Mac OS high sierra or any type
of beta mac OS for an example i tried
installing it on one of our dev
computers the other day and it took six
times to try and install it it failed
after all six times my hard drive was
completely wiped and so again be very
careful with those but you're pretty
safe with xcode beta so good to go
let's go ahead and call this video done
and then actually start moving on to
writing code you're gonna build your
very first iOS app and so first things
first let's look at what we're gonna be
building here this app is called hustle
mode and we're gonna have a item here
when you press a button the power mode
it turns it on and this appears and the
rockets gonna animate and some cool
sound effect is gonna play and we're
gonna do this really fast and you're
gonna learn how easy it is to make apps
in iOS so let's go ahead and get started
first things first go to your Xcode 9
beta or the App Store version if it is
released at this point in time I'm using
the beta and what we're gonna do is
click create a new Xcode project single
View application and just go ahead and
call this hustle mode hustle - mode and
we'll leave the default settings here
just make sure Swift is selected here
and you can unselect these items if they
are selected click Next and then you're
gonna find a folder for it like so and
I'm gonna click create and here we go
we're ready to get started on our app ok
so first thing make sure that you have
downloaded the assets for this project
and once they're downloaded what I want
you to do is click the assets folder
here and select all the files in the
assets folder that you have from this
project except the dot wav file unselect
that so hold down shift select all these
and just drag them here in the asset
folder like so okay there are more
images here in the folder than up here
over here and that's because it sets at
2x and 3x high resolution versions
inside of a single image in Xcode you
don't need to worry about that right now
just drag them here in the assets folder
and the dot wav file just drag here into
the hustle mode project all together
make sure that copy items if needed is
selected and make sure add to target is
selected as well perfect so now we've
got our code and all we need to do now
our our assets and all we need to do now
is go into the main storyboard here and
we're going to build out some user
interface elements remember we're gonna
build out that blue screen that hustle
mode screen okay the first power button
okay so let's go ahead and at the bottom
right here in the object directory here
and we're gonna type in the word image
and let's take this image view and drag
it over here onto the screen image views
allow you to have images on your screen
and once that's selected here let's go
ahead and find the dark blue BG so on
the right hand side over here in the
image view select dark blue BG okay the
next thing we need to do is have a
button right in the middle so let's type
in the word button at the bottom right
and drag it on now again for this lesson
just follow along we will explain more
throughout all the other lessons this is
the very first intro so you'll be doing
things that you don't quite understand
and that's okay so this is a button here
and what we want to do is on the right
hand side okay make sure this middle
icon is selected here the attributes
inspector and take off the word button
and instead what we're gonna do is we're
gonna set an image on this button so
what we're looking for is the power
button like so and holding shift just
drag it a little bit bigger whatever
size you think looks good and drag it
here on the middle of the screen like so
okay so we've got this button here and
the idea is when you click this button
this stuff disappears and then we show
the cool clouds in the rock and all that
stuff and then animates up into the sky
and plays a sound effect so what we want
to do is have another view on the top
like almost like a second screen that
holds all those other elements and so
what I'm gonna do is at the bottom right
here I'm gonna type in UI view like so
and you're gonna see this view 1 and
what you're gonna do is just drag it on
here like so
and you're gonna put it right here okay
so here's your background this is what
we're gonna put all the elements on okay
and if you notice here in the assets
folder we've got let's see here we've
got some different graphics like a blue
background and we've got these cool
clouds this is like the full thing here
we're not going to use this image here
that's just more for mock-up purposes
but this is the one that has the clouds
and stuff on it so we're going to put
the clouds and orange oval on top of
this but first things first is you know
we don't even you probably need to use
an image for the background because we
could just set the view to blue so what
I'm gonna do is command space on a Mac
typing digital color meter and what I'm
gonna do is hover over this blue and
this is 75 119 180 175 119 181 okay so
let's go back to the storyboard and
we're gonna go to the background color
and we're gonna select this here and 75
118 and 170 171 make it a little
brighter there we go not too shabby okay
so there's our nice blue background I
you know you don't need to use an image
whenever whenever you don't need to
because it'll be faster just setting the
color here and so what we're gonna do
now is add an image view to the screen
and I'm gonna make it fullscreen like so
and we're gonna set this one to the
clouds and orange oval oh so pretty but
one thing what's happening is our image
is stretching and so we want to fix that
let's go ahead and say aspect feel and
let's make it a little smaller like so
you know just kind of eyeball it make it
look pretty big because its aspect feel
it won't stretch the image it'll just
look nice and pretty which is exactly
what we want okay so this is cool so the
next thing is let's get our rocket and
our rock is also an image so just drag
an image view on here alright and let's
find the rocket rocket and stream now
again this is stretching again so we
want to set this to aspect fit or aspect
feel so let's try aspect feel
I kind of like that and what we'll do is
we'll just make it go on the screen here
and what I want to do is it's in front
of the cloud so we don't want in front
of the clouds so on the left hand side
here just drag it behind the clouds and
orange oval like so and with this
selected go ahead and double-click it
and just use the arrow key to go down
and we're just kind of visualizing what
it will look like if the Rockets moving
you see how it's coming behind the
clouds yeah it's so pretty so cool very
good so we want to hit in that first
okay and so what we've done so far is
we've created a UI view we've set the
background on it to blue and the same
blue that the image was we just decided
not to use an image just to show you
that you can set a background color and
then what we've done is we've created a
cloud an orange mobile image and we set
that at the bottom here we set it to
aspect feel so it looks nice and then we
put the rocket but we put it behind it
so it looks like it's coming up from
beneath the clouds and we set aspect
feel on that as well too okay the next
thing is let's go ahead and add a label
here so we're gonna type in the label
and if you remember it says hustle mode
on so this label we're gonna say hustle
mode and it's a little bit you know
messed up so let's go ahead and make it
bigger and we're gonna Center it so with
the label selected click the center
button to center the text and we want it
to be white of course because that's
what it calls for so clicking our little
color selector here where you can select
white alright and instead of system I
want to do system like bold so click the
little T button up here on the label and
go to system and then instead of regular
it do bold there we go and let's make it
a lot bigger so also mode and just kind
of eyeball it where you want it like
here in the center looks good and what
I'm gonna do is command D to copy this
label and make a new one I make this
even bigger and instead of hustle mode
this one's gonna say on so double-click
it and change it to the word on and then
we're going to increase this font size
as well to just click that up button
until it gets to the size that you like
Hausa mode on and we can make it a
little smaller now since we know how big
it is and this is looking good so
hustle mode is on okay so all of our
user interface elements are complete so
that's great so now we can actually go
into the code and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna click this button here in
the middle called the assistant editor
okay and what we're gonna do is we're
gonna create some IB outlets we're gonna
connect the user interface to the code
so real quick I'm gonna close the left
hand side so I have some more screen
space and I did that by clicking these
buttons up here you can expand and
retract the different panels here and
this is cool so first things first is
I'm gonna clean up some code here get
rid of this did receive memory warning
we don't need to worry about that just
yet and then I'm gonna make a few spaces
here in the view controller make sure
this says view controller and then what
we're gonna do is this dark blue
background okay I'm going to control
drag holding the control button I'm
gonna drag it over here and make sure
this says outlet and we're gonna say
dark blue BG like so and then what we're
gonna do is we're gonna grab this button
here okay we're gonna call this power
button like so and then this view right
here the one that holds all these cool
clouds and stuff we're gonna make an
outlet for and let's call this the let's
call this the cloud holder okay it's
holding the clouds and all the other
views okay
there's the cloud holder and then what
we want to do is let's go ahead and grab
this rocket and stream so we'll just
control drag the rocket and stream let's
just call this the rocket gear to the
empty space there so the rocket and we
don't need to grab the orange oval but
we do need the labels here and I'll tell
you why in a second so I'm gonna control
drag from the hustle mode label drag it
here we're gonna call this hustle LBL
for label and then again control drag
from the on button like so and we're
gonna call this on label and again all
we're doing is connecting user interface
elements to the code so we can do things
with them okay this is core iOS
development features which you'll be
using every day as an iOS developer okay
so what do we want to have happen well
when that power button is selected okay
what we want to do is have all these
things become visible and have the
our buttons become invisible okay no big
deal it's it's it's fairly simple
actually so all we need to do is create
a function here that's going to allow us
to receive an action when an event
happens and how do you do that as you go
to your dark blue but uh excuse me your
power button here on the left hand side
control drag over into your code and
instead of outlet change it to an action
okay and we're gonna call this a power
button pressed and just press ENTER
until you you have a function here that
will be called whenever that button is
pressed and so what we want to do is we
want to hot we want to show the cloud
holder and we want to hide the other
background elements so let's go ahead
and say we want to say cloud holder dot
is hidden equals false okay
and what we also want to do is we want
to say the dark blue BG dot is hidden
equals true we want to hide that and we
want to hide the power button right so
power button dot his hidden equals true
like so and let's just do a little more
cleanup in the interface builder for now
so let's close the assistant editor by
clicking these little lines here the
standard editor okay and what I want to
do is by default the cloud holder will
be is hidden so let's open up the right
hand side here and I also want these
hustle mode labels to be as hidden so
select the hustle mode label and the on
label and go ahead and select hidden so
scroll down here and select hidden on
those so those will be hidden by default
and then the cloud holder itself will be
hidden by default like so okay because
we don't want those showing at first and
make sure that the cloud holder is above
the dark blue background and power
button so it appears on top of it it
doesn't matter too much but at least for
a visual sake it looks that's how we
want it here and that's all looking good
so when we press the power button this
the screen will appear and the other one
the old one will hide so that's looking
great so let's go straight to our code
now open up the left hand side go to the
view controller and we're gonna write
some code so again what we want to have
happen is we want when that power
buttons press we want the rocket
shoot up into the sky and play a really
cool sound effect and we want to turn on
the hustle mode we're ready to take this
iOS 11 course and work our butts off so
you know we can do great and amazing
things so first things first is in order
to play audio we're going to need to
import a framework that allows us to
play audio so type an import at the top
here avfoundation that'll allow us to
play some music or some sounds in our
case just a single sound and then what
we're going to do is below the IV
outlets here we're gonna type into VAR
layer create a variable called player av
audio layer and put an exclamation point
at the end
this is called an implicitly unwrapped
optional but you don't need to worry
about that right though right now you'll
learn that later okay and what we're
gonna do here is in the viewdidload okay
this is a function that is the starting
point of your of your code when the
screen first loads and so this is where
you can initialize things and what we're
going to do is we're going to find this
file this wav file here in our documents
directory and then we're gonna load it
into the player okay so we're gonna
create a constant here called let path
equals bundle main dot path let's go
save for resource like so we're gonna
say hustle - on that's the name of the
file up type and that's going to be wave
like so save it there so bundled that
main that path and then for resource and
so what we're doing here is we're
grabbing the file okay and it's it's
yelling at us with a yellow warning
because we're not using this yet and now
what we're gonna do is create a URL iOS
works with URLs for it's like local file
system so same as it might grab a URL
from the internet and this is gonna save
the file well actually you can see it
right here if I do the parenthesis file
URL with path and we're just gonna pass
in the path that we just created here so
the path was a string and now we're
converting it to a URL and again you
don't have to understand all this just
yet you'll learn all about this later
we're gonna say do we're gonna try and
load our player and since this could
possibly fail we're going to do a do and
catch statement here player equals try
av audio player
contents of URL and we're gonna pass in
the URL and then we're gonna say player
da prepare to play let's get it ready to
play and if this URL was wrong and
didn't work we could get an error so
we're just gonna catch the air okay
we're just catching the air here and
we're just going to print it in case
there was some type of problem again you
don't need to worry about all of this
the important thing to understand is
that we're grabbing the the file here
and we're loading it into the player and
because it can fell we have this do
catch statement that'll catch errors and
problems again you'll learn all about
this later on so let's just keep moving
on and forward here this is just the
very first lesson so when the power
buttons press we're gonna hope we're
gonna show the cloud holder and then
what we're gonna do is we're gonna hide
the the blue background the dark blue
background and the power button and now
we want to animate the rock head up into
the clouds okay so to make an animation
in iOS we can use a simple UI view dot
animation and we want to do the one
right here with animations and a
completion handler so with duration
let's set 2.3 seconds and press tab to
go to animations and then press Enter
delete the thing that says code and then
press tab again and press enter enter
and type in finished here in the
parenthesis it's a boolean and we're
gonna get rid of this code right here so
it auto populated all this stuff for us
and if it didn't work or you press the
wrong key just copy it like I have it
here exactly and so what's gonna happen
is we're gonna say hey we want to
animate this rocket to a certain
position over 2.3 seconds so we're gonna
say self dot rocket okay dot frame
equals cg rekt and where do we want it
to go well we're gonna set an exposition
a y position and a width and a height so
the X's from left to right and the Y's
up and down again you don't have to
completely understand all this just now
just follow along and you'll learn all
about frames and bounds and positions
and all this crazy stuff later on so
we're just we want it to be at 0 X and
for the Y position let's position it
like 20 points from the top we won't
make it go all the way to the top and
the width let's go look at the width so
click the main storyboard okay click
your rocket
and then they click the ruler over here
and so the width is 375 and the height
is 402 so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna say width is going to be 375 and
height is 402 and so what we're saying
is over 2.3 seconds let's move the
rocket to this position and we're just
keeping the same height and width on
this okay
and then when it's finished what do we
want to do we want to we want to go
ahead and show the show the labels and
stuff okay for the hustle mode on so
self dot hustle label that is hidden not
highlighted is hidden equals false and
then self dot on label that is hidden
equals false okay and then the last
thing we want to do is actually just get
our cool sound effect to play and all
you need to do is type in player dot
play above this UI view dot animate okay
so we've done a lot here and it may be a
lot to take in but it's not it's not so
bad so what we've done is in iOS you can
drag interface elements to your code
like so and that's using the IB Alice so
all we've done is we've said hey we're
making a connection between user
interface and code so your code can
manipulate them so we've grabbed the
buttons and the holder and the Rockettes
and all those things that we created
then we created a player that will
actually play music we've went and got
the path for the file the sound file the
wav file here and we've loaded it into
the player contents of URL into the
player and when we're preparing the
audio player to actually play okay and
then when the power buttons plus pressed
on the main screen we're gonna hide the
power button we're gonna hide the dark
blue background and we're going to show
the clouds in the rocket and all that on
the screen and then we're gonna play the
sound effect and while the sound effects
plane we're gonna move the rock it up
over 2.3 seconds high into the sky and
then when that's done we're going to
show the hustle labels on so if this all
worked out as expected we haven't run
our code at all then it'll look great so
I'm gonna change this to an iPhone 7
okay and then we're gonna run it and see
what happens
here is our simulator it's open and if
it's too large or too small you can hold
down command for us plus one or two or
three and it will change the size of the
simulator
for you okay okay our screen is loaded
and so if we click this button hopefully
it all works out let's go ahead and try
that's pretty cool actually
we have a problem though we have a bug
right so our rocket ship is too high in
the sky so we have to debug what
happened here okay this is called
debugging yeah when you have a problem
and you need to solve it so what
happened here well it's a little bit too
high so all we need to do is probably
make its position a little bit lower
from the top so Y at zero is here at the
top and so 20 down is not enough we
probably need to make it like a hundred
from the top so let's give that a shot
on the Y type in a hundred and save it
and then let's run it again here we go
click it hustle mode on it's still not
quite enough I'm gonna say a hundred and
forty we're just making it look perfect
here there we go so congratulations
you've built your very first iOS app and
you've actually done a lot ok what did
we do here in 20 minutes so you built
your first it happened 20 minutes that's
pretty fantastic and that's with me
talking if you were a pro iOS developer
you could have built this probably in
five minutes
so what we've done here is we created
interface elements on the screen
iboutlet so you could reference the
controls and hide them and show them and
then we created an IB action right here
that basically receives events when you
press a button and we did that from the
power button okay and then what we also
did was we made it so when the IB
actions pressed we hide the old elements
on the screen and we show the new ones
and then we play an animation of the
rocket going up into the sky and a sound
effect all at the same time and when it
gets to the top we show these labels
here and we did our very own animation
which is really cool really really cool
stuff so just for fun let's play this
one more time and then you can give
yourself a pat on the back and call
yourself an official iOS developer so
congratulations you're an iOS developer
in training at least and there's so much
more to learn so let's go ahead and get
started moving forward show this to your
friends and family and this is really
cool stuff so mark price here at dev
slopes calm moving on and forth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
