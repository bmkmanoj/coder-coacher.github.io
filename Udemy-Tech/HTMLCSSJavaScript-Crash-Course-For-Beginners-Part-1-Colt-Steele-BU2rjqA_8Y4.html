things online and this is my crash
course on HTML CSS and JavaScript in 30
or so minutes I'm gonna do my best to
teach you the basics of how these three
technologies fit together with each do
how they interact and then also will
actually build a simple project together
this series it's really intended for
anyone with any degree of interest in
these skills whether you hope to become
a developer one day you want to take a
more advanced course after this or you
just want to be able to talk to
developers or understand how things work
or maybe you're just a hobbyist and it
seems fun all right let's talk about how
this thing works so I have four videos
in this series I'm going to try and keep
them all relatively short and not too
boring I know how easy it is to click
away from a long video on YouTube and
the first video which is this one is
going to explain the big picture so I'm
in throwing the course right now but
after this we're going to talk about
kind of the big idea behind HTML CSS and
JavaScript how they work together in the
next video well dive into writing our
own HTML so we'll start our project and
then the following video will talk about
the basics of CSS we'll add CSS to the
existing HTML from the second video and
then the final video I'm titling
stumbling through j/s it's a working
title but that's probably a pretty
accurate representation of what it's
going to be like for us or for you if
you're not familiar with JavaScript the
first two HTML and CSS are are
definitely much more straightforward and
easy to learn here's a little emoji
guide this this is supposed to be you
explaining the big picture pretty easy
diving into HTML easy slightly less of a
grin learning CSS basics now we're just
kind of smiling instead of grinning and
stumbling through j/s yeah that might be
a bit trickier I'm leaving it for the
end I just want to set expectations now
that you're not going to leave this
crash course being an expert in any of
these technologies but you will feel
much better probably about your HTML and
CSS and have a better grasp of how those
work compared to JavaScript we're just
going to touch the surface of JavaScript
it's
much much bigger technology there's a
lot more to talk about so with one short
video we're not going to be able to
address very much with that said the
objective of this course is not to make
you a JavaScript expert the goals are to
build a basic website with HTML CSS and
JavaScript I swear I had that on the
slides it only says HTML but it's
supposed to be with all three then we
want to understand how everything fits
together we want to write introductory
HTML and CSS I'm going to look at some
JavaScript without panicking so you will
write some JavaScript but you may not
understand every single component of it
it's more big-picture JavaScript let's
put it that way all right so what are we
gonna build this is the beautiful
website that we're going to build
together from scratch starting from
nothing at all here it is it might not
look like much aside from adorable this
is my new cat and she actually she
doesn't have a name right now so if you
have any ideas please leave some
comments here but the idea behind it
aside from just showing a static
circular photo we can click this button
look at that little animation real fancy
click on it there's another photo of her
in a basket on my laptop between the
cracks of a door and a sink she's a
little grumpy yep so that's my new cat
this is what we'll build by the end of
the course so this has HTML CSS and
JavaScript all put together as far as
what you need to complete this course
there's not much you need a computer
doesn't really matter what type Mac PC
Public Library computer a computer cafe
somewhere it doesn't matter at all
everything that I'm gonna show you works
on any platform and you need 30 ish
minutes 30 ish because it may end up
being more like 40 but let's just say 30
ish for now that's our goal and let's
say that timer starts now not at the
beginning of this video okay so let's
get on with it transition so I'm looking
at YouTube the homepage for YouTube I
spend way too much time looking at this
already and what I want to show you
behind any website whether it's YouTube
Google some restaurant menu website Yelp
anything any website that you ever visit
it consists of
bare-minimum HTML most likely CSS and
nowadays also most likely javascript so
at at most its HTML CSS and JavaScript
and at least its HTML and when I say
that a website consists of those
technologies what we see right here is
the rendered version of a website so
when I actually go to youtube.com I'm
going to refresh right now I'm sending a
request to YouTube servers asking for
the latest version of this homepage and
it sends to me something that looks like
this I'm in Chrome and I'm gonna go to
the right click view page source if
you're not using Chrome it's ok you
don't have to do this part
this is gonna allow us to see exactly
what the web page actually looks like
this is the skeleton underneath that
skin this is what is sent back from that
YouTube server and it's a mixture of
HTML this is some HTML here CSS this is
some CSS here and JavaScript if I keep
scrolling this is some JavaScript so a
website like YouTube is insanely
complicated but I just want to show you
that behind the scenes it is those three
technologies and they combine to make it
this which is not that impressive
but then your browser whatever browser
you're using knows how to translate this
take this set of directions and actually
make a nice-looking web page which we
see here
ok so we've established that HTML CSS
and JavaScript are three things and
that's pretty much it we know that they
combine to make what we see here what do
they each responsible for well let's
swipe over here and I have another web
page open this is called code pen com
it's a website that allows me to share
HTML CSS and JavaScript code with you
very easily you don't have to download
everything it's all in the browser so we
have three windows to type each
technology and then a fourth window at
the bottom that shows the rendered
website the result right now I don't
really have any CSS or JavaScript and
actually what I have in the HTML window
is not really valid HTML it's just some
basic text I should mention that this
right here this is commented out HTML
this means it is not running I've made
it invisible
and I'm going to fix that in just a
moment but for now this website down
here is just the result of this text
it's plain text and I just have a couple
of lines that say things like make me a
bullet points it's currently not a
bullet point make me a button here it is
not a button it's just text if I comment
this out so that's command slash on a
Mac on a PC it is control slash one of
those buttons down there next to control
with a slash it no longer runs and I'm
going to uncomment this code here this
is HTML it's the exact same text the
same idea the same data but it's all
wrapped in these tags see if I can make
this a bit larger these HTML tags encode
structure in our page so this h1 that is
wrapped around this I want big text here
transforms it into big text it's a way
of pointing to something and saying make
that big make that italics make that a
bullet point which is what we have here
and you can see we have make me a bullet
point make me another ballpoint or
finally make me a button here I wrap
that in a button tag and we get a button
it doesn't do anything but we've
basically encoded structure into our
plain text into our data so that's all
that HTML does there's no colors or
styles
there's no interactivity it's purely the
skeleton of the webpage we'll spend more
time with it in the next video ok on to
CSS I'm gonna paste in some CSS here and
you can see that immediately my page
changes it's not particularly
nice-looking but I now have some color
here and some color here and that's
really what CSS does it doesn't just add
color but it adds style so it takes HTML
elements things that we add with HTML
the structure and we give them color we
put some makeup on them we change the
size of them we rotate them we can even
animate things there's a lot of
possibilities we move them around we add
borders this is just barely scratching
the surface but I just really want to
introduce the main idea so hTML is like
the nouns of a sentence CSS is like the
adjectives these adjectives describe the
noun I want big text is an h1
okay it is a purple h1 or that button
has a two pixel border and background
color is this if you're not familiar
with hexadecimal colors don't worry I
could replace this with something like
pink and now I have a pink button and I
could make the border 20 pixels and we
get really thick button
so that's CSS we'll cover that in two
videos from now and then finally we have
JavaScript it's JavaScript like I said
it's a little more complicated but it is
a full programming language that allows
us to add interactivity to add life to
our web page before without the
JavaScript our web page was static it
didn't do anything it never changed now
I've added in some JavaScript and it
makes this button work and it does
something every time I click this button
it picks a random color and it changes
the background color of my web page to
that new random color so every time I
click I'm adding a new color to the page
very simple example but that serves to
illustrate what JavaScript can do HTML
with CSS on its own can make some
beautiful webpages but if you want to
make a game you want to make
interactivity you want to add chat other
features to your website for example on
YouTube I could just display these
videos and all this text and style
things with pure HTML and CSS but as
soon as I add this search here let's say
I really wanted to see Jake Paul's
latest video for some reason see this
autocomplete here is this suggestions
this is done with JavaScript this is
interactive it's not just showing me the
same content that was here when the page
loaded there's new information appearing
that's just one example of JavaScript on
this page so those three technologies I
used to call them the front-end Holy
Trinity but then one of my students said
that they were offended by that I guess
because that's a religious terminology
or something so I'm just gonna call it
the front-end Trinity let's go with that
just cut out Holy HTML encodes our
structure CSS is our style how things
should look and JavaScript is how things
should behave and we'll stop here in the
next video we'll actually
fire up our text editor and create an
HTML file and write our own tags from
scratch see that if you come back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
