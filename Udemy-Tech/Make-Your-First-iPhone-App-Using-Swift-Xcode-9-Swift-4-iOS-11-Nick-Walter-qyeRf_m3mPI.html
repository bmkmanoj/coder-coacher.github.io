name's Nick and I'm gonna teach you
everything you need to get started what
we're learning is so important and
fundamental to almost every app you're
gonna see on the app store we are
learning about table views now if you
don't know what table views are let me
show you I've got my phone connected
here I'm gonna bring it up so let's go
ahead and move into Twitter a table view
is something that lists information that
you can scroll through so for example
showing all the tweets here as I move
through the like this is a cell on a
table view bill gates a key how do dave
rubin bryant on each of those tweets
right there those are cells in this
thing called the table view that you can
move through let's look at another one
let's go to Apple music so let's go
ahead and see I'm gonna go to my library
let's go to like artists for example
look this is a table view of all the
artists that I have on my phone let's
say I dive into one Johnny Cash it shows
his songs yeah this isn't exactly a
table view let me do some where I have
more albums for example like Fall Out
Boy this is kind of a special table view
where they're split into two but if you
go into one of these right like these
things listed right here these cells
these are all table views here but it's
in every single app if you go into the
settings on your app Facebook Twitter
I'm gonna give you this challenge show
me an app on your phone that does not
use table views the only exclusion is
games there's plenty of games that we
don't use table views but outside of
games show me an app on your phone that
does not use table views I don't think
you can find one if you do please leave
it as a comment to this video would be
kind of fun but anyways I just want to
stress the importance of how fundamental
table views are to iOS programming so we
have a lot more that we're gonna learn
besides just you know table views here
we're gonna be building an app called
the emoji dictionary this is a really
fun one so basically we are going to
sketch out you know what our apps gonna
look like I'm gonna take you through
that whole process but it should be a
lot of fun basically it's an app that
lists a ton of emojis you can tap on one
it blows up that emoji really big and
you can see all the detail and give a
definition for that moji so anyways lots
to get into
let's go ahead and get started by
learning about something called a raise
that's gonna help us with our table
views let's go get in the playground all
right before we dive into table views
we've got to learn about something
called arrays and I think a great place
to learn about arrays is in the
playground so let's go ahead and open up
our playground file that we have on the
desktop here
okay so we'll wait for Xcode that up and
up here there we go and let's delete
everything we are gonna be talking about
arrays I'm having fun yes it's true it's
true that is a true boolean all right
terrible programming humor for you all
right so what are arrays I think the
simplest ways to think about and talk
about arrays is to refer to them as a
list and in fact in some programming
languages they are called lists in
Python in particular they are called
lists but it's basically a set of order
things that's what I'm gonna raise it's
a set of ordered things and what type of
things well it could be anything it
could you know let's think of the types
that we've learned it could be strings
ants boolean's doubles whatever you
wanted to be it's just something that
holds all those pieces of information so
for example let's say I want to have an
array or a list of my favorite candy
bars
I could totally make that so let me show
you on that particular example how to
create an array all right so first know
that an array can be a variable or a
constant just like any of the other
types that we learned so let's go ahead
and create a variable array so I'm gonna
say var here to create a variable then
I'm gonna give a name to my array I'm
gonna call this fav candy so far so good
you're like okay this is fine now how do
we create an array variable well you
start by having square brackets so the
square brackets say I'm creating an
array and I want something you know a
list of things to be inside of here and
then you've got to decide what are you
putting in there are you gonna put
strings in doubles boolean x' right
whatever
but since this is an array of favorite
candy bars I think strings is
appropriate because we want to have you
know the name of these candy bars so I'm
gonna go ahead and put one in one of my
favorite candy bars I'm gonna say my
number one is hundred grand bar
lots of caramel in there just mmm
delicious next another solid one is
snick
okay and I want you to notice what I
just did so when you make an array
you're putting in a bunch of items into
that Ray and you're putting a comma
after each one so for example I did a
string that said 100 grand bar had my
quotation marks right and then I did a
comma space and then something else now
you don't have to have this space right
here I think it's helpful just you know
kind of visually it helps to see the
different things that are inside of the
right but that's totally up to you but
you just keep following this pattern if
you want to put more things into the
array so for example I've had a 100
grand bar I've added Snickers this
technically isn't a candy bar but fun
dip is a big one for me so I'm gonna say
fun dip add that in there and then I'm
gonna butcher the spelling on this one
but three musketeers maybe it's like
this I don't know but here we go I've
got a list of like my four favorite
candy bars and this is now an array so
this is an array that holds strings and
it's in a variable called fav candy
that's I'm just kind of trying to break
down what we have here so with this
array you can always guarantee that this
is going to be the order things like
100-grand bars the first thing in the
array Snickers is the next then fund up
than three musketeers if you want to add
something on to the array you can
totally do that
to do that you type the name of your
array which in this case is fave candy
okay and then you do a dot append okay
and you'll see the autocomplete for that
so dot append all lowercase and then you
pass in something you want to put on to
that array so for example I'm gonna put
in a Hershey's bar here that's something
that I want to add into the array boom I
can do that now I'm gonna kind of do
this extended thing here so you can see
what's inside of the raise at each time
and it's not showing what I was hoping
for so let's do this let's print this so
after we created this array fav candy
I'm gonna say print fav candy and I'm
gonna do the same thing after we add
Hershey so let's go ahead and do that
okay well wait a second for the
playground here and look at that so the
first time this array had the four items
inside of it
grande bars Snickers fund up three
musketeers and when we append we throw
something on to you the very end there
so we say you know these same four
things and Hirschi
right at the end so if you want to you
can just keep a patty appending things
right if I throw another one on there
like if I say fave candy dot append and
I put inside of here and I'm running out
of candy bars I hate these so I'm gonna
put them at the very bottom so almond
joy will throw that at the very bottom
and now look at this look there was the
two things at it on the Hershey's bar
and the almond joy so something that's
important to denote is that with an
array you can only add the same types of
things into them so for example I made
an array of string objects I can only
put string objects in there so for
example if I try and say alright I did
Hershey as I did almond joy I'm gonna
now say fave candy dot append and I'm
gonna throw the number 34 in there
Xcode is gonna get all upset at us and
say whoa whoa you know you I it's saying
can't convert value of type int into
expected argument type string meaning
saying I was looking for a string you
passed me an N yeah I can't really do
that
you know same goes if I try and pass a
boolean in there or something like that
it's gonna get angry again saying hey I
was looking for a string you gave me a
boolean so that probably raises the
question well then you know can I have
an array of other types yes you can so
I'm gonna leave my candy array up there
but I'm gonna make another array of
let's say my lucky numbers have you ever
seen when you go and do a Chinese
restaurant you get the fortune cookie
and it's got your lucky numbers on there
so I'm just gonna list out some lucky
numbers okay so remember to make an
array you do the square brackets and
then you just put numbers or objects
inside of that array that are separated
by commas so for example this time I
want to have an array of int so I'm
going to say you know eight comma 14
comma 93 comma 72 and just numbers that
I pulled out of nowhere but you can see
it kind of follows the same flow as
above you just have I have an int and
then a comma another end comma and it's
just these commas separate the different
items in the array and if I want to
throw something on to like
numbers I can totally do that if I say
lucky numbers dot append and then you
know I put in I want to add the number
ten inside of there I can totally do
that and if I want to see what's inside
I'm gonna say print lucky numbers and
we'll see that show up at the bottom
look at that we've got the first four
numbers and that number ten down there
okay so you're starting to get the
basics here just one more thing I want
to show you so that you can sort of see
what the type looks like on these so
remember when we created a string before
let's see like for name and we specify
that this was going to be a string
variable and then you know I put
something like Nick inside of here now
you can like explicitly state what the
type is gonna be for a variable you can
do the same thing for a race so for
example this one fav candy if it's going
to be an array of strings I'm going to
say here : and I do the square bracket
and then I put the name of the type
that's gonna be inside of the array so I
say string so this right here the square
brackets with a particular type in the
same alright
I'm creating a variable called fav candy
and it's going to be an array of string
objects now if we were going to do this
for the int one we would do the colon
and we would say this is going to be an
array of int objects and you can kind of
see how those work for specifying those
things so anyways that's probably enough
for this lecture you've learned a lot
here with the race I have a quick
challenge for you though that I want you
to do I want you to make an array of
that the how about your favorite numbers
so go ahead make a new array called fave
numbers instead of lucky numbers just so
you know aren't doing the same thing but
just go through that process of making a
new array on your own I think it will
help you so hit pause now
alright so I assume when you unpause all
I asked you to do is make an array of
your favorite numbers so fave numbers
and you probably could have put anything
inside of here look I'm gonna put some
huge numbers inside if you can't have
letters but look at that that's totally
fine okay so there you have it and the
next one will keep talking about arrays
and then from there on we'll move over
to the emoji dictionary alright we're
going to keep learning about arrays in
this lecture
just have a little bit more information
for you here so let's go ahead and
delete everything until we just have
faith candy and we don't need to
explicitly state that this is an array
of strings we're gonna let Swift handle
that cuz it's saying oh you pass me
array of strings I'm guessing that you
want fave candy to be a string array
variable right so with this there's all
sorts of options that you can get with
an array so if you type out the name of
the array fav candy and then you do a
dot and I hope you've kind of noticed by
now whenever you do a dot on something
in Swift it's sort of showing you the
extra options or features that come with
that particular object so the technical
terms for these are properties and
functions you're going to be learning
more about those as we go but I just
wanted you to kind of know you've
probably noticed already whenever you do
the name of like some variable or
something then put a dot on it there's
all sorts of things that you can then
access as part of that you know object
or item here so with an array there's
all sorts of different things you can do
one of the most popular ones is here
called count tells you how many things
are inside of the array so if I do fav
candy count it tells me hey there's four
things in there and if I you know come
down add something else to this array if
I say fav candy and I want to append a
Hershey's bar
okay and then I do a count after that
fav candy dot count should update to
five there we go so you can see it tells
us it was four now it's five type of
deal other things that you can do with
an array if you do the dot you can get
to the first object in that array so if
we do the first on this it's going to
give us back the hundred grand bar so
you can see that comes there you can
also get the last object in an array so
if you do that you can see it gives us
the Hershey's bar that we just added
right here so those are all kind of you
know cool things but there's this
concept of something called an index
with an array so that's like for example
what if I wanted to get the third item
in the array the fun dip right well it's
not the first thing in there it's not
the last thing like how do I get to this
specific item in the array and you do
that through something called an index
so let me go ahead and delete this so we
can really focus our code here
so the way to use with an index is you
type the name of the array fav candy and
then you do square brackets after it and
then you inside of these square brackets
you put the index number
now what's tricky about this is that
arrays are a count with a zero based
index meaning if we look at this array
fav candy 100-grand bar even though it's
the first item in there it's considered
item zero then Snickers is considered
item one then fun dip is item 2 Three
Musketeers is item three so for example
watch this if i do fav candy square
brackets and i put 0 inside of there
it's gonna say okay give me the 0th item
inside of there and that's the very
first 100 grand bar boom look there's
100 grand bar what happens if i put one
inside of here so 0 1 it shows up
Snickers what if i do number two okay
zero one two look at that it gives us
fun dip so we got to the one that we
were you know looking to do here on the
outset and i promise this will feel more
and more familiar i remember the first
time I learned about arrays and people
told me the zero base thing I just
thought like oh why is it this way like
everyone starts counting 1 2 3 4 5 why
all of a sudden we like 0 1 2 3 4 it if
I had my way I would have it start 1 2 3
4 5 but this is what we're working with
and this is very common in almost every
programming language that they're all
zero based counting so anyways this is
how you can move through I just want to
show you kind of the complete list here
if I give it an index of 3 0 1 2 3 it
actually goes and gets the last item in
there and look what happens if I try and
give it the number 4 I'm like oh there's
four things in there give me the fourth
but it gives me an error because it's
saying there's no fourth object 0 1 2 3
there's no fourth item inside of there
so these are what indexes are so with
indexes you can you know pull things out
of an array for example if I want
Snickers I pass the number 1 in there
that's gonna give me back the Snickers
object I can change things inside of the
array so for example if I want to change
Snickers to Hershey's I can go ahead and
do this
and now if I print out fave candy you
will notice down below here dudududu
come on playgrounds there we go it goes
a hundred grand bar Hershey fund up
three musketeers so we replace the
Snickers with the her shushu said okay
whatever is that index one want you to
replace it with Hershey's that's
something you can do with indexes
something else that you can do is you
can delete things from an array at a
particular index so if I say fav candy
dot delete oh I'm not getting the delete
that I was looking for maybe it's a
different name here ah remove at that's
what I'm looking for so if we say dot
remove at it's asking you know what
index do you want to remove something
that so if I say zero here this is gonna
get rid of hundred grand bar and you'll
notice down here Snickers fun dip
through Musketeers but let's say I want
to get rid of fun dip well zero one two
if I pass in the number two here all of
a sudden fun dip is gone okay other
things that we can do with an index we
can insert objects at a particular point
so when we do an append it just throws
something on to the end of the Ray but
if we do insert it's gonna ask us first
what do you want to put inside of the
array so I'm gonna put inside of here
oops and I messed up here so when it has
these little blocks here if you hit tab
it will sort of switch between the two
you can very subtly see the highlighting
change and then if you just start typing
it will should fix what's in there you
might have to hit delete but at least
that wasn't my case but inside of here I
could pass for example I'm gonna add her
she's into here but that's gonna say at
what position in the array do you want
to put this so in the typical append
scenario if I want to said you know what
go ahead and put this at the zero one
two three I want this to be at the
fourth if I just pass the four inside of
there all a sudden throws her she on the
end but let's say I wanted to be at the
very beginning I could put a zero inside
of there what if I wanted it to be
between fun dip and three musketeers
while I go zero one two I want it to be
three so I passed the number three there
and all sudden fun dip her she's and
then three musketeers
okay so look at that we're learning in
all sorts of cool things here with array
these these different things that you
can do and this is really gonna be the
backbone of table view so I really want
to make sure that you've got a good
grasp on this the last thing that I want
to provide you here is just a challenge
to make sure you've really cemented this
in your mind so I have two tasks for you
so first thing is I just want you to
make a variable called numbers and I
want you to make an array with the
numbers 1 comma 2 comma 4 comma 5 okay
so it's missing the 3 if you know we
were counting 1 2 3 4 5 its 1 2 4 5 so
the first thing that I want you to do is
insert 3 in the appropriate place okay
so you want to put a 3 right inside of
there you're gonna have to use an insert
for that and then the next thing that I
want you to do is I want you to remove
the number 4 from the array so remove
the number 4 and then the last thing
that I want you to do is change the
number 1 to 88 so these are all kind of
random requests here but this is gonna
kind of test your knowledge and see if
you've got it all correct so you should
have this array called var numbers with
1 2 4 5 and then insert 3 in the
appropriate place remove the number 4
change 1 to 88 so hit pause now
go do it alright I'm assuming you went
and did that let me show you how I did
this in case you got stuck or needed
some help so first I'm gonna take this
numbers array and to add the number 3 in
the correct place I'm gonna do dot
insert and I'm going to put the number 3
at position 0 1 2 so I'll put the 2
right there okay and look at that we get
1 2 3 4 5 excellent next thing is I want
to remove the number 4 so I'm gonna say
numbers dot remove at and I want to get
the number 4 which is now at 0 1 2 3 is
where it's at this air is making it so
it won't show that on the side but yeah
0 1 2 3 is where that's at and look it
pulled out the number 4 that's good and
then the last thing that we want to do
so you want to take numbers and change
the number one to the number 88 so one
is at the zero index position so I'm
going to say numbers with these square
brackets put a zero in there say you are
now equal to 88 and just to make sure
this is the array we were looking for
I'm gonna print out numbers and see what
we get okay
so look at that we have 88 2 3 we got
rid of the number 4 and we added that 3
and there's number 5 looks like we've
finished it ok so hopefully you got a
good grasp on arrays you have any
questions please leave them as a comment
here but assuming everything is ready to
go let's go start the emoji dictionary
all right so let's start working on this
app and the first thing that we want to
focus on let's take a look at this
sketch right here is the table view
that's the primary focus of this section
it's really what makes our app magical
so let's go build that now so what we
want to do is first create this table
view visually and then we'll you know do
all the code behind it to say you know
for example put this emoji there that
emoji there blah blah blah so we're
gonna go to our storyboard and here
we've got our viewcontroller remember a
view controller basically means a screen
in the iOS world but this is a plain old
view controller and if we wanted to we
could scroll down here we could take a
table view and put it inside of the view
controller but there's all these things
that we've got to connect it's not
really the easiest I'm going to show you
how to do this later in the class if
you're interested but I prefer to just
use if you scroll up to the top here
something called a table view controller
so this is a view controller with the
table view already built into it so I'm
going to click and drag one of these out
onto our storyboard so there you can see
it's next to our little friend here now
what we want to do is we want to use
this table view controller that we just
pulled out instead of this blank view
controller that Apple gave us so first
thing that we've got to do is this
little arrow to the side here this tells
us where what view controller we should
use and start the app on and so we're
gonna click and drag this arrow to go
from this view controller to this view
controller we're basically saying hey
you know we don't want this view
controller anymore we
use this one and since we're not using
this anymore go ahead and select the
little yellow circle up here and just
hit delete okay that doesn't delete it I
guess in your little side menu here you
can pull that or collapse it here if you
select the view controller and then hit
delete there there we go it's completely
gone so now you should just have this
table view with this arrow pointing to
it if for some reason you know you
weren't you deleted that one without
moving the arrow for example if I get
rid of that arrow you can always select
this table view controller and if you go
to this little caret here you can check
this box that says is initial view
controller and then that arrow shows up
right there okay so we've created this
visually and if we just wanted to see
what this looked like in our app we can
go ahead and run this on the simulator
okay here it comes I'm gonna have this
open ready to go and I'm gonna make sure
on the zoom here I want tsuki oh yeah it
looks like it's a hundred percent
sometimes if you're zoomed out too far
it looks like you have like bars missing
in between these things but it's just
like a zooming issue but anyways look at
that I can click drag with my mouse or
trackpad here and I can actually move
through this empty table view it's kind
of fun I love the smooth animations that
come here with iOS but you know okay
that's a start now really all we got to
do is put some information inside of
here so in order to add some information
what we've got to do is we have to write
some code behind it essentially we've
got to say you know we want to have this
many things inside of here and the first
one should be this smiley face and then
that smiley face and blah blah blah
whatever so you know you might be
thinking oh I'm gonna move over to this
view controller dot Swift but this view
controller dot swift was connected with
the previous view controller that we had
and it's not the right one that we're
looking for remember this is a table
view controller which is a special type
of view controller so we're actually
going to select this file view
controller and hit delete on it and
we're gonna say move to trash so the
basic two choices here if you say remove
reference that's just saying okay the
Xcode project isn't going to look at
that file anymore but I won't delete it
from your computer and the move to trash
says no get rid of all this stuff so if
we hit move to trash
I'll get rid of the file and you can see
now down there in the trash so now that
we've gotten rid of that we have to
create a file for this view controller
remember when we're making an app we
have the visual view controller here and
then we have the code view controller in
a separate file so we're gonna go to the
top menu here we're gonna say file new
file just like this and we want under
iOS we want a cocoa touch class
so go ahead double click on this and
first thing for the subclass of you're
saying what's the subclass don't worry
we're gonna get into that later but for
now we just have to specify that we want
this to be a UI tableview controller
that's the full name for a table view
controller so just start typing UI
tableview controller and you can see it
should automatically populate it for you
and you can just hit enter or tab on
that then for the class name and the
class name is essentially the file name
what we're gonna provide here is we need
to say you know what type of table view
is it we're all well our app holds emoji
so I'm going to say emoji table view
controller that seems like a good name
for me don't have this box checked we do
want the language swift so let's go
ahead and hit next and I'm gonna throw
this into the project there we go
and for some reason this got outside of
the the folder here it doesn't you'll
still work of its era but I'm gonna move
it back down by like the storyboard and
all that ok so now we have this emoji
table view controller if we go ahead and
click on this you can see all these
lines of code that we have inside of
here so I'm gonna help you sort of clean
up this file because there's a lot of
unnecessary stuff in here because really
when we break it down a table view needs
to know two pieces of information let me
bring up our sketch it needs to know how
many things are gonna be in this table
view and what should go inside of each
of the cells right so let's say we had
20 emojis not all of them are gonna show
on screen we need to tell the table view
I have 20 emojis and the first one's
gonna be the smiley face the next one
frowny the next one praying hands the
next one's you know a car whatever it is
we want to be able to provide
answers to those two questions how many
items are inside of the tableview in
what goes inside of each cell okay so
really those two questions are right
here one of them is this one that says
number of rows and this other one that
says cellforrowatindexpath so I'm gonna
just delete everything else that's not
necessary here so for example this one
this says number of sections I'm gonna
go ahead and delete this this function
that says did receive memory warning and
I guess I should say this when you're
deleting functions make sure you delete
when a function always has an opening
curly bracket in an ending one you got
to make sure you delete the whole thing
for example if I just deleted this top
part we're gonna have all sorts of
issues here Xcode is gonna freak out and
it's gonna be like like what's happening
so we want to make sure we delete all of
that we can get rid of this did receive
memory warning that's really not a big
issue for us in this app now you see
this table View self row index path this
has been commented out with the
multi-line comments so we know how to
fix that we're gonna delete the top and
the bottom one there so now that we have
this cell and then or this function here
and then we're gonna get rid of the
extra stuff down here so I'm gonna just
delete all this make sure you leave the
ending curly bracket here but I'm just
gonna delete all of that so we should be
left with now and also delete all of
these comments here three functions
inside of our table view controller
there's the viewdidload which basically
is saying run some code when this view
controller shows up for the first time
and then there's this table view number
of rows this is saying how many things
are inside of your table view and then
this one says what should go inside of
each of those table views okay so that's
probably enough for this lecture I know
I'm bombarding you with a lot of new
information but in the next one we're
gonna get our our table view to actually
show some stuff that's gonna be really
fun so at the end of the last lecture I
kind of left you a little bit of a
cliffhanger I said you know table views
are very easy to work with we just have
to answer two questions one how many
items should be inside of the table view
and what goes inside of each cell right
but I didn't do anything right we just
sort of you know cleaned up this file
whatever well now we're diving into it
so the first thing is we want to answer
that first question of how many things
should be inside of the tableview and
when I say things the technical term is
rose you can call them rose or cells but
yeah so the table in the table view
needs to know how many Rose is there
gonna be inside of this table view so
there's this function right here called
number of rows in section and that's
essentially asking hey how many rows are
gonna be inside of here
and I know I keep throwing the term
round function and I haven't explained
it and you're like what the heck I
thought this was for the beginner here
well I'm gonna get to this is just kind
of you know you got a build bit by bit I
promise I'm gonna teach you about
functions but for right now just take it
for its word a function is basically a
chunk of code that runs at particular
time so this function here this gets
called whenever the tableview wants to
know how many things are going to be
inside of it and the way that you
provide the answer is by saying return
and then you give it some sort of int so
we can get rid of this comment here all
we have to do is return some number so I
could say for example I just want you
know 20 things inside of my table view
boom it's that easy that's all you got
to do okay and that's really all we have
to do to answer that first question it's
pretty simple the next one is this cell
for row and index path so if we look at
the second question it's you know what's
gonna be inside of each of these rows if
we go to our sketch here it's like
what's at the top position and the next
one the next one this is where we'd want
to say oh you know we want this emoji
that emoji whatever so in order to do
this it's already given us this function
has given us some great code so went and
made the cell object which you can see
is a constant here and then you know it
returns back this cell object because
you know when you return that's
essentially answering the question and
we're giving it this cell now with the
cell you can specify inside of it maybe
you know what text should show up there
so for example with this cell now you've
got to write this below where it creates
the cell constant and before it does the
return but we're gonna say cell dot text
label dot text okay so kind of the path
that we're
following here is we went to the cell
then the cell has a label on it and then
we went to the labels text property and
then we're gonna set this equal to some
sort of string so I'm just gonna say
here hello world this will be our chance
to do the classic hello world example so
what have we done here we've basically
told the table view okay we want 20 rows
inside of the table view and we want
every single row inside of the table
view to say hello world let's go ahead
and give it a shot so we're gonna hit
run here on the simulator and big moment
of truth I'm excited for this oh we
don't get anything showing up hmm let me
see what's going on so I know that was
very anticlimactic but I missed a very
key piece of information and that is in
our storyboard we have this table view
controller here right this showed up
it's the very first thing that we should
see when the app opens up and then we
made you know the code version of that
view controller over here but the
problem is these two things don't know
about each other like this file here
doesn't know about this thing on the
storyboard and this thing on the
storyboard doesn't know about the view
controller file that we have over there
so we've got to connect the two we've
got to bridge them so in order to do
that in the storyboard select the table
view controller so we're gonna select to
be table view controller hit that little
yellow circle at the top there then
we're going to go to what I call the
newspaper I think the technical term is
the attributes inspector let's see if I
hover identity inspector but here where
it says class we need to provide it the
name of this table view controller over
here which we called emoji table view
controller so inside where it says class
I'm just gonna type emoji and if I just
type p.m. it already knows what I'm
looking for so just once it has that
text auto-completed there go ahead and
hit enter it's important that you do
enter because it's gonna you know put
this check here and put something here
in module and so once you've done that
now things are working because
essentially we said okay this you know
table view controller here your file
essentially backing you is over here and
you know now the two are connected
so let's go ahead and hit run on the
simulator one more time and see if we
can't get hello world to show up 20
different times okay here we go and oh
another error so I know this lecture has
just been disappointment after
disappointment but let's go ahead and
talk about what caused this crash
hopefully can help us in the future and
I'm also gonna take this moment to just
say out there programmers are not
perfect I obviously as your instructor I
want to prepare make sure I'm giving you
good stuff but just know it's very very
regular in the programming world to not
get things right in the first time
things break you know you've got to go
fix them so if that's happening for you
I'm telling you this so that you feel
more comfortable if that happens I'm not
trying to get off my back like I'm not
that bad of an instructor you know that
happens to everyone but I'm just telling
you it's part of the job hopefully you
know you can kind of get used to that
feeling
so anyways small little spiel there that
I want to share but down here in our
function where you know it's asking for
the cell that's gonna show up inside of
the tableview there's this line of code
that says it wants to DQ a reusable cell
blah blah blah all this stuff
essentially what it's asking for is it
saying give us the identifier of a cell
from the table view and if we go back to
main dot storyboard inside of this table
view there's this little white space
here up at the top and if we look on the
side here this is actually a table view
cell and what we need to do is we need
to give this an identifier to say hey
this is the type of cell that we want
showing up in our table view so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna select
this table view cell and we're gonna go
to the attributes inspector and here
under identifier we're gonna give it
some name I'm gonna call this like my
cell so whatever name that you give it I
want you to copy and paste it because we
got to spell this exactly right please
copy just do a copy like that then we're
gonna come back to our code and then
rather say then saying reuse identify
we're gonna paste in my cell so
basically this line of code is saying go
get something from the storyboard that
has the identifier my cell which is
going to be you know this guy right here
so now
that we've done that let's go ahead and
hit run here one more time the simulator
I would say that I think this is gonna
work but I've said that the last two
times so I don't want to jinx myself
again let's see what we get
oh look we did it we did it we did it so
it says hello world 20 times you know we
can scroll through that there's that
nice little indicator on the side so one
thing that I want to show just for fun
here is that this table view is really
good at handling big big numbers so for
example if we go back to the emoji table
view controller let's say I say there's
going to be two million rows inside this
table if you let me make sure I get the
the zeroes correct here and I'm actually
gonna show you a cool trick so in Swift
you can actually put an underscore in
between numbers as sort of like your
comma or something and it doesn't affect
the number so this is this number is the
exact same thing as this number but if
we put these underscores here it's a
little bit easier to read but what are
we doing here we're saying make a table
view with two million rows inside of it
now just think about how big and
gargantuan that is so with that let's
see if our app I mean it's just gonna
slow it down is it gonna make it really
hard to use well let's see okay here
comes the simulator and look at this
so there's hello world and I'm gonna
start scrolling look at that it's
buttery smooth we can move up and down
just like like now I don't think it
would take us maybe a day of constantly
clicking and dragging to get all the way
down to the bottom but the point is
Apple has written the code for table
views in the very efficient way so that
if you have really really big numbers
it's able to handle and I think this
probably came from if you think you know
the original iPhone one of the big
things that made it so cool is that it
could play music and you know with an
iPod you know if you tap on I want to
see all my songs and it put them put
some in a big table view yeah now you
know that that's a table view right like
people have you know twenty thirty
thousand songs sometimes on their phones
or iPods and so they needed an efficient
way for someone to be able to scroll
through all their songs and I think
that's where this came from
so anyways there you have it so you kind
of got the basics here this is sort of a
you know silly example because it just
says hello world every time but at least
we've got a table view that's working
let's keep going in the next one alright
in this lecture we're gonna do the work
to actually make our table view show the
emojis that we want to be in our
dictionary so this will be fun and this
is gonna be cool because we're going to
tie in the stuff we learned with arrays
and show how they work with table views
alright so the first thing is I want you
to recognize something with this
function here the cell for row at index
path so this thing called the index path
this basically tells you what point in
the table view it wants information for
so just to show you what's going on here
we're gonna do a print so just do this
before it says return cell you can put
it maybe in between these two things and
inside of here we want to print out the
index path dot row and you can see this
gives us back an int this just tells us
what number in the table view it's
looking for so let's just go ahead and
do this I'm gonna bring down our number
from like 2 million probably back to 20
here now let's maybe do 200 because I
think this will be kind of interesting
but we are going to run this and here we
go build succeeded and here comes our
app so inside of here you can already
see that we've had some things printed
so it's gone and it's said I want to
know what's at position 0 which in the
tableview world the thing at the very
top just like arrays it does zero base
counting so this is index path dot row 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 and it's
loaded 14 which is just kind of you know
on half the screen there so I want you
to notice as I start scrolling here I
move up to the top boom
it loads 15 because it's saying hey I've
got to get the next one ready and then I
load 16 and you know 17 18 19 20 23 24
oh this is because I did a big number
yeah so as I just keep scrolling it just
keeps loading all those different pieces
of information and each time it calls
this function the index path dot row is
different so I can move and I go can go
all the way down here to the bottom
and you can see so it loaded up $1.99
which is technically the last one right
if we have 200 things we start counting
at zero the last ones going to be $1.99
but we also have the opposite effect of
when we start moving this way well it's
got to start calling this again on the
things up above so you know as we start
moving back up to the top here the
numbers are getting smaller and smaller
till we get to the top and look it
looked for zero but then it started
asking for you know 12 13 14 whatever
okay so what I want you to recognize
here is that arrays and table views can
have a great relationship together
because they both do this counting thing
with zero based index
they both are a list in one particular
order so what we could do is we could
have an array that's going to tell us
you know how many things should be
inside of the table view and then what
goes at each particular point so let me
just go through the example here and I
think you'll see how cool this is
so up here at the top of our class and
I'm going to talk about what classes are
later we want to make something called a
property and a property is basically a
variable that can be accessed anywhere
inside of each of these functions so
just make sure it's after class but
before this viewdidload we're gonna save
our emoji so we're making an array
that's just gonna be all of our emoji so
we're gonna say this is equal to and you
know how to make an array now do our
square brackets then inside of here put
our emoji so how do you get emojis to
show up on your computer the shortcut
key is ctrl command-spacebar just all at
the same time and it pops up this little
menu so once this is here I'm gonna do
the classic smiley then comma I'm gonna
put something else inside of here let's
maybe do the little poo face guy so and
if you didn't realize this already
emojis are actually just like text so
you put them inside of strings they can
be right next to other letters and
numbers and stuff like that so that's
why we've got the double quotes around
them but let's go ahead and put like at
least maybe four of these things inside
of here I know one of my favorites is
the race car so let me see I'm gonna put
that inside of there and then I'm also
going to do the church that's or another
really cool emoji one
you uh blow it up so I think that's in
I'm not trying to blow up the church I
mean blow up when we make it bigger okay
come on I think I've been watching too
much 24 let's see where is that emoji
well I can't exactly see it these are so
tiny maybe it's this one that might be
the love hotel or something like that
but anyways alright so I've got a few
emojis here right so I've got this array
of emojis there's four things inside of
there now check this out this is a
really cool thing so for this question
of how many rows should be inside of the
table view let's just say yeah however
are many inside of this array so rather
than saying 200 or for example if
there's four inside of here I could just
put the number four or I could just say
emojis dot count however many emojis
there are in this emojis array that's
how many rows there's gonna be and this
is cool because if I decide randomly to
add a new emoji inside of here let's say
I'm going to add the Apple that's fine
all sudden this now will return the
number five instead of four and I don't
you know I wouldn't have to go back here
and manually update it and we're gonna
do that same kind of thing down here for
this self row at index path so remember
the index path dot row like the first
one is zero then one then two those are
basically indexes of our array so what
we could do is take our index path dot
row and put it as an index to get
something out of the race so I'm gonna
say emojis then do my square brackets
and inside of the square brackets I'm
going to say index path dot row which
remember index path dot row is zero for
the first one then like one two three
four and it just sort of magically fills
everything up so I'm gonna take this
this should give us back one of the
strings from here one of these emoji so
I'm just gonna cut this and paste it
right here rather than saying hello
world I'm gonna say you know just take
what's ever inside of the emojis array
at that particular point and this isn't
gonna get them to show up oh I'm excited
here okay so we hit the Run button and
build succeeded oh my goodness look at
this
how cool is this so the same array that
we have up here smiley Pooh race card
Church Apple all sudden now shows up
inside of the simulator how awesome is
that and what's so great about this is
like I said earlier look I want to add a
new emoji inside of here
all sudden now I want the avocado BAM we
can't run on our app and we'll have to
wait for a second here pause for a
dramatic effect
and whammo there's an avocado at the
bottom at the tableview like how sweet
is that like this is so cool so
hopefully you see why arrays and table
views are just like the perfect marriage
and think about the different apps that
we were working through so for example
when Twitter when you were scrolling
through a bunch of tweets I imagine that
somewhere inside of Twitter's app
there's an array of tweets right like it
has an array of tweets is saying okay at
the you know zero position put this
tweet then that tweet think about the
when I looked at all the artists inside
of my music library there was probably
an array called artists which held all
the names of the different you know
bands or whatever inside my phone like
how cool is that
like I hope you're enjoying learning
about this because once I started
learning is programming when I started
looking at other apps my phone was just
like oh like I think I know what's going
on here like kind of a kind of a cool
thing there so if you couldn't tell by
now this stuff gets me pretty excited
but we are on a great pace here if we
look at our sketch for the app we've
essentially completed this first view
controller we've got to add a little
title up here to the top that says this
is the emoji dictionaries then we need
to add the functionality so that when
you tap on one of these it goes to like
another screen but we are making great
progress we've got a good grasp on table
views let's keep moving all right we're
at a good place with our app we have our
table view showing all the different
emojis that we want in our dictionary
the next thing for us is we want to make
it so that we can you know tap on one of
these guys and move over to the next few
controller so if we're gonna make that
functionality to move between the two we
got to have a view controller for it to
actually move to so in this lecture
let's just focus on making this view
controller right here remember a view
controllers essentially just like a new
screen
in an app anytime you switch from one
screen to the next that's moving from
one view controller to another view
controller so let's go ahead and focus
on this one basically we're just gonna
have one big label here that's gonna
show the emoji really really blown up
and then we're gonna have a definition
at the bottom saying you know what that
emoji is all about so let's go to our
storyboard we're back doing something
visual so we want a new view controller
here and we just want it to be a blank
view controller we don't want like you
know this table view controller or
anything like that so I'm just gonna
click drag this out into the storyboard
space and like I said the first thing
that we need to do is just add a big
label that's gonna hold an emoji so
let's search for a label down here click
and drag bring one out so I'm gonna
double click this so I can add a new
emoji and so I'm going to do that ctrl
command spacebar and I'm gonna bring
back that racecar because there's some
awesome stuff you need to know about
that so I'm gonna bring in the racecar
emoji here all right so we definitely
want this guy to be centered so I'm
gonna go ahead and say you should be
centered horizontally good then also it
has to be a you know we want to be like
a certain distance from like the top of
the screen so if you have your label
here selected and you click on this
little Thai fighter dude this little box
here you can have things on the screen
be you know a certain amount of space
from the left side the right side the
top the bottom whatever you want so I'm
gonna check this little red box right
here we're saying I want you know it to
be a certain space from the top and I
can pass some number into here so if I
say you know I want it to be 50 from the
top or I could say I want it to be 10
from the top I'm gonna say maybe
something like 20 that seems like good
spacing so I'm gonna add that constraint
and so now we know that this emoji label
should be centered and it should be 20
pixels from the top here alright so
let's go ahead and select this racecar
now and the kind of the cool thing about
our app is that we blow up the emojis
really really big so we can see all the
details and with this racecar you're
gonna find a cool little treat when we
blow it up so when we select this label
we're gonna have its font just be super
suit
big so I'm just gonna hit this up arrow
and we're gonna watch this puppy grow so
here comes the race car done and there
anyways I was singing just to pass the
time but look at this you can see like
the actual spokes on the wheels there's
like some writing on the side and check
this out
they snuck the swift logo on the side of
the like race car as like you know the
advertising or whatever like or a
sponsor isn't that cool I think that's
such a neat little thing when you like
zoom in on these like emoji details and
find stuff like this I think that's
great okay so we've got this big
blown-up emoji it looks awesome I don't
think we have to do anything else with
fixing this really the last thing that
we need to add to this view controller
is a label to provide the definition so
I'm gonna bring out another label and we
could have it be right below this emoji
if we wanted to you could also say I
want this to be a certain space from the
bottom I'm gonna elect this because I
want you to kind of gain this skill with
constraints of being able to say you
know it should be this far from the top
or the bottom the left the right
whatever
so with this label I'm gonna go to the
little Thai fighter dude here and rather
than Center it watch what I'm gonna do
here I'm gonna say you know what you
should be like 10 from the left 10 from
the right and probably 10 from the
bottom so you can see when I put those
number ins all these little red lines
should be you know fold and not like the
little dotted grayed out versions so I'm
saying you should be 10 from the left 10
from the right 10 from the bottom if I
say add constraints look what happens
you know it goes 10 from the left 10 for
the bottom 10 through right so it makes
this really long skinny label at the
bottom of the view controller here and
this looks good so let's go ahead and
write you know a definition here like a
race car
sponsored by Swift or something like
that okay so something that I would like
to fix about this is I'd rather have
like the text centered so if you have
this label selected under the is this
attributes inspector there we go
you can go ahead and say that this
should be centered and look at that
it's in the right position so if we want
to make sure that this looks good and
all the diff
phone sizes we can change what devices
we're looking at so we can go big with
like you know the iPhone 7 this still
looks fine we've still got the text down
there we can move down to like the SC
that's looking fine okay so I think that
passed our test but if we really want to
see what this looks like on the
simulator what I'm gonna do is grab this
arrow and I'm gonna drag it over to this
one to say this is the starting place in
our app because I just want to see what
our app even looks like so I'm gonna go
ahead and hit the Run button here we'll
see what this looks like and moment of
truth here it comes boom we got that
nice blown up race car we've got the
text below saying a race car sponsored
by Swift this looks good okay so that's
it for this lecture this was kind of a
quick one we have this all designed
really the next thing that we got to
focus on making it so that you know when
you tap on one of these you can actually
move over to this next view controller
alright so we already designed the first
view controller here we've designed the
second view controller we just got to
learn how to connect the two so the
first thing that I want to do is move
this arrow back to the original view
controller here the one that has the
table view inside of it and then let's
talk about how we can move from one to
the next well we can do that with
something called a segue a segue is just
whenever you move from one view
controller to the next one so if we
select this table view controller here
and you select it by picking that little
yellow circle there you hold down your
control key just like we've done when we
set outlets actions you know vertical
spacing all those things do a click drag
from here over to this next view
controller you can do it anywhere inside
of the view controller just as long as
it's got that blue highlight and we let
go and it's gonna say hey what type of
segue would you like to have here and we
want the one that's called show show is
the most common one that you're gonna
have so just go ahead and select that
one so you see when we do that now
there's this little arrow connecting the
two of these things and I think this is
so much fun
imma zoom out here like oops when when
you select this view controller no
matter where you move this guy if it's
gonna let me even move it there we go
this arrow finds a way to keep itself
connected and
yeah shout out to the Apple engineers to
figure out how to do this I think this
is kind of cool it doesn't really matter
where you have it on the screen I always
like to have them pretty close together
but anyways just wanted to show you that
so this segue this is what allows us to
move from the first view controller to
the second one and what we're gonna do
is we're gonna give this segue a name so
that in our code when someone taps on
one of those cells we can say hey go do
this segue so I can move over to the
next one so we're gonna select this
segue and under the attributes inspector
under identifier we're gonna give it a
name and I'm gonna call this our segue
okay so there we've got our name we'll
come back we're gonna need that in a
second and let's go into our code so
inside of the emoji table view
controller right like we want to know
whenever somebody taps on one of the
cells inside of the table view if I pull
up the simulator here
well we didn't have the table view shown
but whenever you click on one of it like
the background color changes or whatever
like we want to run some code when that
happens so we can do that by adding a
new function here and so to add a new
function to a view controller you've got
a it can't be inside and I want any one
of the other functions so it can't be
inside of like these curly brackets it
can't be inside of these or these so we
could put a new function between these
two we could put a new one here or we
could put one in at the bottom as long
as it's not after this curly bracket
because this curly bracket belongs up
here with this top one for the class so
classes basically have a bunch of
functions inside of them so anyways
you're gonna get more familiar with this
over time but I'm just saying probably
before the ending one but after you know
this guy here of this other function
just start typing table okay and you're
gonna scroll down you want to get the
function called did select row at now
please please please listen to me
there's two different functions that
have very similar names one is did
select row at index path one is did
deselect row at index path there's so
close together but you want did select
not deselect you want did select row and
index path if you do the deselect your
codes always gonna seem a bit off
because it's like whenever you untap the
thing it starts going
did I make this mistake all the time but
I mean I'm getting better because I've
helped so many students that have had
this problem like please please please
choose did select row index path so I
was hoping by being this dramatic that
this will be cemented in your mind and
you'll just always remember to pick the
did select row index path so go ahead
and just double click on that it's gonna
write out all this code here and now you
have this function that gives you this
little curly bracket space and any code
that you write inside of here is going
to be run whenever somebody taps on one
of the cells so just to test this I'm
just gonna say print tapped exclamation
point and so now whenever someone taps
on one of the cells we should see the
word tapped printed out inside of the
console let's see if this even works so
I'm going to hit run here on iphone
seven and it looks like oh we need to
provide the word override in front of
that so we're gonna sometimes you can do
this Xcode is very helpful if you just
click on the warning that it's giving
you and you click fix it'll you know do
the thing that's causing an error to
work it doesn't always happen sometimes
it makes your code worse but in this
case it was quite helpful so let's go
ahead and run this on the simulator okay
so we've got all of our cells here I
click on one boom look at that it says
tapped I click on another it says tapped
click on this one tap-tap tap-tap
tap-tap tap-tap and you can see this is
totally working okay but the code that
we actually want to run is that when
someone taps on one of these we want to
do the segway from this view controller
to the next one so we're going to select
this segway copy the name that we had
given it make sure you do the copy here
because the spelling the capitalization
everything has got to be perfect so I
really recommend just copying it make
sure there's no mistakes then we're
going to come over here and rather than
then print the word tapped
we are gonna type out perform segue and
look we want this one where it says
performs segue with identifier we'll
double click on that and it's asking for
the identifier it's asking for a string
saying hey you know what which segue do
you want to run here and if we paste in
the one that we had just copied we're
gonna say our segue and for the sender
thing we're going to talk about this in
the next lecture
but for now just type the words all
lowercase n il nil which basically means
don't pass anything through okay
so there you got it let's go ahead and
see if this works and our play button
here excited for this one okay so look
at this I tap on the avocado boom all
sudden we get to the next page with the
race car how cool was that so this is
great but we're missing one one thing
and that's that you know we don't have
the ability to go back here once we pick
one right like it'd be a dumb app if you
know you pick one thing it's like map
that was your emoji can't go back that
you know maybe restart the app that'll
fix things no no no we want that back
button so the way to fix this is we go
back to our storyboard and we have to
embed our first view controller and
what's called a navigation controller it
basically allows that functionality that
you can move you know forward with
segues and then hit the back button to
undo those segues so what we're going to
do is we're gonna select the table view
controller the one with the table you
select a yellow circle there then I'm
gonna say editor embed in navigation
controller so when you do that but all
this magic appears it adds this new
navigation controllers and moves the
starting arrow to that one and you'll
notice now it's really quite simple to
work with what we have now if we just
hit the Run button
okay our apps gonna open up here and
look at that all sudden there's now this
nice space at the top but more
importantly if I hit like the Apple I
can always go back so I can you know
select any of these that I want and I
can always go back and forth so is the
last piece that I want to do here just
to really cement and finish everything I
want to give a title up here at the top
this is called the navigation bar the
navigation item so if I select this view
controller and over here on the left
side there's this thing called the
navigation item if you select that you
can give it a title which I'm gonna give
it the title of emoji dictionary okay
and now when we run the app look what we
have here
Wow there we go we've got the nice tile
up there so people go oh yeah I'm using
the emoji dictionary it's a nice little
thing to have at the top there and just
because I really want to make sure this
is nice I don't like that when you hit
on one of these emojis that it doesn't
say back it says the name of the
previous navigation item so the way to
fix that is we select the same
navigation item and for the back button
we just give it the custom name of back
just like that and so now when we run
the app you can see it already shows up
here inside of the storyboard so we
should have good faith that this is
working but let's test it in the
simulator so now when we click one of
these look at that it tells us we can go
back which is great okay so we are
really cruising through the app really
the last thing we need to do is add it
yeah way to send emoji from here to here
so it's not always the racecar but we've
done a lot of code we probably should
have done a commit sooner than now but
this is definitely a good place you know
our app is working things are good so
let's go to get cracking here and let's
go up to our work-in-progress we want to
stage all the changes so I wanted so I'm
gonna unstaged you so real quick I
wanted you to notice that it deleted
where was it the view controller that
was part of one of them yeah I don't
know where it went but remember we
deleted that view controller that's now
part of this but anyways let's go ahead
and give this a commit so we'll say
created a table view and segue is
working I just kind of like to provide
some sort of little summary of what's
going on you can choose whatever title
you want but go ahead and do something
I'm gonna go ahead and commit these
changes and now we've got this nice
commit showing all the different things
that we worked with here now if you want
to you can go ahead and make a repo up
on github comm and then you know push
the code up there so that other people
they can get to it I'm just gonna keep
this as is for now but just wanted you
to see that we should should be making
commits here this is a process you want
to get used to so that in case anything
ever goes bad you can always go back
alright enough with this long lecture
we'll talk in the next one alright so we
are at a very good place in our app you
can see this first view controller is
completely done if I tap on one
these it does move over and we've got
two blown-up emoji but it's not showing
the correct one if I tap on the poo face
I want the poo face to show up on the
next one here so we're gonna talk about
how we can send information from one
view controller to the next so before we
can pass any information between the two
this table view controller we made a
file for it right called emoji table
view controller so it has one there we
haven't created one for this view
controller that has like the race car in
it and stuff now we haven't made one for
the navigation controller either but we
don't need to do anything there but this
guy here we need to be able to write
some code like you know set this labels
text to be equal to whatever the user
just selected and you know the
definition should be this thing or that
thing whatever it is so we want to make
a new file for this view controller so
what I'm gonna do is just tell you try
and go make a new view controller file
on your own so I'm gonna have you
actually pause the video remember we
made one for this guy here go make one
for this view controller hit the hit
pause and go try that right now okay so
hopefully that went well I'm not sure
anyways I'm here to walk you through it
I just want to kind of give you some
opportunities to go out and try this
stuff on your own so up here and the
file menu I'm gonna hit file new file to
make a new file who would have guessed
we want I oh s cocoa touch class double
click this and rather than having
subclass of uiviewcontroller we just
have a regular view controller this time
so we're gonna say capital UI view
controller so if you did this on your
own maybe that was a mistake you made
that you accidentally did subclass of UI
tableview controller don't worry you can
always just delete the one that you
created but we're gonna give this a name
so if we look at our app this is like
you know a list of all the table views
we call this emoji table view controller
let's maybe call this like emoji
definition view controller right because
this is where we're providing the blown
up one and the definition so let's go
ahead and say emoji definition view
controller as our name and the name of
these classes they're totally up to you
don't even have to have viewcontroller
on the end or in the other one table
view controller although it's just kind
of a good idea so that you know what
you're working with but yeah these are
totally up to you but we're gonna hit
next I'm gonna add this to our app there
we go look there it showed up I'm gonna
bring it up by its friends here this
doesn't change anything at all just
makes it so these are is a little more
organized over here and here you can see
we have our emoji definition view
controller now for to kind of simplify
things like we did last time I'm going
to get rid of this function called did
receive memory warning we don't need it
this commented out thing for navigation
we can go ahead and get rid of that
really all we want is this viewdidload
and we can get rid of the comment inside
of there okay so now that we created
this file
remember the mistake that I made last
time we have to connect this to the view
controller in the storyboard so we're
gonna go to our storyboard and we're
gonna select this view controller and
say hey under the little newspaper dude
your class is emoji definition view
control there it already filled it up so
I'm just gonna hit enter that sort of
does all the autocompletes and all that
good stuff now those two things are
connected okay so now that we have a
file for this view controller over here
let's talk about how we can pass
something from this view controller to
this one so inside of our emoji table
view controller make sure you're in the
right one the one that has all the
emojis there's actually a function that
gets called right before a segue happens
and that's what we call prepare for
segue so just type out prepare for and
don't do prepare for interface builder
we want prepare for segue so double
click on that and like I said this
function gets called right before you
move from one view controller to the
next and it's basically your chance to
pass anything over you know if you know
somebody selected something here
oh this other view controller should
know about it that's what can happen
here
so what we're going to do inside of here
is first what we've got to do is we have
to get access to the next view
controller and so we can do that through
one of these objects here this object
called set
so if we do segue dot destination you
can see it gives us a view controller
this is the destination the place that
the segue is taking us to so if we say
segue destination this is going to give
us our next view controller and we can
actually do some work on what's over
there
so what we're gonna do is inside of this
definition view controller moji
definition view controller is we're
gonna give it a property called
something like emoji okay so this is
where we're gonna hold whatever emoji
was selected so for right now we're just
gonna leave it as an empty string just
like this so just save our emoji is
equal to two quotation marks okay just
like that then we're gonna move back to
the table view controller and you're
gonna just have to trust me for a second
because we're gonna write a little bit
of advanced code in order to get this
stuff all working but what we're gonna
do is we're gonna say we're gonna make a
constant called emoji VC this is just
the name I came up with called you know
this is like the emoji maybe I should
say emoji def VC VC short for view
controller so I'm gonna say this is
equal to the Segway dot destination but
then I need to specify that it's going
to be this emoji definition view
controller so I'm going to say as
exclamation point emoji definition view
controller so I'm saying create a
constant called emoji def VC and it's
going to be equal to Segway destination
as exclamation point emoji definition
view controller so I'm not even gonna
attempt to explain what's going on here
I mean in essence we're saying oh this
view controller that you're moving to
it's this particular one here and you'll
know it worked out if you on this next
on this little constant that you made
called emoji let's see emoji def VC if
you do emoji def DC dot and then emoji
like this and oh maybe I'm gonna be
proven wrong sometimes it doesn't
autocomplete what you've done here so
what we're gonna do is do command B
which is a build it sort of just takes
everything in your code sort of updates
it real quick let's try this again so
emoji defi C dot and there it is emoji
so basically this is the same thing that
we just set right here like if I call
this emoji dude okay and I'm gonna hit
build again so it kind of saves and
updates everything let's go back to the
file system and this code here now I
could type for example emoji dude so you
can see where essentially we have access
now to this variable over here and let's
just change it back to regular old emoji
okay
so with this we can say this emoji
should be equal to something I'm just
gonna set it equal to something like we
did it
exclamation point alright so to see if
this is working what we're going to do
is because essentially what we said in
this chunk of code here's we've said
okay go get the viewcontroller that
we're moving to and set its emoji
variable equal to you we did it and so
if we go back here to this guy this
viewdidload function this gets run when
the view controller shows up for the
first time so let's go ahead and print
whatever is inside of emoji okay
got to put the actual variable name
there and so what should happen is when
we click on or tap on one of the cells
it should do this Segway and then it's
gonna call this prepare for Segway and
we're gonna say oh go get this
definition view controllers emoji
variable set it equal to we did it and
then once it opens up its going to print
that okay so let's go ahead and give it
a test here big moment of truth and I'm
gonna tap on one of these oh look at
that it printed out we did it so we know
we're on the right path here that we're
actually sending forward some
information woo oh this is cool because
remember the big thing that we've
accomplished here is we were
successfully able to pass something from
let me get to our sketch here from this
view controller onto the next one okay
so in the next lecture we're gonna make
it so that we can actually get the emoji
that was tapped on send it over to the
next view controller and have it
displayed and big and you know get the
definitions to show up and all that good
stuff alright this is gonna be the
lecture where we axe
get the emoji that you tap on to show up
in big on the next view controller let's
dive into it so what we've got to focus
on is this prepare for segue function
right like we don't want to send we did
it this is where we want to actually
send in emoji so what we're going to do
is so we've got to get whatever you know
emoji the user tapped on we have to get
it to show up here so the way to
actually do this is remember this
perform segue function that we typed out
here in the sender thing in the sender
this is where we actually want to pass
the emoji so just to test and see if
this is working I'm gonna put an emoji
inside of here so we're just gonna put a
string emoji and let's put like the gas
emoji right there and to know that this
is working so this whatever you put in
sender here is gonna come out in this
function here and so what we can do is
actually say here rather than just
saying we did it we're gonna say this
emoji variable is equal to sender as
exclamation point capital string so
we're saying the thing that came through
here is a string and I know these these
as things we're gonna get to this when
we talk about optionals but for the time
being just trust me on this okay so
let's see if this works if what we were
able to put in here
gets passed into this function and then
ultimately gets passed in this variable
and gets printed out so let's hit the
Run button it's kind of be our little
experiment that we ran all right
simulators here and I tap on it could be
any one of them but look at that the gas
you know emoji shows up that means we
were successful in that
so really the last thing that we need to
do is we don't want to pass the gas tank
we want to pass whatever emoji the user
selected so for example if it's the poo
emoji the race car whatever it is we
want to actually pass that over so
you'll notice this function here it
gives us an index path just like this
cell for row at index path function gave
us so we can actually use that to go get
the correct emoji out of the array
because it's gonna tell us like hey you
tapped cell number four or you know you
tapped cell number zero cell number one
2-8 I don't know whatever it is that
they tap so we can actually do a line of
code here we say all right let emoji so
we're making a constant here we're gonna
say let emoji be equal to emojis with an
S so let's get the array and then we're
gonna pass in the index of index path
dot row so this will tell us whatever
one they selected it puts it in this
constant and now we can pass emoji
rather than just doing like the
gas-station emoji right there so this
should take whatever it is that they
selected pulls it out of the array puts
it into this perform segue which then
goes to here which then passes it to
this view controller which then prints
it out a lot of steps that were going
through here but it should be worth it
let's run and see what we get all right
simulator don't let us down opens up all
right so lava cod Oh will we see you
down here oh yeah oh yeah let's try it
with something else let's do the Apple
my goodness we are doing great so the
awesome thing is we now have the correct
emoji showing up inside of this emoji
definition view controller we have
access to it via this variable right
here the last thing that we need to do
is just update this label to say hey
show whatever one they selected instead
of the racecar and then provide a
definition so let's focus on just this
label right now so we're gonna go to our
storyboard we're gonna select this label
and we're gonna do our split screen here
this should be showing when you select
this label the emoji definition view
controller again it's not showing up
click here you got to change it to
automatic if it was saying like manual
before go ahead and change this to
automatic and we're gonna bring over
this label as an outlet so I'm gonna do
a control drag I'm gonna put it below
the class but above where we have our
mode you could go below but you know I
think this is a good spot and I'm gonna
call this emoji label okay so I'm gonna
connect that let's go back to fullscreen
and now inside of our viewdidload rather
than printing the emoji we're gonna say
set whatever the emoji labels text
should be so we're gonna say emoji
label dot text and we're gonna set this
equal to this emoji variable here which
should have had the correct emoji passed
into its oldest put emoji there and
moment of truth here I'm excited really
it's this and then we got to figure out
the definition stuff but we are we are
real close so app opens up let's see if
we can see this big smiley face oh yeah
we can see that big smiley face let's
see a big pile of poo yeah look at that
we see the nice detailed swirl on this
do a little bit of shading on the mouth
avocado wow that's just you can see the
like walnut' features on the core it's
probably not walnut but anyways look at
this we got like the the church so I did
want to show you one special one here
not the love Church but the actual
church emoji I'm gonna find it now
because it's worth it to see this cool
little detail so I'm gonna add another
emoji to our array which remember all we
have to do is add one and you know our
code automatically shows it up inside of
the table view so look there's the
church I finally found it and it looks
like there was one more Church that I
thought looked really cool that might be
interesting to see the details on so
we'll pass that one as well but let's go
ahead and run this alright app opens up
so I'm gonna click on this church first
look at this the stained-glass window
like there's actual stained-glass
windows inside of this church like they
look like little bubbles or like
whatever but when the emojis like this
small you don't really notice this like
oh yeah that's the church it looks like
it from there but when you blow it up
like man someone gave this freaking
church like stained-glass windows and I
was interested because there's a window
looking thing on this church look at
that I think that's the Star of David
I'm not the greatest on religions but
yeah I mean that's kind of cool to see
like you know the intricate details like
there's like steps to this church all
sorts of cool stuff when you like blow
up emojis and see what they look like
the Apple they're kind of
straightforward but look the leaf it's
got the little line in there I don't
know I I think this stuff is fascinating
alright we're gonna pause here one more
lecture that's going to
talk about how we can get the definition
to be the right definition for each
thing but we are getting really really
close all right for the last piece of
functionality that we need here if I
click on the avocado I want avvocato to
show up here inside of the definition so
first thing that we should probably do
is connect this label to the view
controller code so I'm gonna go back to
the storyboard and we'll select this
label here do our split screen and we're
gonna just move it up by its emoji label
friends so I'm gonna just do a control
drag right up there and I'm gonna call
this emoji definition label just like
that okay so now we've got those two
outlets let's go back to the full screen
and inside of here we're gonna talk
about how we can get the correct
definition to show up for the correct
emoji and what we're going to use is if
statements so basically we're gonna use
an if statement to say if the you know
emoji here is the Apple emoji then we
should provide the definition of this or
if it's you know some other thing we're
gonna do that so I'm gonna present this
as a challenge this is gonna kind of
stretch you a little bit because you got
to put a lot of pieces that we've
learned together but I think this is a
good thing please really try this
challenge even if you get stuck you know
maybe go back and watch some other
lectures Google you know your question
that you have or something that you're
stuck on because I want you to feel that
process of doing something on your own
so what I want you to do is make an if
statement that says for example if this
emoji is the avocado then set the
definition labels text to be equal to
evoke Oddo so go try that on your own
hit pause now okay so how did it go I
hope you really gave it the old college
try and try to get this thing working
let me show you how you can do this so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create a series of if statements here so
the first one we're just gonna say if
emoji right which is this string here
we're gonna say if this is equal to and
you got to use the two equal sign and
let's just go get that avocado emoji in
fact we're going to need a lot of these
so I'm just gonna copy this array of
emoji
and I'm going to paste it right here as
a comment this is kind of a cool way to
use a comment I'm gonna say if you know
the emoji is equal to avocado then I'm
going to say emoji definition label dot
text I'm gonna set it equal to a nice
ripe avocado or something like that okay
so let's go ahead and see if this works
if it does we'll add it for a couple of
the other emojis I don't know if I'm
gonna do all of them I'll let you do
that if you're interested in it but here
we go
simulator coming up I will say the
simulator has been launching much faster
than it has in the past I remember when
I first started coding you'd hit run and
it was like four minutes later okay here
comes my happened so anyways shout out
to Apple so if I select anything else
like the pooh emoji is still showing the
race car won but if I select the avocado
Oh nice ripe avocado okay it's working
so let's do this for a few other ones
I'm going to copy this if statement
maybe paste it two more times down below
so we'll say if it is the church emoji
we're gonna say a church with stained
glass and we'll do one more here we're
gonna all with the race car was the
default one so let's do this happy face
so I'm gonna copy paste this one here
we're gonna say a happy smiling face
okay so let's go ahead and try this out
okay so if I select for example the
church a church with stained glass
avocado we know that one's working
nice let's do it for the smiley face hey
a happy smiling face and then for the
ones that we haven't provided something
for is still just saying a race car
sponsored by Swift so if you'd like to
you can go fill these in for all the
other emojis that you have I just think
you know you don't want to watch me
typing and copy and pasting five times
in row here to finish this out but
congratulations
we finished the up I have a lot of
things to say but let's save them for
the outro oh my goodness we can't finish
now I'd be a horrible teacher if I
didn't finish by committing our code
into our git repo so let's go ahead and
do that now we're gonna open up get
crackin we'll go here stage everything
and I'll say we have version 1.0 woohoo
exclamation point of the description
let's just say we and let's do the heart
this will be kind of cool say we why are
the hearts in this thing nobody have a
heart anymore
oh there's a lot of hearts we heart
emojis okay so we make that commit now
we've got this one here all of our codes
checked in whoo okay I finished thing I
thought yeah we did it but I was like oh
we didn't commit so gotta get in this
practice I'm not perfect at it but make
sure you do commits it so in case you
ever have something go wrong whoa how
cool was that man we made a polished
finished app I love the whole process of
you know first creating the sketch pen
and paper what it is that we want to do
kind of thinking through you know
where's this button gonna be where's
that where should we put the definition
and stuff you know then we walk through
that and then we just started step by
step so we said first thing we got to do
is we've got to figure out the table
view and then once we've got that okay
we gotta you know get the mogees to show
up there from our array then we got to
figure out how to get them to the next
view controller do all that set the
definition put in the navigation control
all that stuff just step by step
we've got it done so hopefully your
confidence as an app developer is
building get ready to hear more about
table views because we're gonna use them
literally in every app that we build in
this class so you know just you're gonna
get really good at it if right now you
kind of shaky like I sort of get the
table view not really don't worry you're
gonna have plenty of times to practice
because we're gonna be using it every
single time also hopefully enjoyed
learning about arrays that was just
another thing in Swift that we're
learning as we move on to our next apps
we're gonna you know keep learning more
and more Swift Khan
steps until you're feeling really
comfortable with that so pat on the back
for finishing what I consider a complete
really nice-looking app also Congrats on
learning about table views these are
such a big part of you know being an iOS
