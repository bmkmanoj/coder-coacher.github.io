let's look at dictionaries in this
lecture this far we looked at strings we
looked at least and tuples assume now we
have yet another data type now these are
dictionaries let me open the Python
shell and let me create a list first I'm
just creating this for reference so to
compare this with dictionaries but you
don't need to create a list for
catherine dictionary so to create a
dictionary you need curly brackets so
open and I'm closing curly bracket alone
inside that you'd pass the items of
dictionary now the difference here with
dictionaries is that instead of letting
Python add default indexes for your
items you want to create those indexes
yourself explicitly so therefore for
dictionaries you do something like this
name a column and then the item let me
write another one surname colon and then
the other item and yeah that's it
that's the dictionary so what we have
here is when I was talking about
indexing I was referring to these things
actually these two are referred to as
keys not indexes for so for dictionaries
you can create custom indexes so to say
and so these are keys so we have key and
value key and value this is good because
now if you want to access one of the
values of the dictionary again you'd use
square brackets just as you did with
strings lists and tuples
there you pass the key which value you
want to extract so if you want to
extract John you want to pass the key of
John that will extract John value
something to note is that dictionaries
are unordered collection of items so
sometimes you may notice that the order
of the key and values is not maintained
so you may see that surname has gone the
first place so surname Smith the pair
has gone the first one and name John is
the second one and so on
so this is different from lists as
strings and tuples and the very same
Python doesn't keep the order is that
you know the way you access dictionaries
is you exclusively pass the key of the
dictionary when you access it and so you
don't need to know the order of
dictionary and whenever you want to
access something you say surname for
instance and that will return Smith no
matter where Smith is so whether it is
the first one second or hour and so on
and interestingly in dictionaries you
can also pass you can have like lists as
values or even tuples so let me write a
circle there or I wouldn't keep it like
that
and let me add another compare here
let's say cities let's say John Smith
lived in three cities portal and
San Diego and Bali you close bracket
there so as you see we have the key here
we have a colon and then you have the
value which can be anything so it can be
a string at being a number it can be at
least a tuple in this case that's a
tuple so if you access now cities like
that you'd get a solo hat two brackets
there so you'd get the tuple and then
you can also do tricks like you know if
you want to access Bali you'd have other
brackets there and pass to that will
return Bali so why is that that's
because you know up to here you have a
tuple but that's that's a tuple object
and then from that tuple you use again
the square brackets notation to access
an item from that tuple so you won't
item with index 2 and that is Bali and
yeah that's about dictionaries try them
out small play around and you will be
able to comfortably create and access
items from from a dictionary so hope you
enjoy this and talk to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
