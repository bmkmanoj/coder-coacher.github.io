added to the CCNA it's important that
you have an understanding of how to
configure BGP as well as how to
troubleshoot a BGP in a previous video I
showed you the configuration of this
topology this is a troubleshooting video
and in this scenario we've been told
that rudder one on the left is not able
to ping the loop back of router fall in
other words router one is not able to
paying for dat 4.4.4 and that's true as
we can see here so let's do a trace and
see what happens at the moment it looks
like the trace is not going anywhere
we're not seeing it hit right at 2 so
let's confirm that we have the right in
the routing table so show IP BGP
okay so quadruple 4 is not shown in the
VTP routing table which means it won't
appear in the IP routing table which
means you won't be able to ping that
network show IP BGP shows us that we are
receiving routes from a neighbor 17
1.1.2 so in other words routed to is
advertising rats to us we are as an
example learning about Network 15
so can we ping 15.1 that 1.2 yes we can
so in other words we have IP
connectivity and we can just prove that
by doing a trace through the network to
the gigabit 0/0 interface on router for
but we can't get to the loopback of
router for so that probably means that
there's an issue on router for so show
IP BGP notice the network 4.4.4 at 4
does not appear in the BGP routing table
show IP interface brief that network is
configured on the loopback interface
is it advertised in bgp so show run pipe
section BGP we do see a network command
advertising that loop back into BGP so
what do you think is the problem have
you got any ideas at the moment what the
problem could be so to help you with
that let's have a look at the
configuration of the loopback interface
hopefully at this point you should see
where the problem is what's been done
wrong in this configuration
okay it's really important in BGP that
you configure the network command
correctly the network command doesn't do
what it does in IGP such as OSPF or
EIGRP it doesn't enable the writing
protocol on that interface and then
advertise that network through the
writing protocol what it does is it
looks for a router that matches the
network command in the IP routing table
and then advertises that into bgp so if
we type show IP route pipe include for
we do have a raft in the IP routing
table but notice the problem this is a /
32 network based on that configuration
BGP is looking for a / 24 Network it
will only advertise the network if
there's an exact match on the mask so
once again show IP BGP shows us that the
rod is not advertised in BGP this is
what our BGP configuration looks like at
the moment so let's configure that
correctly so no and I'll just copy and
paste this network for
and then we need to do that again 4.4.4
at for mask 255 255 255 255 so show run
pipe section bgp that's what our
configuration looks like now show IP BGP
notice bgp found the network in the IP
routing table show IP route pipe include
4 and I'll just use a regular expression
this just means that it's looking for a
dot
it's a 4.4 we can see that a network is
directly connected on the loopback
it's a slash 32
we can see that by looking for that
option so a / 32 Network this command
matches this exact entry / 82 mask so
it's advertised in BGP
so now he's rather one learning about
that network through BGP yes it is
so hopefully should be able to ping
quadruple fall and it can so that was an
example of how to troubleshoot BGP the
lesson to learn here is that the network
command is a standard mask it's not an
inverse mask and it has to match
networks exactly so this network as an
example matches this entry here and
hence the local router will advertise
that network through BGP and that will
be learnt by remote routers
