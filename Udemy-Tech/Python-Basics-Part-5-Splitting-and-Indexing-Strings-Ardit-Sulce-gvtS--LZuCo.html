talked about streams and in this lecture
again we are going deeper into learning
strings specifically we're going to look
at indexing indexing is a very important
concept not only with strings but with
other data lies that we'll be looking at
later such as lists and tuples and
dictionaries so please follow this
lecture now let's talk about indexing
let me open a Python interactive session
let me create a string hi there
exclamation mark and close quote now
when you create a string every stream
that you create Python under the hood
what it does is it assigns a number to
each of the items of your string so it
starts from 0 so age will be assigned an
index of 0 and then a 1 for I 2 for the
Y space three forty four five six seven
eight
so the exclamation mark character will
will have an index of eight so you would
ask why is this useful well this allows
you to extract certain parts from a
string and there is a certain notation
to do that you'd want to access the
string so in this case that's the
variable see holding the string then you
want to use square brackets so an
opening square bracket and then a
closing square bracket and so those
square brackets you pass the index of
the item that you want to extract let's
say I want the t character so that would
be 0 1 2 3 I pass number 3 there as an
index and that will extract for me a
letter T which is actually a string
so you can check the type or the outfit
and you'll see that that's a string so a
string is made of strings you can say so
if you wanted age you'd pass zero and if
you wanted a lost character well you
might have to count so one two three
four five six seven eight
so sorry I'm including type there sorry
about that
so see eight would give you the
exclamation mark but there's also
another indexing system there that
Python uses and so in this case we had
to count from the beginning to the end
of the string but wouldn't it be useful
if you had another system that lets you
count from the and so from right to left
well sotiently system exists and it
starts from minus 1 so the exclamation
mark would be minus 1 now that you can
extract that with that monster would be
e RB minus 3 and so on
off to age so we have 2 indexing systems
there which allow you to extract items
depending on whether the items are in
the beginning or near the end now what
if you want to extract more than one
item from a string let's say you want to
extract high well there is a notation
for that - so uh high is expanding from
index 0 to index 1 so up till here so
let's try 0 to 1 that will not work a
very good but let's see so as I said
this will return only H so it doesn't
return item with index 1 that's because
splitting in Python so we were splitting
a string here splitting in Python is
upper bound exclusive which means that
the upper bounds of the split here is
not included
the output so if you want to include eye
you'd want to pass the index after eye
which is to so this is a string just for
reference and so we extracted item with
index 0 and item with index 1 and then
the split starts right there at index 2
so it doesn't include the space just hi
if you pass 3 there that would include
the white space as well and similarly
you can pass like 1 and that will
include eye and the space there are also
a shortcuts so if you pass 0 like
nothing to 3 that is the same as doing 0
to 3 so it will include 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 and
similarly if you want to extract there
with the exclamation mark
well what you'd want to do is T would
have an index of 0 1 2 3 so 3 and then
you can just pass a color there and
execute it and that will give you there
with the exclamation mark let's now try
to extract or and e using negative
indexing so something to know is that
even though we are using a negative
indexing which starts from right to left
the splitting will work from left to
right which means the first index you
want to pass is that of the first item
so are we passed minus 3 for our because
you know we have minus 1 minus 2 and
minus 3 so minus 3 for our and then we
want e which is minus 2 but since
splitting is upper bounds exclusive we
want to pass - while there so let's try
that minus 1
execute annyeong we get the correct
output that's the idea if you didn't
pass anything here you'd get the
exclamation mark as well so it will take
a while until you get used to this but
with some practice you'll be able to
remember these notations and yeah that's
what I wanted to cover in this lecture
so this was about string indexing and
splitting so you split using the index
that Python uses all the background you
know I hope you enjoy this and I'll talk
to you later but thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
