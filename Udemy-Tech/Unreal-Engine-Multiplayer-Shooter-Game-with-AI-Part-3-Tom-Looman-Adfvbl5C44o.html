have set the fire function we redid the
processing of the line trace so now
let's do something with this line trace
data and the data is all inside of this
F hit result if we all G into this you
can see there's a whole bunch of
information available and there's a few
things that are very interesting
especially the actor that we hit which
is over here the physical material that
we hit which we could use for things
like did we hit the rock that we had
some kind of wood and then we can you
know change the type of particle effects
that you play or the sound effects or in
the case of a player for example we
could use this as as a way to figure out
if we did perform a hit a head shot or
if we hit the body or the feet and then
we can apply different multipliers based
on you know if it was a head shot or not
and there's a whole there's a quite a
few a lot of information in here but we
really only need a few so let's get
started by grabbing the actor so let's
call it hit actor actor alright okay so
now let's apply some damage that's
actually very easy to do we can just get
the game play statics so let's try to
encode that let's see no it does not
find it for us so let's include kiss man
/ gameplay statics okay so apply damage
we have a few variations here apply
damage by point damage and radial damage
and real damage will fall now the first
one is just the most generic
miscellaneous damage that we can apply
this
you know could be maybe it's a male
ahead or maybe it's some kind of poison
damage or whatever we since we are a
hits can light a point damage type of
weapon we have enough information to
apply it as a point damage now this has
a few benefits one of them is we can
pass in more information we can say from
what direction it we hit exactly on what
point that we hit the character and that
could be useful for example if you want
to apply a physics impulse so let's see
we pass in a damaged actor we have some
kind of base damage let's just put in 24
now we can we'll make this variable in a
second we should specify a shut
direction so let's make a new vector
over here and use eye rotation of vector
and then immediate we can also replace
this eye rotation vector here because it
is basically the same thing okay so the
shot direction will just pass it in and
he hit info well we have that we have
this whole array I mean this whole
struct here and then it is expecting an
event instigator we have the owner right
here we don't immediately know the event
instigator so let's see if we can get
that instigator get instigator
controller there we go
so that will grab the instigator for us
and then we have a damage caused er
which will be this there's the weapon
and finally we need to specify a damage
type and it's not an instance of a
damage type it is expecting a T subclass
off yeah we'll make the variable
immediately T subclass off you damage
type
so damaged type and I will just for
declare that like some this is a please
subclass off instead of something like
this where it would be like an instance
of the object and that is simply because
of the way that unreal implemented their
whole damage system they we never use
instances of damage types because you
never have to change variables in a
damage type so we can just use subclass
off and that with that we already have
enough information to figure out what
kind of impulse to add or what kind of
other effects apply if we strictly step
in we can see what is available so
there's not a whole lot it's mostly
about impulses and who caused it but we
could extend this add something like a
fire damage or if it was poison damage
something like that okay
so let's see we oh yeah let's pass in
the damage type in for now we just have
to make sure that we expose this
variable so we can actually see it in a
blueprint we can assign it and it
defaults only because we really only
need to edit this in the editor and not
at runtime and let's say let's call it
blueprint read-only in just in case we
want to be able to show this summer
maybe in the hood or wherever and we'll
call this web weapon Caterpie okay
that's easy enough okay when that's done
compiling we're ready to go into the
next lecture well where we create a
target dummy to actually test out his
point damage
okay when we're back in the editor we
will create a target dummy something to
quickly test out this damage application
have we done so let's right-click open a
blueprint new blip in class let's bake
actor and just call this VP target dummy
there you go so we can drag this in
already and then let's double click so
we can edit this blueprint now I'd like
to add a skeletal mesh we're gonna have
the mannequin mesh that we use for our
character and we don't need to set any
mate animation so that doesn't matter
for now and because it's just a target
dummy and you know let's just drag this
on to be the root because we don't need
that default scene root okay now if you
jump to the event graph that isn't open
you can always double click here and we
will add events to respawn to this
damage so let's right-click and type in
damage and here you see any damage point
damage or radial damage now any damage
will always be called even if it's a
point damage but we we know specifically
that we're interested in point damage so
let's click on that one and then we see
we have some damage value with the
damaged type hit location it normal with
all of this information on what was hit
so let's simply start off by printing
this and let's just start with print
string and enter it like that okay so
now we have this character the spacebar
and then rotate it just so we have the
orientation press spacebar two more
times to switch you can also switch with
these okay let's play and one thing I
would like to do now it's just move to
with this camera or move the camera a
little to the right because it's not
quite easy to aim yet
so we'll just double click and open up
the player bond and I'll go to viewport
and let's move this camera around a
little bit so you can just unset it oh
wait let's go back controls it and I
would like to how use the grid again
it's much nicer ok so let's just try 20
units let's play mmm they don't know
really make much of a difference let's
try another 20 and play ok so if we try
this out you can see that we we're
supposed to be hitting it hitting this
but it's nothing's happening
so let's dive into the dargah dummy and
see why so if you select skeletal mesh
and we'll check the collision and you'll
see that it's set there's no collision
which is a little silly I don't know why
that happened but let's just set it to
block all so we can see that all these
channels are blocked most importantly
our visibility channel because that's
the one we're tracing with and collision
is enabled
ok let's go back and this is one more
time now we can see that when we shoot
it we could see that we're actually
hitting it and we seem to see the damage
that was applied okay so let's make this
a little nicer let's just delete this
and we'll use the hit location to draw a
sphere where exactly we hit it unlike
just draw yeah let's our thrust appears
here strong debug sphere there we go set
this up use the hit location for the
sender that's for the radius do
something like 20 line color let's make
it very noticeable so let's make it
something proper yellow duration will be
about a second and let's make it a
little thick so it's easier to see and
what else
mmm I think that's good for now so let's
go back and play again
and now whenever we hit every day hits
something else we don't see anything and
that is because you know we only
implement this on that mannequin on a
target on maybe specifically and you
know let's make it a little smaller so
we have a lid of a better view of what's
happening so let's make it maybe five it
doesn't really matter but it's nice to
just be able to see you know where we
hit something
there we go this is not a very exciting
way to visualize this you know in in a
few lectures we have some particle
effect spawning when we impact something
we'll have a bit of a better camera
position with a crosshair but for now we
know that this is working we are able to
apply damage okay so for now this was a
very quick way to test our setup and now
let's start adding some effects in the
next lecture hey guys so I hope you
enjoyed that preview of what you can
learn in my udemy course which teaches
you about C++ creating AI and also
creating multiplayer games for unrelated
for there's a discount link in the
description of this video that will take
you to my course with a special youtube
dis game so please enroll today and
let's start making games for unmentioned
for together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
