this video we're gonna dari quickly look
at how to create atmosphere in your
unity game by playing around in unities
lighting window and let's jump in and
have a look so let me give you the
context here for what's going on we've
created a rail shooter' this is my
terrain that's the world I've got
enemies that are on paths using unities
timeline system I'll just hit play here
and you can see a little bit you can
move left right up down and shoot there
we go just little bit of context emerald
slick bar comes along says hello and
back and all that kind of good stuff and
shoot your score goes up you can crash
if you smack into that and all that kind
of wonderful things so that's the game
that we've got and at the moment it
doesn't look so atmospheric does it it's
it's using the default skybox and if you
guys have used unity at all you are yep
that's the default skybox alright and it
looks like it's the middle of the day on
a nice summer's day it doesn't really
say that we're under attack if I scrub
through my timeline here you can see
there's enemies flying around and
they're gonna be shooting lasers flying
all over the place and that's not really
matching without atmosphere so want to
have a look at that happens for your
first step is skybox if you guys have
been through any of my courses you know
that I love Unity's asset store big fan
of that you can access it right from
within the unity windows in here and go
window and then asset store just in
there or control 9 let me search for
planet skybox see what that brings up
I'm gonna go and drag the price all the
way down to cheapskate
cheapskate I think it's a cheapskate
anyway down to free not gonna pay for it
at this point in time and I like this
skybox volume to over here by the
Hedgehog team very fantastic Thank You
Hedgehog team these guys produce good
stuff and you guys might know this
already but click import go through that
process I've already downloaded it so
all I need to do is import it's gonna
think for a while
throughout this list of stuff make sure
you check through it's all good and the
sort of things you want to put in there
and then click import I've already done
that so I'm not gonna do it again but
you click import take a little bit of
time then we don't need to go find it
it's as easy as going over to our
lighting tab
back into the scene so you can see
what's going on and over in our lighting
window if you don't have that then a
window and find lighting settings from
our lighting window the very first thing
I hear default skybox I'm gonna click on
the selector and select just type in
skybox you can see here they're in mine
I've got this skybox green as soon as I
click it everything changes
instant atmosphere I think if I just
scroll out the player is not going to
see the world quite like this but I
think that's a pretty nifty looking
skybox nifty looking world come back
into where the player is going to be
have a look around
one thing that I've done in my lighting
window here is scroll all the way down
the bottom I've turned off Auto generate
sometimes if you've got Auto generate it
sits there Auto generating for hours
thinking about what's going on while I'm
still just playing around with things
and I remember and I'm actively in the
lighting I like to just go and click the
generate lighting button to get it to go
through its process to to do some
calculations and then at the end of it
if I stall for a moment I also find it's
quicker when you click on it then if you
just leave it auto generating for ages
there we go and what it's done is
applied the lighting coming from the Sky
box as part of the treatment on our
world so it's got I think a darker
there's more contrast more more of this
shadow within our textures here because
we're using a really nice normal map on
our textures I think that's a really
nice nice look much nicer than and going
down to the beach look that we had
before we scroll up here you can see the
environment lighting is using skybox as
a source we could use color and just go
in there and say let's make it pink or
let's make it a bright green and then
everything will have that applied to it
in the world I like it coming from the
skybox because then if the player does
have a moment to look up into the sky
they can see these sorts of colors and
there's a relationship between those
colors and the world ok that's step
number one step number two when you
started your scene you would have had a
main light I've renamed it sunlight over
here we can drag sunlight into the Sun
source just so if you were to have a
second or third or fourth directional
light and just let me recap on that
light a directional light there's a
second one if I've got two in there then
everything's super bright I'm gonna
delete that one I just created that's
the direction light that ivory now
Sonlight if you don't have two or three
then you can drag over in here and say
this is the sun source which is
basically the most important light and
that'll set the direction of the
lighting so wherever we've got this the
direction of that at the moment it's
hidden underground but you can see is
heading in that direction that's also
the direction that will be used for the
sky box when calculating the impact of
the sky box so if we have multiple
lights directional lights then we want
to make sure we say which one the Sun is
I've only got one at the moment
and often it starts if just standard
let's go have a look at it you know
inspector just standard white color one
intensity which is fine but I want to
have a little bit more of interplanetary
color coming through here so I'm going
to change this to a more of a bluey look
you can see it has a really nice impact
when we change this main light a little
bit more purpley there we go I don't
want it to be too overpowered I don't
want you to look at it and say well
someone's put an Instagram filter on
this but something that has more of a
softer feel overall quite like that more
atmosphere is what we're going for here
and then we can punch it up with lights
in our scene a little bit darker and
then we can add lights - let me just hit
play for a second here - things like our
Rockets our spaceships we've got these
lights they really pop out you can see
them glowing as you're coming along and
our lasers really glow so a little bit
of a darker contrast dear world means
our lights when we put them in later on
have a really big impact okay and the
last thing we're going to look at in the
lighting window it's not something you
need for all games but I think this one
it helps a little bit is fog scroll all
the way down the bottom in the lighting
window we can click on fog I've got it
set up already with a color that I think
is okay for me but you can again click
here and play around with the color
that's way too bright and down there I
think it's dark I like darker in this
particular setup I've got a few
different modes linear exponential
exponential squared honestly I just tend
to get in there and play around with
what I think looks good I like linear
that it has this more consistent
drop-off I can say what the start and
end point is if I make the end point
closer to the camera then it's going to
be a lot darker in here it's based upon
where the camera is right now so it's my
viewport is showing the fog when I was
to click play then
show based upon where the camera is in
the game there we go so if I want it to
be super weird and foggy if you're
making more of a horror game then you
might want to have stronger fog for me
it's just a way I'm going to put it back
to 500 just a way of softening what's
going on off in the distance so that the
enemies pop a little bit more against
the background so that they do look way
off in the distance
and as I get closer to them the details
are revealed a little bit more so it's a
little bit less obvious what's coming
down the pipeline in the future and I
just generally I think again creating
some atmosphere if you look outside your
window and you've got a distant view way
often in the distance the mountains
further away more blurry they're not
crystal clear if I turn the fog off
again you can see all these details way
back there and this just makes it a
little bit more atmospheric by doing
that let's click on generate lighting
one last time just to make sure we've
got our final lighting in the scene so
there we go there's the final product
flying through the scene you can see the
impact that it has with our skybox the
big planets way off in the distance the
jet particle boosters I've got coming
out the back of my planes really stand
out now you can see them off in the
distance I think overall very quick that
took us what 10 minutes and we've got a
far more atmospheric game than we had
before there we have it thanks for
watching you guys if you have any
thoughts on your own ways of creating
atmosphere I'd love to hear from you
guys in the comments let us know how you
create atmosphere and I hope to see you
sometime soon in one of our courses see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
