video we're gonna be covering what's
known as the if-then logic you guys know
it probably as if our statements and
else if statements these are your main
basic logical operators you can't get
away without using them so the reason
why the court if-then is because it's
literally as it sounds for instance you
have and you have in for instance it
looks like this so if if then do this
okay so it's calling F n all right so if
condition then do this that makes sense
all right so for instance if let's go
and create a variable for our age so we
have here all right so I'm 22 now in
order for an if-then statement to work
which is just an if statement in order
for it to work it has to be inside a
method or function a method and function
or the exact same thing they used
interchangeably so this is a method or
function called void start and inside
here you can put an if statement
the syntax for one is an if condition
brackets and then and then the open
close and curly braces inside here goes
your condition and then this is your
then logic so if this is a true
condition then run this code alright so
for instance I want to know if my age is
greater 19th so this is where also
awkward logical operators come in so for
instance if my age I can just say my age
here which is going to get replaced with
at 22 is greater than 18 now if that's a
true condition then this will be called
so I can go ahead and say debug log I am
greater or I am over 18 so if we go
ahead and just go to unity and we put
this on our main camera you'll see on my
age there now if we go and run it
you'll see here in the console then it
says I am older than 18 alright so this
is how it works so we can do all sorts
of things for this so for instance this
is an example of doing my age now what
if I wasn't 18 I wanted to say I'm not
18 or what if I was like what if I'm not
older than 18 I want to print out I'm
not older than 18 the way we do that is
with an else theme so what we're gonna
do here is I have here an else I'm gonna
rewrite it so if I'm not older than 18 I
go ahead and say else and then I can say
if I've got long
you're not older than 18 all right so
with this we have an if condition here
now if this is a true condition if my
age which is 22 is greater than 18 this
will get called if it's a false
condition it's gonna drop down to the
else which is down here alright so if
we're going to test that out and if I go
ahead and change my age here just say 17
and I run it alright you'll see here
you're not older than 18 so our first
condition was ignored because it wasn't
true so now what if I had what if I
wanted to check for something else this
is where what's called an if-else
statement comes in so for instance say I
wanted to also check for if my age is
greater than 18 or if my age is less
than five L was invalid you know what if
I'm just drinking for those two things
for as an example I would say here aasif
all right and you could say here the
same condition my age is say if it's
greater than 18 if else if my age is
less than five and ones of is lesson 5
just debug that log less than 5 and then
here you'll have an else all right so
our program is gonna start from top to
bottom it's going to go through here is
the age say it was 5 is 5 greater than
18 no so it's gonna go down to here is 5
greater than is 5 less than 5
so it's gonna drop down to the elf
saying invalid now for my age being 22
it was 22 greater than 18 yes so this
one will get called else if I wasn't if
it was say my age was three all right is
3 greater than 18 no well then it's
gonna check this one is 3 less than 5
yes it was gonna call this the else will
never get called right so this is the if
I'll statements very very simple stuff
for a gaming logic one basically what
you could do is you would check for
instance if you if you uh some variable
was true for instance and you would
print out a message so like for instance
that's not a variable for a can drink so
I would say here I need to know if I can
drink right so it's a bold question
unless I can drink by default right now
we're gonna say true and here I wouldn't
go to program so we're gonna go and say
here if can drink equals true debug log
you can drink all right pretty simple
right so we guys can go ahead and do is
for an exercise go ahead and create a
program that checks to see if you're
alive and if you're alive print your
live else print you're dead right or do
create a health and variable and check
the value of the health check and see if
it's alive or not
and print out a message let me know what
you did in the comments and make sure
you're following me on Facebook and
Twitter digital gaming institute comm
all links and stuff like that will be in
the description thanks for watching guys
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
