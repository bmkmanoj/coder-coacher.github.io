creator of one of the most popular
Android and Java developer courses on
udemy so in this video I'm going to give
you a free preview of a lesson from my
android angel developer course on
udemy.com in this lesson I'll show you
how to set up Android studio and build
your very first Android application
alright so let's get to it
in this video I'm gonna show how to
download and install Android studio and
I'm gonna search don't say download
Android studio like that and then you're
gonna have a few links here but the one
that we interested in is the one that
has developers at and roodaka one of
these is saying you should have already
downloaded Android studio and the reason
why is because I have downloaded Android
studio already but nevertheless I'll
just to walk you through the process
okay so I'm gonna go to download the
Android studio and there we go
so as of recording of this video the
Android studio version is 2.3.3 okay and
I'm on a Mac here very simply we're just
gonna go ahead and say download and of
course we have to accept a few terms and
conditions here and then we are now able
to download Android studio for Mac and
then it will start downloading once you
do that you should be able to see this
page you know while things are being
downloaded in the background and it has
a little video it shows you how to set
things up okay so it's a very good
resource for us again it says here you
should have already downloaded android
studio which is true but i just want to
show you here okay so pretty soon we
should be done with downloading there we
go so I'm gonna double-click will start
extracting okay so now we have this I'm
gonna go ahead and drag and drop like
that into the Applications folder
perfect now that's there I can get out
of here I'm gonna go ahead and open it
in our application folding and you can't
quite see but I see I have a few version
of Android studio I'm gonna click on the
one that I just downloaded and it'll
give me this warning here I'm gonna say
open anyway please I trust the source
now the reason why mine is showing this
is because I've already downloaded
Android studio that's why it goes back
and finds any previous applications that
I've worked on it's just asking me to
add update or Gradle ok so I'm gonna go
ahead and say update but for you you
probably won't see that so I'm gonna do
it anyway here that way I can show you
exactly what in your case you'll be able
to see again you won't see this at all
you will see something different all
right so once you've downloaded and went
through that process which you weren't
able to see it here it's a fairly simple
process you just have to follow the
instructions and follow the wizard it
will get to the point where you will
come to this yours may not look this
dark ok so how you do to get this darker
color here and the configuration can go
to configure say preferences appearance
at the top here and you see here says
theme says either Dracula Oh dark Allah
you can click you can go to default
which will make it all white and I like
this dark color here so in your case
here if you have a white theme you can
come down here and change your doctor ok
and once you do that you say ok and
apply ok I can't don't need to do that
because everything is working but the
other thing we need to do here is if you
go to configure go to check for updates
and in this case here telling me that my
Android Studios has already been updated
and so on thing but if it for any reason
it says that you need to update a few
things just go ahead and update those ok
so let's go ahead and start a new
Android project and here you can go
ahead and put your name or anything else
is there that's not a problem I'll just
go ahead and let me just say test here
okay and I'm gonna keep going
I'm just go ahead and get an empty
activity just like that
I'm gonna finish and within a few
seconds you should see something like
this right now we have a project done
the first thing I want to show you here
is this button here at the top which
says SDK manager so I want you to click
on that the SK magic manager has all of
the libraries and tools that we need to
run our Android apps and as you can see
here the moment ago two SDK platforms
you have this API level and status so
you notice some of them are installed
others aren't
okay in this case here I have the latest
one installed app two for that oh three
which is Ice Cream Sandwich but I
recommend you at least to install
anything from 3.0 so this one here up to
as well as Android Oh so click that okay
and anything else up to three that oh
and say install I'm gonna click all of
these once you've done that I'm gonna
say apply say ok and it will go ahead
and install all of our SDKs as we
requested you take a few seconds alright
so now let's done you can go ahead and
say finish okay you notice now all of
the items are installed let's go to our
SDK tools here ok this is also very
important as you can see we have Android
emulator in my case Android emulator to
2631 one is installed as Takai platform
26 is installed so everything that I
have here that is installed you should
also make sure that you install now you
notice also here that we have this
Android SDK build tools 26 update
available in this case here you would
click on that ok like that and before we
go any further I also want to make sure
that you have Google Play services have
to be installed
ok Google Play library also needs to be
installed so in my case again here most
of them are already installed by you
know case just go ahead and click on
those and if by any case in
support deposit if any of these are not
installed in your case please do install
them so just check them and go ahead and
say apply and say ok and it will install
everything for you ok finished that's
great and you are done ok now next thing
I want to do here is to show you how to
create an emulator so the emulator
allows us to emulate or to run our
applications before testing so I'm gonna
go to my AVD here stands for Android
virtual device manager so click on that
and again in my case here I've created a
few already in your case you probably
won't have any just fine so what I need
to do is to go ahead here and say create
you want a phone and let's create a new
one here how about a nexus 6 okay you
pick spic whatever you want I'm gonna
get a nexus 6 and say next I say next
and you can change the AVD name here the
emulator name if you wish I just leave
it the way it is and I say finish
ok it takes a few seconds and you can
see here now we have our item ok so now
you have your virtual device in your
case my keys here here I have 4 but you
will you would have just one one we
created now alright so I think we're
good
I'm gonna refresh this real quick ok and
it's all good I'm getting out of there
and once you have done that okay go
ahead and run here and you can find all
of your emulators that he created here
in this case we'll have our Nexus 6 just
go ahead and say ok and takes a few
seconds here to wait our emulator up and
run our app
you can see there we go should see our
app working a second here there we go
now you have hello world okay so you
were able to run your first app on
Android emulator device here perfect
congratulations now if you have any
questions at all it should be very
straightforward and as I can see any
I'll just say here you have this little
video that we can also play but if you
have any questions at all don't hesitate
to ask okay perfect the congratulations
and i'll see in the next video this
application will be called try me okay
so go ahead and create a project a java
android a an android project and name it
try me okay and i already have here a
demo so this application will do the
following so we'll have a big button in
the middle here that says try me and
when we click on it will change the
background color like this and it's all
random again that's the beauty of it so
we keep going and sometimes we get the
same color because it's all random and
there we go this is the application that
we are going to be building so once the
project is open is created this is what
we have here and i went ahead and added
a few items here the background images
so if you go to reveal in finder reveal
in finder this is what we should have
okay so i went ahead and got these to
put into the Drobo in fact i don't think
we're using this one here i don't need
this and you will have access to all of
these obviously okay so i have this
around background PNG image here which
is already there alright first thing we
need to do of course is to put a button
right here let's go ahead and put a
button right there in the middle and we
are going to give it gonna give it an ID
try me
button okay that's perfect
all right let's go back to our main ones
here so why what else we need to do
let's add our background here pick a
resource here and right away you will
see we have our round underscore B so
click on that say perfect
that looks great okay and the next thing
you need to do let's go ahead and change
the text color of our button here okay
so it's let's search here text color
there it is let's change it color to
this background light white there that
looks good
how about let's see if we can change the
text size to make it a little bit bigger
so click here in fact you don't need to
do that let's go ahead and change it
ourselves here let's give let's give it
actually 418 s B well that's great that
looks wonderful perfect let's go ahead
and run one more time just to see if
things are actually looking the way we
want them to look there we go
and why do you know it looks great
okay and I think is happening when we
click the button here because simply we
haven't done anything in the code but it
lets me know that things are looking
good perfect let's go back here so the
next thing we need to take care of is
our background here we need to figure
out how do we access our background
because remember we are going to change
the background color each time they tap
on this button here and while we're here
let's change this button here to
something different the title to
something different let's change it to
see here okay it says Texas button let's
say
we're gonna click and we're gonna click
here in the pick source resource click
there and we want to add resources act
strength resources file that way it's
easy to maintain okay we're gonna name
this try me and the value is gonna be
tried me so the value is what we are
going to see once we use it ok and you
can see it's gonna be under strings that
XML okay
I already has one that's fine that's
because that's what I used prior before
there we go try me say ok and if you
want to make sure to see what I'm
talking about if you go to strings here
we should have here try me ok perfect
there we go try me that's perfect
so how do we then figure out a way to
access the background here I will go to
the text view we can see that this would
be the background section here
represents the background represents
this white area that we see and we said
before anything that we see is an object
in it and it's it can also be
represented via XML text as we see here
and we also said in order for us to be
able to access resources of any type
including this view here ok because
again it's a resource type as you can
see here we need to have an ID you see
this button here we we gave it an idea
of try me button should be button that
butoon ok there we go
Tootie's there we go that's much better
ok we have try me button here as the ID
which means now we will be able to
reference this button when we are ready
to create our logic here in our activity
ok so how do we do this well the first
thing we need to do is to give this
and ID so if you say ID there it is
we're gonna choose the first one at plus
I T and we're gonna give it ID of window
view ID this way now we will be able to
reference this view so now that we have
that done let's go ahead and create our
link let's go ahead and link everything
up here so the first thing we're gonna
say it's private and we are going to
save you because now we want to be able
to reference this view here which
incidentally is this background view in
the back it's a view okay and since we
need to resolve this that means we have
to import this view package class here
you just say you say alt or option enter
and there we go you will see at the top
here we will see this view import that
has just happened we know view and the
next we're gonna say private and it's
gonna be a button because now we're
gonna try to get this button here
reference I'm gonna call this try me
button it's great so now that we have
our view window here which is this
background here let's see what we can do
with it because remember everything is a
view okay so that means whatever we can
do with the buttons obviously we can do
with views as well so that's the idea
remember that hierarchy that I told you
about at the top we'll have view and
then at the bottom we'll have all those
widgets we which are buttons textview
Attic text and so forth so let's try
something quick here so that way we can
see the power here that we have so now
that we have this window view here
created field we can go ahead and say
window is equal to find view by ID we're
gonna say our got ID dot window if you
ID now you notice right away here we
don't have to cast like we do when we
create button or any other widget right
we usually have here
couldn't have we could upset here a few
and that's still it's okay but it's very
unnecessary well because as you can see
here it says it's redundant because we
are finding view by ID and it happens to
be it's actually a view type that we are
finding so we don't need to put that
there
okay so we can just go ahead and do this
that way we can get the window view ID
reference to our window view view here
okay once we have that let's play around
with something you notice a window view
let's set the background color to
something you see dot set background
color and notice something here this
background color takes an integer as a
color okay there's other ways to to add
colors but let's use this one and now we
can say color class right and say dot we
can change it to red let's save this and
run we should have a red background
color showing look at that wonderful
that's amazing that's really good so you
can see the power here that you have and
you can go ahead and say for instance
window dot let's see what else can we do
we can even set a background from a
drawable which means we can set a
background of using an image that we
have under our draw bolts so under our
resources images so we could have put an
image here and we could have referenced
that way as well
all right okay so that's the idea that I
wanted to show you before we proceed
here and I hope you understand what's
happening there's nothing really new
it's just that we were able to get the
view this one background here because we
know it's an object and then we linked
it to its window view ID that way we'll
have a handle and then we can do
whatever else we want to do with it just
like we do with the buttons and text
views and edit text and so forth so we
were able to get our window view here
and we were able to connect it to the
correspondent ID and then we were able
to set a background
color to rent very good so let's do the
same with our button here before we
forget I'm gonna say try me just try me
button now remember we have to cast it
because it's not just a view it's a type
of view that that's why we have to say
find a view by ID but we have to put the
button here and here we can say our dot
ID dot try me button there we go let's
go ahead and move this right about here
okay first thing they're gonna try me
button and how about getting this also
here that's not bad okay
now that we have a try me button let's
go ahead and attach an event listener to
it let's try me button right set on
click listener new on click listener
okay so that means here is where we are
going to put our logic that will be
called once we tap on the button for now
let's go ahead and log into our console
here we haven't talked about this but
we're gonna go ahead and log into our
console here whatever we are doing
inside here that way we can see what's
going on so there is a class called log
class that allows us to see what our app
is doing okay these are things that will
be shown here so the user won't be able
to see it which is good because we are
the developers we need to be able to see
debug or see things or test things out
in our applications when we are building
them okay we're gonna go ahead here and
say for log that's the class you can see
these on Android add util package and we
can use the first one here for debugging
or the next one let's just keep with the
first one D stands for debug and we'll
talk more about that and then here we
have to pass in a string let's just say
test
something like that and the next
parameter it's gonna be something let's
put another let's say tap okay save this
let's go ahead and run you can see there
it is we should see something happening
here so tap see say test tap that's good
it's working perfect idea here is that
when we have this try me button here we
want as you click on it we want to start
changing the color in the background
here so we know how to change the color
of our window our background here right
now we'd have to make this dynamic how
do we do that okay so the first thing
I'm going to think about is okay so
colors as you see here if we get rid of
this let's go back here if you have an
over set a set background color it takes
in an integer okay
that means the colors that we put when
we say color class dot red that is
actually an integer that is being stored
in the back ground of our code okay so
this representation here is represented
as an integer which is very useful to us
because now one we want to randomly
generate a number that would correspond
to a certain color so this means the
first thing we need to think about is so
we talked about integers and we talked
about random numbers and we're talking
about a group of the same types and that
should ring a bell like we probably are
talking about an array here so let's go
ahead and create an array for color so
we're gonna call this private int all
right we're just gonna say it's an int
array so we're gonna say colors you've
seen these notations or we're saying
here we're saying these colors here is
an array of type int so it's gonna hold
integers perfect so inside here let's go
ahead and create the actual array so
we're gonna say colors
is equal to new int so what's happening
here this is a very interesting notation
so we are actually in station
instantiating a new array creating a new
array of integers and then as we create
it we are right away also inserting
items into that array this is that's
what it means here so we created the
array because we know here and then we
go ahead and put items inside of that
array now we said here this color that
red returns an integer which is great so
that means here we can put all of our
colors you can say color dot cyan okay
send color dot green say color
okay you get the idea like that so now
we have an array called colors which has
all of these colors as integers here so
now we have our colors array perfect so
this means if we want to access for
instance color red
whereas color red is here right that
means it this it's on zero one two index
so now we can just go ahead and call the
colors array and then since we know it's
array we pass in zero one two so the
second index so now we have a way to
access that okay so if we save this and
run once again we should see the same
color
okay nothing has changed except we know
now we are referencing the color red
from our colors alright here we want to
make sure that all these happens inside
here when users tap or tap on the button
okay we need to figure out a way to
create random numbers so there is a
class called random class that we can
use already again it's all pre-built we
don't have to do that ourselves okay
we're gonna use that class that will
help us to randomly choose colors here
as we tap so the first thing we're gonna
do I'm gonna say random that's the class
gonna call this random it's gonna be
equal to new random okay Stan shading it
and then what we need to do we are going
to create and now we're gonna go ahead
and create the actual random number at a
given time so I'm gonna say int because
it's all gonna be an integer okay that's
what we want
brand we're gonna call this random num
okay this is one number each time you
tap okay we're gonna use our random
object here to start creating our random
number so random dot next int that's the
method we need to use
now inside of this next and we need to
pass in a number here integer which
needs to be the length of our colors
array here because we need if you think
about we need a way to know okay if we
are creating a random numbers what is
the range is it between 0 and 100 or a
zero and 200 or zero and three right in
this case we want to make sure each time
that we tap on the button we get a
number that is between the length of
this array here because it would not
make any sense if the length of this
array is 6 and then we get a number that
is beyond the length of this array then
we get an error and that's bad because
it's gonna say well this array here
length is 4 and I'm getting you a random
number 7 which is not part of this array
here could have gone ahead and count say
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so we know the length
is 9 and put it here but we're smart
enough to not do that because this array
could change we could add more numbers
here and that wouldn't work we can just
create a variable here that will give us
the length of this array so int color
array length how do you get the array
length well you say colors but that's
the name of the right length
there we go so now we can use this copy
and put it here so now as we create this
random number so next int which means
it's gonna go and find randomly an
integer between 0 and the length of this
array it will never go beyond the length
of this array which is exactly what we
want so now that we have this we can
comment this out remember here this
window view so let's get that out of
there and let's put it here so now check
this out instead of putting a 2 here we
can just use because we know that this
is an integer so each time you tap it's
gonna go ahead and create a new random
number right
which is confined between the color
array lens which is what we need okay so
we copy this and put inside here so now
our colors so we're passing here our
colors array so we saying Kyle's array
is gonna be let's say random number two
first time is one it's gonna be colors
array one index once was gonna be 0 1
it's gonna be green if next time is 0
gonna be colors 0 it's gonna be cyan ok
so that's what are we doing let's save
this and run once again and we should
have ok it's white that's fine let's
click oh look at that click again look
at that oh wow and yes there will be
times when the colors will not change
that just because our random generator
it's not perfect so it generates the
same number okay and that's fine but you
can see now let me prove you that we are
actually getting different numbers here
let's go ahead and say the following
here let's say random and for the value
we want to see let's let's say here
random number so we're gonna see what
number is being generated this is random
and D so we get an error here because
these are not compatible with passing
here an integer which is fine for what
we try to do but in order for us to see
a log we need to make it as string so we
need we're gonna go ahead and use a
string class again dot value of that's
one that we haven't used so here what
are we doing here we are invoking a
screen class and we say we want the
value of whatever we're passing in here
so if the value of integer do we pass in
is 1 then we're gonna make it a string
which it's gonna then be able to show
here so now if we save we will be able
to see the numbers being generated as we
tap our button
okay let's go ahead and run once again
alright so let's open this monitor here
so just keep your eyes are on here okay
so you tap random is two if you look
here so if they say random is two should
be red let's see two is red that means
two would be the index two so this is
index zero cyan one two is right perfect
so this works let's see what's one right
next here so it's three and it's blue is
it true be detective here where is blue
blue is here so that means zero one two
three yes you see okay you keep going
now you have this great tools that you
can use to start creating really fun
little applications that there are fun I
mean it's really awesome me too to be
able if you've never done this and to be
able to create something simple but
something that it should be proud of you
are able to create an app that does
something fun creating random numbers
and as those random numbers are created
you're changing the background color I
encourage you to go ahead and add more
colors here okay as many colors as you
can and play around okay and see see how
fun this is
