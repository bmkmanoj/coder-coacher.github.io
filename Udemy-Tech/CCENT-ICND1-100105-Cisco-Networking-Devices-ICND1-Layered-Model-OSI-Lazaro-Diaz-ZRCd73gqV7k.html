layered models listen we have to know
this stuff okay we have to know the
standards this part of our icnd1 okay we
need to know this even the basic
networking classes we need to learn and
even at Microsoft we need to learn the
old si model the cisco to learn model
the tcp/ip model we just need to know it
and again what are these models what is
so important that we need to know about
these models well a little brief history
there just so you can see you can read
it on your own but basically it's a
conceptual model it's a real that you
can touch it is a guideline of blueprint
that we can go ahead and use because
they are you see there its goal it was
for interoperability because before this
everybody had their own protocol
everybody had their own rules and in
order for two devices to inter
communicate with each other it was just
you know take two tunnels and call me in
the morning it was a headache it was a
real real headache because you have to
put in oh well if you're using tcp/ip
I'm using Apple I'm using NetWare
whatever the case may be and WLAN you
gotta use all these different protocols
and it just became cumbersome and it
really took up a lot of processing so as
you can see there in the 70s the ccitt
the Telegraph for the International
Telegraph and telephone consult of
committee that's a big name alright they
came out with this old they started with
the ISIL doing the is old
alright that's why we make a joke and
say that the is o was created by the
OSI was created by the ISO okay back in
the 70s but again it was important
because we needed to make sure that all
manufacturers all vendors everybody's on
the same page so when they create our
net card they
create a protocol or particular
application things of that nature
where you know they can say okay we're
just gonna focus on this particular
layer there nothing else needs to be
done this will be able to interoperate
with everything else so in 1983 the two
documents were merged and the standard
the basic reference model or open
systems interconnect model okay was
created all right so a little history
there now they're gonna get asked but at
least you know if you're in a party you
can go ahead and show what you know but
the OSI model as you can see right in
front of you is broken up into different
layers
I go from layers 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 I don't
do 1 2 3 4 5 6
why because each layer has a name right
application presentation session
transport network data link and physical
I and you can make your own pneumonic
device is completely up to you what you
want to call it I say all people seem to
need Domino's Pizza to be data
processing it could be whatever it is
you like it doesn't matter as long as
you remember them is good to go ok it's
good to go layer 7 will be your
application layer 6 we're breaking down
shortly 7 is your application 7 is your
presentation 5 session for transport 3
network to datalink and 1 is physical
and they're all have their own specific
job that they need to do it's like in a
company in a company everybody has a job
that they need to perform and if you
don't perform that particular job if
somebody depends on you doing your job
then something the chain will be broken
ok and I got to give it an analogy Oh
several years ago a lot of years ago I
was involved with real estate right I
was involved not me personally I was
just passed papers back and forth pretty
much just sit there
all right bought up I saw these things
everybody had a job to do the bank and
there's people like a to three people in
the bank had to do their things so they
can pass on the paperwork and the
paperwork Adonis with mortgage broker
the mortgage broker how to put dairy
information in and you know everything
comes down to getting this huge ten
thousand page paper okay that everybody
needs to sign and then still you can
change your mind the bank can change
your mind and things don't happen but
the point is that if somebody within
that chain and I don't know their titles
because I complete forgot because I was
traumatized but if somebody in their
chain that chain says well I'm going on
vacation or I'm sick or whatever the
case may be and they don't do that
particular job everything is on hold on
to that person comes back so imagine
here in the OSI model and something
because remember as it comes down the
other side because this is the closest
to the user will break them up sorry
this is closest to the user all right so
as it goes down the or side model is
called encapsulation okay so if
something breaks down whether it be in
the session or transport layer then
that's a problem all right
that's a problem if they don't do what
they're supposed to do they don't put
the information and they're supposed to
put it then that becomes problem so the
oil side model actually becomes a
troubleshooting tool to see where things
broke down okay so it's not just hey
something you need to remember and I say
that for you know certification purposes
but in the real world you really need to
know and understand what's going on when
you're doing your arms and you're doing
all your layer - checking connectivity
and all these different things you
really really need to understand ok so
you can troubleshoot properly now here
comes the breakdown for layer seven in
the application you see there's an
abstraction layer that specifies the
shared protocols interface methods used
by Holst
communication that were basically the
application layer says hey are you ready
to accept communication all right and
this is the one that you control right
you're the one sending the email you're
the one clicking the browser you're the
one that's doing all these things typing
whatever you need to type trying to get
to a share you're the one using it so
that's closest to you things that work
there protocols BGP it's a routing
protocol exterior gave a routing
protocol DHCP DNS FTP HTTP Alda nntp pop
email right SNMP SSH in telnet so
anytime we try to tell them that as a
sage or or do Guana browser or do an FTP
or TFTP order the case may be
all right we're using an application
that's actually a protocol because there
are some port numbers are associated to
these protocols all right that it if it
breaks down right there well you don't
even getting outside your own gateway
you're not getting outside your own NIC
card all right because you can't get to
where you need to go all right so that's
the job of the application they deal
with those particular protocols and more
believe me there's a lot more okay that
they deal with but it all deals with
applications don't think of it as Excel
or PowerPoint thing like that
these are protocols protocols like when
you open up Internet Explorer all right
you're dealing with either HTTP HTTPS
okay or FTP all right so there's
different things that you interact with
like let's say using Outlook that's a
client application but you're using SNMP
aren't you when you're sending messages
you're sending SNMP so all these things
pop is when incoming so all these things
work at the application layer do you
need to know these protocols yes you do
do you need to understand that the
application layer is the closest to the
user yes you do
all right do you need to know the layer
number yes you do all right and then is
at the top layer of the OSI model
now as
down right now there's something called
or they call because everything right is
just data that's all this data okay so
we're talking about the process or the
OSI model the first three layers of the
upper layers as you can see here data
presentation session everything is still
one big chunk of data okay I'm Dina
all right so nothing's broken down yet
so when it gets to the presentation
layer all right the military's
responsible like says there for delivery
and formatting of information to the
application layer for further processing
or displays so it relieves the
application layer of concerns regarding
syntactical differences in data
representation within the end-user
system the example that they always use
is episodic coded to ASCII code it file
encryption and decryption so but you
also do things like RTF JPEGs having you
ever guard a file by your computer has
no icon for it says huh what is this I
have no idea
well this is your presentation layer at
work so it says hey listen application
layer I am so sorry no that's when it's
coming back up which is the
encapsulation I have no idea what this
is I'm gonna send it to you it's not
gonna have an icon so you can open it
with you think you have an application
that may open it or you can browse the
Internet to open it
that's your presentation layer at work
because the application layer it's not
gonna say okay he sent it to me I don't
no idea what this is I have no clue
see what you can open it with but that's
why the presentation layer that's its
purpose that is this purpose all right
to make sure that hey okay what's coming
my way
can I understand it what is the format
that I have here all right is it
encrypted so I can decrypt it okay and
just a little side note on encryption
decryption no go in saying encrypting
information to the highest number okay
because you're gonna cause overhead on
your pcs alright and I have you PC can
handle it
knock yourself out if it can't don't go
insane alright
that's why networks have their firewalls
yeah other certificates of authority you
have all bunch of other things that you
can do to encrypt and decrypt so don't
go crazy okay session layer alright
provides the mechanism for what for
opening and closing and maintaining
sessions between end-user applications
okay
this is job make sure nobody is just
idle just sitting there okay so I says
there's a semi-permanent dialogue so
communication sessions consist of what
of a request and a response that occur
between applications so session layer
sources are commonly used in application
environments that make use for remote
procedure calls or pcs so what works
here and this is important full duplex
or half duplex there's only information
appletalk look at the protocols and look
at zone zone informations if you if
you've been working already with IP
version 6 if you notice those weird
addresses right those hexadecimal
addresses at the end have a percent
symbol
that's a zone ID all right so I knows
where to send the information because
you got multiple net cards multiple
interfaces so one particular IP address
I can use is your loopback even though
there's only one loopback address but
there's one loopback address per
interface so you have many interfaces
you have many loopback addresses right
same loopback but different interface
going towards a different network so you
need to have that zone ID so I knows
where exactly it's going to go to it
doesn't send it out the wrong interface
but full duplex or half duplex it is
important by default some switches layer
2 switches anyway they come at half
duplex why in the world would you won't
have duplex I don't know especially in
today's day and age if you have devices
there are capable of running
duplex why would you have an internet
working device where there's a switch or
a router running at half duplex you
don't want that because you're gonna get
eventually if not immediately a an error
a duplex error okay and that is caused
because you have the wrong setting
that's the wrong setting it's probably
you just forgot or you just assumed so
you got to make sure that if you're you
know if you're really in say hey I am in
need of speed all right Tom Cruise here
okay we have the need for speed all
right you want to go ahead and use full
duplex you want to be able to send the
receive at the same time not saying wait
and then receive we don't want to do
that even worse it's just simplex like
you know I'm just gonna speak like a
bullhorn I'm gonna speak out no I want
nobody else to talk to me I'm just gonna
talk to everybody like I'm doing now all
right but uh definitely this is what the
session layer and it keeps all these
different applications
separate from each other as you know we
are multitaskers in this day and age so
we will go ahead and open multiple
applications okay and it could be
networking applications that access the
network and you know we could be doing
SSH on one will be doing telnet on
another one we could be sending an email
we can be on a browser so all these
things the session layer says hey let me
separate all these applications and make
sure that everything is okay alright and
it's just you know maintained all right
or end the session if need be so these
are the upper layers remember they're
all data data data because the process
of encapsulation has a name now we'll
give you that name alright now we
started getting into the lore layers are
three four and three they have two and
one
okay uh the first one we run into is the
transport layer here this is where it
says here the protocols of layer
provides host two holes communication
and funny enough in the tcp/ip model
which we'll discuss
briefly the transport layer could also
be called host-to-host
I provide services such as
connection-oriented data stream support
which has reliability flow control and
multiplexing okay
so TCP that is reliable that is a
connection-oriented protocol tcp UDP on
the other hand is connection-less right
because it doesn't care so who uses UDP
TFTP TFTP just to make a very simple
example TCP does not care that's why
when we're in the routers and we're
copying our iOS or our startup config
files we use a TFTP we could use FTP if
you wanted to but we can use normally
using TFTP server that we had set up
already and we copy these things because
we're more interested in the speed of it
that we are in the error correction and
reliability and all these different
things all right but tcp is definitely
something that we want on the internet
don't we even in our network we want TCP
because it does a lot of checking
especially within an IP for version
world there's a lot of checking going on
there's a lot of overhead with TCP IP
all right but is for the good because we
want to make sure if our packets don't
get there that we're gonna be getting
acknowledgments or negative
acknowledgments or windowing and I'm
talking about the same layer here when
doing all right all these things and
sequencing did it get there in the right
order and if it didn't get there let me
know send me an error message ok so and
when do we Hank can you handle a byte at
a time or can you handle two bytes at a
time so we can have this window that's
constantly adjusting itself to meet the
needs and really that all depends on the
type of cabling you did ok because if
you were cabling cap 5 and everything is
cat 5 and you
you know plotters or an architectural
company and you're sending you know
gigabits across the network yeah you
have a problem or if you're going across
a whatever Network and have a t1 line
yeah you're definitely gonna have a
problem okay so that only you want TCP
on there to make sure that you get those
acknowledgments or negative
acknowledgments that you got it and you
didn't get it and if you want that
windowing you want those sequencing make
sure that the packet did not get
corrupted on the way over there okay so
a lot of things can happen in the
transport layer a lot of things happen
in the transport layer all right but the
biggest two or TCP and UDP okay and
because we use TCP on a daily basis okay
there's the protocol the internet if you
would all right then we get to the fun
layer if I like to call it the network
layer Network layer is responsible for
packet 40 including routing through
intermediate routers since it knows the
address of neighboring network nodes and
it also manages quality of service and
recognizes and force local host domain
messages through transport layer of four
layer four protocols at work here
IP version 4 version 6 IP X works here
all rotting protocols work at this layer
right here will be rip erp OSPF BGP
what-have-you they work at this layer
interesting enough we have as I
mentioned previously TCP IP TCP is on
the transport layer but IP is own layer
3 so when we're talking about IP
addresses that are on an interface
those are route Ted protocols not
routing protocols routing protocols
they're the ones that say hey let me
make a map and see where is which is the
best way to go based on the algorithm
RIT uses Billman Ford ERP uses dual so
they're like okay which way do I go
alright so if you're using rip obviously
is gonna take the straight line it
doesn't care it was a 53k connection
yeah your appeal on the other hand makes
intelligent decisions through bandwidth
and delay and says well you know there's
a a 53k this way but I got a OC one
lines going to the other side I'm gonna
send it down that way and I can low
balance between both so it's an
intelligent routing protocol but all of
these decisions are based on the
algorithm and all these decisions are
made here the network layer this is why
IP addressing as much as that I drilled
it as many videos I have a as I have out
there alright and people last IP again
yes IP again because even though on your
certification exam they tell you well
only 5%
there's IP addressing but what they
don't tell you is they're gonna sneak IP
addressing on you on an protocol on a
peripheral question on an access list
question on a neck question so you need
to know IP addressing like you know your
alphabet all right and all this happens
at layer 3 and layer 3 you know OSI
model so again and IP is a connection
less oriented protocol connection less
and that's why I needs TCP all right
they both work together that's why they
call it the tcp/ip suite all right so
layer 2 here now we get into the data
link the data link the data link layer
so now it's concerning would deliver
your frames frames those hex numbers you
don't like between devices on the same
and this is important on the same land
MAC addresses MAC addresses burned in
addresses hard or dresses well hard
water we're gonna call it MAC addresses
they do not leave
Eve your segment your broadcast domain
they stay there
routers do not forward MAC addresses
okay so that's why it's the same land
dealing frames as these protocol data
units okay are called
do not cross the boundaries of local
networks internet work routing globe or
dressing or higher layer functions
online diddling protocols to focus on
local delivery addressing and mediation
arbitration basically what works on here
are what okay you really know what
they're called they're called protocol
data unit these are your PDUs right the
data data data what happened what what a
minute what happened at the transport
layer what happens here is a segment so
we got data data data segment PDU
segment and what happens that layer
three packets
oh we're dealing with packet fourteen as
it says right there packets
those are PDUs remember I said the
process of encapsulation so we have data
data data segments packets frames at
layer two frames
okay so now here switches bridges okay
even wireless devices work on here
switches all they care about is MAC
addresses now I know I'm gonna hear ya
Balazs what about layer 3 switch but
we're not talking about our layer 3
switch and neither is your icnd1 ok
they're talking about layer 2 switches
where they don't have the compete the
capability of turning on routing they
don't have the capacity okay
so worried about layer to make sure that
your MAC address creates that beautiful
kam table so you can do a show MAC
address table and can look at all your
frames and who they are attached to
ok that's what the dinner link layer
worries about alright
so here is frames frames then finally we
get to the physical layer which consists
of basic networking hardware so we're
talking about the cabling we're talking
about hubs which you don't use anymore
amplifiers their NIC cards really work
on both layer 1 layer 2 but net cards
okay Oh any type of cabling Wireless
works on here too
so very basic networking devices is what
you're talking about here it is the
fundamental error underlying the logic
data structures of higher level
functions in an hour
due to the plethora of available
hardware because there is a plethora
there's a bunch just to make it simple a
bunch of available hardware technologies
with widely varying characteristics they
all do their own thing and believe it or
not they call it the most complex or the
other side why because it's the most
important believe it or not even though
the application layer sits up there like
a king but if you run your wire wrong or
you wrong you run the wrong type of wire
that's going to be an issue that's going
to be an issue okay because then
nobody's going to be able to communicate
if you punch it down to a patch panel
incorrectly that's why you need to test
your cables not only for continuity or
connectivity but you also want to test
it for the standard that you're using
right 802 11 B if that's what you're
using you wanna make sure that those
eight wires that you have on that cat5
or cat's eggs are actually lighting up
using your not your toner that's what
that's what the continuity for testing
for connectivity but those lights you
use that tester to make sure you get all
pairs are good to go alright so this is
a very important layer because if you
mess this layer up ain't nobody talking
nobody alright so make sure you got to
build a foundation first you building a
building you don't
from the penthouse you start from the
ground up so those forms on the ground
there are the cement that's poured in
all that at the bottom you need to make
sure that it's solid that it's going to
be able to handle a 50 floor building
with all this stuff okay so make sure
that your network when you're running
those cables or you're creating a
wireless network it still make sure
those antennas the features everything
all run properly you do your site
surveys your physical site servers radio
sites are always tough one off on a
tangent but this is why they want to
call the most complex layer because
there's so much Hardware out there that
you can use but it needs to be used
correctly so this is your side so now
that we're at the end of the other side
what is the process of encapsulation
data data data segments packets frames
and bits but I like to say don't stop
pouring free beer pizza and beer can't
get better than that okay now let's do a
little comparison here all right you can
see what there it says this is the CSUN
I'm not inventing this okay you can see
right there where it came from
all right this is that something I made
up there's your OSI then you have the
original tcp/ip layer which is the
application transport internet and link
which used to be called it or names we
call network now it's called you know
they say Internet okay
link but now we have a five layer tcp/ip
this is for the new exam ok the 200 -
125
all right this reunion exam new tcp/ip
model application transport now that I
want to call it internet then when I go
back to network ok but you see the
mapping look at the mapping the mapping
has not changed and now in the new
tcp/ip they have the data link and
physical where before it was just link
now they separate even more didn't link
and physical but they're still mapping
to the other side to the same two layers
so they're actually calling it the name
same names as the OSI but it's the new
five layer tcp/ip model that's all it is
that's all this okay so if you know your
OSI model you know your protocols I work
there you have zero issues in the tcp/ip
model okay
that's the new one look I'm not making
it up you're seeing where it comes from
but lastly what I want to finish off
with is the Cisco feeler model look how
simple this was back in the day all
right you had your core your
distribution and your access so your
core those are your main layer 3
switches you know your your core
switches are gonna send everything
across ok I mean they're just worried
about speed now those could be switches
no could be router that's your core
layer you put whatever you want there
people are in love will layer 3 switches
ok whatever you're an aficionado and
layer 3 switches ok or it could be
routers alright those are your core
routers they're not worried about what's
happening down there without those lands
they just care give me their network
starting to go to and I mean I'm just
gonna send them your distribution was
the one that was worried about inter
VLAN connectivity there a word about
access list they're worried about NAT
we're about a whole bunch of different
things right policies that we write all
these things and then we have the layer
the access layer which is the one
nearest you ok so that's the one where
you assign the VLANs to or you can do
certain policies if you want it they're
not policies but access only if you
wanted to but the core layer is always
left alone all right three layers it was
simple now let's look over here on the
right yeah still core distribution and
access but what they did say listen we
can't touch the core ladies
we can't touch it that's the one you can
see that circle surrounding those three
lines that are going from one to the
other
okay to be a router or your switch could
be an ATM it could be of many things
okay they're aggregating they're
aggregating those wires to make it even
faster
okay whatever aggregation that they're
doing we don't care at this moment we
just know that those are meant for
speeds the core layer hasn't changed in
that aspect but the distribution access
layer have now they're sharing the
responsibilities so they can help each
other out and take a look at the
redundancy that they have which is
wonderful but unrealistic because all
the people they're in charge of our
money all right are not gonna allow that
unless is you know some high top level
official that says I don't care how much
it cost
we got the pockets we're gonna put it in
there we cannot afford to be down point
zero five over percent okay over point
zero zero zero five percent we have to
be up all the time so they want
redundancy after redundancy after
redundancy and that's what you see there
and really they could have fixed it even
more by putting those switches at the
bottom of the access layer plug them in
together as well all three switches well
hey I guess they don't want to take it
that far but either way what they're
looking at here is that the distribution
and access layer are now sharing
responsibilities and this is what they
call that collapsed architecture this is
it right here
still the cisco to layer model the only
difference is the distribution and
access layer are sharing their
responsibilities so those are your
layered models do you need to know them
yes you need to know their layers and
layer number yes you need to know how
they work why there are that way yes
okay but that's it when you get out
there in the real world you're gonna
have third party application
they're gonna tell you exactly where the
issue is gonna be but you need to have
at least a basic understanding of what's
going on
