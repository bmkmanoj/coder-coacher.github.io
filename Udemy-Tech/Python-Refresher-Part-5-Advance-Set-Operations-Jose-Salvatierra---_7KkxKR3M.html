looking at some advanced set operations
and they're not going to take very long
just a couple of them that I think you
should know about
let's create a scent that I'm going to
call scent one and this is going to be
one two three four five and then is sent
to that's going to be M 1 3 5 7 9 and 11
a set is a collection of unique and
unordered elements therefore what really
matters is which elements are in the set
it doesn't matter if the one is at the
beginning because this is unordered so
really we cannot get that what matters
is the one is there the one is there the
two is in set one but there is no - in
set 2 that's really what matters which
elements are in this set for example you
may have a set of lottery numbers that
you have played and you may have a set
of the winning lottery numbers and you
may want to see which numbers are in
which
so let's imagine set one is you lottery
numbers and so two is the winning
numbers so you've obviously earned quite
a lot of money because there are quite a
few numbers there are the same three
numbers so how would we check if these
numbers match well we can print your
lottery numbers dot intersection winning
numbers there should be numbers I'm
going to comment out this other print
statement there because we don't need it
just now
so we're printing something a bit larger
here your lottery numbers is this first
cent and we're gonna say don't
intersection and that's another method
that it's going to take in
the other set inside the brackets
so if you've ever done maths you'll know
what an intersection is but if not let's
just look at what comes out and we can
run this again I'm actually gonna clear
it first and run it again what do you
think is going to come out with the
intersection of these two sets
we get another set so this evidently
produces a scent and that's the output
and the set contains one three and five
which as we know are the numbers that
are in the first set and also in the
second set
so this calculates the numbers that are
in both sets
okay
we can also do print
your lottery numbers dot Union winning
numbers
what do you think the Union will print
if you learn maths this is an easy
question but if not I'll give you a hint
Union is going to essentially a datasets
together
you
so our first cent has five elements our
second cent has seven elements a quick
question for you would you expect the
set that gets printed out to have 5 plus
7 12 elements would you expect the cent
that gets printed out to have 12
elements
hopefully you said no because this said
as you can see only has nine elements
nine ten six eight eight elements that's
right
evidently I can't see very well or
rather count so the union is the one two
three four and five that's the first set
the set here and we are uniting that set
with this other set so we do one two
three four five and we add the one to it
but one's already there
so with this can't that then we ant
three but threes already there so with
this contact then we at five
but file already there so with the scan
that and then we add seven nine eleven
so we end up with eight elements 1 2 3 4
5 7 9 and 11 remember there are no
duplicates in sets every element has to
be unique so that's why 1 3 &amp;amp; 5 never up
here
finally we can also do print something
like 1 2 3 4 . difference 1 undo
and that should be like that it doesn't
matter in Python you can you can have
them like this if you prefer em but I
like my code to look a specific way
sadly so there we go
okay what do you think this we're gonna
pin down one two three four difference
so what is the difference between these
two sets
the difference between the two sets is
three and four that's the numbers that
are different and then we get three and
four back
so these three cent operations are
really useful in some cases and just not
very useful at all the majority of the
time however if you know about these
there will be a moment in time where you
will realize that this is the perfect
solution for something you want to do
and then you'll know that this exists
and most of the time you won't use them
at all but nevertheless they are there
and if for example you want to calculate
lottery numbers maybe you will then this
is perfect the perfect tool really if
you ever want to deal with unique and
unordered things then this is also a
perfect tool so that's it for this video
hope you learned something here and I'll
see you in the very next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
