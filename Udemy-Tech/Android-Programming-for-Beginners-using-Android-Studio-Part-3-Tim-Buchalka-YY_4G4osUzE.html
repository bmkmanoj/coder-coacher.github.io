they've passed the things are all about
and do you may recall that before we
deleted the constraints by clicking on
that clear constraints button we saw
these zip fastener things on the screen
sort of at the top and to the bottom of
the image view so at the moment we've
got a roughly square image view in the
middle of the screen and if I click to
select the image to the right the
blueprint shows the four handles on the
corners that we use to resize the widget
and of course we did that in the
previous video and we can move our mouse
down to do that again anytime we'd like
but there's also these little circles on
each edge as well in the middle of the
edge now these images are different to
the other ones that were for resizing
the circles are used to set constraints
and you can constraint each of the four
edges to behave in a certain way so to
start with what I'm going to do is use
the left and right circles to constrain
the the actual image view horizontally
between the two sides of the screen so
do that I'm going to click on and hold
the left mouse button and it can be
helpful when you move your mouse pointer
over the constraint circle just to
weight to half a second to a second
until that little tart tooltip appears
because otherwise you might find when
you go to drag you'll be dragging the
image view instead of setting and
constraint so just move over to there
we're too short while and then just hold
down the left mouse button and drag the
button over to the left then release the
button and you notice that when I did
that the image jumped sideways but don't
worry about that because we can always
drag it back again and if we do that
Android studio will then show how far it
is on both previews but to also up here
in the top right hand corner just to
show you what I mean that's so you can
see that's currently showing at 16 which
is a margin which we'll be talking more
about shortly but I can move this over
and make that a bigger number if I like
to Center it say to 120 release it and
you can see the image is quite happily
showing in the middle of the preview
again but unfortunately with the way
that I've done that if I move this over
to landscape mode by clicking on the
orientation
you can see that we've got a problem and
it doesn't look too good in landscape
mode
it's obviously not centered in the
middle of the screen so if you think
about how what centering means it
actually means an equal distance from
both edges so if I want a widget
centered then I really have to set
constraints on both sides so this time
what I'm going to do is use the
right-hand circle and drag that to the
right edge but while I'm doing that just
look up here that the zoomin pane zoom
in and pan pane and the minute to see
what happens when I do that so I'm gonna
hold down the tool tab toolbar tip comes
up and there's drag over to the right
and you can see what happened when I did
that we've got a margin appear on the
right-hand side and that's because we've
used a constraint for the right-hand
side but we also got this little pain
this little slider appearing down the
bottom as well the value in the slider
shows how far the widget is from the
left edge as the percentage so if it's
50% from the left edge it must also be
50% from the right and the image is now
perfectly centered on the screen well
maybe not because clearly it's not
centered on the screen at the moment so
the reason why it's not centered is
because the image plus its margins are
perfectly centered but if you recall we
set the left margin to 120 and I can see
that by just hovering with my mouse in
the hundred and 20 showing up there and
you can sort of see the constraints
there are those little dip things and
those how the constraint finishes here
on the left and then we've got this gap
of 120 which is a margin and on the
right hand side the margins only 16
before was where the constraint actually
ends so taking that into account it
actually needs the margin plus the width
to determine where it's going to be
centered so although I said that those
numbers to the left and right of the
widget in zoom and pan in the zoom and
pan pane represent the distance from its
edges that's not strictly accurate
because they represent the margins
around the widget now the distinction
wasn't obvious when there was constraint
on only one side but obviously it's now
far more obvious as I'm just showing him
the image is clearly not central due to
that extra margin on the left-hand side
so we go back up here and I'm gonna
click on that and change that to eight
on the left-hand side and also eight on
the right-hand side once I do that we
can see that things now are much more
scented and just to confirm if I switch
back to portrait mode again we can see
that the image is still scented as well
remembering that at this stage we're
only focusing on centering it
horizontally because we have an added
constraints vertically at this point in
time so get those zippy lines and known
as constraints and this is why this
particular layout that we're using is
called a constraint layout so the theory
behind this is that you put constraints
on widgets to get them to appear in
certain positions so here we have the
image view constrained to appear a
certain distance from the left and right
hand edges of the screen now we can't
just drag the widget around if we want
but at the moment the only thing that's
guaranteed is the left/right positioning
of the widget so top to bottom isn't
defined and that's why we've actually
got this little red exclamation mark
which is quite small showing in the
image itself and if we hover right over
it
we do get a helpful message show up for
us automatically but generally speaking
it's quickly just to come over here and
we get the same thing by just clicking
on this little button you can see that's
showing it's the show warnings in error
button if we click on that we actually
get the errors showing on the screen
there and the number in there is the
number of errors or warnings so at a
glance you can sort of see whether there
are warnings and errors and if so how
many there is as well so the more severe
our warning in an actual fact you can
see here it's an error not a warning
it's saying that there's nothing
constraining the image view vertically
so basically it's saying it's kind of
jump to the top at least that's what it
should be saying currently saying jump
to the left I suspect that's a bug in
the preview version of Android studio
because so we haven't got a constraint
added vertically at this point in time
and in fact if you run this app right
now on an emulator you'll see that the
image does appear to jump to the top of
the screen so getting back to Android
studio we know that the image is roughly
set
horizontally and we could see how
accurately I positioned it by looking at
the little resume and pain diagram in
the top right so this sort of shows a
schematic of a widget with margins and
constraints on its side if there are any
now we've only got the left and right
sides constrained so there's no vertical
slider and there's no top or bottom mods
and showing in there at this point in
time now the slider shows the percentage
bias from wherever it's constrained to
on the left and the bias on the right is
obviously a hundred miners that because
it's a percentage so as I drag the image
left and right you have a look in the
zoom in pan pane you'll notice that that
slider is actually moving up and down
along with the image and you don't have
to do that to me but you can also just
give it roughly where you wanted to with
that selected I'm just using my left
keyboard and that doesn't work you just
need to click on the slider and once we
do that we can move it manually you can
see I'm just moving with the keyboard
now I can move it to be a little bit
more precise to get it exactly where you
want it to be and of course that beats
fighting with the mouse to get that fine
you know adjustment so most things up
here in the zoom and pane zoom and pan
pane and draw get that that wrong a few
times throughout this course most things
they are actually clickable so I can set
left or right margins by clicking the
values and choosing something from the
suggestions that drop down but I can
also type in a new value so here instead
of just typing selecting an option I can
just double click in there and say quite
happily change that to 12 present and
double click in there and make that 12
as well press ENTER and you can see the
margins are now 12 and we just hover
over here you can see that the margin is
showing as 12 as well but changing the
margins is a little bit artificial at
the moment because the image is nowhere
near the edge and there's actually
nothing else on there but even so you
can see that I set both to 12 but if I
set one to say 32 you saw that move the
image move over to the right to allow
for the margin that I've added on the
left hand side so setting a vertical
constraint is the same as horizontal and
you'll see the circle is at the top and
bottom of a widget so when I set the top
one by just moving ahead to the
top and holding down the mid left mouse
button and dragging to the top you can
see the image jumps quickly to the top
of the screen we've now got an extra
constraint at the top and you can see
we've now got the margin showing at the
top here in the zoom and pan pane and
notice that we've only got the one
warning here now and we'll talk more
about content descriptions shortly and
as soon as I set the bottom constraint
you should find that it'll come back
into the middle again I'm gonna do that
we know basically in the middle but
we've also got this extra margin here
which I'll also change back to weight
and I'll change this one back to weight
as well notice now that there's also a
vertical slider in the zoom and pan pane
and that works exactly the same as the
horizontal one did but obviously
vertically I can move that up and down I
can also move the image if I want to
instead and get it back to 50 like that
and the bias in this case is measured
from the bottom of the screen for the
vertical slider and the slider makes
that visually obvious but you have to
remember that if you position things in
your code rather than using the designer
so far this is very simple and that's
because we've only got one widget on the
screen I'm going to be coming back to
constraints soon when we start looking
at constraining widgets to other widgets
rather than just the edges of the layout
and I'm also going to explain what the
auto connect button does and also show
you how Android studio can infer
constraints and both of those are pretty
cool but while we've still got a pretty
simple display though I want to just
have a look at some of the other
features provided by the layout designer
now firstly Google were currently refer
to the panel named zoom and pianist the
view inspector that's us here and in
previous preview versions of Android
studio 2.2 it did actually have the name
showing on the screen there now but it's
now just referring to that as properties
so inside the inspector there's four
lines which are used to set - how the
width and height are interpreted you
know Google refer to these as the inner
lines within a widget and that's these
four lines here that I'm talking about
so at the moment they're both using the
values in the layout
width and height in these fields here
which if you recall in the previous
video we set that to 160 DP and that's
called fixed now if we click on any of
these here will actually change into any
size then the markers will change to
sort of a spiky graph let's just do that
to see what it does
notice how this has changed now some
spiky graphed and then it's also that we
select the horrors selected the
horizontal one and the layout width now
has changed to zero DP if we click on
that again we see that the layout width
has changed to wrap content and we get
these little Chevron's showing as well
so what do they actually all mean well
at the moment we're working with an
image that's actually bigger than the
device screen if you recall the image
was 640 by 480 and our screen isn't
actually that wide so it's easier to see
a lot of this if we're using a smaller
image so what I'm going to do in the
next video is bring in the other image
and we're going to start working on this
just to see what we can start figuring
out about the various types here the
fixed the any size and the wrap content
and what differences they make to our
images so I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
