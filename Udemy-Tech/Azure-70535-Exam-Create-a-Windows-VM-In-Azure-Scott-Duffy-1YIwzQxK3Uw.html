and in this tutorial I'm gonna create a
brand new Asha virtual machine Windows
virtual machine that you can then use
for whatever purpose you want running a
Windows server in the cloud now I'm
gonna use Microsoft Azure if you don't
have an azure account Microsoft does
have a free account so you can go to add
Microsoft com sign up for free and they
do throw in a two hundred dollar credit
so you can start to experiment play with
servers and resources for up to 30 days
there are 12 months of extended free
services for some of those resources and
there's some resources that are just
always free so go on and get yourself a
free account if you don't have one now
I'm signed into the azure portal that's
at portal Dodger comm and you can see
here I've got some resources and I'm
current career but that's okay I want to
create a virtual machine now I there's a
couple of ways to do that there's a menu
that across the left and so I can just
go into virtual machines and create it
there's a search box across the top and
I can type in virtual machine and
that'll take me to a screen as well or I
can go into this new tab I'm gonna go
into virtual machines
I don't currently have any virtual
machines and I'm gonna say create
virtual machines this is a directory of
Microsoft virtual machines and there are
literally hundreds maybe even a thousand
or more different options to choose from
different vendors not just Microsoft
like Red Hat canonical etc provide
images to Microsoft that you can use to
start up now we're gonna create a
Windows machine Microsoft has many
different versions of windows to choose
from from Windows 2008 update Windows
2016 you can see here that there are
also a containers versions etc okay so
I'm going to create this top one here
Windows 2016 datacenter edition
okay now we're gonna create it in the
resource manager model if you if you
don't know the difference between
resource manager in the classic model
you're gonna select resource manager
classic is was arranged it was basically
it's being deprecated resource managers
was introduced a few years ago and so
unless you have legacy resources that
are running under the old model we're
gonna continue to use resource manager
model now we need to give it a name so
let's call it my first virtual machine
now the first decision that you need to
make has what kind of disk storage that
virtual machines gonna make we have the
choice between a traditional spinning
disk HDD or the flash solid-state disk
now the solid-state disk is a little bit
a little bit more expensive but of
course the data accesses are quicker you
also don't have the amount like the
solid-state has an upper limit to how
much storage you can get or as the
spinning disk is obviously it sometimes
in the terabytes and multiple terabytes
I'm going to create a user account so
this is the user that you're going to be
using to log into Windows so you're
going to use Windows remote desktop and
I'm creating a password for the windows
remote desktop as well it's going under
might I only have the one subscription
but if you had MSDN or a visual studio
subscription or you're part of the
Microsoft SPARC program or there's a
bunch of other types of programs that
provide credits but I'm just paying for
everything that I use in our resource
group the real thing about the azure
resource model is that you can you have
to assign resources into a group and
then you can act on those groups so you
can delete them you can assign security
settings those groups become lumped
together and you can do actions on them
as a whole so I'm gonna say a Zed new
resource group
also you need to choose a location now
Microsoft currently has 42 regions
around the world and so I can deploy my
virtual machine into most of them now
you can't deploy into places like China
although chart they do have a Chinese
data center you need to have an
agreement with the Chinese data center
so I wouldn't see China on this list but
there are everything from Korea Europe
North America South America on on here
so I'm gonna employ this into Canada if
I do have a Windows Server license I'm
part of a Microsoft agreement I can
obviously use allocate one of my
licenses but I don't click ok and we're
taking it to the second blade here now I
said we selected the solid state disk
the flash disk now we get to choose
which type of server now Microsoft has
dozens and dozens of options in terms of
servers depending on the date the data
center that you chose so I chose a
Canada data center my options might be
different if you chose an American one
or you chose a European one different
data centers have different options
available I can go with what's
recommended or I can click view all ok
if you all so Microsoft does name their
instances with this these letters right
so D with a number and underscore v3 so
this is the third version of the D
Series alright so there's a DV 2 and a D
regular D there's the db2 it's just an
additional types of hardware this is a
most modern version of the D Series if
you're willing to use some older one you
can probably save a little bit of money
we can see the dollar amounts that are
attached here but the purposes of this
demonstration I'm the server's not going
to live for very long so I can just
choose one that again your pain by the
by the minute essentially so if I chose
C
I chose this this ds-11 or ds2 that's
that's the average monthly charge it's
around six dollars a day but again it's
not going to live for a date in reality
with this demonstration this one comes
with two virtual CPUs seven gigabytes of
memory access level memory I can have up
to eight data disks etc etc fourteen
gigabytes of local storage I will choose
that one now what it's asking about
availability set microsoft recommends if
you have availability is a concern of
yours then you're going to need to run
more than one of these servers okay so
you're gonna need two or three or four
or five servers in order to make sure
your application stays up during the
most critical times sometimes Microsoft
runs updates against their stuff
recently an Intel was hacked and so CPUs
need to be updated with with new
operating system code so sometimes it's
not unavailable to bring our server down
so if you have more than one then you
can mitigate that I'm not gonna run this
and availability set Microsoft has this
managed disk option so if I was to say
no then I'm going to create dis and I'm
going to have to then reserve an amount
of space etc etc managed disks Microsoft
manages the backups they manage I'll put
my mouse over here they already manage
the availability of the disk and so I
think it's really things are moving
towards this managed disk option of
course it's a little bit
you know it becomes it becomes scalable
when Microsoft manages it if you say no
then you manage the scaling every
resource must be on a network of course
so it's going to create a brand new
virtual network because I have a new
resource group it's gonna create a brand
new virtual network for this server to
run brand new subnet a brand new public
IP address and a brand new security
group so all of these will be attached
to the network on which the server runs
now if I wanted to have extensions like
there's automation etc then I could add
extensions to it I won't auto shut down
this is if you know if you're using this
for testing purposes which we are then
it will I can say shut down at 7:00
o'clock every day so if this machine is
running by 7:00 p.m.
it'll shut down I can pick my time zone
here I'm in Eastern so by 7:00 p.m.
tonight this machine will shut itself
down
do I want notification no monitoring I
mean that makes sense your DevOps and IT
pros are going to want some information
on this this gets logged into a storage
account there's a storage account
associated with this and now Microsoft
actually has a backup option on the
creation step this is relatively new I'm
not going to touch it
so Microsoft's gonna give me the summary
here of this server that I'm about to
create we'll give it a second it's
important to remember so this is 24
cents Canadian per hour which is not not
bad I guess for having a server for a
short period of time important to
remember that this is the price for the
virtual machine storage has its own
price and so when you're creating a
virtual machine you're creating a
virtual hard disk Bhd that supports it
that VHD goes into your storage account
and so even if the virtual machine is
not running you're going to be charged
for the storage but this cost is only
for the cost you're using it while it's
running if I click the Create button
then I'm going to end up with a virtual
machine it will take about ten or
fifteen minutes I'm gonna let it I'm
gonna let it do that
and when we come back to this video
we're gonna have a running virtual
machine alright so we can see here that
the virtual machine has been created it
is a standard ds2 B 2 as we requested
with two's V CPUs and seven gigabytes of
memory Asher has assigned to the public
IP address we will recall that we did
not actually request a specific IP
address you can't request a specific IP
address when you're creating a virtual
machine but Microsoft has pulled one of
their IP addresses out of their pool and
assigned it to us as a public IP address
so we can connect to this box using this
IP address if we wanted to give this
machine a domain name we could go into
here configure it and it will be
based on the public IP address we can
call it you know it's something dot
Canada is cloud app a sure calm so my
first VM Kennedy's cloud app calm ok and
I'll save that and so it's now I can
access this IP address which is the
server by its IP address and also by a
fully qualified domain name so let's
let's connect to this box right so the
box is running I'm going to click now
there's a couple ways I can do this
now that I have an IP address I can open
windows remote desktop and I can just
put the PI ap address in there and
connect to it the domain name that I
created my first VM kind of the East etc
or Microsoft provides this convenient
connect button right up here at the top
left so I click connect and you'll
notice that it downloads the RDP file to
my local machine so I just simply need
to run this and windows remote desktop
will start and it will automatically try
to connect to the same IP address now I
do need to approve it and it will try
remember that when we created the
virtual machine we created a specific
user ID and password so it's not using
our Windows credentials from our local
it's going to use this wind I use
already and password now I have logged
into this too just now to test it so
it's remembering that but what you'll
find is it'll try to log you in as your
Windows user that you're using your
computer as and you're gonna have to go
and say more choices and enter a
specific user ID and password so I'm
gonna enter the user ID and password
that I created and say ok now it's
asking me security if this certificate
is valid because because it hasn't seen
it before
I'm gonna say yes I can also click the
box saying don't ask me again for this
computer but I'll just click yes and now
when you login to this box for the first
time it's going to need to create just
like in any windows it hasn't seen you
before it's going to create a user
profile for
there's a little bit of a startup but
look how quick this this sort of comes
up now what we need to do is we need to
go into server manager now it might
start automatically for you so no
machine is disputed for the first time
server manager pops up and you'll see
here the way that you you modify a
server for usage is using rules okay so
I can say add role here and a little
wizard pops up and I can say okay next
role based I want this machine and now
these are the list I know it's hard to
see here but the list of possible roles
for this machine so it can be a DNS
server a dhcp server and r2 directory
server i need i want this to be a web
server okay so i click web server and it
asked me to install the is management
console of course I need is management
console that's that makes sense so click
Next now if I wanted to I could add more
more features to this so SMTP server FTP
server telnet server
you know you might if you're using this
server for a real purpose you might need
to get in here and set the oldest all
the features of it but this is just a
demo for me and so I'm not going to I'm
going to use the default installation
you can see here for the web services
I can choose things like let's see HTTP
logging redirection WebDAV is clients
URL redirection so we don't have to
really touch any of this by default see
these are just sort of the rural
services and I'm gonna click install and
so Windows is going to do all of the
things that's needed here to to make
this a web server one of the things that
it does is it actually modifies the
firewall so there is a firewall on this
Windows machine just like in any Windows
machine and it restricts traffic that
comes in to the box from external now
until the is roll is installed then web
traffic so if I said inbound rules see I
want to say enabled yes so by default
there's no rule that allows port 80 or
port 443 which is the web traffic when
this installation of the roll that
completes its going to insert a new rule
for the Windows Firewall for 80 and 443
here's here's four four three so you're
so good tunneling so once this is
complete we're going to it's going to be
enabled right now it's not enabled and
and basically traffic is going to be
allowed to come into the server so
that's one thing we need to do to make
sure that we can make address this as a
web server okay so you can see here that
it's got the follows role and an is role
now I'm going to close this down I'm
actually going to disconnect from this
machine click a click disk
and one thing I need to do is I need to
make sure that traffic can travel to the
machine so you'll see here a virtual
machine is is part of a subnet subnet as
part of a virtual network so I'm going
to go into the subnet here and so
there's a subnets default every subnet
has a network security group this one
you see must inherit it from the from
its parent so first VM has got a network
interface never interface has a network
security group so there's a my first VM
network security group and you'll see
here inside of the network security
group this is these are basically the
firewall settings inside of azure we had
Windows Firewall which was software
based this is also software based but
it's outside of the machine this is the
network now by default it allows RDP
traffic so that's port 3389
it allows it virtual networks which are
VPNs and it allows load balancers and
then it denies everything else right so
you'll see the inbound security rules
for this network it's pretty restrictive
it just allows one thing from the
outside which is RDP traffic which is we
already proved and when we tried Remote
Desktop it worked well what we want to
do is we want to add security rule I'm
going to say from outside we want to add
I'm going to choose the basic one and in
the basic one I can choose HTTP traffic
from the drop-down and I'm going to say
yes I want HTTP and see it's updating
here so you'll see here
given priority 100 rules are executed
from lowest number to highest so
priority 100 is in this case the first
rule that will be evaluated we also want
to allow HTTP traffic so I'm going to go
up to here and I'm gonna say HTTP that
is the rules have to be unique so I'm
going to put this as priority 101 and
that's port 443 and so now I've added
two rules to the firewall that will
allow the this traffic to through the
through the firewall okay now if we go
back to our virtual machines
I'm just going to go this way to it
you'll see here that I'm gonna copy the
IP address and I'm going to open a new
tab on my browser here and with that IP
address I'm going to navigate to the web
browser so this has traveled from my
computer over the Microsoft Azure
network into that virtual machine that
we created and it's now serving up the
default web page that is Gibbs when you
don't have anything there so in this
video we have successfully created a new
virtual machine created it as a web
server specifically and proven that
we're able to get to it now I do have a
number of courses on udemy that are
relating to Microsoft Azure now so if
you're interested in the absolute basics
of Azure and cloud computing I have a
course that is the starting and
beginning course for Microsoft Azure now
if you do have some experience or you're
interested in getting certified as
Microsoft Azure I have a number of
certification courses that'll at the end
of that and you take the tests and pass
it you will be able to call yourself
Microsoft as your certified passing two
of these exams you can call yourself an
MCS a and if you pass all three of these
exams you'll be called an M CSC so
for instance the 73 to 535 exam for
architecting Microsoft Azure again
available on you to me the link is in
the description I recommend you checking
it out there's already almost 25,000
students in this course and so it's the
most popular course online having to do
with Microsoft Azure as far as I know so
check it out and again if you want to
get the basics there's one for you too
so come over to my udemy landing page
check out my courses and perhaps you'll
find something that's interesting to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
