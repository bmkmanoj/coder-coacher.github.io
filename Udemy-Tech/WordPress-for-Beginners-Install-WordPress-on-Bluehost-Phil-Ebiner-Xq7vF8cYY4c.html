video I'm going to give you a free
preview of a lesson from my wordpress
for beginners course on udemy calm in
this lesson you'll learn what hosting is
and how to install WordPress on your web
host such as bluehost.com the first
thing you need to do if you want to
build a wordpress site that's live for
the public is to purchase hosting
hosting is the back end of your website
where your actual files are saved
WordPress is the framework that allows
you to edit your website but it's not
where your files are hosted there are
many different hosting services out
there I've used Bluehost for a number of
years for all of my websites and I can
recommend it there's other ones out
there to other people recommend like
Hostgator but i'm going to show you how
to install wordpress with Bluehost
because it's what I would do if I were
you now for other people if you're using
another host I'll try to include
resources for how to install WordPress
on those hosts as well so to get started
I'm going to actually walk through the
entire process if you go to Bluehost com
what you're going to want to do is click
get started now you can select your
different plans these different plans
have different options so if you go with
the basic plans
you only get one website you have a
limited amount of space for that website
even though 50 gigabytes seems like a
lot it potentially could get filled up
if you end up having a huge website with
lots of files photos those kinds of
things that you upload to it you can
only have up to 5 domains 25 subdomains
these are things that as you grow you
might want to consider upgrading and
that's another thing you can upgrade to
any of these accounts later on these
other ones include different types of
things like unmetered bandwidth and
space and websites but for this class
I'm just gonna go with the basic one
just to get started if you already have
a domain name you can submit it here on
the right and you're going to have to
transfer it say you purchased a domain
name from GoDaddy calm or Namecheap or
another domain
you're going to have to transfer it to
Bluehost if I want a new one then I
click over here and I can choose a new
one for this website test I'm going to
create a website based off of my very
simple woodworking designs so I'm gonna
call it a banner designs now dot-com is
the best one but if I want something
cheaper just to play around with I can
use a dot site or some of these other
different domain extensions so let's
just click Next to make sure that this
domain name is available it looks like
it what is available so the next thing
you would do is fill out your name and
all of your information and then under
your package information you can choose
which package you want so for example on
Bluehost there's different packages and
the deal gets better the more months
that you pay for up front so choose the
price that fits your plan now there's
different options that you might want to
consider one is domain privacy
protection this is really important and
if you click any of these more
information buttons it will give you
more information about it if you don't
have domain privacy protection then your
address and your email address are
actually out in the public once you
register for your domain name so I would
consider that one the other ones site
backup pro search engine jumpstart site
lock security all these things we're
going to be learning how to install
plugins that do just the same thing but
for free and some other options so I
wouldn't recommend not choosing any of
these over here
lastly you input your payment
information and then click Submit so go
ahead fill this out and purchase your
hosting before moving on to the next
step once you have signed up for
Bluehost
log into your account and under hosting
click on cPanel then click install
WordPress it'll take you to this new
page and say get started you're going to
choose the domain name that you just
registered for me I have different
domain names that I've purchased I'm
actually using my main account for
Bluehost now because I can purchase
multiple domain names under the same
host so now I can click a banner designs
com which is the new website that I want
to build for this course select that
domain leave the directory empty
unless you want it to point to a
separate website so if you typed in home
for example then when you go to Evan or
designs , would take you to Evan or
designs comm /home so leave it blank so
people can get straight to that domain
name click Next and then it will show
you your admin username email address
and password check these two boxes
saying that you understand that the
install will take place on this domain
and that you've read the Terms then
click install once you get this
installation complete banner up here
you're ready to rock and roll you'll
also receive an email with the web
address and your information for logging
in so go ahead and go to the website
address which will be your domain
name.com or whatever your extension is
forward slash WP dash admin this is how
you log on to your WordPress site now
input the user name or email address and
password that you were given in the last
step of installing WordPress great now
you have WordPress installed for your
brand new website now to log on and to
edit your website always remember that
you're going to go to your website URL
comm forward slash WP dash admin and
then input your username and password
the Bluehost account or your hosting
account is separate and you might have
to login to that to adjust things to
register new domains or things like that
but for the rest of this class we won't
be dealing with hosting as much as just
with your website itself so whether
you're using the free option of server
press or a hosting option like Bluehost
we now have WordPress installed and are
ready to start building our own website
