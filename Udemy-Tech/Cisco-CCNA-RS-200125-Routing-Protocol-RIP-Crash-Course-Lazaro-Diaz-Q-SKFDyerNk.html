this lecture is gonna be about rip do
everything there is to do with rip or
basically anything that you need to know
for certification about rip and I'll get
into some other stuff now there's gonna
be a little makeshift with me
disappearing and coming back in don't
worry about it that's normal that's me
playing around okay so let's go in and
get started and see what we're gonna
talk about all right so the things we're
going to cover as you can see right here
is the differences between a routing
protocol any routed protocol okay so you
need to know this for test certification
and if anybody asks you I mean if you're
in the IT industry you got a wise guy
out there it says hey well do you know
the difference between routing and route
it you know you can just say yes I do
all right and you can actually you're
questioning your test we're going to a
routing protocol basics now when I get
into the IP routing process we should
know this so we're gonna stick to just
you know rip oh we're gonna talk about
the administrative distance very
important lots of questions on
administrative distance that I can
remember and that your students can
remember okay and we have different
types of routing protocols such as
distance vector lane state and advance
this inspector or as they call it the
hybrid okay you know we're talking about
eh RP with our so that we can I'm gonna
get into is Rick all right talk about
rip and all the little features or some
of its features and then we'll go into a
different class types of rip because you
got rivers are one which we don't use
anymore
we don't but you could get a question or
you could work for a company that's
using the older rip and they put the
newer rip but they forgot to do them
this other one and you want to know
what's going on that's what we have the
verification commands and you be good to
do a debug IP rip and you'll see oh so
version two will not listen to version
one
version one well isn't subversion two
and so for something like that okay so
we'll get into that we'll get into real
version two and we'll get into rip ng
yes yes yes yes is that just a
powerpoint we're going to be going into
labs I have a nice lab already prepared
for you guys
okay so we'll be going into that Oh so
we'll be configuring rip obviously the
basics first just to get the lab
connectivity alright then we're doing
two main things two main things to tweak
rip alright which is holding down real
propagations
using the passive interface command
that's a big one that's a big one okay
yeah so funny they're getting that looks
like a big one to me all right
and then advertising rip using default
routes and you normally would do this
and you know it's funny when I get there
but I've got more than one connection
that the routes can go and you might
tell hey especially towards the internet
and you want to tell it that you want to
go a certain way you use a default route
okay and then we'll look at verification
commands always he began the routing
table we show IP route Treveon brief
looking at our interfaces debug IP rip
but we can take a look at what's going
on behind the scenes and our little
buddy ping all right so let's gonna get
started with the very first slide of
this particular lecture oh differences
between Ryan protocol and routed
protocols that's the whole thing
all right so as it says right there
writing protocols find all networks
within the greater internet work and to
be sure that all routers have the same
routing table obviously that's what
routing protocols do that you always
snitch on each other and they tell
everybody hey this is who I'm connected
to all right that's what they do and
then they create this huge network right
once everybody knows about everybody's
network they're converged right one
important calls also used to do it to
determine the best path to reach the
destination network but again as you see
those things running protocol for their
rip had your piano SPF each one has a
different method right because each one
has a different algorithm the rip uses
the bellman-ford BRP uses the duel and
then OSPF I usually just put RSP that's
funny
whoa SPF all right I'm missing enough
they're gonna be sending me emails
because I missed an F okay I'm telling
you now I missed an F okay Oh SPF uses
the Dijkstra so each algorithm and each
writing protocol uses its own way of
determining which is the best path okay
so that's a little bit you know when it
comes to each one is different like
static routes they really don't use
anything you know because we talked
about dynamic routing that's where I was
running a writing protocol static routes
we're telling you hey go this way that's
just the way it is alright but these
three are the most common obviously now
with a new CCNA we do have ibgp that's
involved okay but up there will be a
path vector routing protocol we're not
gonna get into that cause we're gonna
stick to rip okay so let's go ahead and
onto the next slide
a routing protocol
those aren't ones you put on the
interface once you put an IP address
whether it's ipv6 or before ain't turned
on hey you're using a router protocol
that's it Robert call determine the
method of package delivery but method
okay but with ipv6 there is a little
more arc
no more broadcast right ipv6 uses
router solicitations router
acknowledgments router advertisements
okay got dad duplicate address detection
all these things so the router protocol
so there are only two that you need to
know
all righty v4 and ipv6 so if you're
asked that question now you know now you
know we have routing protocols and
routed protocols all work on layer 3 of
the OSI model by the way all there
through yo the OSI model alright so
that's the difference now we'll be
configuring both we're gonna be
configuring happy for and ipv6 so we're
gonna do like a dual stack scenario
for you okay all right so let's go onto
the next slide
this guy is very important a lot of
questions on administrative distance or
the ad you gotta be careful just by
seeing ad because E is your P does you
something called not an assistant it has
it but it also uses and what is the DL
the active distance or something like
that so you gotta be very careful I
forget sometimes but the advertised the
advertised the advertised oh the
advertised distance that's what it is
there you go I remember so the
administrative distance or the ad or the
writing protocol is how believable how
trustworthy that route is and the lower
that number the more believable you can
see the range right there from 0 to 255
okay and the thing is if a router
receives an update from the same network
it will check the very first thing it
does it checks the ad to see who I
believe not gonna tell you this right
now okay if you're configuring let's say
those three
yeah ERP or SPF and rip my which is what
we're going to concentrate out yes your
P is gonna be in the routing table
that's it all right
ever network has two routers that it's
advertising the same network I don't
know why that would be all right so it's
kind of crazy all right
but hey that's what they tell you it
says they get if our if our router
receives an update from the same network
from two places then it will check the
advertised distance well I can tell you
right now that if you have these three
writing protocols configured my IHS at
least three writing protocol config are
configured the one with the Lords
administrative distance is going to take
effect
period it's going to be the right table
if you go for your rip we're gonna build
a router you pop it on start it'll be
there yeah your P will be there or SPF
will be there but yeah add your P you do
a show IP route here's your P is gonna
be the one that's gonna be maintaining
that routers routing table
be making decisions or how it's gonna
route the packet so I don't think
anything else all right so that's BS
we're selling this right now straight-up
allows where JT has just told you that
that's BS all right if a router receives
you know different say no okay it
wouldn't even make sense
okay if both routes have the same ID
next next in line will be than the
matrix so let's just say for books sake
that the router gets two routes for the
same network and they both have the same
eighty all right so what worries gonna
do next it's gonna look at the metrics
or bandwidth and always and always use
the facets but again that depends on the
routing protocol because rip does not
care at all about bandwidth rip is all
about distance hops we'll get into that
shortly
that's a here's your piano SPF that's
another story but they have their
different methods of dealing with it
okay but we're not gonna get into that
but your your feet does use bandwidth
and delay and so does OSPF so there are
more intelligent routing protocols that
will say okay well they both have the
same ad what metrics do I use well for
rip is a hop camp alright so not very
good we have a little table you find in
any book any pamphlet
google it whatever alright but I
connected interface when you do a show
IP route I'll connect an interface the
ID is zero alright and this was funny
because the book doesn't tell you this
all right or any any book doesn't tell
you this my book will but as I am doing
a CC read book all right it's gonna be
very detailed and straight to the point
no no fluff all right static routes the
pen
if you're using the exit interface or
the routers next-hop if use the exit
interface then it will be a zero and
then it will be considered a connected
interface if used the next routers hub
address then it will have an
administrative distance of one now for
the CCNA and there's one thing that keep
telling everybody I keep telling my
fellow colleagues my instructors all
these all these people you need and you
IT guys and gals out there when you go
take this test forget about what you do
in your job you're taking a friggin test
okay so you got to answer it like a test
that's just the way it is because even
within the Cisco world in the CCNA world
they tell you use the exit interface
make it a connected route that way is
what's gonna happen is it's gonna do
only one look-up on the routing table
you get to the CCIE level as they tell
you don't do connector routes because
you're going generate too many ARMs so
as airily is based on the certification
that you're taking okay but anyway
static routes are zero if you exit
interface next our top address will be a
one okay we can change that that's
something that you can tweak for static
routes external bgp will be a twenty EW
GRP will be 94 SPF 110 rip 124 rip
alright
yes you can change the dole you can make
it lower or higher you can make it
external bgp 170 did I just put that up
there why did I put it in twice external
bgp 20 and i down here it's momiji
people inside no sir no bgp is 170 okay
I know I put that 20 under for forget
that one for ignore this okay and
internal BGP is 200 and 255 so
no it's not used I mean that's the
highest of the range if you have about a
minute this is 255 you'll never go never
listen to you because you're the most
untrustworthy portion or router in the
world okay
so nobody's gonna believe you but where
we're concerned with is rip rip right
which is 120 so keep that in mind
because I don't know if I don't you know
I am an instructor you know I given
tests and you know questions that I will
give students were like if you have the
following three protocols configured
which running protocol will make it to
the routing table well it's all based on
the administrative distance so if you
have a jarppi or every age I repeat if
you have ears European OSPF EIGRP if you
have always favorite OSPF okay unless
you change the administrative distance
manually keep that in mind keep that in
mind no big deal just keep it in mind so
classes are writing protocol so once you
make the decision and what would you
make the decision let's ask that before
we get into this slide I'm not gonna
make it read all that
well you can read it as I talk but why
would you want to use a dynamic routing
protocol think about that all right we
have static routes awesome
telecommunications where you static
routes like there was no tomorrow okay
it was really coming pace so it's the
same thing over and over again but still
static routes and somebody one day
believe it everything half of South
Florida was going but either way I'm
going off on a tangent so why would you
do
dynamic versus static well static routes
play I have no burden on the router the
router doesn't have to think it's nuts
in the air anyhow any updates out so it
makes you secure right but the burden is
on you the administrator the tech guy
who's just walked in the door and say
listen you go configure this so you
gotta figure out it like oh wow I gotta
start doing static routes and all these
different networks we imagine and ours
for this question
babe is big right where do you determine
to go from static routes to dynamic
routing I remember and one cause that
worked they first you know when I first
I working for them they only had I think
two campuses no they had three campuses
and they were using static routes one
day grew to seven campuses then they
went to dynamic routing but they also
kept their static routes and I believe
it's backup if I'm not if I'm not
mistaken okay because it's how many
summits you have okay how many summits
is it a router number because what if
you it's just one subnet under every
router that's all you have and you just
using a router to get out to the
internet to get to the other side right
you can use dynamic routing that's why I
know you're just advertising just down
one network but what if you have a
hundred subnets on your each router or
you have two routers yeah 50 subnets
under each oh okay so when you start
getting you know you don't want to type
all those static routes you don't want
to do that so that's what you made the
decision when it's becoming a burden
let's say put it that way like I said
there's too many sad routes to keep up
with ah you know is ridiculous every
time I take out a sudden it I put in a
subnet I got a change the routing table
because I take out that static route put
it in the static route so it just
becomes not feasible right they're
paying you used to your own hey we need
an administrator just to do static
routes No
so I also will use dynamic routes with
no dynamic writing protocols because
they do the job for us but we got to be
smart about it
we got to make a decision which one am I
going to use in this case we're using
rip write small network it's a distance
vector routing protocol alright the way
looks for the best password however is
based on five counts hop counts it does
not take into consideration anything
else
it looks at hop counts and the maximum
hop count is 15 all right but are you
going to use a distance vector goes
rip is a true and proud this is vector
routing protocol okay so yeah look at
your network you gotta see what you're
doing alright you gotta get your wine
links all these different things because
you're using a writing protocol because
you're getting across a wine unless
you're doing inter VLAN connectivity
which in that case you didn't need a
routing protocol it's just that same
router you're connected to okay it's
because going from branch to branch to
branch across a went by the way then you
have links to these fur girls also
considered shortest path first they
create tables the neighbor table who's
right next to you who's connected to a
neighbor a what's up neighbor alright
the topology table has a a better view
of the entire network or distance vector
routing protocol has no clue okay links
a writing for a call does because it
creates this topology table and it knows
how ardennes connected and then
obviously has a routing table leg states
protocols or link state routing
protocols have a better understanding of
their lease a protocols do not send the
entire it's exactly are these based on
triggered updates this is vector routing
protocols at a default setting at least
for RIP 3/32 okay here's my whole
running table hey here's my whole
routing table hey here's what I got it
you know you know I mean that's the
whole thing with with rip imagine
somebody poking you on the shoulder
every 30 seconds to tell you the same
thing
nothing's changed still the same I just
wanted to poke you on the shoulder again
every 30 seconds I'm gonna learn or
knock your teeth out alright so with a
link state routing protocol that doesn't
happen okay will link state routing
protocol only when there's a change does
it say hey here's an update there's a
new change that has gone on on the
network you need to know about and then
just to make sure that you're still
there it just sends things called
hellos but they're keep alive now you
says hey you're still there very small
you know little packet that says here
you there yeah cool alright I'm still
here too
I mean that's what it does to directly
connect the neighbors that's why I put
that in parenthesis so uses a hollow
messages quick thing here you know I
know we're not talking about these
writing protocols
well yeah GRP these hellos okay they can
be different it's okay all right but
OSPF new you directly connect you're
directly connecting neighbors better
have the same hellos goes there in
seconds okay
my believe is 10 seconds nothing all
right
are there there you have so if they're
not the same that's the point if this
router and this router they're directly
connected to each other and it sounds
some hollow for five seconds and this
hello for 10 seconds they will not
create a neighbor relationship okay they
will not they usually solos as well so
they can use discovery of this though
it's updates alright and so it a
creative you can create your neighbors
all right these hollows going out and
say hey who's out there 8 are you there
alright and all chapters are called
link-state advertisements ok which are
small alright just to create neighbors
alright so this is vector bad right bad
rip right because the whole writing
table at the same time not very smart to
make decisions laying state much better
but we have an all-knowing advance this
Inspectorate we're talking about here is
he had your p okay it uses both features
from the DV and the link state why is
this is your p like acts like a link
sake because it uses solo messages to
discover the neighbors and only sends
partial updates yeah grpe
the first time it starts creating its
neighbor table it will send everything
out the first time around after they've
converged then it sends out updates then
it sends out updates okay but your PD is
still considered a distance vector
even though it acts like a ling state
because it's limited to hot camps a
killing by default a hundred right and
you can change it up to 255 all right
but yeah RP is a better routing protocol
because it does make intelligent
decisions because as things called K
values one through five okay which is
the tool most important - which is
bandwidth and delay bandwidth and delay
it makes these calculations for the
advertised distance and all these
different things that it does to make a
good decision on which way should I send
this data these packets okay but rip has
no clue in life doesn't care you can
have fiber you can have I don't know all
c-51 lines running on the outside and
you have a direct link
that's a 33.5 cable going straight
through it'll choose that 33.5 cable all
the time because it's one hop pointing
straight across rather than two hops
going this way so that's just the way it
is or three or whatever it is alright
but that's just the way rip works you
can tell it you can tweak it all right
like I said you can use in the beginning
when going to things we're going to go
over default we use a default route all
right for Rick to send things we're not
wait static routes will always override
the writing protocol based on the ad
maybe haven't configured that way so you
can you can do things to make things
happen
but by default yeah rip straight you
know what's the closest was it was it
closer this is between two points a
straight line and that's what rip thinks
about where your P actually makes it it
tells your decision you think about this
think about this you want to go to a
supermarket you're at your house you're
sitting at your house I know use Google
Maps now but you know play with me here
okay
you're you you look at the time what
time is oh my god how to pick up milk
what time is it oh wow it's 2d o'clock
school's out
school's out and on this side of the
street on by that Avenue but if I take
this it's like the highway it's tourist
season so they may get clogged up at
this time maybe they're going to the
parks so I think it will be a better
path but so you're right there you're
now you have an algorithm in your head
and you're saying hey based on the time
and because the school's out and because
it's tourist season and because you know
that certain streets have construction
on them which would be the better way so
you're creating all these different
variables and you're calculating in your
head which would be the best route and
maybe your gas tank you don't have
enough gas and you're saying oh man I
don't have enough gas which would be the
best way I need to go get gas for some
angular's wiring so all these different
things you have to take in consideration
we don't think about it we just it's
like you know it's robotic it's it's
just automatic it happened you didn't
you got your brain go so fast and you're
like no the best way to go is this way
once you start getting older then you
know like me okay sometimes you can
forget words and how to talk okay
but when you're young and strong you can
go ahead and think things like this but
that's what an algorithm does it creates
all these variables so it'll make a
better decision on which way to go
unfortunately Rick doesn't have that so
here like I said ripp is a true this is
effective writing protocol every 30
seconds by default you can tweet that
you can change that okay it'll send
being tired routing table out to its
neighbor
all right maximum Hawkeye 15 meaning if
he gets a hop count
he knows the 16 for destination it's all
reachable I didn't create the running
for recall don't ask me why
okay it is what it is know what it is
these are questions we sound like
questions to me I don't know all right
baby zombie Oh ball grip is best when
using small networks obviously it's not
efficient on slower web links no because
that's up people get confused when
creating labs because we're connecting
router to Roger Roger otter but remember
routers are really going across a wide
area network
going across some sort of connection you
have with your provider where that is
because if you have a branch office over
here in Miami have a branch office over
here and you know Florida branch out in
California branch office in New York so
you're going through providers to get to
where you need to go so they're going
through wide area networks so this is
where you're writing for recalls come
and play what are you gonna use what are
you gonna use
do you have fiber are you going fast do
you have a t1 I hope not
but if you do are you gonna use rip see
these see all these things that you need
to take into consideration it's very
important now things also to take into
you know keep in mind is the route
counters or timers all right because the
update timer you see right there every
30 seconds you can change it it has an
invalid timer and the reason I'm giving
you this is because sometimes there's
something called a flapping interface a
flapping interface there's something
wrong with the hardware or just
something wrong with the software that
keeps going up and down up and down up
and down and what happens is if you
don't tweet these timers all right what
what's gonna happen is that your route
will be coming valid quickly and you'll
hold alzheimer will not keep it in the
router and then you're flush timer will
say get this router running - so what
you need to do maybe not update as much
when I change that 30 second in
something less okay increase your
invalid timer and your hold down timer
to be longer periods in case you're
having some sort of an issue
it'll keep those routes there and
increase your flush time so it doesn't
get rid of that route completely out of
the routing table so if you are having a
hardware issue or software issues these
are timers that exist within rip that
you can play around with you can play
around with okay and yes you can learn
in the simulators you should be able to
do it in any simulator so knock your
socks off and play around okay so that's
rip that's right let's glue the next one
all right we have three well we have
several versions of RIP I should say
reversal warn nobody uses and they're
using it Tom
wrong don't use it because it's a class
full running protocol meaning everybody
has to have the same subnet mask
okay it summarizes it sends out the
summary and it's update doesn't set out
the full network because there's so many
math does not go out on it updates okay
rivers are one cannot talk to route
version two reversion two can talk to
rivers on one now there's things you can
do to make them work because you can
inject routes into reversion one and
inject routes into rivers into from each
other
but why do that just use red version two
we're version one is old are you still
using Windows 95 no you're not are you
guys using Windows 10 or one of those
two hundred whatever it is that they
come up with now whatever it is you know
that everybody gets the latest and
greatest so why in the world would you
be using red version one all right all
right no no when Windows 2000 came out I
went to update a I believe it was a
matter nursery was a daycare I don't
know daycare maybe watch or school care
thing I don't know they had laptops
there were this is one Windows 2000 ones
well ok that laptops with megabytes on
them that laptops running Windows 95 I'm
like I can't be nothing like this just
by the laptop I wasn't about to sit
there and change memory allocations and
and trying to make this thing wrong
quicker you need to speed on you listen
hello we're Windows 2000 we went through
Windows 98 98 second edition we have
millennium alright then one through
Windows 2000 hello
let's get up with it alright the same
thing with rip stop using rivers and one
it's not companies doesn't want to work
with the rest of us okay we run into
issues with that don't use it
alright your aversion to that uses
classless routing protocol what does
that mean it means it sends out the
updates if that's what a book doesn't
say that's why people get confused when
you're configuring ribbon that's what
doing this when you configure rip
version 2 it will still summarize the
networks you must it is imperative you
the world depends on it that you type no
Auto - summary whether you're doing it
in rip or e I G or people yes I said
that
why did I say that what did I say he had
your piece because yeah your P is also
considered it this is going to writing
protocol
don't get to in a second I'll get a
little bit deeper but you're gonna type
that too or do something else now that
you know because the person 2 will still
summarize and you'll see it I'll prove
it to you all right
still summarizes by default to the
classroom boundary what is that what's
the class of boundary well we have a
10-1 one 10.1.1.10 30 which is one of
your networks by the way what do you
have okay what do you have you have 2 up
here dresses 5 &amp;amp; 6
right well rip doesn't see that rip sees
even if it's version 2 is he's 10.000 I
don't till you type no Auto summary
meaning please do not summarize when you
send things out on the update and send
us some that mess with it so if you
don't type that command right there
that's in quote in both rip or yes your
IP for the CCNA you're gonna be out of
gas
ok make sure you type it right now we
have ribbon G that's where ipv6 routing
it still falls onto the category this
inspector still has 15 a maximum 15 hop
count limitation it still has the same
administrative distance the
configuration has changed
alright the configuration has changes it
actually is easier alright but but it's
still a distance vector routing protocol
no more ARP okay everything is multicast
alright but a are these multicast in
version - as far as the updates are
concerned as well they just if we're in
an Ethernet network guess what ARP still
exists because we're using ipv4 but if
we're using a full ipv6
network not to worry about that all
right fine let's go the next night let's
slide
alright so configuring the basic rip pay
router rip or version using I am using
version 2 and this is what you put you
put network 10000 network 170 to 1600
you put the class full boundaries
another class rule the default mass will
go here the default mastix here the
default mass is here that is the default
boundary I just used these three towers
as an example for two different classes
that we use a B or C and then the most
important one of all no Auto summary
this is how you get this thing to
actually work ok so let's do this let's
go to our lab I've already put in all
the IP addresses okay let me put in all
the IP addresses all we're gonna do is
lower the lab hours I'll explain it but
then we're gonna go ahead and we're
going to start configuring the basics
over it I'll see you inside the lab
alright here we are in the lab right so
we have this is obviously an ipv6
address here's we will do 4 first
all right well 4 is already configured
you can see our green lights going all
the way across and you see I did this on
purpose okay I did this on purpose okay
because rip is gonna say hey I'm gonna
go to maker that's the shortest path but
again we just want to get basic
configuration so we have three or four
18:41 routers we're using ten one one
for Saturday so we have four eight this
should be 12 not 16
oh I already have already configured in
such go well I should have done that 16
20 and this is 24 alright this should
have been 12 not 16 alright but whatever
oh now you know what it now you want oh
you know what yeah let's fix it let's
fix it now that's shouldn't be that way
alright so I was only 12 so I need to
change these two IP addresses so let's
go to this
there should be 13 and it should be 14
so let's do that before we get into rip
all right I need to have it done the
correct way because we're network
engineers we're CCNA s way to get things
done the right way so enable let's see
what I put before swipe you're out for
IP and brief sorry and you can see for
the s triple zero
I put 17 I shouldn't be it alright local
15 interface s 0 / 0 / 0 yeah you're not
gonna see me my right for you to see
this instead of my ugly mom okay and
just put the right IP address in there
so it's gonna be I P address you're not
to put the clock read again it's ready
their IP address 10.1.1.1 dot 13 and
255.255.255.0 is due hours or no shirt
just real heck of it and always double
check always verify you can't do it do
WR that's a control Z I just did you
can't do it WR on on a task I do pop
around start from plays mode
I'll do it she'll start just to take a
look at everything real quick which is
not much oh there's mine zero zero see
the clock rates ready their clock rates
are on all the sort of interfaces by
default anyway okay but just the way it
is
alright so we're good we're tension 10
110 oh yeah that's gonna be ok
that's ds1 all right so we're good that
one less close I wonder how let's bring
this one up this is should be the s11
should be 14 all right and that's one
thing you want to do I mean don't waste
time in your test but you want to verify
what's going on they make it do actual
running your test so you can take a look
at all the configurations alright and
see what IP addresses are on there maybe
it could be a mistake seam is 0 1 1
should not be 18 it should be as 12 14
so I'm gonna do our control see here on
the config T
why interface s 0 / 1 / 1 I'm sure
you're in the right interface when
you're doing things IP address the 2ds
is $10 100 1.14 255.255.255.0 - and is
there no shirt just for the sake of it
and control Z or IG likes it and you do
a show IP in brief which is verified and
we do have the correct IP address on
that one and the correct IP address here
this is the 22 and then this will be a
21 over here so we're good now we're
good now I'm happy we all got the right
right for 812 so this should be 16 I'm
not changing it all right and then now
let's go ahead and start putting the
writing protocol look we have different
networks don't we we have different
networks I'm gonna prove to you what I
told you that it actually summarizes by
default okay so that's why you don't
need to go get all crazy with this all
right oh and don't say it was the packet
tracer no it's it's the real routers as
well comte router rip ver or version 2
network connected to 3 hours and I
connect it to the 10.1.1.10 err I'm
connected to who else I'm connected to
the 10 now 1 net show for network tender
120 and I'm also connected to the
10.1.1.10 T 4 okay 10.1 no 1.24 but I
can't put a wall card mass I can't put
nothing that's a can't put nothing
outside so I'm gonna hit her and then
I'll do new Auto summary no I don't tab
that and you can use tapping the test
all right I'm gonna do the WR can't do
that in the test well let's take a look
at it
you saw that I put
the actual subnet that I mean I put the
actual subnet that I'm connected to
right okay let's see what rip shows us
shall start tada
okay that's why it's so important for
you to put this command no Auto summary
because it still will do this okay so
what do you do when you come over here
do you think I want to type all those
networks no I'm not gonna do that I'm
gonna make my life easy
that's the whole point smarter not
harder
okay and then you just go router rip ver
to net 10 no Auto summary done see that
you get above a notepad and you wanted
to in fact that and you're done right so
but let's just type it out let's not get
lazy all right all right so we're over
here in this router from fatigue router
rip over to net tangible 0 no Auto
submarine to WR step quick that is and
router 3 same deal comte router rip
version 2 network tangibles it looks
nothing in the keyboard triple 0
you want a summary do WR
run from this router right here goes
already configured router zero so I'm
gonna do a show IP route verify let's
open this up so you can see everything
nice and neat
alright so from router 3 I'm getting Ned
the networks for I mean the networks 8
and I'm getting the networks 24 I'm
directly connected to 20 and directly
connected to 12 so that's fine all right
here's the administrative distance right
here administrative distance 2 hops away
1 hop away three hops away ok to go till
24 ok via the 13 so and this is
something you need to look at he to
learn how to read it cuz it's a okhane
order for me to get to the 24 network I
need to go to the 13 address and then
I'll get to the 24 so where's the 13
address I gotta go I'm going this way in
order to get to this way ok or you can
do a trace route trace route so let's
say 10.1 1.20 was 25 I don't know where
I put I see which way it goes see they
went to the 13 then I went to the 9 and
then I went to the 5 now you don't know
its words going so we can we should be
able to ping that I pay there's no
control shift 6 that's all the first
thing I've done ping and I won the 1.20
is 24 right yeah it's to 24 9 so 26 is
that berating for the team
something's going on because it's not
reaching it ok control C or control
shift C ctrl shift 6 ok ok finish let's
see if I can ping go away
Tendo 101 that 25 I can paint 25 so lose
25 so the traceroute there see about
troubleshooting traceroute 10.1 oh 1.25
and in your test it goes to 13 the ninth
so in order to get to sleep as he was 25
this is 25 show IP and brief and this is
the 25 right here you're gonna see the
Fast Ethernet 10.1 oh 1.25 that's the
address all right by putting it to 26
which is over here why is that okay so
let's take a look at sharpie and brief
type int 3 on the f0 and I have not even
configured it you see that a tracer I
showed you something's going on you can
ping that side but on this side why
comes right on that router
I didn't even configure that IP address
so let's go ahead and do that already in
there about config T interface F 0 5 0
IP address 10.1 to 1.25 to 5 5 no 26
sorry to 502 a 5 that's a 5.2 go to
enter and Ali's dunno shot again just
for the sake of it what do I have to do
it using military down all right so
that's done so let's even now I can ping
from this router the 26 it says
unreachable unreachable dirigible okay
that's right again
amazing all right just take a look at
all right a well I love this this is how
you learn ladies and gentlemen you got
to create topologies you got to say okay
what's going on what can happen you
refer it to having an assimilation a lab
environment in a real world so we have
the IP address 10 that 101 that
26 we have the correct mask so that's
that seems okay
okay alright so our serials are 13
whatever and then we have 10 all right
we have rip version 2 not a submarine so
that looks good
all right let's look at our writing
table here show IP route and you see
it's getting the 20 which is on this
side but it's getting it from the forth
and it's getting it from the 14 dress
from this guy all right so 8 and 12 it's
connected to directly
here's where's 8/8 right here and here's
24 and it's time to drug me to 12 but
for whatever reason it doesn't want to
see this way so this should show me that
is directly connected to that one so I
should I should have a connected route
here on the 24 so I do not see what I
was doing that show IP in brief okay it
says hey up down so we have a layer 2
issue there - ok so I tell you what
let's do this let's get rid of that and
I don't want to cheat I'm not gonna
cheat because this Roger router should
be cross over when I use f00 and have 0
0 I think that was the problem says
you're a wine as usual yeah see now ok
that autumn is a good time to change
take 2 up sloppy and breathe see let's
do 4 up your office yeah see that change
okay see now God directly connected
route to the 24 you see so well most
likely I wasn't looking at because I'm
going blind is that this was really as
your one as
all right so now let's take a look at
this chart let's maximize the screen and
do a show IP route and now we have the
24 network is going via the 13 still ok
so we should be able to payments go
paying 226 now we can pain to it you see
just a little bit of troubleshooting
using two simple commands right we're
doing a trace route we're doing a pain
we're looking at the routing table show
IP route okay and we saw that hey I was
configuring more likely on the wrong
interface okay so I used to the cable
out for a new cable but pay attention to
these things because these things can
happen imagine these are nothing this is
nothing going on not real world as far
as you know nobody's getting hurt by
this router not advertising anything
when in real world it could hurt
specimens telecommunication industry so
let's do that trace rather we wanted to
do trace route to the 10 by 101 not 26
and it's quick because he just goes up
to 13 and boom on there but if it wants
to go to a 25 now look it's a little bit
different
13:25 it used to be three hops not only
two so that works that one I should say
that works what it takes to always to
really well count this is two so it's a
lot better it's a lot better so that is
your basic configuration of RIP and more
or less I don't look to see what's going
on using trace route commands pinging
commands and show IP in brief commands
okay that's how you get rip working but
you can see that rip again it's gonna
choose the shortest path first okay he's
disinfected writing protocols will look
to see instead that's it distance and
direction
that's what victim is direction so in a
real world scenario where everybody's
connect it to a cloud all right you're
not provider I should say if it's a
direct connection it's just gonna look
hey this is closer to me I don't care
this is 56k and these are all c1 lines
out here I don't
there or lc3 whatever I wind this way
that's a probably rip and the bigger and
more complexity you add to their network
is going to create issues it's gonna
create shoes
all right all right so let's go back to
the presentation to look at a couple
more days now you got that configuration
of rip you seen what the lab looks like
we'll be back in a bit we just need to
look at some other stuff all right I'll
see you outside
all right so here we are again and
presentation and now we're gonna talk
about holding down rip propagation and I
show you a little snippet there or where
you would do it you do it under a router
configuration okay what this does and
this sounds like a question to me I mean
I will put this in my exam because it's
interesting and you see I've highlighted
both to these okay so what this actually
does it prevents rip from sending out
updates of that interface for sending
out updates on that interface so if
you're going connector to say to a
particular win right I put a but you
have multiple Wang connections or even
align all right and you don't want to
rip to send out its updates
maybe receive but I send you can go
ahead and use the passive interface and
then you put whatever interface you want
to use if it's an Internet
I hope it's not a fast ethernet a
gigabit if using new box or you can use
default but if you use default what
happens read it right there it
suppresses routing updates on all
interfaces so one of the things later on
ccmp CCIE they will give you something
that you will have to suppress all
interfaces from propagating out except
for this one all right so you will use
that one and then you will turn on you
know do no positive interface on the
other ones all right so this looks like
a question so be careful because you can
get a question also like why isn't this
router receiving updates from this rod
look for that passive interface to man I
mean do ashole run
make sure that the passive interface
command if it's there that it's not
pointing into your land it could be
pointing to the LAN that's fine but not
into your own land okay so make sure
it's not pointing internally but it's
pointing externally because that's
exactly what that command does it stops
from sending updates so let's go ahead
and type that particular command and
let's make it stop sending updates to a
certain router cool let's go back inside
the lab I'll see you there oh and we're
gonna do that passive interface command
very simple to do so we'll go ahead
we'll choose this router well I don't
have problems before no I did a problem
that was a problem well choose this
router and we're gonna say hey don't
send any updates out the Fast Ethernet 0
0 interface that's what we were going to
do so let's open this up right here I'm
going to enable some fake t router rip
version 2 and then you question market
you can see all the things that you can
do we're gonna do passive interface and
then I tell you what what interface do
you want to use okay well I want to use
the F 0 slash or interface I'm sorry oh
we're gonna do no no F 0/0 interface I
believe I can do it yeah just like that
alright so that's gonna make changes on
the routing table control see WR or
control Z will be the same thing let's
take a look at this routing table remain
any changes here all right so let's open
this up here we can see show IP route we
see okay we're so we are again but you
see right here we're getting this update
from rip from the 20 which is down here
okay and it's going through the 14 which
is right here coming this way and we're
getting it through the
25 what was going through here so we're
still getting it the proper way
now is this actually sending out any
updates out this interface well let's
take a look at the one that's directly
connected to it they'll be the best one
enable show IP route and we're directly
connected to it there's really nothing
being updated but everything else is
coming out through a 12 or an 8 is not
coming out the 25 this is directly
connected to it let's see right here hey
we're getting anything from the 25 for
the 24 to take amble show IP a dream
nothing should be coming out of that f00
Stroh IP and brief no show up you're out
all right we're getting 24 but is via
the 13 via the 13 which is this one
right here isn't right here you were to
do and again this is part of your
verification commands that I talked
about in the slide at the beginning it
will be debug IP e rip so it takes a
while but you can see right here VoIP
rip we received version 2 updates from
the 10019 and it takes a lot of minuses
every 30 seconds received receive virgin
- as you see right here from the 20 it's
from the 20 I don't see anything coming
hours telling me exactly from what
interface you see here received a virgin
today from the 10 125 on 0 0 okay but
via these two routes you know these two
routes so you can do a debug IP rip on
it and you'll see how it'll tell you
because it will be building updates as
it goes sometimes you'll be able to say
I'm still sending out that interface but
remember it takes 30 seconds for all
these things to take effect because of
that's how the updates do work that's
how the updates do work all right so I'm
receiving updates where I'm not saying
any updates okay so
on debugger no debug IP right no you all
I think that works as well but we'll do
that that turned that off so we're doing
it here so we're receiving updates on
this one well we're not sending any
updates on on this one so that's what
that one does we're holding back the
updates from going out this particular
interface you can receive but you're not
going to send okay I'll just interface
that's what that particular command does
all right so let's go back to our
PowerPoint again and we have one more
command that will need to take a look at
all right well let's explain it first
I'll see you there all right then we're
back
well last commands what we're gonna do
is advertising a default route using rip
okay now if you everything like the
thing the reason that they asked to know
this plan is because it could be they
have multiple interfaces that could be
going out to the internet you'll be
leaving your autonomous system you may
want to find a way I mean like it says
here you may be connected to a metro e
alright and we can direct packets to
that Metairie or to many the other one
interface that's going out there so we
can do this using a default information
originated command under router
configuration and tell our routers which
way or it's our routes if you want to
get to this destination this is the way
you will need to go okay using the
default information originated okay
also you can go ahead and create a
gateway of last resort because you don't
want packets that are getting to your
router they're getting to your router to
actually drop packets so you want to go
ahead and configure a gateway of last
resort and that's something you do on
your stuff on your stub routers all
right you all really pretty much doing
any router but it's really only your
stub writers writers facing out towards
the internet you know
want to send a packet and to a certain
destination and when that router
receives it says listen I don't have in
my routing table entry I don't have an
entry for that particular Network so I
am NOT going to send me I'm just gonna
drop it if you have the IP route all
zeros they said hey listen just match
the IP match the mass send it out the
faceting 3000 and you set it to their
next job the next your honor
okay so let's go ahead and do these two
last two commands and then we should be
good to go all right let's go back
inside the lab all right and here we are
so as you can throw them pick this guy
right here I'll just pick this guy right
here and we'll just do the two commands
real quick just so you can see how it's
done so you know what they're for now
you know we'll show you how to actually
do it BT router rip version 2 because if
you don't do version 2 it's gonna think
it's version 1 okay and you see default
formation controls distribution of
default information to default and what
is a whine originated originated is
there anything else I need to do oh my
god question mark no just hit enter good
we're done with that alright so now it's
gonna have a default information
originated and we want to go ahead and
do a gateway of last resort what did I
get out I peer out even though let's not
consider it so broader comes ask to wait
but operand I figure out in here up
you're out zero zero zero zero zero zero
zero and the Gateway will be the triple
0 s 0 / 0 / 0 hit enter do W are no I'll
be my game of last resort okay and then
I'm gonna do short IP route and there
you go you have your gateway of last
resort that is set and you're seeing it
here okay and if you look at your rip
okay oops I think I passed it you have
your default information originated did
that change anything on the other
routers show IP route
you see that you're getting a default
because that's what the Astra's means
that is a candidate default you're
getting a default all right from rip
okay all zeros all right via the ten one
one nine interface so that's as easy as
again so I'm just gonna switch back okay
and again we talked one through this and
we talked about many things all right we
talked about the administrative distance
we talked about the classes we talked
about things the features the different
types of rip that we have that you could
do ipv6 we haven't done it I'm gonna
save that for a later video so I don't
give you too much information and crowd
your brain I didn't forget I'm just
gonna leave it for another video there's
already enough information all right but
we did do the short people we did this
Rypien brief we did the debug we did the
ping we actually did a trace route we
took a look at what was going on we were
able to troubleshoot ride the very
beginning we had issues because I forgot
to put an IP address on there and but
that's normal you're going to make a
mistake here there it's not you're
trying not to make as many mistakes but
you're trying to understand okay why is
this happening and using those
troubleshooting commands those simple
ones right there's looking at a routing
table I'm I'm getting an update from
this network looking at the short period
is it up up up down doing a debug
pinging doing a trace Rob all going to
that actual router through another
interface and see what's going on
looking at those interfaces
troubleshooting troubleshooting
troubleshooting and that's what
everybody out there is looking for this
is not as old he is I'll see you guys on
the other side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
