mark price here dev slopes calm and
today is the day where you get to build
your very first Android app sounds
pretty cool no experience needed let's
go ahead and open up Android you should
already have installed I'll find mine by
just command space and Android here on
the Mac there we go
Android studio okay and so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna create a project
that does percentages you know what is
15 percent of this number not super
complex but we'll write some code we'll
make some UI so go ahead and click start
a new Android studio project and you can
call yours whatever you wanted I'm gonna
say math sucks that's gonna be the name
of my app math sucks okay and company
domain is the name of the company that
you'll be putting in there which is your
own or whatever name you want to put in
there no big deal
project location is obviously the
project location currently mine is just
stored in Android studio projects you
can put that wherever you want click
Next now this is important okay API
level how many users you want to support
if you notice here by targeting API 16
and later your app will run on a POC
approximately ninety two point eight
percent of the devices
alright the higher up I go the lower
goes less than one percent on the
androids newest version right so what it
means is if you this is the minimum SDK
so basically they have to have this they
have to have this version on their phone
in order to run this app so we cover
about 92% on jellybean Ice Cream
Sandwich goes up a little higher but 4.1
introduced a lot of cool features with
jellybean so let's just go ahead and do
that we're going to skip these other
ones here and click Next and there's
lots of different templates here we are
gonna do blank activity okay
and the reason why I'm choosing blank
activity instead of empty activity is
because it has this cool action
button with some event listeners and I
like to use existing code to reference
code snippets sometimes when I forget
like how to set listeners and things
like that because I was I tend to forget
syntax occasionally so I'm just gonna
set blank activity click Next
there we go and your activity name this
is the main activity for your
application kind of the starting point
here you can name this accordingly ours
is just going to be called main activity
because we're only gonna have one and
we're not going to click use a fragment
at this time and click finish
ok our project is open we've got the tip
of the day which I don't care about at
this time I'm gonna click close and it's
going to load up the content underscore
main which is the XML layout for our
project meaning this is going to be the
user interface for our project there it
goes okay so here's our project let's do
a little bit of setup first what I want
you to do is hover over these icons here
okay this one SDK manager okay and you
should have the SDKs installed as part
of the installation process if you don't
have these installed you're gonna want
to install the different SDK versions
that are available okay you can click
those buttons there so just make sure
you've got you know I've got mine down
to API level 17 and that's okay and then
you want to go over this AVD manager
here okay and these are your virtual
emulators your virtual devices and I
have one because I've created one but if
you don't have one make sure you click
create a virtual device and I would
suggest just pics it picking the nexus 5
for now it's a good generic phone click
Next and you're gonna want to set let's
see there it is so we're gonna want to
make sure we've got all the other
details on it available so click Next
and this is where you can set its like
Advanced Settings here you can set how
much RAM it has and things like that I'm
like I'm gonna hide these Advanced
Settings here and what I would do is I
would say use host GPU which just use
the GPU of the actual computer that
you're running on this never actually
used to be available to Android it used
to actually take forever to load the
emulator
and it would run actual device specs but
I'd rather it run off my computer specs
because I wanted to run fast because I'm
doing lots of testing and iteration so
that all looks good and you can go ahead
and click finish I'm not going to do
that since I already have a device and
once your device is on here it means
you're good to go and ready to start
developing apps so let's take a look
here we are in content underscore main
okay over here on the left hand side you
should see some files if you don't if
it's collapsed you can click this icon
here that says project and you can
expand it to see these files here okay
and you'll notice you have AR es that's
for short for resources and these are
resource files and a resource file
represents your application the user
interface of a screen or an item in this
case our main activity has its own user
interface file and what it does is if
you look over here on the right hand
side it includes this right here this
include right here it includes an entire
layout file so this main file this
activity main layout file and includes a
whole entire layout file which is going
on top of it so we actually can't click
HelloWorld on here because it's not it's
not actually on this layout this action
button is and so does a toolbar as you
can see our here toolbar and this action
view right here this custom view but
click double click content underscore
main dot XML and now we can access our
hello world and we can start adding user
interface so this is the screen we're
going to be working with this is the
layout editor for Android you can also
do this via XML but in this video we're
just gonna do it here with drag-and-drop
user interface which is really cool one
more thing to point out if you click
your Java folder here okay you've got
one for test unit test we're not doing
any of those today and so we want this
one here comdev slopes dot math sucks
and double-click main activity I'm going
to expand this here your Android will
not probably look like this because I
spent a couple hours customizing the
styles and fonts and how this looks to
be honest I kind of made it look like
Xcode because I love Xcode and I like
white themes but what I do want to show
you here is go to Android studio
princes and you go to appearance and you
can change the theme from default to
dark EULA if you want it dark which I'm
sure most of you will choose because I'm
the only person I know that codes with a
white background so anyway if you want
this it is available I just message me
on the chat rooms or find me somewhere
else and I will send this these at this
setting themes to you so enough talking
let's go ahead and talk well let's go
ahead and just talk about what we're
gonna be designing so there's a website
that I refer to frequently when I'm too
stupid to remember how to do percentages
sometimes I just forget so what I like
to do is go to Google and say you know
what is X percent of Y and then there's
this awesome website here called
calculator soup and they have different
types of calculations you can do with
percentages so what is X what is this
percent of this number or what is the
percent of this number so if I said what
is 10% of 100 and I click calculate y
equals 10 okay so it's just a calculator
that's all it is
and for percentages and we're gonna do
the same thing but on an android app and
we're gonna keep it in its simplest form
so very cool stuff let's go ahead and
get started so first off we know that
we're gonna need to get just like in
that website here we know we know we're
gonna have to have a field here and a
second field for the number so one field
for the percentage a second field for
the number and a calculate button okay
and also we're gonna have some nice
labels here you know that do the same
thing what is this percent of this
number and then we need a place to
display the result okay so we're gonna
need all those things so that's what
we're gonna build first here in our
layout editor so go over to your content
main.xml and double click it and we're
gonna have some fun so this hello world
you can actually just click and drag it
and we're gonna move it right there in
the middle okay and it's a little bit
small and what I want this to be is the
actual result filled the total filled
okay so let's scroll down here on the
bottom right hand side these are the
properties that are available and I
highly suggest you look at the different
things you can do and play around with
them okay don't expect someone like me
to go and tell you every little thing
you need to go around and play around
with these things here
and what we want to do is just make it
bigger so I'm up here at the top instead
of wrapping the content for the width I
want to change this by clicking the
arrows here to feel parent okay so now
it is filling the parent of course it's
not centered which I don't like so I'm
gonna scroll down until I see something
called alignment text alignment right
here and I can click this drop-down
arrow and select Center okay one thing I
also don't like is it's a little bit
small so let's see if we can find a text
size field which there is one right here
and we're just gonna enter a number and
I'm gonna say 50 and that looks that
looks okay and by the way that's 50 DP
okay density pixels it's not necessarily
pixel per pixel it's it'll be relative
to the size of the screen so that's good
50 that's what we want in Texas hello
world well by default we just want it to
be zero kind of like it's a calculator
so we'll just leave that there and this
is starting to look really nice although
one thing we do need to do is give it an
ID because we need a reference this in
the code so when you actually click the
calculate button it knows which field to
grab and put the value in okay so I'm
gonna give it ID and I'm gonna call this
total we'll call this the total text
view this is a text view okay this is a
text view if you're familiar with iOS
this would be the same thing as UI label
all right so there's a text view okay so
we got the total view there now what do
we need we need some type of other view
actually that text view that will tell
us you know what is well basically let's
look at our design scheme right here we
need something that that says this what
is what is so let's do that now so I'm
gonna go over here on the left hand side
this is the palette that has different
widgets and things and such in it okay
if yours is not there you can access it
by clicking the palette button and we
are going to look for a textview
in fact we can just click large text and
i'm gonna put it right here in the
center and looks good to me
go ahead and double-click it and for the
text inside of it I just want it to say
what is okay no big deal now we need a
field right to actually enter the
percentage like something that's
editable so we're gonna do that with a
and edit text so let's see if we can
find that here our edit text here we go
just plain text is fine actually we
could do a number this will this will
keep it formatted for decimals which is
what we want so let's drag that number
decimal here okay I'm going to drag it
over till it's centered and that's
looking pretty good don't you think that
we should have a placeholder in there
that basically says enter a percentage
or enter percentage I think so and so on
Android this placeholder is not called
placeholder it is called hint it's
giving you a hint and will say enter
percentage press Enter
now I don't like that it's aligned to
the left so I'm gonna go over to the
bottom scroll down to the bottom here
and click text alignment and we are
gonna select Center okay that is looking
good to me and while we're at it let's
just go ahead and copy this command C or
control C if you're on Windows and
command V and it's gonna have this
little orange box that pops up and I'm
just gonna drag it right here and click
that's pretty cool let's you place it
and I'll drag it over to Center it the
same as the other one except here we're
gonna make it say enter number so go to
find the hint field hint
I lost the hint let's click this field
here enter here we go enter number
instead of enter percentage okay so what
is and what it'll show this percent we
probably need a percentage sign so let's
do that now let's command C and command
V this textview and let's put it right
there
I'm gonna double click it and just put
the percent sign and press Enter it's a
little too far to the right so I'm gonna
move it over here right next to this
text field
that's looking good so basically we're
saying what is 15% okay and we would say
of so we don't have the of field here so
let's put that now click do what is
command C command V and let's put it
right here okay double click it of and I
don't think action needs a capital let's
make it lowercase here so what is 15% of
and then this is a little too close
let's see if we can move it down we
might not be able to we might have to
set some padding here but click click
and drag down your number and yeah it's
having some issues spacing here and so
it's not doing what I wanted to do so
what I can do is I can actually set some
margin on top of it so it's a little bit
further away from the up symbol here so
on the properties at the bottom right
scroll up to layout margin and expand it
and from the top let's say we want a 10
from the top and it pushed that up there
right in the middle what looks like it's
in the middle
let's click it's a little bit
off-centered here maybe actually we
didn't need to change it at all maybe it
was the layout guides that were messing
with us here so let's set it back to
zero and see what it looks when I click
off you know what that's not too bad I
can live with that yeah you can always
modify it later and play around some
things so what is 15% of enter number
that number very cool what else are we
missing well we need some type of
calculate button to actually perform the
calculation so let's do that now on the
left hand side you can just grab a
button and drag it over in the middle
somewhere a little off-center so I'm
just gonna Center it there new button
I'm gonna double click it and we're
gonna call this one calculate all in
capital letters and that's looking good
okay that's looking nice now there's a
couple things I don't like I don't like
the color of the button I don't like
this ugly blue oh my goodness and then
this action button we're not actually
gonna need it there so let's first off
change the color of the calculate button
we can do that by going to background
and if we click that little three dots
in the bottom
right inside we get a nice little color
picker here and we could just pick a
color that we feel is good for our
application that looks nice it's a nice
red but the black doesn't look too great
on it so let's go ahead and change the
color of the text down here you can
click in the field and I'm sure you
could do the same exact thing here pick
a color you know or we could do
something different we could do pound
sign F F F F F F which is the
hexadecimal value for white and make it
white which i think is really nice now
what we could also do is make this
button a little bit bigger so it just
looks nicer so let's try dragging things
around so notice how it's not liking
what we're doing right but when you add
both edges over there
it lets you expand it so one rule of
thumb when working with the Android
designer is if it doesn't work on the
first try okay try moving it around and
messing with it in a different manner
now maybe you're saying that's not very
scientific
well you may find yourself getting
frustrated because it's not working the
way you want but you don't yet
understand how things are working under
the hood it doesn't just put things
pixel per pixel where you want them it
aligns things up based on the way
Android XML layouts are set up and so it
only works in certain types of ways so
again play around with it and tell you
understand perfectly how it works behind
the hood and so now it's looking a
little bit how I want it to look very
nice and what I'm gonna do is actually
copy this color here in the background
on the properties I'm going to ctrl C it
or command C because I want to use it up
here on this toolbar now if you notice I
can't click the toolbar and change it
well that's because it's not in this
layout remember it's in the main
activity so it's just nicely showing us
the preview T behind it which is really
cool so there it is you can click on it
and then what we can do is go down to
background right here and I can just
take all this off oops I forgot the
pound sign there we go so now we've got
a nice red banner here and this nice red
calculate button at least I think it
looks nice I'm also going to click this
action button this F
baby okay and I'm gonna get rid of it by
pressing the delete button so that is
now gone
and things are starting to look nice
okay percentage of this number here now
here's the question how do we get code
talking to the views that is the real
question of the day isn't it so go to
your main activity dot Java oh look at
this pretty theme you guys are like this
is so ugly I think it's so cool I feel
like I'm making an iPhone app you know
what actually find is I have to have the
perfect environment whether it's my
house with the lighting cleanliness of
room my IDE everything has to be perfect
so I can be in a good mood and theme
when programming like I'm not one of
those people who can just jump on any
computer and start coding like I have to
feel happy when I'm coding and this
makes me feel happy anyway you're like
this guy's lame okay so a few things to
point out we're not going in-depth onto
everything because this is just an intro
video it's already going longer than
other people who might make an intro
video so protected void on crate this on
create function okay as part of the
activity and it will be called
automatically when it is time to create
the views and what happens is your code
more or less will take your XML layouts
and it will inflate them into actual
visual things that you can see on this
screen run some code behind the scenes
to inflate those layouts and make them
into actual views and so what we do here
isn't this uncreate function is we will
grab the views from the XML layouts and
we will assign them to the code okay if
you are familiar with iOS development
this is similar to creating IB outlets
where you can control drag from a
control to the code okay although we
don't get the luxury of that here with
Android we've got to manually connect
these things up so that's what we're
gonna do now so we're going to make our
code talk to our views and so we know
that we have to manipulate a few things
or get data from few things one is we
need have the total view which is a text
view we've got to edit text fields for
entering data in and then we've got a
calculate button which is just going to
calculate the operation so let's go
ahead and enter the things that we need
now so
textview in Java you always put the type
before the and also notice here houses
Android widget that's what you want
sometimes there are other things that
can have similar class names as Android
but you always want to use the Android
versions okay so anyway so yeah the
variable name in Java or the variable
type goes before the variable name
that's what I meant to say type before
name and we're gonna call this first
textview the this is the label so the
total will call this total textview and
i like to spell out what type of view it
is just so in the code i know i'm
grabbing the right one okay and what
we're doing here is we're creating
public instance variables here that we
can later assign values to okay so
textview total textview and then we also
have to edit text fields right so edit
text and the first one was percentage
text I can just call it txt for short
edit text and one more this one's going
to be the number text where we put the
number in okay that looks good to me
and if we ever needed to mess with the
button as far as like storing it or
changing its name or whatever we could
we could do that here but since we're
only intercepting or setting a listener
for the click event we don't need to
store these references here and so the
reason why I kept this floating action
button or I chose that template is so we
could look at the default implementation
of how to set a listener so we can just
follow suit here which one of the ways
that I always learned to code when I'm
personally coding and learning new
concepts is by looking at other people's
code okay so down here what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna create a button
this is an official Android button as
you can see Android dot widget and also
every time you create an Android class
or implement a class it will
automatically import the needed item at
the top okay
unlike iOS if you're familiar with iOS
development you have a UI kit that
includes all of these controls and you
only make one import with Java you
import the specific classes you need for
your project explicitly so we're gonna
say button we're gonna say calc button
okay equals and what we're doing here is
we're casting we're gonna cast what the
cast the view that we're finding so
we're casting the find view by ID and
we're gonna say r dot ID okay these are
official IDs that you've registered in
your project and you'll notice something
here I'm looking for my percentage field
but it's not there okay so if you're
confused let's make this less confusing
when I go back into my content main.xml
and I click my enter percentage and if I
scroll down here this ID just says edit
text it's generic and it's not very
useful so instead what I need to call
this is probably per centage txt okay
update usages as well this will update
all xml references and java are filled
references okay so what you change here
in the ID is going to automatically
change in androids our file which stores
all of your IDs and this is what we want
and I'm gonna click this button so it
doesn't show me this message again
because obviously I know what's gonna do
that so I'm gonna click yes then on this
second one here okay I'm gonna scroll
down to where ideas and this is the
number so I'm gonna call this number
txt which is what I want and did I give
an ID to my calculate button no that
just says button two so let's go ahead
and call this calc BTN and then I
believe we did set an ID on this guy
here which we did a total textview so
now we've got the appropriate IDs set so
when I go back to my code my main
activity dot Java okay and when I go
into this find view by ID now I could
say R that's capital R by the way also
keep in mind there's Android different
versions here Android support support
support we don't want that we want the
arf-arf for our project which is in this
case comdev slopes taught math sucks so
we're gonna say r dot ID and this is the
button right so if I type in the letter
C there's my idea which it wasn't there
before so
that idea is now available and the
minute I do this it is now tying this
button in my code it's now created a
reference to this button that's in my
XML layout so if you're familiar with
iOS development this is the equivalent
of connecting your iboutlet by dragging
it over to your code where they connect
this is what we've just done right now
and of course it's grabbing a generic
view from the layout file so we have to
explicitly cast it into a button saying
hey this view is a button it's not a
edit text field it's not this it's not
that it's a button so we're casting it
here so we can appropriately
appropriately use it okay you with me so
far
okay so now that we've got our button
referenced in code we need to set a
listener on it okay a click listener and
if you are familiar with iOS development
and I'll be saying this a lot so please
don't get angry me if you're not
familiar with iOS development this is
for the sake of all those iOS developers
learning to code and Android but anyway
this is equivalent to creating an IB
action for a control on iOS so let's go
ahead and do that now calc button dot
set on click listener and you can
actually just scroll down to whatever
one you want and press enter ours is set
on click listener and I'm just actually
looking at the example code above
because it makes it nice and easy and we
get to say view dot on click listener
okay this cool anonymous function here
which will create an inline function
here for us that will be called and so
we're setting an onclicklistener
and what we need to do is override the
on click function okay we're on click
method okay and Java these are called
methods not functions although they are
equivalent we're gonna say on click so
we're overriding the on click function
and we're overriding it on the on click
listener function of our button okay and
so they'll take you a few times to get
this right okay so basically we've set
the onclick listener we've set this
anonymous class function here which will
be it's almost like an inline function
or what you might call a block in
objective-c or a closure in Swift and
basically
it's going we're gonna override this
views this class that we're creating
okay this view class that we're creating
we're gonna override its on-click
function for this button so we can
perform an action and this is where
we're gonna write our code to manipulate
the views however if you've noticed we
have not referenced these views yet okay
we've done it for the button but we
haven't done it for these so let's do
that now so we're gonna say total
textview equals and this is a textview
so we need to cast it to a textview and
we'll do the exact same thing find view
by ID our ID in this case it's the total
right so total textview grab that ID
that we created in our XML file to
reference the correct view and then
percentage text equals this is an edit
text field find view by ID r dot ID dot
percentage text and one more is number
text equals this is edit text fine view
by ID r dot ID dot number text so those
are now referenced okay so what we need
to do is now run the math and then take
the values that are in the text fields
and then set the total based on the
information that's in the text fields so
no big deal that's not a big deal so
first off let's go ahead and grab our
percentage that the user has entered in
we'll do that right here I'll make this
even bigger so you can see it here and
by the way I'm doing command + and
compliant command - to make the font
grow big and small which is not enabled
by default in in the Android studio
settings which is also available in my
my settings file which I'll make
available to you so what we want to do
here is first grab the percentage right
so let's just call it a float because it
could be a decimal value so we're gonna
say float or float and we're gonna call
this percentage equals and how do we get
text from it well we can just do total
not total percentage
percentage texts dot get texts so this
is how you get text out of it right by
doing and get text now by default it's
not actually giving you something that
you can work with as a string or an
integer so we actually have to cast it
here so we can say to string so we're
gonna grab the text value out of the
field and make sure it's converted
properly to a string and what I'm
actually gonna do so now that we've got
the string we'll actually need to turn
it into a value we can work with in
mathematics which is a float so I'm
gonna command X to cut this and what I'm
gonna do is call float dot parse float
and we're gonna pass it in the string
there are you with me so far so we're
grabbing the text out of the text field
converting it to a string and then
taking that string and converting it
into a float which we're storing here in
the percentage okay now in order to
properly do the math simple percentage
math we need to convert this percentage
into a decimal do you remember how to do
that so we'll just say float Dec for
decimal and we're gonna say equals
percentage divided by 100 that's how we
convert the percentage into a decimal
now the last thing we need is the end
result right so we can say float result
or total since we're saying the word
total everywhere total is going to be
equal to decimal multiplied by the
amount that is in the number field okay
this is this right here is just basic
percentage mathematics if you're not
familiar with it you can just look it up
online and no big deal
so decimal times well how do we get the
value out so it was number text that's
the name of the field dot get text got
to string okay so we know that's what we
need but I'm gonna go ahead and just
command X this and parse this and do a
float as well parsefloat and pass that
right in there so now we've got the
total okay all we have left to do now is
assign that total into the total of view
so easy as total text view dot set text
and we're just gonna pass in total or
float let's convert it to a string float
dot to string and we're gonna pass in
total okay so we're calling the official
two string function or method of float
and we're passing in the float value
that we want to convert into a string
and we are setting that into our total
textview text okay so if all worked well
in our code it should be working in our
program so go ahead just click the
little play button here and it should
let you pick which emulator that you
want to work with you may have one
running I do not currently but you
should have it right here
next is five I'm gonna click okay and
you'll see your emulator up here here
this little nice little Android looking
guy here it'll take a moment to load by
the way I recommend that you do not
close your emulator once you've loaded
it for the first time because it could
take a while to load and if you think
it's broken broken don't worry I it you
will usually it will usually come
however if it doesn't come you can
always look in your project for errors
and I think we do have an error that we
need to fix if you notice everything has
these red squigglies you think that
yelling at us one time would be enough
but no and if you look down here in the
console cannot find symbol variable fat
well there's a problem because what we
did was we deleted the view from our XML
layout but we didn't delete it here from
our code so let's go ahead and do that
now highlight anything that has to do
with the fab at the floating action
button and just delete it and save it
and then go ahead and try running it
again this time select the runner the
one that's already running
there goes no errors no warnings you can
see the icon at the top right it means
it's successfully loaded and it will
load automatically for us here now we do
have some problems with our layout as
you can see it didn't do exactly what we
thought it was gonna do when we actually
dragged the controls into the
application and so let's go ahead and
fix this problem here you can see how
the of is stuck in between the number
and the percentage so let's fix that now
if we go back to our code and go into
content main we're getting a few
rendering problems here which is
problematic we don't need to worry about
some of these right now what you can do
is actually just click clear cache on
this and it should show us what we need
okay so we are here you know here's our
file it looks good here but obviously it
doesn't look great when we're inside of
when it's actually run on a device let's
let's talk about how we can fix this so
let's do some debugging your first look
and debugging a problem so click the of
and let's look over here on the
right-hand side and look at this layout
alignment components here so we've got
some alignment things going on and it's
relative to the other views here if you
notice what it's saying is hey I want
the bottom of this of label this of view
I want the bottom of it to be at the top
of number text so the bottom right here
is matching as you can see the top of
this which is fine but what's happening
is it almost looks like this number
percentage here it almost looks like
it's going down on top of it which is
not what we want so what we can do is
try something we can grab it let's say
if we align the top of to the bottom of
this percentage right here so what we
can say is the top so the top of the of
view let's align it to the percentage
text like so okay so but it's in this
case it's excuse me that's incorrect we
want we want the top bottom not the top
top we want the top of the of the bottom
of the second view so the first the
first off side on here the left side is
the first component and the other side
is the second oponents what we're saying
here is grab the top of the of view and
align it to the bottom of what review
we're gonna select in this case we're
gonna say percentage text okay see how
it looks okay and it's a little bit too
close I think so what I'd like to do is
select up again and this time on the
layout margin in the top
let's set five just give it a little bit
of padding it's not enough let's make it
ten I see how it looks looks good to me
now let's see if it actually looks good
in the app so I'm gonna go ahead and run
it just click okay there it goes and we
lost our of label actually it kind of
looks nice without it but I want to fix
it so let's I'm not gonna play random oh
I'll show you I'll show you a solution
that actually works here but those are
some very important information you need
to know that you can actually align
components what's happening here is
there's not enough spacing in the
components between the top and the
bottom ones so there's it's smashing the
of out of there so let's fix this here
let's take our of label here and let's
go to the layout settings here just
delete the the layouts of this label
here what I'm gonna do is drag this
calculate button further down okay drag
it over and I'm gonna drag this entry
number field down here and I'm gonna
drag this off and set it right there
right in the middle command save and
let's run it again when you're working
with the visual layout editor you have
to play around with things because it's
doing very specific operations behind
the scenes and I don't typically always
build all my layouts with the little
editor here and so this is good enough
for now I'm not gonna mess with them
anymore the of its it's close to where
we want it to be but you're gonna learn
later on how to take your views and
actually modify them in the XML layouts
to make them exactly perfect because the
visual layout editor has some caveats so
let's just see if I if our entire app
works here okay so what's the percentage
we know of so let's say 10% okay what is
10% of 100 if I click calculate it says
10 I think that's correct let's take a
look at our calculator over here let's
try it a different one that look that is
correct by the way let's say what is 15%
of 25
I know their calculator works so let's
click it so 15 percent of 2500 is 375
let's do the same math over here I'm
going to say what is 15% of 2500 and
click calculate and it is 375 might add
0 so there's some more formatting we
could do but that's it you've just built
your very first Android application your
view is talking to your code we purely
use the layout editor which we could
play around with it wouldn't be hard to
get this up thing where it needs to be
tagged do it on your own play around
with this some more in fact I recommend
that you actually do some of these other
calculations in here as well to be able
to build out this calculator here but
that's it Android very first Android app
for you there
mark Pricer dev slopes calm exciting
times - see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
