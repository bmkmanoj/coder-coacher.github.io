deal and you can see here in the course
outline for this course my new course
which will hopefully hopefully it's
already on udemy by the time you're
watching this video but you can see we
learned that funk Mane's the entry point
to your program and that we saw that
thing about very attic parameters and
just gives like some additional notes
here and I really try to give a thorough
create a thorough course outline so you
not only hear me read this stuff but you
also have a good description of
everything I'm talking about and and
then I highlight the important points in
red so it's very consumable and you know
that's hello world and the next thing
we're going to learn is we're gonna
learn how to do a variable and so I
talked about keywords operators operand
statements and expressions here but
first thing we're gonna do is we're just
going to go to the go playground we're
gonna create a variable so I could call
this first I just call it F in for first
name and and naming your variables it's
good to name them short if you're gonna
use them very close but like the bigger
your program the farther away the
declaration which is where I declare
variable right the farther away from the
declaration where I use that variable
the more I'd want the name to be some
scripted so I might do first name like
that and camelcase is the preferred
method if you go to larger names but F n
is is good for this case so first name
we'll just put in James my name of
course is taught McCloud maybe we should
use that and we can do both if we want
so we can just do in for named Todd
McCloud and so I could have hello and
that hello and then put a comma here to
add in a new new argument to pass into
this function and so what is stored here
the short declaration operator and an
operator is and so that's like you know
right here what is an operator an
operator is the plus right and the
operator operands are the two so if we
go and we look at the language
specification so we can do going spec
and we go to the language specific
and then we just look for operator wait
for it to load here we have under
lexical elements which are elements of
the language lexical kind of means
language and we come down to operators
right like here are the operators and
one of the operators is a short
declaration operator and so that short
declaration operator allows us to both
declare and assign a variable and so
this allows us and I could put a little
comment into my program so I do the two
forward slashes that means here's just a
little note it doesn't impact how the
program actually runs but it'll
hopefully help anybody who's trying to
understand this program when they read
through it and see that comment so I'm
saying declare a sign equals initialize
so when you declare an assign excuse me
we need to Claire and assign a variable
you're all it's also known as
initializing the variable I clicked
format and just format it all that to
make it look pretty and so here I'm
declaring that there's a variable in and
I'm assigning to it this value which is
of type string so let me just write that
out for you I'm declaring there is a
variable in and I am assigning to it the
value Tod McCloud right which is of type
string okay so I'm declaring there's a
variable in and I'm assigning to it the
value Todd and cloud which is of type
string I can also do a write and call an
equals and I could put in 42 and so the
way I would talk about that now is I am
declaring declare there is it's a
variable a and I'm assigning to it the
value 42 which is of type int so values
are of different types and that's just
the way computers work
and you gotta have you need to have
different types for variables some
programming languages like are dynamic
and they just figure it out and that
could create some problems it's better
to have a static programming language
where when you declare a variable it
holds a value of a certain type but this
terminology when you learn about
programming it's really important to
learn the language which we use to talk
about the language of programming right
so we're using the go programming
language here but it has its own
language for talking about the language
and programming has a language for
talking about language and so declaring
a variable assigning a value to it a
value being of a certain type right
that's all really important stuff to
learn declare a sign value type these
are like this is like the fundamentals
of go programming you're gonna have
values they're gonna be of certain types
you'll have variables when they're
declared those variables will hold a
value of a certain type alright like a
can only hold values which are intz I
can't then reassign to a like what I
could do is I could assign 43 but then
if I try to assign 44 right I can't
store a string in a it's gonna throw an
air cannot use 44 type string is type
int an assignment and that's happening
on line 15 which is red right here it
could assign 43 to it but not 44 because
a when I use the short declaration
operator a became a variable which could
only hold values of type of type int of
type int not type string
likewise in if I wanted to I could
assign let me just run this all again
and we'll put that in there and we'll
format it and now that's gonna run glow
table McCloud 42 and within n can only
store a string right so I could assign
another value to it all right all right
that that value is literally of type
string and that will work but I can't
assign a number to it because an only
store strings right
line 11 line 11 line 11 you can't assign
that that's that's an int that's type
int can't use type int as type string an
assignment because when I use the short
declaration variable I declared there is
a variable in and it's gonna store
because I assign to it short declaration
operator I sign to it a string in is
going to store values of type string is
gonna store values of type int all right
so some terms here you're learning
you've learned dynamic versus static
programming dynamic programming some
languages are like that allow you to be
willy nilly loosey-goosey hey I used to
store net there now I'm storing a string
in that variable bad bad bad bad bad
creates all kinds of problems right you
need to know software engineering is
engineering engineering has great
creativity
it also requires great precision that
BMW behind me they didn't just say oh we
need some bolts to hold on the wheels
they found very specific bolts to hold
the wheels that have certain break
points and certain strengths and certain
types of metal and they put them on to a
certain tension and it's very specific
it's engineering and you want it that
way cuz you don't want your wheel coming
off at 80 miles an hour and so
engineering requires precision it
requires precision loosey-goosey hey we
stored a string there and now we're
storing an int they're like you know
dynamic programming languages it's it's
a it's they make me worried for my young
and it's much better to be with a static
programming language it's static it
doesn't change its static once you say
that this variable storing a string baby
it's always store in a string static it
doesn't change so static that's a stack
means static programming so you've
learned dynamic versus static program
and you've learned about declare you've
learned how to declare a variable at the
short declaration operator and then
assign a value to it and then if you're
you know sometimes people talk about
that like as initializing a variable
you've declared it and you've assigned a
value to it it's a
initialized alright so that's a that's
the first little deal here of using
variables and we declared you know two
variables in an a and then we just added
extra extra arguments we call these
arguments when you pass values into a
function we added extra arguments to
this function to print them all out this
will now run again and and we have those
three arguments those three values being
printed out and we just separate our
arguments by commas and that's just the
programming convention all right so part
of what you're learning here if you're
feeling like whoa what is all this stuff
part of what you're learning is how you
speak this language to computers so when
you learn a new language there's syntax
there's new words to learn and that's
what you're learning here and if I went
to Mexico and I want to order a doughnut
I better know how to say doughnut in
Spanish you know because if I don't know
how to say it I'm not going to be able
to make that happen but when I know how
to use the language the right words and
the right syntax I can make stuff happen
and it's the same way of programming so
you're just learning a new language it's
an awesome language it's a language
which gives you superpowers and you
learn some good things here and in the
next video we'll play with some values
and doing some math with some with some
values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
