exceptions errors are bound to happen in
your code especially when someone else
ends up using it in an unexpected way we
can use error handling in an attempt to
plan for possible errors that may occur
in your code for example if we were to
try to write to a file that was only
opened in the R read mode then an error
occurs and the script would just stop
running completely because you would
need to open a file fade right to
permission in order to write to it now
what if we actually wanted the script to
continue in that case we can use the try
except and finally keywords to catch
errors create a block of code that will
run in case an error happens and then
finally run the rest of the script that
way even if an error happens your script
can't account for it
and then continue on let's explore how
the syntax works in a notebook
let's begin by discussing the try/except
and else statements put together and
then later on we'll introduce the key
word finally so here we have our tri
keyword and underneath this tri keyword
is the block of code that you expect
might induce an error and as we
previously discussed this could be
something like trying to open a file
with only read permissions and then you
try to write to it and you may get an
error so if you try to do that a
particular exception is going to occur
and to give you an idea of what this
looks like if you've ever tried to for
instance say 1 + 2 so I'm trying to add
an integer to a string notice here we
have type error so we have a special
exception code type error and then it
has some sort of explanatory text to it
unsupported operation for addition with
integer and string and you can go to the
documentation under the exceptions list
so this is Doc's python.org 3 slash
library slash exceptions and there's an
entire list of built-in exceptions here
assertion error attribute error import
error OS error and you can scroll down
and you can see all these particular
types of errors and what the except
blocks allow you to do is try to catch
certain exceptions so for instance if
there's a particular exception here such
as exception 1 then we're going to
execute this block and then finally we
can have an else statement where if
there is no exception then we execute
this block so let's see this simple
example we're going to try to do the
following here we're going to try to add
an integer to a string and then we're
going to say accept and we're going to
accept this type error
so we'll say accept a type error and if
that happens we're gonna print out a
statement saying you are not adding the
correct things together and this sort of
print statement really helps out when
you have other people using your code
because sometimes these error lines
don't give enough of a description and
your print statements can do that or
your print functions can do that much
better and then we're going to say
L
prints everything ran smoothly so if I
run this and now we see the printed
statement you are not adding the correct
things together that means our script
didn't actually break completely instead
we accepted that we had a type error
here and then we print it out you're not
adding the correct things together and
this is a nice message for someone who's
trying to use your code and they realize
oh I'm not adding the correct things
together so you may be thinking well if
I know there's going to be an error
beforehand why would I not just fix the
error well maybe this too is actually an
input statement maybe it's something
like result is equal to input please
enter a number and then we were trying
to cast that number as an integer so if
something like this happens then maybe
someone types in the wrong thing like
the letter A so if we were just tried at
this code by itself and we were to run
it here so I do shift-enter please enter
a number if I enter a letter here then I
get a value error so it says value error
in Nevada invalid literal so I can grab
this error code and say accept type
error you're not adding the correct
things together or then I can also add a
new exception called value error and
instead of saying invalid literal for
base 10 are what I'm going to say is hey
make sure you supply a number so now
when I run this it's going to say please
enter a number and if I hit 3 then it
says everything ran smoothly however if
I try running this again and I input
something like Y it says hey make sure
you supply a number so now you get a
very nice-looking script and even if the
user is using it incorrectly you get
some results that make a cleaner outlook
versus these value errors with sometimes
hard to understand errors now you may
also be wondering do I have to memorize
every single type of built-in exception
well you definitely do not in fact you
can just have a single accept statement
with no exception
code and then you can just say Prince
hey an error occurred and this basically
says just catch any exception so if I
run this again and I input the letter R
it says hey an error occurred that way
you don't need to worry about memorizing
every single exception that's possible
but what's nice about the alternative is
sometimes you may want certain print
statements or even certain blocks of
code to execute in case a certain
exception occurs so now let's look at
another example of trying to open a file
we're going to say try and we will say F
open a test file and we will do it with
right permissions so that is W
permissions then we're going to write
test write this and then we will say
accept and we'll try to accept an i/o
error or let's just accept any error
so we'll say accept and then we're going
to print a and error happened and then
we'll say else prints everything worked
so if we come back here and I run this
it says everything worked however if I
were to change this to our sort of read
mode and I try to write to it
and then I run this again it says hey an
error happen because I didn't have the
right permissions and if I were just to
try to run these two blocks instead
without the use of that try block of
code then I just would have gotten
unsupported operation not writable so
notice here how my accept allows scripts
to continue running even if you have
errors that happen in them now we have
try accept and else but maybe you want
the try block of code to run the accept
statement to run and something else to
keep going after both try and accept
have been triggered in that case you can
use the finally keyword and the finally
keyword we can we'll always execute even
after there's an exception so we can
write here finally I always run the
block of code so let's run that again
and you can see here that we have try so
we try to run this code we print hey an
error happen and then finally we execute
this block of code so this is different
than else because else only occurred if
everything actually worked and here
finally this is going to run regardless
of things working or not working and you
can see here if I change this back to W
meaning the try block should work
anyways and I try to run this then I
don't get the exception but my finally
block still prints so that's how you can
use try accept and finally keywords when
you're trying to handle errors excellent
work so far we'll see you at the next
