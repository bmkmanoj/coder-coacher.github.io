Linux they're referring to the Linux
operating system as a whole an operating
system is a collection of software that
manages hardware resources and provides
an environment where applications run
the operating system allows applications
to store information send documents to a
printer and interact with users for
example a Linux distribution is simply a
collection of software and applications
bundled together and distributed as a
single operating system for example one
Linux distribution might come with one
particular web browser installed while
another Linux distribution will come
with another web browser installed by
default you'll be able to browse the web
on either distribution but the specific
piece of software used to do that might
be different it's important to point out
here that the software that comes
installed by default can be changed if
you don't like the web browser that
shipped with the Linux distribution
you're using you can install another one
and use that one you can think of a
Linux distribution as a curated
collection of software that works well
together but you're more than free to
use the software and applications that
you like best before we continue I'd
like to point out that you'll often hear
the term distribution shortened to
distro also some people refer to the
various distributions as flavors what
every Linux distribution has in common
though is the Linux kernel again
typically when the term Linux is used it
refers to the Linux operating system as
a whole however it can refer to just the
Linux kernel as well the Linux kernel is
the core or the heart of the operating
system
it's the layer that sits between the
hardware and applications said another
way it's the intermediary between
software and hardware however to have a
useful operating system you need other
components in addition to the kernel
these components can include system
libraries graphical user interfaces
email utilities web browsers and other
programs to summarize a Linux
distribution is the Linux kernel and a
collection of software that together
create an operating system
