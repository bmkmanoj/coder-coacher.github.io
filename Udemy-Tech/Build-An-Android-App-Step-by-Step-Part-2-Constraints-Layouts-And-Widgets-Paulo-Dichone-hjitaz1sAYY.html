creator of one of the most popular
Android n Java developer courses on
udemy so in this video I'm going to give
you a free preview of a lesson from my
android angel developer course on
udemy.com in this lesson I'll show you
how to set up Android studio and build
your very first Android application
alright so let's get to it
so an Android app is divided in three
parts when we develop applications okay
so we have the front part of thing which
is what we see the user interface so
what people see what people see and
interact with and then we have the back
end so the code part of things right we
have the Java logic as we saw here and
then we have the other layer which is
the the resources part of things so this
resource is part of thing that's where
we have all of the layouts which of
course it's part of what we talked about
saying the front part of things which is
the user interface okay so we have the
layout we have images we have the sizes
of the text where we have the fonts we
have certain values we can add for some
for some colors strings so which means
assets to the application one of the
benefits of having this very divided
over this very organized way a
compartmentalized way of organizing our
Android development is just is that it
allows us to focus on smaller pieces at
once okay so if you think about it we
have here as you can see the Java
folders where we can write our java code
which then that Java code connects
obviously to our resin to our resources
okay that means could ice or layouts or
drawables or images or videos audio
whatever else we are working with in our
application and that's a good thing for
every layout that we may have we should
have a correspondent
activity or Java file okay because
that's what's needed to connect the to
that so that we actually have our user
interface something that people can
actually interact with so now let's take
a look for instance at this layout
activity here and see and you notice
that all these layout activities they
end with they have this extension here
XML because it turns out all of these
are actually created our layouts are
created internally as XML so if you
double click you should see this
appearing here so the left here we have
this view which shows us the screen
where all of our items will be placed so
now notice that when you create an app
right away this IDE our IDE and your
studio puts together all of this for us
there's a lot of things going on here ok
but they were very simple essentially we
have this graphical user interface for
us developers as we make our application
so start seeing where are we putting our
widgets such as text as you can see here
but first things first you notice the
moment we went to activity main that XML
we have all of this great amazing things
to look at okay to the left right here
we have this properties so if you notice
if I click on hello world text my
property is filled out here so it gives
us the property of this widget here
hello world so that means we can change
the properties of this particular text
view here but there's so many things we
can do as you can see here we can even
change our visibility so if want that to
be invisible you notice that it won't be
visible okay just with a click of a
button here all right of course you can
move the item to the left right to the
right the middle okay and you can do the
same here if you want to put it at the
top there go back here at least to the
middle
more or less okay and change all of that
stuff all right
and you notice also here there's a lot
of other buttons of course but the main
thing that I want you to understand here
is that you can you can change the
preview that we've seen here okay so for
instance here what is showing it's
showing this preview on a nexus 5
Android device so you can go ahead and
change to this one okay gonna go and
change to a bigger one if you want to
okay as you can see things are changing
all right so you're gonna keep our Nexus
there you can see there's also these
guidelines that are showing here those
are really good because now with our
Android development it will be easier
for us to know exactly where our items
will be on the screen because now we
have this constraint layout and if you
look at the bottom here says component
free and we have constraint layout that
means if it click here that means this
whole screen here that we are able to
see once we run app is now a constrained
layout which means again that we will be
able to position things accordingly so
that if we for instance want to tilt the
if we tilt the application or the phone
the things that we have put the items or
widgets that we have put on the screen
they will readjust accordingly okay so
that's a huge thing that's a wonderful
thing because the last thing you want is
to have this hello world has to be in
the middle and on this phone but then
when you run on a bigger phone or
something like that then it just shows
something totally different but as you
can see here because everything is in
wonder constrain it will always be in
the middle doesn't matter
which phone or what orientation you have
okay that's really really big thing and
of course you have here you can zoom in
can you zoom out get a lot of things
okay and we'll talk more about all of
other other buttons there
just know that you now have a lot of
things you can do to make sure that
everything looks clean and nice and well
positioned okay so the top here then we
have this pallet view here and this is
where we have all of our widgets widgets
are essentially just what you can see
here textview something that we can show
a text as you can see hello world here a
button is a widget so as you click you
see a preview of what you're clicking so
a text you see a text view button and
check box and all these things that are
there for us so we can literally just go
ahead and drag and drop there look at
that it's not great and all of a sudden
because we are under constraint
everything here is actually now this
happened all of a sudden also has its
own constraints of course you will have
to change things to make sure that the
button is actual where it's supposed to
be but at least now you have a way
something to work with so if we save
this and run say ok and we should see
our button but notice something our
button is way up here
well what if we want it to be right
above our hello world well simply what
do we need to do is click on it once you
click on it you will see this green as
you hover over you'll see this green
mark happening here so you can actually
drag and point it there okay and you can
go here and on the proper isn't gonna
say how what's the height how far from
whatever it's at the bottom here in this
case is this textview you want this
button to be okay so you can go ahead
and hover over the number and click here
you can say 16 okay and you can see now
it's moving so if we save this and run
again you should be able to see look at
that the button now it's pretty much
about 16 pixels up of course you can go
ahead and put as many other items or we
just as you want you have a bunch of
them here we can use and we'll be using
a lot of
okay you have here from under pallet you
can see you can go to layouts there's
different layouts that we will be
talking about later containers you can
even add image views image buttons
videos view so let's see if we wanted to
add an image view on the top here so we
can put it about here okay and once you
drop an image view it obviously knows
that he should put an image right so it
opens this drawable window here where we
can go and find an image and you can
also search if you already have an image
here so gets a alert for instance it
shows anything that has alert in it okay
so this gate I'll just get this one so
click on that say okay okay and right
away it gives a little bit of our
constraints here okay so if you save
this and run let's see what's gonna show
okay it's at the top here perfect if you
want to make it bigger you can literally
you can go ahead and click on it on that
image and go to the bottom here at the
corner bottom or whichever corner you
want but and hold and start making it
bigger okay now it's bigger and you can
see in this preview here layout preview
where the constraints are of course but
the size of that image as well okay and
if you want to make sure that the make
sure that for instance there is a
distance between where this image is the
image view in relation to the button you
can do the same so you go like this and
connect like that and you can go ahead
and change here if you want it to have a
bigger margin for instance or two
something like that or can just hold it
and take it out like that okay if you
save this and run you should see it
showing right away there we go okay very
nice so we have that going there it's
really great how easy it is to start
building applications
here right because we have all the tools
that we need the next thing I would like
you to do is to go ahead and use the
example that I just gave you here and
start putting in go to palette
obviously first you will have to go to
layout click on that and you'll see this
just like I was we have it here and
start adding items inside of your window
here is that instead of your screen here
okay just like we did and adds
constraints now one more thing before I
go I need to show you you go at the
bottom here there's two tabs through its
design and there's text we are under
design that's why we can see this
because we are designing visually but
the great news is you also can design
using the text so if you click here
alright if you're here design you just
click text you should see this okay it
may look a little bit scary but this is
exactly what I used to use from the
beginning of Android development here
right because years ago we didn't have a
very solid design so everything was done
just using here the text so with here as
you can see textview ok this textview
here is this textview that says hello
world the text XML here as you can see
is a representation of what you see here
of course this is much it's more
beautiful and cleaner right because you
can actually see all of the widgets and
images and everything but this is where
the magic happens in case you notice
here it says hello world if we were to
change hello first look and save this
and go back to design we should see
hello first look okay for button we
could go to text here if you go to
button says text and text here button
Texas button we can say my button save
you will notice it changes here as well
okay very nice very nice now if you
click on this and you can also
notice again if you click on any of
these widgets okay for instance go to
the image you notice it's very
contextual meaning that on your
properties right here we will be able to
change whatever we clicked yes in this
case it's the image view will have its
property we can change the ID which we
will do it later time but also we can
change our layout width and all of the
great stuff okay but also look at here
we can change the background so we can
click on this three ellipses here and
you can change to something else here so
that means you can change the image and
of course if you want you can go and
save view all properties so you can
change a lot of other things pertaining
to our image here image view alright to
go back just click on this back here and
brings us here and remember all of this
that you can do using this design mode
you can do using the text mode which
shows us the XML file which creates our
design here
