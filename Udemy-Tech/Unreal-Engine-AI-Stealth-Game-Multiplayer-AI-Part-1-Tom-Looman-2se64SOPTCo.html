course on C++ in Unreal Engine 4 there's
a discount link in the description of
this video so please enroll today and
let's start making games for unmentioned
4 together
hey everyone and welcome to this first
lecture for the stealth game project now
this project we'll start off by using a
bit of a template so we won't start
entirely from scratch we'll be using a
first person shooter template and now
instead of using the built-in shooter
template that comes with unreal I put up
a simplified version of this that
removes some of the virtual reality code
that we don't need and it is available
on github but along with this lecture I
have a download resource available that
besides this template has a little bit
of content that we'll be using during
this first section so please download
that project that comes with this
lecture specifically and once you have
that downloaded and unzipped and in a
place you would like to use maybe you
want to put this on get up as well if
that all done we can start building up
this project so the first thing to do is
just go to the you project file and
we'll generate the project files now one
important thing to note is that this
project was made with Unreal 4.18 so you
know using a later version or 418 is
great using 417 or earlier won't work
because some of the assets will not be
able to load or just won't show up in
your in your engine so if the project
files generated we can now double click
and open up visual studio and in the
solution Explorer we have some source
files available so let's see what we got
first of all we got the FPS character
now since this is based this project is
based on the first person shooter
template all the classes start with fps
any class in your project will have some
kind of prefix to differentiate it from
you know engine classes that sort of
thing so the FPS character is very
simple it only consists of three
opponents has some input as a function
to fire a projectile and it has some imp
some movement code they're actually very
simple now visual assist is still
processing in the background so you can
see that the there we go
now popped up I was just gonna talk
about that the highlighting was not done
properly in so then the next class we
got is the FPS game mode and there's
very little happening here you know we
just set up the HOD and we set up the
pong class and in the HUD we only draw a
crosshair and in the FPS projectile this
is basically the thing that we're gonna
be firing from the weapon and it has a
collision component and it has a
projectile movement component and then
whenever we whenever you projectile hit
something we can do some some logic
we'll be changing this logic during this
project right now the only thing it does
is it checks if it hit a simulating
object so any kind of like physically
simulated box for example and if so it
will add some impulse at a box and then
it will do a destroy the projectile and
I can show you what that looks like in
the in a second so overall very simple
and I'm just gonna press f5 to build and
run this code right nice once that's all
loaded you should see the same thing
right here which is a very simple first
person template now we can just play
this you can see what's going on now we
can play we can shoot and whenever this
projectile hits something it gets
destroyed and some physics gets applied
to whatever he's hitting and we play a
sound when we shoot now not a lot
happening yet but by the end of these
sections you will have a very simple
very simple stealth game created with
some AI guards will make it multiplayer
already and we have an objective item
that we can pick up and
we have an extraction zone where we take
that objective item and so we're going
to be creating a few game mechanics some
obstacles and you know it will be a very
small nice little game that will create
over these next four sections so I'm
excited to get started and I hope you
are too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
