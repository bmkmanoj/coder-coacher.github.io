gonna cover is loops there are four
loops in programming or at least in the
c-sharp language what those loops are is
we have a for each loop a four loop a
while loop and a do-while loop I'm gonna
demonstrate each of those and show the
syntax and discuss each one basically
what does it loop though so a loop is
basically a repeated event for a number
of times or until some condition is
meant basically the type of loop you use
depends on your programming tasks and
your personal preference one benefit of
c-sharp over c++ is that we get what's
called the for each loop which is the
same thing as a for loop just a lot more
readable in terms of being able to
iterate through data so the first one
we're gonna cover is the for loop and
the for loop is one of the most common
loops at you'll encounter it's useful
for tasks such as finding a name and a
variable or or for calculating how many
or iterating through how many objects
are in a list or something like that but
basically say you take the example of
finding a name and is in a variable so
like an array variable which is a list
of items if we were variable storing
multiple names and we want to find just
one name and then do something with it
we would use a for loop the for loop or
allow you to iterate through all the
names and find the name you're searching
for so the first we're going to cover is
a for loop okay and the syntax for a for
loop and I'm sure you guys have seen it
the syntax for a for loop looks like
this it uses the keyword for write and
what you put in here is int I equals 0
int I equals 0 and then semicolon and
then I less than some max value so for
now I'm just gonna put max value and
then I plus plus we're just going to
increment I and then here is our loop
code so our code goes here now
oftentimes understanding loops is more
simple
that it may seem so it gets the name
loop because it uses the keyword for in
pseudocode this loop reads for the
integer variable i equals zero checking
to see if i is less than some max value
so i is less than some max value
we're gonna run some code and then we're
gonna increment i all right as long as I
is less than the maximum value it will
continue to increment when the condition
of I less than the maximum value is no
longer met the program will stop looping
and continue on with the rest of the
code so say this is our for loop right
here and then say right here I had a
debug that long that said hey this debug
that log will not get called until the
for loop is finished so as long as I is
less than some value it's this debug
dialog will not get called until the
vecto this condition is no longer true
so for instance what is this value it's
any it's a variable so say we had a
hundred apples okay so we had a hundred
apples and I need to calculate I need to
print out each Apple well well I is less
than some max value well we could put
apples so I is zero is zero less than
100 yes so we're gonna run some code and
then we're gonna increment now we're at
one is one less than 100 yes we get up
to 98 is 98 less than 100 yes is 99 less
than 100 yes now we're out a hundred is
a hundred less than 100 no so we break
out of the loop and now we run our debug
dialog Hey alright pretty simple so with
this Apple say we have a hundred apples
alright somebody comes along wants to
buy our apples we say ok and start
ringing up the apples in this scenario
you need to count you need to print out
each Apple so you know you need some
sort of loop now the way this works with
the for loop is I'm gonna go ahead and
say here for int I equals zero I less
than apples and I'm gonna print out each
Apple so I'm gonna say debug log the
current Apple which is I because I is
getting incremented which is this plus
plus here that means add one tie and
what's gonna happen here is if I run
this it's gonna debug zero through 99
now the reason why I tend 0 to 99 and
not one two
because numbers start at zero and I said
I equals zero
I wanted it to print out a hundred I
would have to say I equals 1 and I is
less than equal to apples and now it
will print out 100 so it's gonna print
out 1 to 100 see that and if I wanted to
I can even go in reverse I can go ahead
and change the logic switch it up I
could say for int I equals 100 while I
is greater than greater than 1 so while
I equals 100 well and then while I is
greater than 1
go ahead and subtract I so I - I don't
see what happens there that's gonna
print it out backwards so you'll see
here we got all the way down to 2
through 100 and the reason why I did two
and not one
is because I said greater than so I
needed greater than equal to one and
then it would have given me
so now we have 100 through one alright
so that's a four loop knot it gets a
little bit getting used to and in this
video I'm just really covering the
syntax of the loops I will have another
series going over practical exercises
using all the fundamentals that we've
covered so look forward to that but for
now that's the for loop and what we have
next is alright so what we have next is
the for each loop now with the for each
loop it only works when you have an
array okay and I'm gonna explain more
about arrays in the next video but an
array basically is a variable that holds
multiple variables of the same data type
so for instance this is what an array
looks like use these square brackets
next to your data type and then we're
gonna say numbers and I'm gonna go and
declare the array and I'm gonna cover
more of this in the next video but it's
just for demonstration purposes to show
you the for each loop so you have
numbers equals five six seven eight so
what if I wanted to print out each of
those numbers well I could also I could
use it doing I could do it using a for
loop which would look like this so I
would say four and I equals zero I less
than numbers and then dot length that's
gonna get how many elements are in the
array so there's four elements in the
array so this loop is gonna run four
times and then I plus bacchus aramid I
and then I would say here debug that log
the current element in the array so I
would say numbers and then I and that's
gonna grab the current index so it's
gonna print out five six seven eight
yeah that's fine if I were to use a for
each loop which is the exact same thing
as a for loop it's just more readable I
could say here for each bar use the key
Universal data type and you don't even
have to read it saying for each bar you
just say for each so you say for each
number and the key word in numbers then
you can debug that log the current
number just like that no need to work
with I or anything like that no record
thing
this here is the current number and this
is the array you're going through so for
each number in the numbers array you're
gonna give them that long the current
number
now this bar corresponds with the
datatype of this array so if I wanted to
instead of saying bar I could also say
is because that's the type of array it
is but for most readability purposes
that you do say bar and Rita as for each
number in numbers array debug dialog the
current number and if we test that out
let's see here five six seven eight
using a for each loop alright the next
example that we have here is the while
loop now the Wow and by the way just
just while we're on loop still just no
any loop you're in no code below will
get ran as long as the loop is running
so the loop has to end before something
else can run now we have the while loop
and the while loop is considered a
dangerous loop because you can get
caught in what's called an infinite loop
if you get caught in an infinite loop
your memory will fill up and unity will
crash if you're on a shitty computer
your computer will crash often times
this has happened when I'm working with
the curve routine and I want to do
something continuously and I forget the
yield statement if you forget to yield
in a current email using a while loop
your game will crash unity will crash so
when you're in a while loop it needs an
exit condition okay so for instance this
is very dangerous here while true
because true is never false therefore
this will run forever and it will crash
your system if I just say like this
there's no delay so it's running 60
frames per second taking up all the
memory and then done now what I can do
though is I have here say we have here
publicans apples right equals 100 okay I
can say here say we have here pumpkin
apples is a hundred okay and what I'm
gonna do is we're gonna subtract their
apples so I'm gonna say well apples I'm
gonna put a condition in it so while
apples is greater than one I'm gonna go
ahead and say keep up that log we're
gonna do like that log apples the value
of it and then I'm also gonna say apples
- - so I'm subtracting an apple every
time
so while apples which is a hundred is
greater than one which it is it's gonna
print out apples and then we're
subtract one so it's going to do this a
hundred times and then it will get to
here we're just gonna say to bug that
log the while loop finish yay for no
crash alright it's going to test that
out all right there you go so print it
out hundred do two again and the reason
why that is greater than one if I did
greater than equal to one then it would
have done that all right so that's the
while loop dangerous loop you can get
yourself in an infinite loop make sure
you have a condition that allows it to
get out of that loop okay and the final
loop we're gonna cover here is called
the do-while loop and the do-while loop
is pretty cool it's very similar to what
we just did with the wallet but it says
do and the difference between them is
that they do will happen at least one
time all right in the syntax for is this
we do do the open closing brackets and
then a condition so doing will do the
loop at least one time so for instance
if I wanted to say print out apples I'm
gonna say do debug that log we're gonna
print out apples apples and then plus
apples so how many apples do we have and
then how long do you want to do that for
do debug down log apples Wow
what does that can be do well apples is
greater than one all right and yeah
let's say greater than equal to one and
what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to
again subtract apples so we can get out
of the do-while loop all right so we're
gonna say apples - - and the syntax for
this requires a wallet so we're gonna
say wow there you go so you're doing
this at least one time and then Wow
apples is greater than equal to one so
for instance if I said here while apples
is greater than 90 it would just run
once and then Apple is greater than 90
so it just it's gonna stop
however grapples it's gonna be greater
than one for a while so it's going to
keep going so if we go and test that out
it's gonna run it
and there you get one 300 again alright
so that's the video on the syntax of
loops and if your little loss on it you
know try and watch the video again
they're really not that bad once you
work with it if you're not sure on
practical examples don't worry I think
as soon as I finish the arrays I'm gonna
cover a practical course which is gonna
take everything that we've done so far
and we're gonna do a few exercises
together it's what we're gonna take
about an hour and it's gonna use for
loops for each loops arrays if statement
switch statements and we're gonna get
really comfortable we're gonna do
real-world applications and it's gonna
you know it's gonna help you understand
what we're doing here and it's gonna get
you thinking logically thanks for
watching I hope you guys understand the
loops and I will see you next time
Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
