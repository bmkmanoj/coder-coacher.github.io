for the ultimate certified AWS Solutions
Architect associate course and I'm doing
a series here on the most intriguing
announcements from Amazon AWS reinvent
2017 and we've gone through several
others and now we're ready for the
number one the most intriguing
announcement in my opinion that came out
of reinvent 2017 and my choice for the
most intriguing announcement out of all
of the announcements at Amazon reinvent
2017 is serverless aurora so what is
service Aurora let's talk about the
details of the service and why I think
it's so intriguing
well Aurora is a very well established
database from AWS it's part of the RDS
or relational database services family
and basically it's a manage database
service there's a number of databases
that Amazon the native there supports in
RDS including MySQL Maria DB Postgres
sequel server and oracle aurora is one
that's kind of intriguing in that it's
it's only part of AWS no other provider
offers that it's not a existing database
that ADA B us has chosen to support it's
one they wrote themselves and the notion
is basically you get proprietary
commercial high performance database
capabilities at open source pricing and
so what Adria says is that Aurora has I
think it's ten times the performance of
MySQL five times the performance of
Postgres but very inexpensively it's
been part of the RDS family and as such
has operated similar which is basically
you define what database you want
running and then you say I want it run
in this kind of instance this size
instance and you have options around do
I want
because do i multi AZ support which is
basically support that gives you a
failover capabilities but all of them
still operate on the paradigm of you
install daily software into an instance
and then that instance operates and runs
the database now the keyboard yes
AWS manages the database and they make
sure that it's backed up and they make
sure it's passionate so forth but it's
still basically database running in an
instance why is what is service Aurora
and why is it so important well service
Aurora is the next step beyond them so
instead of you're having your database
run in an instance that is your
responsibility you pay for it's kind of
the equivalent of lambda but for
database so in other words you basically
just use the capabilities the SQL
capabilities of Aurora there is no
running instance AWS takes care of all
of that behind the scenes and I think
it's fantastic
because you no longer have to worry do I
have enough capacity
am i running near the limits of these
I've got am I being wasteful with this
is I'm running it in none of that
all you do is basically tell AWS I want
to run it's rora services I'm gonna
issue commands against it and you'll
make sure the capacity is there when I
need it and you can adjust the capacity
as needed that is phenomenal and I think
it's gonna be revolutionary so how does
it work well as you see the first point
you create a database in point and
you've already done this if you've used
RDS you basically make the commands you
say I want this database I want this
size census it gives you back a database
endpoint and you use that as the end
point for your sequel commands no
different with a roar server list you
still get an end point but there's where
it completely is different then you say
I want possibly you can say I want
minimum maximum capacity make sure I
have this many transaction capabilities
and this is the max I want because maybe
I want to limit how much I can
throughput I can use which would mean I
limit the amount I pay but you don't
have to you can just say here's my
endpoint and I'm gonna issue commands
and you'll let me know how much it costs
at the end of the month the queries
and I'm saying queries but it would also
be other kinds of commands inserts
updates at whatever are routed to a
rapidly scaled fleet of database
resources you have no idea what that is
and what's more you don't really care
AWS takes care of that behind the scenes
they just make sure there's database
capacity for the queries updates inserts
whatever that you issue and they can
scale that up and down so they've
basically got database capacity in
reserve and they're monitoring that
managing it and as you need for your
particular use your particular endpoint
need more capacity they add it so that
it's ready and available new resources
come online within five seconds now the
way it has worked in the past is if you
had an RDS instance RDS instance I guess
that's the best word and you ran into
capacity issues you would basically have
to say start up a larger instance and
RDS could take care of that for you but
it would take a few minutes and it would
also force your system to go down and
then reboot so you'd have some offline
not very long but some service doesn't
do anything it just basically knows how
to add capacity or remove capacity as
needed so that it operates properly that
is phenomenal and I I expect that the
cost is gonna be kind of similar to
what's Apple with lambda so basically
lambda many many people have found that
as they've converted applications lambda
their processing costs have gone down
90% o month-over-month and I think the
same things gonna happen with Aurora
service people are gonna see their
database costs drop dramatically and I
believe that there won't be any change
in the actual interface so you'll be
able to just swap in a different
endpoint you won't have to make any
changes to your programs no continue to
operate now where do things stand with
Aurora well right now it's in preview
that means you have to apply to use it
it's available but it's not something
that anyone can get access to
they're testing the service they're
finding out how it works
they're seeing how if there's any
problems seeing how operates see if
there's any challenges for users so it's
a preview you have to apply for it but I
believe it will come into general
availability at least in certain regions
within the next few months so you can
look for it to become available or if
you're interested in using it now you
can actually apply it for a preview and
see if you can get access to it so
that's why I consider service Aurora to
be the most interesting intriguing
exciting announcement that came out of
reinvent 2017 I hope you've enjoyed
these videos and I hope you'll come and
check out the class and take it and
enjoy it and learn from it and get ready
to be certified Thanks I'll talk to you
soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
