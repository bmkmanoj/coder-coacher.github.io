operating system on your laptop or
desktop or maybe you just want to
install docker and use it on a linux
server in the cloud or on a Linux VM and
this is the video for you we're gonna go
through all the Linux features that you
need to make sure are set up correctly
so that you can get through this course
and do all of the examples and code
stuff so first off congratulations if
you're gonna use Linux it's actually the
easiest to get started with docker
docker was made for Linux it now
actually has docker containers for
Windows but we're gonna get to that
later in the course but most of this
course is all about containers on Linux
and so when you think of the Mac and the
Windows stuff it's mostly them actually
running a tiny little Linux VM in the
background for you if you're gonna be
running natively on Linux then you're
good to go
there is no emulation or little VM
running in the background it just runs
straight on your operating system so
there's three main ways to get docker on
Linux and it might not be what you
expect the first one is to rescript
that's actually using a curl script it's
actually my preferred way especially
when I'm installing it from just for
testing or playing around with it
because it does use the edge releases
which are not the stable sort of
production II version they're more of
the beta monthly releases so obviously
you don't want to do that for maybe a
production system where you want to
automate over and over again for
creating servers in the cloud or your
data center but for installing locally I
highly recommend just using edge it's
it's actually quite stable for being
beta I usually don't have any issues
with it
and but it allows you to test out
features quicker because it comes out
monthly so that script would actually
get you installed and we're going to be
using that script today I'm also going
to show you though about the store which
has specific instructions for each
distribution so whether you're on Ubuntu
or Debian or Red Hat or sent OS or just
like all
redistributions they're they largely
come down to debian-based distributions
or fedora and Red Hat based
distributions and the yum package
manager in the apt package manager right
so there are other variants and other
things out there but really in this
course for Linux we're really just
mostly talking about those two because
they cover 95% of the of the use cases
in Linux and you need to go to the store
to get the specific instructions for
your distribution because you'll learn
that you shouldn't be using the built-in
default one that might come with your
package manager we'll talk about that in
a second so I want to note real quick
though if you're on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux or rel as I'll call it from now on
that only really officially supports
docker Enterprise Edition which is the
paid version and Dockers attitude really
is a paid operating system gets a paid
version of docker a free operating
system it's a free version of docker
that when we're talking about the native
stuff like Linux right so in this case
if you're going to be on Red Hat you can
actually go to the store and look up the
cent OS version because it's also a yum
package manager version and you can do
that docker seee instead of having to go
pay for docker ee but i just want to
tell you that now because if you go to
the store and then you go to click on
docker seee and it then you go look for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux it's not going
to be there because it's over on the EE
side docker assumes if you're running
the paid rel that you would actually be
paying for docker support just like you
pay for your Linux support so next up
you can install this on any Linux option
whether that's the native computer on
your laptop or desktop with a GUI or
it's a server in the cloud all these
processes are the same and we will if
there's ever an exception I will mention
at the time this is not gonna work for
all distributions remember how I said 95
is really 95 percent is really what
we're going for so that's just an
estimate of my experience with the
people I work with I have no scientific
background on that
ninety-five percent but there are
distributions out there that may not
work or will not work with docker and
specifically those are the less common
or vendor specific distributions like
Amazon Linux or Linode nit Linux or a
few other ones out there maybe like
Google clouds Linux which I know is
still beta testing docker support so
docker is a leading-edge technology that
uses the OS kernel and specific features
in that kernel and those particular
kernels at least in the past have not
had all the features in them that docker
needs to work properly so just for this
course a lot of my stuff is going to be
on like my demonstrations and stuff are
gonna be on a Ubuntu or Debian variant
and actually in this one we're gonna use
mint here in a minute
and lastly don't use the pre-installed
setups this is generally my
recommendation because docker moves
really fast and you want the latest
version of docker even if you're doing
production you want the latest
production version when you start out
and so if you go to digitalocean or AWS
or Linode you might find a linux install
that may be like an easier built-in
package thing that just says hey we've
already got docker installed for you
generally I don't recommend using those
because you you're usually gonna get an
old version you're gonna get an old
version of docker and then the first
thing you're gonna have to do is figure
out how to update it and depending on
how they install docker it may not be
that easy to figure out how to update it
to the latest edition so I always
recommend using like the official Ubuntu
or the official fedora or the official
cent OS installs then manually
installing docker as we will in a minute
in general this is going to actually go
through a couple of basic steps we're
going to first update our package
manager and install docker then we're
going to optionally add your user
account to the docker group and that'll
prevent you from having to use sudo
every single time you want to run a
docker command because that can add a
little bit of time and tediousness to it
so we're gonna do that then we're gonna
go and we're gonna clone my repo from
github onto your Linux machine and then
we can talk about getting a code editor
if you don't have one and lastly we're
gonna
tweak your terminal and she'll setup
this is a very optional approach but I
get a lot of questions in the course
from people saying hey your terminal or
your shell did this or look like this
how do you do that so I'm trying to give
some information around paths you can go
down to maybe tweak and set up your
shell differently so that it looks more
like the one that I use which I use
everyday and I customize it constantly
because I'm trying to optimize it you
don't have to do any of that if you
don't want to but I want to give you
some tips on that okay so what I have
here is a mint Linux stock
out-of-the-box machine and mint Linux is
a variant of your boot too so in case
you're curious it's actually a really
great desktop version of Linux but I'm
sure at this point you are using your
own Linux and you have all the things
you want on it and so I don't need to
tell you about the one that I tend to
like so if i just type docker in this
scenario it actually says hey it's not
installed you can use app to install it
and you install with docker io the
problem with that is you're gonna get an
old version maybe even a year old which
is it that's at least four major
versions if not twelve edged minor
versions old so you don't want that you
actually want to install it through the
store and so we're gonna actually use a
script like I mentioned while ago but
before we do that I just want to show
you what it looks like if I go into duct
or C II I know that basically my Mint is
actually just a variant of Ubuntu so I
can scroll down and find the Ubuntu one
and it actually will step through
instructions it tells you which editions
and I know mine is based on 1604 so I
click on the uses instructions in the
top right and it actually walks me
through and it actually tells me hey you
can use make sure it's these versions
and go get the docker for Ubuntu from
the docker documentation website which
is a very detailed stepping you through
making sure that you don't have the old
version installed from the default
apt-get
posit Ori and how to go through each
step by step however there is sort of a
cheat for this in our case when we want
to install the edge release I'm just
going to go to get docker comm and it's
actually going to show me a script which
I can use with curl over HTTP so that
way I'm making sure that it's officially
the script from docker because it's
encrypted on the connection and it will
let me install through an automated way
it'll basically figure out what is my
operating system what is my kernel what
how do I do I use a package or yum
package and it'll figure all that stuff
out and basically install everything I
need so I tend to use this because it
works so well for local installs so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy this and
paste it into my terminal it's gonna
download the script and it's telling me
just to run the shell so put it in my
admin sudo password and away we go and
you'll notice what this is installing
that the actual package is docker - c/e
and over the last few years as docker
has changed their branding and their
versioning and also their packaging
formats the name of the actual package
that you would install has changed and
so the one that it actually installed
the background is called docker - see II
in case you're curious okay and it's
actually telling us at the end of the
install that if we would like for our
user account to be able to just run
docker commands without having to type
sudo or go in as actual root then we can
do this particular command where we're
just adding our user account to the
docker group on our system and then I'm
going to need to log out and back in in
order for that change to take effect so
instead of doing that I'm just wanting
to test to make sure that docker is
working and running and I can do a sudo
docker version okay great
I'll actually log out and log back in in
a minute so you don't have to do that
part if you're concerned about security
and here's why docker requires root in
order to do the things it needs to
with the core functionality of Linux and
those things are something around
namespaces and there's this thing called
C groups and other features of Linux
that it needs to use so it needs root
for that right so when you by default
when you do things it's going to need to
use sudo but if you add your user to the
docker group what you're effectively
doing is giving that user in this case
Bret the ability to actually run a
docker container later that could then
have root permissions on the host now
this is a subtle little nuance of
security that you don't necessarily have
to worry about if it's just your local
machine but there are some variants of
Linux that have taken a hard stance on
this and that includes all the Red Hat
so the scent OS and the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux and maybe the Fedora
will not work with this docker option
you will have to either be root or use
sudo for every command you use for
docker on those distributions of Linux
unfortunately again that's anything
based on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
stuff and fedora and that's so that's
Fedora RHEL and Sint OS there might be
others but those are the ones I
definitely know about that won't work
with this so in those cases even if you
add yourself to the docker group it will
do nothing and you'll still have to type
sudo and you'll know if it doesn't work
because if you just type docker version
it'll actually say hey I can't talk to
the Linux daemon can you help me out and
that's because only root can talk to
that socket and so that's a hint that
you need to be either admin root rather
or be in a group that works so notice if
I do docker version again with the su do
it works right all right now that you
have docker installed you're going to
need two other tools for this course
from docker but when you're using Linux
as your main operating system they don't
come bundled with the install when
you're on Mac or Windows this is all
managed for you but on Linux we have to
take things into our own hands a little
bit and those two tools our docker
machine and docker compose each one is a
single binary and you can get them on
Dockers website in the documentation
area not on the store and so for the
docker machine part I can find here
instructions for Linux and I can just
copy that and it should work on my
machine ok and now I can type docker
machine version and make sure that I got
the latest version and it works and I
can do the same thing for docker compose
and find that on the documentation
website as well and scroll down to the
linux option now we could actually copy
this and install it from here but I want
to show you an alternative way that I
actually prefer the nice thing here is
that the docker website has lots of
information about how to install it what
it does and what not but these are all
available on github so I can go over to
github comm slash docker slash compose
and click on the releases button and
this is where the official release as
you can see the latest is 1:15 and so in
this case the documentation website is a
little outdated with 1:14 then the
releases on the compose on github so I
just always remember to go check github
calm slash docker slash compose slash
releases and I can do the same thing for
machine and right here it gives me the
information that I just need to cut and
paste into my terminal but you'll notice
that I actually got a permission denied
error and that's because in this case I
do need to be root so I'm gonna be su do
- I for interactive and then I'm going
to paste that same information and then
I should be able to back out a route and
type docker compose version and there we
go in case you're curious back over on
the github I can actually just replace
that word compose with machine and end
up right over on the machine page and
the releases for docker machine notice
this is on 12 - and I can copy this
stuff here as well and install it that
way instead of the documentation website
way so the choice is up to you there's
not really much information
installation on the github that much
more information is over on the
documentation site for docker that is
Doc's docker comm and the one last piece
of information here is that because we
manually install these that also means
that compose and machine we have to
manually update so you just need to make
it a part of your sort of mental
checklist every month or two to probably
go check for new versions of compose and
machine because they do update pretty
frequently hopefully in the future
docker will add packages to the package
managers for these so that we can
automatically update them with the rest
of our system just like we do for the
docker install ok so let's go get my
repo now there's several ways you can do
this one way on github is that you
simply download their GUI and use it but
they don't actually have an official one
for Linux yet so you would need to go
get a different third-party one and
we're not going to talk about that so
we're just going to use the command line
so if you're looking at my repo page
under my github account you'll find that
link in the resource section on there
section one under the getting resources
lecture and over here you can just copy
this URL and paste it in the command
line but if you've never used git before
then you won't have that installed so if
I type to get it would not be there so I
do need to install get real quick ok so
now I should have the version yep ok I
got get installed and I'm just gonna
make a directory real quick to put this
repo in and so I do get clone and then I
paste in that URL that I got from the
web page and that will pull down my repo
now you could download a zip file of my
repo but it does get updated as I fix
things or make things better and so it's
easier when you're starting this course
maybe a month later if you're still
doing the course that you just need to
do a get inside the directory actually
so you inside the udemy docker master
directory I could just do it
poll and that would get the latest
updates for the course alright next we
want to talk about code editors I
personally like Visual Studio code it's
very similar to github Adam if you've
ever used that or sublime text if you've
ever used that obviously if you're a VIN
fan or Emacs or any of the other editors
you can use all those but I will be
showing off a little bit of Visual
Studio code in this course because it
has a really great docker addon so I'm
gonna download the Debian version and on
my version of Linux that actually will
automatically open with the package
installer and I can install it that way
okay has finished installing and now I
can run it and once you get we just
studio code running or just code as we
call it or vs code gets there's got lots
of names there you might want to go into
the extensions and look for docker and
the one that's just called docker
install that and that will allow syntax
highlighting and little extra features
whenever you're editing the docker files
in this course and a nice feature there
is if you're in a directory and you just
type code with a dot after it it'll
actually open visual studio code in that
directory so it's sort of a shortcut to
get all the files from my course in up
in your visual studio code okay and the
last little tip we're going to talk
about real quick is customizing your
terminal and the nice thing is on Linux
is everything is pretty great out of the
box you have a nice-looking terminal
usually that comes with Linux it works
with all the features of docker and one
of the things you'll notice is the
command line completion that's tab
completion that you may have used for a
long time where if you're typing a
command in Linux in your shell and you
just hit the tab key it'll auto finish
that and actually show you features
around the options for that command so
if I just type docker and then hit tab
twice it'll actually show me all the
different commands I can use here so I
could type docker image and then hit tab
twice again it gives me another one and
I could say LS and then I could hit tab
twice again and
give me all the options that I would
have for that particular command and
that all works out of the box after
installing you have to do anything to
get that feature with Mac and Windows
you have to go through extra steps if
you case you watch those videos but in
case you're seeing stuff in my course
like the fact that I use the zsh shell
and then maybe I have different colors
that you like or features you just need
to check out dub dub dub Bret Fisher
comm /l and I list everything that I use
in my custom shell in Mac that will
actually work pretty easily inside Linux
so I customize my vim for example and
other various things of my show so feel
free to check that out but it's
absolutely not required for this course
I just get a lot of questions on it so I
wanted to give you some more info before
we get started okay so hopefully you
have docker working on your machine so
let's just review the tips and tricks
that we just talked about and all the
things we got installed so after
installing docker make sure you also get
compose and machine and you can get them
from those two links or from the github
page that I showed you I didn't mention
this earlier but later in the course
when we get to the sections on swarm
you'll be using docker machine to create
more VMs whether on your machine or in
the cloud that run docker so that you
can have multiple nodes running docker
docker machine is just one of the ways
that you can actually setup another
machine to run docker and you can check
that out any time but you won't need it
till near the end of the course and if
you remember we talked about visual
studio code so you can check that out
and bonus if you're on Linux then bash
completion for the commands just works
and you don't have to worry about
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
