going to work with and that we are going
to implement is called a linked list so
what is a linked list
well a linked list is pretty much
exactly what it sounds like right it is
a list of elements called nodes that are
connected together or linked together in
a single-file line there are two types
of linked lists a singly linked list and
a doubly linked list in a singly linked
list each node only has reference to the
node after it or the next node in a
doubly linked list each node has
reference to the next node but it also
has reference to the one before it as
well or the previous node the linked
list itself as a whole only needs to
know about two nodes in the whole list
for it to function correctly
it needs to know about the head node in
the tail node and it keeps a reference
to these nodes by two pointers which are
rightfully called the head pointer and
the tail pointer so that's it that's
what a linked list is and it's pretty
straightforward right so we are also
going to want to perform some operations
on our linked list so that we can add
data to it and retrieve data out of it
the operations that we are going to want
to perform are adding a node to the head
of the linked list adding a node to the
tail of the linked list removing the
head and removing the tail and as you
can see the head and tail pointers
change which node they are pointing to
as the nodes are added and removed so
they never lose reference to what the
head of the linked list is and what the
tail of the linked list is another
operation that we're going to want to
perform on our linked list is searching
we're going to want to be able to search
through our linked list to see if a
certain piece of data that we are
looking for actually resides in our
linked list so we're going to implement
that as well all of the nodes that we
will be creating are going to be
represented as JavaScript objects and
here's an example node that we might
have
as you can tell it has three properties
on it it has a value property which is
basically the data that it holds it has
a next property which references the
next node in the linked list and it has
a previous property that references the
node previous to this one in the linked
list so let's finally get into some code
and start creating our linked list
