video where we're going to have lots of
fun making a dynamic material and not
only just the materials gonna change
over time but we're also going to deform
the mesh as well using a very similar
technique so as you can see with this
video that I've got up on the screen at
the moment is gonna start with a nice
glossy finish and we're gonna decay that
we're gonna make it rust away and then
we're gonna actually deform the mesh
based upon that now we are going to use
a few of the features of blender 2.79 so
if you've not got that installed on your
computer we're going to have to do that
so 2.79 is the starting point you'll
will need for this video namely we're
going to use the principal shader and
some of the experimental features will
be a bit more stable as we use them in
2.79
now if we have a look at the screen over
here we have also a few things to do to
set up so let's go ahead and do that now
so I'm gonna click away to dismiss the
splash screen and we've got the default
cube now you may have other add-ons
installed this is a pretty stock version
of blender but we're gonna have to make
sure we've got a couple of things
installed first of all so you guys can
follow along without any issues
the first one that I want to show you is
when we're going to be rendering we need
to make sure that we're in cycles so if
we go to the very top on the info header
bar and switch that from blender render
to cycles render because we're going to
use the cycles rendering engine the next
thing that we're going to need to do is
go down to the render properties and
make sure that the feature set is set
from supported to experimental now here
comes our first warning when it comes to
using the experimental features it is
incredibly important that you get into
the habit of saving and saving regularly
because as we go through this you will
find that occasionally blender will
crash not only are we using an
experimental feature set but we are also
going to be rendering a lot and we have
to come in and out of rendering to show
what is actually going on on the screen
we won't see some of the output until we
do that the next thing I'm going to do
is go to my add-on so I'm going to go to
the file menu come down to the user
preferences and
there we can go to add-ons and I'm going
to enable node Wrangler I don't think
I'm going to be using anything else so
in the search box I've typed in node so
I don't have to go searching and then
finally we've got node Wrangler make
sure there's a tick in that box now in
general that's a good one to have on
anyway at the moment it will just apply
to this current blender file we're
working on but if you want it to apply
to every blender file you can go ahead
and save your user settings once we've
gone ahead and done that I'm gonna close
down the user preferences and save my
file so we get going and I'm going to
save this as rusty pipe okay so let's
crack on now and start generating our
object now in this particular case I
decided to create my object in a
slightly different ways so even though
it might look like I've extruded a
cylinder or something like that in this
case that's not what I've done so I'm
going to clear down well I'm going to go
into edit mode actually on this cube and
just delete the top vertices and I'm in
vertex mode at the moment so I'm just
gonna quickly select holding the shift
key right click for those top view I'm
gonna press the X key to delete and I'm
gonna select vertices this will leave us
with something we can work on now that
ideally should be in a better position
and down there but we can solve that out
in a moment the next thing I'm going to
do is delete the face so let's go ahead
and delete that face but I'm not going
to just do faces I'm gonna do only faces
and that will leave the surrounding edge
so this will be the base for our pipe
that we're working on our rusty pipe but
the next thing I need to do here is
actually add something else to give it a
bit more interest that's really all this
is about I mean you can you can create
your own shape as you go if you wanted
to so select everything here and move it
up on the z-axis by one so it's in the
middle of our scene and I'm gonna move
it across it doesn't matter whether it's
in the positive or negative direction
here but I'm gonna move it in the X
direction so G X and then by one so
we've got our our base coming together
here now the final thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to go back into vertex
select and create a triangle going up
here so I'm going to extrude so e for
extrude so we've got this now floating
vertex connected with an edge
and the robes aired by two and then I'm
going to move that across in the
y-direction by one Shoji y1 and then I
can extrude down to this vertex down
here now in order to make sure I'm not
faffing around trying to join these two
things together in a bit by removing
doubles what I can go ahead and do is
when I'm extruding I can snap to vertex
and merge uh vertices automatically so
we go along to the 3d header bar here
and we turn on snapping which is this
little magnet now if you can't see
everything if you've done not got a high
enough resolution display you can use
the mouse wheel to scroll backwards and
forwards on any of these header bars
where you can't see anything I'll just
demonstrate that if I pull this across
so we cannot see that magnet we can use
the scroll wheel to pull it across and
then we can see it let's just make that
a decent size again okay the next thing
is what are we going to snap to well
increment might be fine but I'm not
going to risk that I'm gonna actually
try and snap to the vertex and this
means we can pick this individual point
here now if we go ahead and extrude and
put a vertex on top of here we'll
actually end up with two vertices in one
place occupying the same space so in
order to make sure that doesn't happen
I'm gonna go along a little further and
there's a nought there's a two arrows
butting heads together and that is
automatically merge vertices moved to
the same location and because we're
snapping it will be the same location so
with all those three things set I can
press e to extrude again and this time I
just moved my cursor over that vertex
there we go in it snaps in place and
it's merged and if we press G we can see
that that is moving all together it's
not moving individually so perfect
that's that's actually everything we
need done in order to set up our basic
shape okay so it didn't quite look like
that it looked like it was there was two
of them and that's what we need to do so
I'm gonna go ahead to the modifiers tab
I'm gonna come out of edit mode into
object mode and then from here I'm going
to go and go to the modifiers tab in the
properties window and I'm gonna add our
first modifier now there are gonna be
all three or four modifiers as we go
through this but let's go ahead and add
our first one our first one is going to
be a mirror modifier
so we're generating new mesh data so we
go to the generate column if we go down
there it is mirror now fortunately I've
made it along the x-axis so when I
reflect it among the x-axis it does
actually just put it there which is
absolutely fine I'm also going to turn
on clipping if I accidentally go ahead
and move any of this geometry what I
don't want to happen is for it to end up
with intersecting geometry turning on
clipping will help prevent that okay so
that's the first modifier setup now if
we go ahead and add in another modifier
this time a skin modifier
now this modifiers actually go is
another generator generating mesh if we
go to skin we can see that it puts
around our are sort of beam that we had
created now this isn't ideal at the
moment we can see blatantly here that
this is well not tubular at the moment
it's very rigid now this might be a look
that you're going for that's absolutely
fine but that's not the look that I want
to go for so in this particular case I'm
going to hide away the skin and hide
away the mirror just dropping those down
now let's just see here if a if a
modifier the subdivision surface
modifiers going to solve our issue so if
we scroll down again this is generating
because we're generating new geometry
subdivision surface that's looking
pretty good
now let's knock up the levels of
subdivision surface just a little bit
more yeah that's a that's so quite a
good start now in this particular case
there are a couple of other things that
we need to turn on now I am going to
turn on adaptive and I'm gonna leave
everything how it currently is we may
have to work with that later
now adaptive is something that will
subdivide more the closer this object is
to the camera when it comes to rendering
and subdivide less further away so that
basically means that the further you get
away from the camera the less work has
to be done calculations have to be done
so ultimately you will end up with a
faster render however to counter that
the closer something is to the camera
the more it might be chopped up and
therefore have the more work that needs
to be done so if you've got a lot of
your object really
close to the camera you may find that
this will slow down your rendering
slightly but if you've got a scene like
this let's say we set up the camera
along these lines where a lot of the
geometries far back and there's only
really this front bit that's next to the
camera we will find that it looks much
better when it comes to chopping up the
geometry when we start deforming this
mesh as it rusts away in a bit okay so
we've got the base mesh all lined up
here there are a couple of other things
that I will want to do at this point in
time first of all I'm going to turn on
smooth shading so in object mode I'm
gonna make sure that smooth shading is
turned on and then I'm going to rename
my cube what should I rename it let's
call it rusty pipe might as well get our
naming right from the very beginning I'm
not sure if it took smooth shading it
doesn't look particularly smooth flat
smooth interesting no mud and let's go
ahead now and add a bit of color to this
so I'm going to go to the materials tab
and add in a base material now this is
going to actually be a dynamic material
that will end up modifying over time but
I'm just gonna name it pipe for the
moment and I'm gonna click use nodes
let's go ahead and use that new
principal shader it's basically a load
of shaders all pumped together and that
actually makes the node setup just that
little bit easier and less involved in
some cases it also does some
calculations in the background as well
so I'm hiding my tool shelfs there and
I'm gonna go into the node editor and
start editing now before we start going
through and adding a ton of stuff here
let's just keep it simple so we get rid
of our diffuse be SDF shader I'm gonna
press X to get rid of that Oh
make sure you've only got that one
selected otherwise that can cause you a
few headaches there we go
so make sure it's only that selected
delete that and I'm gonna add in an a
shader of type print support B SDF now
at this point I tend to use the search
feature so I will type in P R there we
go it's there straight away that's the
general thing that I will do when I'm
looking for something and here we have
the B SDF we can plug that into the
surface now we're also
using the displacement part of this in a
moment so there's gonna be sort of two
halves to our node structure well sort
out roughly how it looks to begin with
and then we'll talk about its
deformation so we'll talk about its
color sort of building up the model and
adding a material and then we'll talk
about animating and deforming it over
time so there will be another modifier
we'll add on in a few minutes so our
base color now I picked green before I'm
gonna pick red this time now before we
do anything else I'm going to save my
work okay so there are a couple of other
things I just want to finish off here to
set the scene and make sure that it's
not so jerky as we start being a bit
more advanced with our rendering stuff
now I am recording at the moment
obviously you're witnessing that so I'm
gonna change my device from my CPU which
is being used for the recording to GPU
now you may not have that option in
general GPUs are gonna be faster this
type of workflow especially when it
comes to rendering which we're gonna be
doing hopping in and out but if you're
working on the CPU that's absolute you
find this will also work on CPUs and you
won't have the bottleneck that I have
with recording anyway so GPUs turned on
I'm just gonna save that as we're going
through and just test the rendering that
is working excellent now a couple of
other things all look that's a lot
smoother as well wish I'd done that
earlier let's go ahead and add in a mesh
and this time it's going to be a plane
and under scale that up by a a silly
amounts probably scale by 20 excellent
so that's all scaled up and I'm gonna
rename that ground because that's
essentially what it's going to be now
what happens if we render this scene now
okay it's looking good we need a bit
more light in the scene now we could go
about making a more complex light setup
but I'm simply gonna go to my lamp and
change its type to a Sun lamp I'm gonna
use nodes and increase the strength to
maybe three yeah that looks pretty good
now looking at this this doesn't look
like a metallic or a painted pipe at all
this looks like a lump of plastic at the
moment so let's rectify that straight
away let's go to our principal shader
and change the roughness
drop it down to 0.1 maybe a little
higher actually or a little lower in
this case so point naught 5 yes I'm
happy with that as a starting value now
as it starts getting rusty what we can
do is make it rougher in places and we
can change that and guide that based
upon some textures in a few moments but
at this moment in time we're getting
everything ready getting a rough
approximation of what we're going to be
going for also we can see here that our
our object is embedded in the ground so
I'm going to grab the ground and move it
down on the z-axis by only a little bit
because I don't want it to disappear and
I think I've still got snapping turned
on if I have that's going to cause me an
issue because it will be snapping to
things when I don't want it to yes I
still have snapping turned on so let's
turn that off grab the floor G Z there
we go it's lowering down and I will not
make it levitate about there that looks
absolutely fine to me just my eye it
doesn't matter at this point of time so
we've got a nice shiny metal bar or a
painted metal bar that we can start
making rusty now I do want to show you
I'm going to save my work do save
regularly because we're going to be
rendering Lots and it will crash it will
I tell you it will crash at some point
we want to avoid that but what I want to
do here is just show you what sort of
node setup we're going to be approaching
for with the material on here just to
give you an overview of where we're
going before we actually go there so
I've saved that I'm gonna open up my
rusty demonstration and let's get rid of
everything else but the node setup okay
so here we go now don't be afraid when
you have a look at this if there is a
lot going on here but we're going to
build this up slowly as we go through
and I'm gonna explain what each bit is
actually doing in fact it does look like
there's something that's there that's
redundant as well by the looks of it
this little noise texture at the top
here is its outputs aren't actually
plugged into anywhere but let's zoom in
just for a moment to the principle
shader because that's all we really have
at the moment and let's just have a look
at the few changes that have happened
here now at the moment we've got the
principal shader coming out and going
into the output
what the material looks like what the
surface of that material it renders like
now notice that the first thing that's
being changed is the base color and
obviously as something goes wrong it's
gonna change from its is painted color
to perhaps an orange color because it's
rusting and because of that we need to
control that over time and that's why
we've got the series of nodes we will
look at those in a few moments plugged
into the base color the other things
that are changing are it's metallic
nurse and it's roughness now when you
start you will get some metal coming
through before it starts going rusty so
we're going to change the metallic
appearance of the surface and also the
roughness itself as something goes rusty
well it's going to be smooth painted to
begin with but as it starts to go rusty
well it's going to get rougher as well
it's not going to be as shiny as it once
was simple as that really so that is
quite complex as you go back here and we
can see there's a bit of crossover this
bottom part is all about displacement in
reality and this top half is all about
how the colors are changing however as
you can see these nodes are connected in
such a way a bit messy this is an
experimental project after all but these
are there's a great deal of crossover
because as you can expect as something
starts to rust away you're also going to
end up with it changing color and the
parameters how it is rusting away will
also dictate how the colors change as
well and that's why there is this
crossover so what we will do now is hop
back into our project and start building
this up okay so we're back over in our
project here we've done the modeling
aspect and we've got a base material on
here
that's the modeling part pretty much
done as far as this goes so we've got
all the geometry out of the way the next
thing we need to work on is how this is
actually looking in terms of how it's
going to act as it rusts away that's
quite important because it's very easy
to will basically get the wrong
parameters or do things in a funny order
and then you end up having to backtrack
so let's just make sure we're doing this
in a in a more logical way now the first
thing we need to do is add in a mix
shader'
now I'm going to switch to render
mode on hopefully it won't cause any
crashes we do have to obviously be
careful of that if it does crash I may
have to go back a little but hopefully
because I save regularly that won't be
an issue okay so we have a base color
here and we need to go between one set
up in another and what we need to do in
order to do that and those there are
many ways you could go about this by the
way but we're going to try and keep it
simple and so we're gonna have to RGB
nodes which are basically the color red
green blue so let's go ahead and add in
another node and call it well its RGB
here we go so we've got a load of
options in here but in this case we just
want RGB and this is basically a color
selector so I'm going to go shift D and
duplicate that so we've got 2 color
selectors we'll have our original color
up here which is going to be red and
we'll have a rusty color for the moment
an orange that's absolute you find we
don't need to do anything else the next
thing we need to do is mix these two
together so it can go from one color to
the other now of course you can do this
in multiple ways and in fact you can do
it in a gradual way and have multiple
layers of mix which is essentially what
I did in that more advanced one but you
can go ahead and build that up yourself
at the moment let's go ahead and mix
these two together so I'm going to add
with shift an A and I'm gonna type in
mix in this case we're not mixing
shaders we're mixing our GB if we go
ahead and pop that in and then we've got
a color one attach color to and then we
can go in and apply a base color now at
the moment as we slide the factor
backwards or forwards you can see we can
go from our red to our orange pretty
neat hey there we go job done well
unfortunately things don't rust like
that do they they rust in a more random
pattern so we're gonna have to have
something there that's controlling that
controlling this color but based upon it
changing kind of randomly rather than
just the whole thing at once so we're
going to change this factor and for that
we're going to use a texture now I'm
gonna make this RGB just a little
smaller for the moment and we're going
to control this factor we need to
control it with
think what should we use to control it
with well let's go ahead and add in a
texture so we're going to go down to
texture and there are lots of different
textures you can use but after playing
with it for a bit
either noise or vulnera is going to be
quite good I'm gonna use noise initially
now I am going to have a quick look at
my settings that I had before so we can
speed things along as it were but in
this case I found that a scale of 10
worked really well and I'm gonna plug
for the factor not the color but the
factor itself into the factor up here
and what we should end up with and we do
now run out of zoom over on this window
on the right hand side so I'm gonna go
to the view and view selected if you've
got a number pad and you run out of zoom
I you're using your scroll wheel and it
doesn't seem to be doing anything number
pad full stop there we go there and we
zoom in here we can see that we've got
blotchy patches here that's pretty good
that's a good start
however what I feel is kind of happening
here is we're not really getting a great
deal of one or the other and eventually
we do want it to migrate over to being
completely rusty and we can't do that by
just plugging it in like this so we're
gonna need something in between this
that's entirely up to you how you do
this I'm going to use a color ramp now
I've also got because I've got node
Wrangler turned on I've also got the
ability to hold down ctrl + Shift +
click on any of these nodes to see what
it looks like at any point now the 1st
ctrl shift and left click is going to
select the top output in this case the
color and then if I click again it
alternate to the factor and because it's
the factor that we're using we can see
on our model now how it's being applied
now because there's no true white or
there might be on there or there may
even be a true black on there but
because it's not completely polarized to
black and white we don't actually have
ourselves any means of seeing the full
rust color or the full paint color so
what we can do here is go ahead and add
in a color ramp that's one way of which
we can control this we could also
control it with a with a brightness and
contrast now
that would also work but in this case
I'm going to use a color amp so it can
have a little bit more control over it
and I'm gonna go shift in a and have a
search for my color ramp and there it is
color ramp let's go ahead and you can
see if you drop the node over it or
connect it in place now what I can do is
I can go to my mix again to see what
it's looking like this is a raw version
before it's all rendered up but I can
adjust where the black point is
essentially making everything painted or
I can just where the white point is
essentially making everything rusty so
that we could actually animate that if
we wanted to that would be one way of
making it rusty and rustier or certainly
start making sure we start with full
paint and then work our way to being
rusty the other way so there's lots of
options we can do in terms of animating
that but let's just get the basic things
set up first so that is all of the basic
material set up there and let's go ahead
here just bring that down a little bit
more and bring this one up so we see we
get a much bigger contrast between where
rust spots are and where paint is gonna
be if I then go to my principal shader
and shift control click that we can see
that we end up with well we do not got
anything affecting its roughness yet so
it's still shiny where it's orange how
can we do that well because the paint is
linked to this color ramp let's try and
use that so let's come out from the
color here and plug that into the
roughness now hopefully what this will
now do is where it is shiny but it's
still what paint on it will be shiny and
where it is not I this orange it will be
quite rough and I think we can see that
if I turn that off by moving it out and
let's find somewhere that is in fact
shiny on oh there we go over here on the
end we can see if that it is shiny and
it this highlights if I angel' this
right should go across both are there we
go we've got it on the orange that's
exactly what I want to demonstrate this
now if I go ahead and plug in the color
into the roughness we should find there
we go it is shiny
where is red and where it was orange
it's no longer shiny so it's rough in
those places excellent so you can see
how we can start to build up quite a
dynamic texture by doing it this way
quite a dynamic surface as well this is
completely procedural at the moment
we're not using a fixed texture to
generate any of this so there we go
we've now controlled both where it's
rough and where it's smooth and where
the color changes as well unfortunately
they're over the same things the next
thing we need to do is test out how we
want this to look when it starts to get
really rusty and the other thing I want
to do as well watch them hear it start
to control how these noise textures are
placed now because we've got the node
Wrangler add-on turned on what I can do
at this point is select that and go ctrl
+ T and that will add in a mapping and a
texture coordinate node it may even add
in an image as well which we can delete
so ctrl + T here we go it's added in a
mapping and a texture coordinate the
reason why I've added these in is to a
give us a bit more control over our
model and its textures and also be
explicit about how we want this texture
this noise texture applied to that model
because we could go about and apply it
in certainly in different ways now we're
doing generated coordinates here so
blender is handling all of that for us
and that's probably a good thing with
the way that we've constructed our rusty
pipe it doesn't really have any mesh
data at the moment it's purely generated
from those individual edges we drew at
the very beginning okay so we've got
that coming through now one of the
things I do want to change is the scale
on here this gives us an extra layer of
tweaking I quite like how it looks but
what happens if we say set this to 10 10
and 10 now we get a much more bitty so
rusty pattern so we can go back and we
can change it on one particular
direction if we want been general I'd
recommend matching these up so I'm
trying to pick something that looks in
between it being totally rusty and
weather where it actually starts flaking
off and we can add in other control
points as
if we want to so we have here something
that looks pretty good so far in terms
of everything that we've got but now we
need to control how this is going about
its hold sort of disintegration and it's
actually displacement there are a couple
of things that we can do first and
that's just to make sure that the
experimental features that we've turned
on are actually going to work and in
order to do that we're gonna have to
turn them on
now that is under the material
properties itself so I'm gonna click on
material I'm gonna scroll down a little
sir so we come down here there's an
option for displacement that's fine we
can leave it as it is under the settings
if we scroll down a little further we've
got an option for displacement at the
moment just says bump
we don't want bump we want both we can
do true but both really accentuates it
so we're gonna use both now you won't
notice anything change at the moment
because nothing is plugged into the
displacement material output I'm gonna
lower this down ever so slightly and I'm
going to plug in our color ramp that we
had earlier so let's go ahead and plug
in that color ramp into the displacement
now oh that's actually updated
occasionally it won't do we go ahead and
go shift Zed and then shift said again
there we go you will have to do that
occasionally it's work first time this
time I'm really impressed with that but
occasionally you will make a change and
it won't be reflected over in the
viewport until you've turned rendering
off and back on again now to keep this
rendering nice and quick I'm gonna go to
my render settings scroll down and go to
sampling now I'm not I don't really care
in it of it looking that pretty so I'm
going to turn the preview down to maybe
five I'm not gonna leave it at one that
would be ridiculous but if it's at five
I know it's going to get to a decent
place quite quickly and we can see there
that that's pretty cool but it's a bit
on the strong side so we're going to
have to add in probably another color
amp or something else just to control
how that's behaving and we certainly
don't want it looking quite like that
towards the end we need to control that
displacement in in some form or another
and on top of that the displacement
itself is not gonna be totally smooth
it's gonna have a bit more of a bump to
it as it starts sort of bubbling away
and we can add that in in a few moments
as well in fact I'm gonna start by
building that up as we go so we've got
our noise texture here I'm gonna grab
that and duplicate it and I'm gonna grab
our color ramp and also duplicate that
now we need to control how this is
looking at but I want something else
there as well I need to mix two things
together so I'm gonna go ahead and add
in a mix RGB node and I'm gonna plonk
that in the middle and that means I can
start adding in something else and now I
need something after that to control how
it comes across so then I can spread
this out a little further and make it a
little less bumpy in this case now I'm
gonna go ctrl shift and click on this to
see what it looks like and I'm also
gonna go shift said in the viewport and
out again so it's not really changed how
that looks for the moment if I bring
that down so it's not fully affected and
come back again there we go this time
it's much smoother and where it's rusty
it's gone in by the looks of it let's go
back to my final material output and
just see how that's looking okay that's
the wrong way round okay so we've got it
rusty still on the surface and then
inside it's red so there are a couple of
things that we could do here we could
switch around these two colors at the
top but since that's all setup and that
could be quite a complex material setup
we are now dealing with how it's
displacing we can come down to the color
ramp and just switch those around so
we're gonna flip the color ramp so now
where it's rusty yeah that looks that
starting to look better already now
where it's rusty is where it's going to
be going in rather than the other way
around and we can see here after turning
that on and off again that's working
however you can see where it is rusty in
places it's quite deep still so perhaps
I need to bring the this black value up
slightly come back shift Zed shift Zed
and see how it's looking this is
something you're going to have to go
backwards and forwards with so that look
that looks good in terms of where the
drop-off is with the well
with the red and orange border but I
think I need to elongate this now so
we've got a bit more of a gradient
between the two it's too sharp
yes that's starting to look pretty good
now in this particular case I think we
need to do a few other things I'm going
to add in some extra noise we've got
some noise down here I'm gonna use the
factor into color
- I'm gonna shift-click just to see what
it looks like and I'm gonna turn this
off and on again now we're talking about
the factors I need to go control shift
and click once more once we've done that
I can go ahead and adjust the scale now
in this case I want a really bumpy
surface it's gonna be really high on the
scale 18 oh maybe even more than that
let's go up to 120 yes that's a little
good detail mmm interesting how do we do
the detail in this case well let's go to
the mix and see what that's looking like
when it's mixed together interest of
course we've got a factor here so what
we want to control that factor is where
it is rusty and we're isn't rusty so we
want this to also be controlled can't
see that by the same thing that's
controlling how the paint where it is
and isn't rusty so we can use the color
out of here is also the factor so where
it is rusty is and we can see this here
where is rusty it's whiter and where or
white or close to white and where it's
not rusty it's still black and if we go
and render that we can see we've got
there a much better surface so it's not
going to have any of our new noise
texture unless it goes all the way down
now that's still a bit strong there we
need to start bringing those two things
together and I don't think the color
ramp is actually going to be suitable
for doing this let's just bring the
black point up slightly and re-render
yes I think at this point we can see
here this is what's going on I need this
almost gray in places let's see what
it's doing now because this is
effectively controlling the displacement
the displacements quite strong at the
moment so I may need to add in yet
another color just a week and that's out
let's rerender and see what
happens ah that looks a bit better let's
squash this up even more it needs to be
really subtle at this point and let's
come back and you can see there's a lot
of iteration that you can go through
okay they're starting to look there
let's bring this back down ever so
slightly and re-render and start getting
used to doing this coming in shifts edge
shift said okay that's looking fine for
the moment now at this point in time as
you're bringing all of this together
I would also save my work and look at
doing a full render what we're seeing in
the viewports at the moment is a rough
approximation of that render so in order
to do that I'm going to change my view
to the camera so view or get the menu
right in a moment view camera numpad 0
if you've got a number pad and that's
what it looks like from the camera view
I'm gonna move the camera now by going
shift + F to go into first-person mode
and just move this closer now you may
find it's easier to do this when you're
not in rendered mode I'm I'm almost
happy with that I'm gonna shift it down
a little now you use WASD to move around
Q and E to go up and down and there we
go I'm happy with that
layout and I'm gonna press f12 to do a
rendering I'm also whilst I've got the
opportunity going to save it as well now
at this point in time you will see that
with everything we've got going it may
take a while to render out now these
cells themselves that are rendering look
too small for me for GPU rendering I'm
gonna let it render out at the moment
but I'm also going to in my render
properties come down go to my
performance area and change it yes these
tiles are pretty much set up at 64 by 64
which is not really good for anything
it's kind of a halfway house if your
rendering with your CPU you'll want
those quite low maybe 8 and 8 or 16 and
16 depending on the CPU and for
rendering on a GPU you probably want a
higher value like two five six now I'm
not going to worry about the actual
rendering here but let's just have a
look at how it's coming along we can
zoom in and I quite like how that's
looking at the moment
now we probably do want it to go totally
rusty at some point but that's not a big
issue for the moment we can always tweak
these things later on when it comes to
animating okay so the next thing to do
is actually talking about the
displacement itself now this is where we
don't use the nodes unfortunately
there's no direct link between the two
but if we go back into well I'm gonna go
into the node editor again but this time
I'm going to open up the 3d viewport as
my main area and then we can focus on
working there okay so we've got our 3d
viewport open and this time we're going
to have to change how this thing is
looking but this time using a
displacement modifier so I'm gonna go
ahead and add in another modifier I'm
gonna call it displacement and again
this is a modify this is deforming our
mesh so we need to find it here is
displace so this is gonna add an extra
level of bloatedness by the looks of
things that's pretty cool and the reason
why it's doing this is it's that it's
all in the wrong order we're displacing
it after we've done everything else now
if we think logically the modifiers
themselves do apply themselves in order
so we start with the mirror modifier and
let me just hide the node editor and
bring this across so we start with the
mirror modifier which is fine then we
skin everything that we've mirrored and
then we want to displace before we do
the subsurface modifier so let's bring
that up now it still will be a bit
bloated for the moment because we're not
controlling the displacement with
anything so if we open this up we really
want something to control the
displacement rather than it's just doing
what it wants to do so in this case I'm
gonna go to my texture settings and just
click on new which will add a new
texture ok that's gone all funny what we
can now do is name that texture um where
or something along those lines as in
it's wearing away and then go to the
texture tab so along the properties
panel if we go to the texture properties
we will see that it says noise texture
which is all very well but that's not
the one we want
if we click on where it says noise
texture we need to find the one that's
under the modifiers because we're not
adjusting a material texture
we're not adjusting a brush texture
we're adjusting the modifier texture
here we go
so currently there's not anything
appliance to this it's just got a black
image applied to it I'm gonna scroll
down and where it says the type of
texture image your movie I'm gonna
change that to an actual generated
texture and I'm gonna use noise in this
case
hey that's starting to look a bit funky
and we can start playing around with the
settings in here to make it look just
that little bit better so in my case I'm
gonna go and reach for the settings that
I had previously when it came to my
displacement and I'm having a look at
what I got set there before Oh No before
I did not choose noise I chose wood and
obviously this is through a lot of
iterations and playing around
I chose wood as my example that looks
like it's melted into a blob this is
fantastic and this is what I mean
at the very beginning when I was saying
about playing with stuff I did not
realize quite how well some of this
would turn out until I well I went to
wood obviously I would not have thought
about that before and looking at my
settings down here I've left this top
area as fine I've come down and I've
changed this to a saw pattern so it's
more yes and no rather than nice and
smooth changes which I think's much
better if we have a look here we get a
straight transition between the black
and the white which is fine that gives
us in this case a very sharp cutoff
between the two I changed it to band
noise and if we have scroll back up we
can see that it's a little bit more
wibbly-wobbly at this point and there
are a few other things that I've gone
through and I've changed so if we scroll
back down again
the final things that I have changed
here is the type of noise I've switched
from soft to hard which gives it a much
harder edge between the two now as you
can see here this doesn't look like
anything like what we would want it to
look at the moment this is just a
starting place what we now need to do is
go back to our displacement modifier and
make sure we've got the
right level of displacement applied and
what I have done is we've gone through
is this strength value oh let's set it
to zero and see what it looks like there
we go it looks like that and as we
increase this to one is going to morph
into this is that what we want probably
not it looks like we're going to have to
play around a little more now the
texture coordinate so I'm gonna use the
object itself that means that the object
determines how is that almost the same
as using generated previously so the
object is going to determine how this
texture is applied to itself so once
again I'm going to come in and go in and
out no change there let's change the mid
level up to one there we go
that's the sort of rusting away effect
that I probably want to go for here and
now let's change the strength back to
zero so it's nothing and then we can do
a step up now we don't need to see these
deep finer detail rust here so I'm gonna
go shift Zed and just have a look at the
underlying mesh and how its distorting
so you can see it's wasting away here
and by the time we get to point six you
can see that's actually pushing it
through itself so we don't need to go
that far in this case we're going to use
the strength and probably end up going
to maybe this level here point five
let's think about now animating that so
we've got a start and an end point for a
lot of our of our items here this is
going to be the end point this is going
to be the start point we might as well
animate it between those two points now
I'm going to do this simply on the time
line and of course all of this can be
refined and refined and refined in fact
the one you saw at the very beginning
did take several hours of tweaking
admittedly I was having a lot of fun at
the time need to take several hours of
tweaking to really get it exactly how I
wanted it to and of course trying to
recreate that and well it will just be a
different rusty pipe this time so let's
pick our own I've got two timelines here
now that's good going so let's pick our
start point in this case frame 1 and I'm
going to key in the strength at 0 and
I'm going to just hover over strength
and press the i key
that is now keyed in this is the great
thing you can animate anything in
blender and then finally we need to
decide how many frames this is going to
last over I'm gonna go to 120 in total
so I'm gonna go to frame 120 and then
key in the final frame so strength here
is going to be at 1 nope no what did we
say point 5 so it's key in point 5 and
press the i key and now what we can see
is as we start and play through we can
see it's wasting away how cool is that
and now we can do the same thing but in
the node editor now this is where we're
going to have to be careful and have the
beginning and end in mind so the
beginning I don't want it looking rusty
in the beginning at all so we need to
find the right node settings that it
looks like it clean well just read
essentially so I'm gonna go to my node
editor and at this point I think the
only thing that's controlling this is
the factor between these two so in this
case we need to decide how we're
branching out these two here how we're
changing between these two colors so
we're gonna be changing something here
and there are several ways we can go
ahead and do this we could we could
animate the position of these items here
so we could push I think it's the black
all the way through how does this need
to look for oh that's oh I like that so
yes we can move these things about so at
the moment it looks like we need a
hundred percent black in order for it to
work as we would expect it to and that's
come out and back in again
and we've still got a little bit of
displacement coming in here that we
don't want so we need to think about
think about more than one thing at this
point in time so we need to think about
this one and this one down here so let's
make sure that there is no defamation at
all and it's totally smooth so that
looks totally smooth but it looks like
we've got these in the wrong way and
looks like I need it to be a hundred
percent black in this case or almost
there let's just say for argument's sake
and there we go we've got that so I'm
gonna set that position I'm going to
key that in whilst I'm on frame one make
sure you are on frame one when you
decide to key things it
so I've keyed in the position of both of
those elements now as this changes as it
gets rusty towards the end and looks
horrible like this what we can then do
is say well we also wants it looking
really rusty so we've moved two things
here we've moved the position of zero
and the position of one now it is
important that you key in the starting
position on both of the things you're
about to change
so we've keyed in the position of number
one there's black marker but we've not
keyed in the position of zero so let's
make sure we put key that in as well now
we can go ahead to the end of our
animation and say well by the end of the
animation it's going to be completely
rusty so both of these will have moved
across and of course this is controlling
more than just the color is changing how
rough things are and it's feeding in to
how the actual material itself is
getting rusty and it's defamation so
there we go we've shifted that across
I'm going to key that in so I think both
1 &amp;amp; 2 are keyed in there we go 1 &amp;amp; 2 is
0 &amp;amp; 1 in this case now the next thing we
need to do is think about this next
color ramp down here so we have it
starting position of number 0 let's go
to 1 and key that in let's go to the end
and then we think about how we want that
to look so if we go ahead and or let's
say shift this down to there what do we
have it looks pretty rusty let's shift
autumn having issues clicking it oh I
think that's looking pretty good
let's just go shift and said over in the
3d viewport hi there we go you see how
that's changed that's why it's important
to come over and shift-click and you
shift and said to get it working so we
need it more this way that's quite bumpy
in fact we could pro we could probably
leave it like that but let's just see if
we can get it looking that little bit
better
it looks quite spiky at the moment
and now this is a great way of just
testing this I'm gonna go and save my
work first and then I'm going to render
it out again
I wouldn't recommend over being a bit
overzealous when it comes to rendering
but what we do need to make sure is
anything that we think is going to
happen actually happens when we go ahead
and render so something is not happening
here why is this still totally smooth
yet in the viewport it looks all bumpy
like this ah problem to be honest I
don't know I've probably missed
something as we've gone along so we've
got a displacement of both over on the
material settings of that that feels
fine there it could be the fact that
we've not keep that in yet so let's go
in and go to the node editor and key in
that position that is a bit extreme and
they both at one they do look like
they're both at one let's just keep that
in because I think that probably is
what's going on there and let's just
render that out again we can see it's a
much quicker to render in width we can
see that's much quicker to render when
we've got the GPU rendering okay so
we've got material here if we've got the
right material I think we have yes and
the displacement isn't rendering so in
the render settings do we have
experiments or rendering turned on we
have excellent now I'm going to change
this to CPU for a moment just to see if
there's an issue with how it's set up
I do love problem solving on a live
video it's always great let's just see
what happens at this point now notice
it's also changed over here as well in
the viewport so it's just come back and
re-enabled GPU there is something funny
going on and we will get to the bottom
of it so it has decided to render
smoothly again let's go to our node
editor and see what's going on here so
we've got everything set up here we've
got well let's just see what it looks
like when we just look at this color
ramp here let's make sure we are in
rendered mode so this color ramp here is
all black at the moment which basically
means no displacement that's not what we
want so this black value has been
brought up far too far let's come back
in and go through that looks much better
so we just moved that black value far
too far there make sure we're on the end
and key that in and the annoying thing
there was the viewport wasn't actually
updating and showing us or what the
actual issue was and that in itself is
painful it really is so now hopefully
when we go ahead and render what we
should see oh we're still rendering with
the CPU didn't want that to happen now
when we go ahead and render all being
well we should end up with it being
bumpy which it is that's great and now
we need to go back to our node editor
and just make sure everything is back in
place so I'm going to shift ctrl shift
select my principle shader that looks
fine there excellent finally we just
need to test the beginning and end and
make sure they're working fine so I'm
gonna save my work I'm gonna go and open
up the uv/image editor and I'm gonna
make sure that we're on slots one so on
the header bar for the uv/image editor
make sure you're in slot one and go
ahead to the beginning of your scene and
press f12 to render it or you can go to
the menu here render image and this will
give us an idea of what it looks like at
the very beginning excellent so we've
got how it's gonna look at the beginning
and that's lovely and shiny now the
reason why we're doing it like this is
simply because rendering an animation is
going to take a long time to do so I'm
gonna go to frame 60 here and I'll go to
slot 2 and then I'm going to go render
my image and this will give me an idea
of what it's going to look like half way
through now hopefully I have it does
look a bit odd it looks a bit spikey so
there may be more refinements to do but
I'm happy with how it's turning out so
far just as an experimentation there
nothing else and again you can iterate
this and go no no I don't want it to act
like that I want it to act like this so
here we go starting to deform now you
might want to leave the deformation
until after it's gone completely rusty
that's what I did in my
original so I keyed in all of the
defamation how it was changing how that
texture of the strength in the
displacement modifier when we're
animating this I did not change that
until after it started going completely
rusty I might do that in a moment on
this one as well finally I'm gonna go to
my final frame go to slot 3 and just
render that out as well and the good
thing about doing this is you've got a
good idea of its start middle and end
position now you may in fact want to
just use a different texture when it
comes to showing blender how you want it
to deform now this is a totally
different look as before it looks like
something's growing on it tempted to
change that to a green as there is some
sort of alien fungus or just fungus who
knows anyway so that looks pretty good
that that looks like a good starting and
end position now one of the things that
I would really recommend when you're
working with this type of project where
you know that rendering is gonna take at
least 30 seconds a frame 120 frames you
know that's a long time to wait well
that's gonna be there's gonna be an hour
isn't it so I don't want to wait for an
hour but I do want to have an idea of
how this is going to animate through now
I can switch between slot 1 slot 2 and
slot 3 and go okay that looks pretty
cool but how does it look when it's
animated so the final thing here is
about outputting now there are several
several schools of thought when it comes
to animating outputs in general as I'm
just producing something really quick to
have a look at I will go to my render
properties and scroll down and my output
folder I'm gonna set that as something
where I can actually reach like the
desktop and then I'm going to change the
file type to a ffmpeg video going down
to the encoding I'm gonna set it so it's
presets here I'm gonna use h.264 in mp4
which is absolutely fine I'm gonna leave
everything else as default because this
is just a test run I don't really care
if it's blocky or not as perfect as it
could be or even in this case if it's
gonna crash midway through the render
because I can always click and render
again however what I will do at this
point is just have a look at the
resolution I want a rough idea of how
this is going to look not a detailed
look a detailed look I've done with
these renders if you're I'm happy with
this bit if I'm happy with the others
then I'm happy and good to go but what I
don't want it to wait an eon so I'm
gonna knock this down to 25% of 1080 now
this is going to look really ropey in
terms of a quality's perspective but
it's gonna be quicker to render so I'm
gonna go ahead now I'm gonna save my
work before I go ahead and render and
what I need to do is render my animation
now to make things just a little bit
more interesting I'm gonna do what I
said earlier and I'm gonna clear my
keyframes for the for the actual
displacement I'm gonna start at frame 60
where it starts displacing and then go
all the way to 0.5 so it changes a bit
more naturally because that the matte it
shouldn't be deforming till it's quite
rusty and I'm going to make sure I key
in a strength of 0 at that point and
then we've also got a strength of 0 here
so it's gonna stay at 0 until it comes
out that's easier than removing all the
keyframes and re adding them afterwards
I'm gonna make sure if once again save
my work now I'm not gonna render it on
this computer because it's gonna take an
eon I'm gonna go render it on my desktop
which has a bit of a faster GPU in it
and I'll be back in a few minutes and
here we go I've slowed this down so we
can really explore what's happening it's
not particularly high-res but we've got
a glossy start and then we can see it
slowly rusts away now we put in that key
halfway through so it didn't start
deforming until then and we can see it's
just rusting away and bubbling and
actually in many ways I have I like this
one because had a bit more thought to it
than our original one and of course here
it is now at full speed boom done and
there we go thank you for staying with
me throughout this tutorial I really
hope you've learnt lots now
unfortunately we can't always cover
everything that we want to cover in a
tutorial like this this is essentially
glossing over our a material setup our
modeling and everything else if you do
want to
much more about blender please do join
me over on my udemy course where you can
learn far far more than what I can
possibly put in a short tutorial like
this take care and I will see you over
there
