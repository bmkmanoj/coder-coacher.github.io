learning how to code and learning the
best programming language you can learn
today which is the go programming
language and we're gonna actually start
coding now we talked a little bit about
why you might want to choose go and how
it has amazing credentials it's the
highest paying programming language in
America and it's the best programming
language in the world according not only
to myself but also to Google and also to
Rob hi Kim Thompson - Robert grassman or
the luminaries in computer science who
helped to build it so why you might want
to learn to code and why choose the go
programming language and how coding is
super cool and it's a super cool
community of hard-working creative
innovative intelligent people who have
superpowers and destroy industries and
create new industries and then also do
this amazing party called Burning Man
every year and and so like how you get
to become a part of that community and
gain superpowers yourself how it pays
super well and and then we also talked
about what it takes to be successful on
your journey and learning how to code
which is you got to have that that fight
that positive attitude that persistence
and that grit and not give up and if you
plant the right seeds today you're gonna
harvest a great crop tomorrow and then
we saw how computers work and and we
looked at like you know circuits and
switches interchangeable words and how
there's coding schemes so the porch
light on off come trick or treat go away
that whole thing and then we saw a kind
of fast-forward video for more advanced
people about downloading and installing
go on your computer and using an editor
and how you know goal and or vs code are
really to me the two best choices that
are out there of course you could do it
with other stuff a lot of vim people out
there if you're all the way up there but
but like that editor and then getting it
installed and confine configuring your
environment variables with your go path
pointing to your workspace where you
have a bin package and source and then
source is where you keep all your source
code and its namespace by domain you
named repo usually that's the way it
works you should only have one go
path work space on your entire machine
alright so we learned all that and now
we're gonna start to learn how to code
and I'm just looking through the outline
here for my course and this course is a
new course i i've created and it's gonna
be on udemy soon currently on udemy my
course is the course from two years ago
but this new outline i'm super excited
about it and i'll have this course up
there soon maybe by the time you're
watching this video it's already up
there
alright so we're gonna take a look here
at doing a basic hello world and and
we're gonna also see a short declaration
operator so we're gonna go to the golang
playground and the go leg playground is
a place where we could write go code and
the first thing we're gonna see is a
hello world and so we already have that
right here you know hello world and so
we have hello world i'm just going to
format that and run it and it prints it
out so here's the code and then here is
the results of the that code when i run
it and so at the golang playground
there's a couple of buttons up here this
button allows me to share this code so i
could copy that and i could put it on
social media or i could share it with
somebody and they could see the code
that i wrote here and and by and large
this going playground we could do like
three-fourths of this course at the go
leg playground but then when we get into
more complex topics like concurrency and
doing parallel computing parallel
processing and having multiple threads
multiple go routines running on
different CPUs only one go routine can
run at the playground here so we hit
some limitations using the playground
about 3/4 of the way through this course
but for the beginning it's great super
easy is we're up and running so sharing
allows us to share code if we have a
check next to imports we'll bring in
import so i'm gonna tell you what
imports are here right so if I don't
have that checked and then I hit format
nothing happen but if I have it checked
I hit format it brought in my import and
so we'll look at what an import is in a
second so formatting will format your
code in an idiomatic way meaning
everybody's code on your
programming team will look exactly the
same when you your code your
format your code and so there's a tool
at the command line and you could
integrate it into your editors when you
start writing code with a team but he
that to tool is always gonna format go
code in the exact same way so go is
specific about your code needs to look a
certain way and in format will format it
like that and if you have this check
mark here it also brings in your imports
at the playground and finally run runs
your code and so let's just take a look
at this and understand what's happening
in this HelloWorld program so the entry
point for your your for this code to run
is it package main will eventually get
to the point where we write code that we
could have many different packages in
our code and a package is kind of like
folders where you store different stuff
in different folders and so this is
package main and your program is always
going to start in package main and it's
also going to it's going to go to
package main and then enter func main
and so that's the entry point and the X
exit point for your program your program
starts here and when it leaves func main
your programs over and in between here
we could do all kinds of stuff and
launch all kinds of other processes and
so that's the entry point though package
main funk make and so every every
program needs to have package main and a
func main a func main so the simple
program has that and when you write
stuff in your editor you could have
different packages that you pull in so
there's a bunch of packages already
built into something called a standard
library and so the standard library if
we go to golang.org and and we go to
documents and then we look we have
installing go learning go tour of go how
to write go code effective go this is a
really important document frequently
asked questions the go wiki package
documentation we'll come back to that
one second command documentation
language specification so the two most
important documents here are effective
go and then also language specification
now language specification the people
who created the go programming language
are masters masters
computer science and so they suffer no
fools like they wrote things for you
know everybody to figure out and
understand and you know they wrote it
they didn't they they wrote it like
haikus very brief wasting no words every
word counts and so the language spec
actually takes a little bit of time to
understand even if you have a strong
background in computer science that said
you know what you need is a good teacher
to introduce you to the different parts
I was fortunate that I had a mentor and
William Kennedy Bill Kennedy who's an
amazing go programmer and trainer and so
if you ever you know get an opportunity
to go to any of his courses which he
offers at different places around the
world highly recommend Bill Kennedy but
you know he helped introduce me to all
this but don't don't be put off if you
read the language spec you know like
what is all this stuff just take my
course take bill's course and everything
will be good you'll you'll get
introduced to we show you how to read it
and make sense of it first though we're
gonna go to package documentation here
and so in here are all these different
packages of code which we could use and
this gives you an idea if you have a
computer science background of all the
different stuff that you could start to
do like this is pre-written code that we
could use in our programs and one of the
one of the packages is funked and so
here's the funked the funked package and
then it describes a package and
everything it could do and when you come
down here to the index you can see one
of the things we had was print line
funked print line and so print line and
you'll learn through my course and maybe
through these videos we'll see how far I
get and just making a bunch of YouTube
videos but here in pumped print line you
could go and you can see from package
bumps we're importing package font and
from practive package font we want to
call print line right and so that's
print line right there and so we're
calling this function so function is
just a chunk a package is a bunch of
different pieces of code which we could
use and inside a package are a bunch of
functions and those functions are
does this function it does that function
this function right here allows us to
print and it also inserts a new line so
it's print line so prints and then it
adds a new line after a printed func
print right this is a function that
prints doesn't add a new line after it's
printed and so these functions give us
functionality and they're all kept in a
package with a bunch of functions
related to formatting printing right
and so funked print line we call that
function and here what this means
they'll take an unlimited vary attic
parameter unlimited number of arguments
of any type meaning we could pass it a
bunch of different stuff so here in our
code we've passed in hello world but I
could also pass in 42 and I could also
pass in you know James Bond right I pass
all that in and then I run it and it
printed all of that and and it printed
all that because here this function
allows a very attic parameter unlimited
a number of arguments of any type and
then if I wanted to it has some returns
so the number of bytes written and
whether or not there are any errors you
do not need to catch that return if you
don't want to those returns you don't
need to catch them go does have multiple
returns so that's an introduction to
hello world and understanding a little
bit about like what this stuff you know
show you know what what it is what what
all this is right here and we have
package mean which is where you're you
know program is going to start and the
entry point is inside func main and when
you leave func me and your programs over
and we saw how import we saw how all
these buttons work and we saw how this
is importing package funked and in
package flump we're calling that
function which allows us to print
something out all right so that's like
the first step and learning to code and
you can just put different things in
there numbers or quotes and separate
them by commas and you could have them
print out and if I wanted to share this
with you I'd just grab it copy it and
send it to you yeah baby
you ran your first program put something
in there run it and I'll see in the next
