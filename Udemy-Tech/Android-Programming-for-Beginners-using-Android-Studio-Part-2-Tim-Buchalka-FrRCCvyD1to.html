a bit bigger you can see that by default
so Android studio has made the image
quite small and actually looking over
here in the layout width it's really
only set to 37 DP and incidentally will
be talking in future videos what this DP
stands for if you are seeing something
similar on your Android studio screen or
get you to change this to 3/8 for DP
press ENTER and change this one to 480
DP by doing that you can see we've
dramatically increased the size of the
image the other thing that I want to
draw attention to before we get to our
first mini challenge is the scale type
property over here you notice when I
click it we've got several options so
you'll be wanting to check and have a
look at this once I give you some
information on the first challenge so
yes it's challenge time so the idea of
the challenges in this course is to help
you understand a particular concept a
bit better by getting you to actually go
into Android studio and try and solve a
particular problem or in this case a
challenge so we're gonna start off
simply then as we go through the course
we'll try and build on the complexities
of these challenges to really challenge
you and you'll come out of this course
here with a much better understanding of
Android studio and becoming a better
Android developer in the process so here
is the first challenge so I just showed
you a short while ago the Scout type
drop-down box so I'd like you to
experiment with that box and in
particular work out what they do when
you select them on the image of you you
don't need to worry about metrics which
was one of the options in the drop-down
list because you can't really see what
that's doing in the designer but
certainly try the other ones now just to
help you work out what's happening the
original image if you recall was 640 by
480 and the image view that we've put
that into is 384 by 480 and you saw me
just change it to those dimensions just
a short while ago so that's all your
many challenges to figure out the scale
type so they have a look at them I'll
just see what
they do and check your answers by
searching online for image view scale
type you know if your search results
throw up a developer.android.com website
then that should be the first site that
you check and they will be asking you
throughout this course
to often go to google and search for
things and the developer.android.com
website is the site of Google's official
Android documentation and that would be
where you get the definitive word on
anything Android related so in other
words that would be the first site you
would generally go to if you're looking
up some aspect of Android development
but with that said there are lots of
other websites on the internet that do
provide useful information or add extra
pieces of information to Google's
documentation so you would certainly
want to check other sites from time to
time as well so that's it to start now
time to go ahead and do this challenge
so pause the video here now try up the
challenge as I mentioned and when you're
ready to come back start the video
playing again and then I'll go through
and help you with the challenge pause
the video now
okay so how did you get on did you have
a good play with the various scale types
we're going to go through those shortly
to see what they do but the other thing
I want to just draw your attention to
was the website so we're going to open
up a browser and I'm going to do what I
suggested you to do is go to google and
then to type in image view scale type
and notice when I did that the first
website that came up was a
developer.android.com website yes I
mentioned that's the generally the
definitive first site to go to for
anything Android related so I'm going to
click on that and that gives you some
very useful information on in this case
the scale type property as it relates to
an image view see what the various
options there and what they do
so hopefully you looked at that and that
gave you a bit of an idea on the
documentation and what I suggest you do
anytime that you're stuck or you're
unsure do you make sure you do some
Google searches because that's really
how you become a great Android developer
or even just a developer in general good
developers know how to use a search
engine and often check the search
engines for answers because the answers
are usually out there on the Internet
okay so let's have a look now we've seen
the documentation but let's go back and
have a bit of a play with these various
scout types to see what they do so I've
got the image selected so we've got at
the moment asked our top on none and
that would obviously mean that it's not
doing anything and I mentioned metrics
that's a bit of a tricky one here and it
uses a metrics to scale the image but
you can't define a metrics here you have
to do that in code and it's used to
allow the image to be resized in code
when the user pinches it in or out but
obviously at this point in the course
we're not at that point of writing that
code so we're going to leave that one
for now
now fit X Y and if we click on that you
notice that the image is then scaled in
both directions independently and so you
can see that it was stretched vertically
in this case because it was already
stretched as far as it could go
horizontally the aspect ratio wasn't
maintained so the ball in the photo is
obviously not circular now as it was
before and at the sizes were using here
it resembles
probably more an Aussie Rules football
or rugby ball on its hand that's what
fit XY does to an image the next one is
fit start and click on that and here the
aspect ratio of the image is maintained
so both axes are stretched or shrunk by
the same amount and the image is
positioned at the top left of the image
view so clearly you can see it is a
soccer ball and it hasn't been stretched
as fit XY did it so that's a fit start
fit centre you'll find that tell that's
very similar to fit start but the only
difference there is that the resulting
in which is centered as you can see in
the centre of the image view and now
that I've done that you can probably
guess what the fit end does again much
like fit start but the image is lined up
at the bottom right of the image view
the next one Center now Center actually
centers the image in the image view but
it's not scaled and so the edges it has
cropped off as if the image was too
large so what we see a week or what we
get rather is the full height of the
image
remembering that the image was 640 by
480
but our image view is only three eight
four by 480 so we get that full height
of the image but we lose part of the
image off the right-hand edge as a
result of that okay and sent a crop now
this scale was the image maintaining the
aspect ratio but we'll make sure that at
least one dimension is at least equal to
the corresponding dimension of the image
view now because the height of this
current image is the same as the height
of the image view it actually behaves
the same as centre so that's why you
didn't see anything changed if the image
was a lot narrower then it would have
scaled up and we would lose part of the
image at the top and the bottom okay the
next one is the last one is Center
inside now in this case the image is
scaled maintaining the aspect ratio but
no side will be scaled larger than the
image view so what that results in is
the image being shrunk so that it says
Wireless the image view
I'll show a lot less hi in this case now
with our image view it's the same as fit
Center but with an image smaller than
the image view fit Center will actually
fill the image to fill fill in at least
one direction where a center and side
would leave space around the image so
that's that that's it in a nutshell it's
a good thing to experiment with and if
you do want to experiment further
consider creating images that are
smaller in both directions and smaller
and only one dimension we can test it
out without creating a new image by
making the containing image view smaller
now because I told you in the previous
video to have this turned on when we add
of the image there were some constraints
automatically added now I'm going to be
talking a little bit more about what
constraints are shortly but for now what
we want to do is you want to clear those
constraints and in terms of wondering
whether the constraints are that's these
things you can see up here at the top
and at the bottom so I'm going to come
up here we're gonna click on this button
which is the button to clear all
constraints look so you notice that they
disappeared from the screen so it wasn't
specifically necessary to do that for us
to continue but I follow those little
zippy indicators can obscure part of the
screen which we need to see when we
resize the image and we're about to do
that now and the other thing is that
auto-connect is also 1 at the moment so
that was the option being left on that
resulted in those constraints being
added to our image view when we dragged
it onto the screen and that's this
little button up here so what I'm going
to do is click that to turn that off so
you want to make sure that has got like
a dash through it now which tells us
that we've turned auto-connect off and
what that means is that no constraints
will be created as we move the image
don't do anything with it and we'll be
talking more about what I connect in
constraints in detail shortly but for
now let's just go ahead and resize the
image view so to resize that we just
move our mouse to the corner of the
image making sure that's selected and
notice there's a little black squares
and as I move the cursor there it
changes to a little sort of black line
there and I can hold down my left mouse
button and you can see the numbers now
showing there there's a 3/8 4 out of 4 8
and holding that down I'm gonna make it
smaller and notice how that's getting
smaller on both the horizontal side and
the vertical side they're gonna make
them at both about 160 560 and it
doesn't need to be perfect because once
I let go of the left mouse button you
can see that the image moves and what
I'm going to do then is I'm going to
drag it into the middle again like so
and if you wanted to be exactly 160 we
can just come over here to the layout
with and I can just type in 160 DP and
incidentally I'm gonna be talking more
about DP shortly so if you wonder what
that is
stay tuned we will get to that I'm gonna
press into there 160 DP that's a way to
make it exactly 160 DP now I'm pressing
return or enter there sometimes Android
studio does require you to press Enter
shouldn't need to do that so it might
just be that the preview version that
I'm using is doing that if you're
finding that the properties not updating
as you'd think it should be updating
just try typing whatever value want in
there and pressing enter and that tends
to fix it anyway okay so at this point
we've resized our image and we've learnt
a little bit about scale types let's
finish the video here now and then in
the next one what we're going to do is
start understanding what these
constraints are what they mean and how
to use them so I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
