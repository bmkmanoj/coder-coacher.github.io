tutorial today I will introduce you to
the Linux terminal and show you some of
its basic functionalities so in kali
linux terminal icon is located in the
upper left corner this black thing so
just click on it and there you go you
have the terminal up and running here by
default it opens up a root terminal in
Kali so if you want to usually people
want to configure it but if you want to
if you don't want to configure anything
else this is perfectly fine you don't
actually need to do anything else
however 99% of the time people will
configure the terminal to suit their own
needs and purposes for example I will
always almost always increase the font
size so that is it's clear and visible
and that I have a better overview of
what I am doing at the moment and it
also reduces eyestrain according to some
articles anyway so just go ahead and
right-click anywhere on the terminal
itself not on the bar but on the
terminal itself and then you have show
menu bar now we can see it here go ahead
and click on edit you can click on
profiles as well and create new profiles
here by just typing in by just clicking
on new giving it a name and then
configuring it in the preferences
however we're gonna be configuring the
default profile since there really is no
need to create any additional ones go
ahead and click on profile preferences
and here you have a great deal of
options one of the first ones that you
will see is that you can use a system
fixed width font so this is not good you
see this is very small you do need I
always need to change that if that's
fine for you you can keep it like that
but I always change it and I have mono
space 20 if you click on it you can
change the font size here if you wish
you can change the font that you're
using and that would be it as far as
this place is concerned you have some
other very simple options here it says
show menu bar by default in new
terminals
I generally ticket I think it's a good
idea since you always need to do
something like open up a new tab or
something of a kind but you don't need
to
you have the cursor shape here it says
block I beam underline just wanna show
you how it looks like you can view the
terminal as the changes are applied to
have a block and you have an underline I
prefer a block you can use whatever you
wish it will not affect you it will not
affect you in any in any technical sense
that is have title and command we don't
actually need to change anything there
you can change title if you wish we have
colors so I think that this color scheme
is appropriate and fitting for me but
you can change it any way you like you
can customize it to the point of extreme
you can change the text color the
background color you have the pallet
color color pallet here so you can do
whatever you want here you have built-in
schemes so it says white on black I can
say green on black or oops sorry
pencil you can say green on black does
it have blue on black black
oh this was bad I wouldn't be able to
work on this one so let's just leave it
at black on white on black sorry this is
the best color this is one of the best
color schemes I use a personally I use
on Fedora blue on black but I'm just
gonna leave it as it is here no need to
actually change anything now in
background there's an in there you have
three features here basically have solid
color like this one here that you are
seeing and you can you can choose a
background image we can download
anything you want from the internet
pretty much you can configure it to be
transparent or image background and also
you have the ability to have a transfer
transparent background and if you click
on transparent background it's pretty
much the same as having a background
image except in this case
excellent I'm just gonna configure it
transparency levels and that's pretty
good except in this case your background
image will be your desktop image pretty
much depending on where your terminal is
in scrolling there's an important
feature here it's scroll back so you
don't want to have 512 lines you want to
go ahead and click on unlimited unless
you're severely limited in terms of RAM
and unless you're typing in a large
amount of commands or something of a
kind but in any case it's better to have
unlimited especially in environment in
not only in environments such as these
but rather instead in cases such as
these you don't need to do anything here
in terms of compatibility I'm just gonna
go ahead and close this and I have
selected a transparent background and
you see this only works for a desktop
image it doesn't actually show icons or
anything of a kind if I open up my web
browser it's not gonna show it in the
background it's still gonna keep the
desktop background image so the desktop
wallpaper should you wish to call it so
there's a slight delay what it goes
about in the update but it's fine
doesn't bother us in the slightest bit
maybe I will change this later on during
the tutorial see how I like it but I
just wanted to give you an option so you
can do whatever you want with it in any
case you can go ahead and click on file
and open tab I'm just gonna go ahead and
open myself four tabs three new ones and
one that I already had so here you can
switch in between them it's very nice
there's no complications for example if
I press open up a new terminal
I got a click here and then I got a
click here and usually you're gonna have
I'm just want to show you what it's like
to have four of them so yeah this is not
actually manageable especially because
you don't know what you are doing on
which terminal people sometimes split
their screens into terminals I sometimes
do that it's very nice but we will deal
with that a bit later on when we get
into some serious stuff when we actually
need multiple terminals
but stabs it's tapping these tab tabbing
these terminals it's very nice
primarily because you can actually see
what you're doing on each one of them in
the Heather see these things that I'm
selecting that I'm clicking on now there
are headers of the terminal or so you
can call them and if I for example in
this terminal I'm gonna go ahead and say
I want you to go into home change
directory to home change the working
directory that is and if I change it
here to var and if I change it here to
far logs and if I want to go here to DMP
folder excellent so on each of these
tabs in their headers I can see where I
am so this this one it's home this one
is TMP I don't need to click on it to
know this one is log so I can know what
I'm doing in every particular terminal
and even though you can have a program
running or something like that it's
still gonna write it out in the header
and you're gonna get some extra
information there it's very nice very
useful and it's gonna help you out a lot
as we progress through this course and
as we get into more complicated stuff
anyway I just want to introduce you to
the Linux terminal we have done some
work with it before during the
installation of VirtualBox and
VirtualBox guest additions but basically
there I've just given you the command
and you're gonna basically just rewrite
it or copy/paste it and that's gonna be
it but here I will in the follow-up
tutorial actually I will start
explaining the fundamental Linux
terminal commands the most common ones
the basic ones and there you will be
able to see the logic of things and how
this Linux terminal works and functions
because once you actually learn that it
gives you a huge amount of power all the
power of the operating system rests on
its terminal because it's a direct
interface to the kernel of the system
and it's a lot faster than the graphical
interface now one more key note that I
would like to make here once I teach you
how to use the little
germinal and once you get into habit of
typing in commands you can use them for
a wide variety of purposes you not not
necessarily need to use these things for
pen testing or something like that you
can use these commands for network
administration or you can use them in
order to troubleshoot problems with the
system and so on and so forth so you get
a you get a far wider spectrum of
options in terms of jobs or something of
a kind as opposed to just learning
something that you can only use for pen
testing and nothing else in any case I
bid you farewell and I hope to see you
in the next tutorial hello everybody and
welcome to this tutorial today I will go
over a few basic commands which you will
need in order to follow this course
through now these basic commands there
are four term there they're used in
order to navigate within the terminal or
through the file system to figure out
where you are at the moment to copy
things move things get listings of files
folders see the contents remove them
change the change the ownership of files
or change the modes of files you will
see shortly what I mean so first off we
have CD which is changed directory so if
I just type in CD slash home I am going
to navigate over to my home directory
let's see these stands for change
directory as I said before you are
literally changing through your working
directory if you type in a CD double dot
you date you are you will always go one
step back so double dot is always the
previous folder a bit of a shortcut
there you will use it fairly often next
up we have LS LS shows you the listing
of the current folder contents but you
can also use LS slash for example home
and you get the listing of a specified
folder as well typing LS in and of its
own will give you the listing of the
current folder as opposed to typing LS
and then a path to a folder
we'll give you a listing of a specified
folder in addition to that you also have
LS dash L which will give you a long
listing so it will tell you who the who
the owners are the size that they the
type the permissions and so on and so
forth however one of the more common
usages of LS is - L a to show the hidden
files as well you might notice that I am
not using ll like I was using like I
generally use in Fedora
because bash ll command not found I
guess I could install it here as well
but it doesn't really matter it performs
fairly similar function as LS does but
it's a bit faster to type in so I'm just
gonna go ahead and clear this next up is
PWD which prints working directory and
you might find this a bit confusing but
slash in all UNIX unix-like system it
simply refers to the root directory to
the beginning to the root directory so
you remain from where or where all the
files are located and from where
everything begins so to say but let me
just make it a bit clearer I'm gonna
navigate over at home and then do PWD
you can see that I am in home at the
moment so print working directory does
exactly what the name itself says it
prints your current working directory
next up we have our CP command which we
already have used in order to copy
VirtualBox guest additions from one
place to another fairly simple you type
in CP path - let's not do it like that
let's do a real example so if I for
example go ahead and type in CP VBox
guest additions Linux edition sorry dot
run and if I let's say want to copy it
to somewhere let's say that I wish to
copy it to var I will delete of course
and I'll show you how to do that as well
but it's fairly simple and if I want
like sir
well I don't want to recursion I just
want to verbosity
there you go so CP v ba you specify what
you want to copy and where you want to
copy it to keep in mind that you could
have actually typed in here a folder a
full path to this VirtualBox guest
additions start run you didn't actually
need to be in the home directory and
this - V option gives us this so it
tells us what was copied we're very
useful option let me just show you what
would happen if I didn't have that oops
just like this nothing there is no
output or anything of a kind now this is
this is fairly simple when you have one
very small file and you don't really
care but when you have a large file
let's say 20 gigabytes or so and you are
copying it you're just gonna have a
blank screen below nothing will be
happening you will not be able to figure
out that the cop where did the copying
process is going on or whether it has
actually crashed bug or something of a
kind they'll just pass the - - V option
which is always useful to have simply
because the Machine actually tells you
what it is doing now you might have
noticed that all of these commands more
or less they have their own arguments
which can be passed to them in order to
modify what the command does you can
view a listing of these arguments you do
not need to memorize them all so just
let's let's take an example of CP I'm
gonna - OH - - help so this is a
universal way of getting help on a
particular subject within the terminal
you type in the command space - - he'll
press ENTER and you get a listing of
possibilities so I know it looks a bit
messy and a bit difficult to see but you
don't actually need to look at all of
these things here you just scroll
upwards and there you go you can see all
the arguments there are listed clearly
here you have the argument here and then
you have an explanation of what that
argument does over the for the time
being you're not going to be able to
memorize all of these but over the time
you as you practice more
and as you started doing and as you
start actually using these commands you
will be remembering more and more and
more and more without actually wishing
it basically will be caching the
information so to say anyway over here
in the upper in the upper part of this
help menu you'll get usage so in the
usage you get the format where the
syntax of the command
so basically CPE you pass an option and
then you specify you specify your source
and destination very simple no problems
there this is universal for all of the
commands you can always use the help
menu however in addition to the help
menu you also have man pages so if I
type in man and I'm gonna use a command
PWD man pages on PWD basically give me a
download of information and you can see
ok obviously it gives you the name it's
called synopsis here but basically the
syntax of the command you get a
description
full description of what the command
does full description of the arguments
you even get the order who actually
wrote it some notes copyright and some
references to something else as well
this is a very short man page because
PWD is a very short command and a very
basic command but for example if I was
to type in man
guru sorry grep you can see that the man
page is a lot bigger as I just scrolling
down and it seems to be on and grep is a
multi-purpose command which I will show
to you in a moment but I just wanted to
tell you but I just wanted to show you
the difference between a basic and a
more complex command let me just go
ahead and clear the screen next up we
have moved so MV that will cause a
folder to move this is how you rename
folders to or files so just go ahead and
navigate over to
var where I have actually copied this
file yes excellent so if I say move VBox
guest additions
olynyk's additions I can move it either
to some different folder under some
different name or I can just rename it
within my current folder so if I just
type it in I don't know let's let's
let's go ran sorry random is not so
random I'm just gonna rename it to death
and say dot run you can put whatever
extension you want of course it won't
function the same but I am just showing
you the way of renaming a file and if I
do LS again you see that this is that V
box the next additions dot run has been
successfully renamed to random is not so
random dot run I can also do this I can
for example move and them is not so
random to my home directory and if I do
LS and then specify a path to my home
directory and press Enter you can see
that I have actually moved it here but
unlike the copy command
it doesn't retain the original within
where the destination wherever that
destination
wherever the source might have been so
once you move it it's gone from the
distant from the source folder however
it's gonna appear in the destination one
also a tricky way when you delete
something with move when you move
something over something else it's so
difficult to recover if not impossible
also be very careful with deleting files
in Linux cuz once you delete them from
the terminal it's near its next I mean
you will not be able to recover them
basically it there are some complex
procedures that might give you the
fraction of what you wanted to recover
but if you remove it from the terminal
it's very very very difficult it's not
like Windows or something of a kind when
you delete something in Windows you can
always recover it
basically didn't even delete it
nonetheless something else you just
don't see it but here when you delete
something it's gone permanently so take
great caution take great care but don't
be afraid I mean over the time over a
certain period of time these things
become second nature to you and you will
work you will take it into consideration
without even thinking about it so I'll
just go ahead and clear the screen next
up we have cat now cat gives us a little
well let me show you what kept us rent
ups I cannot recap the random ah because
it's not there of course so let's just
navigate over at home and let's cat
random is not so random
you see what it does it actually shows
you the listing off this is a bit of a
longer file so it shows you all the
entire contents of that file whatever
that might be not not for this content
is not pretty at all you can't basically
read it like this but doesn't matter
let's just create another company let's
just create another another file and I'm
just gonna cat it
so nano is my favorite text editor from
the terminal you will need to learn how
to use terminal text editors because
primarily you don't want to be switching
back and forth between GUI text editors
and working on something in the terminal
it's extremely time consuming and plus
here on Kali Linux you can actually edit
things with route however if you are for
example using some other distribution or
something or what kind most of the GUI
text editors will not be you will not be
able to run them as route you will get
an error message so that can be a bit
problematic that's why you should always
learn how to use text editors that are
terminal text editors so just type in
Nano and type in the name of the file
that you wish to create so for example
I'm just gonna go ahead and type in yes
this is gonna be a test file no need to
give it any extensions or anything of a
kind and there we go now we are in the
Nano text editor so he
I can for example write some text some
random text goes here let's just do that
okay so you have a wide variety of
options down here well maybe not a wide
variety but certainly a good amount so
country this is this caret sine X it
simply means control X so if you press
control X you're gonna exit control o
right out that's basically save you
don't need this where is is basically
the weight search things so control V
search and know let's say random press
enter and there you go it's gonna point
to random it's going to find it no
problems previous page don't need that
next page you're not gonna be that
engaged with it so cut text is also very
nice because it allows you to actually
remove large portions of text at a
relatively fast rate so if I just say
ctrl K it's gonna remove the current
line where the cursor is not what you
have selected with your mouse just so
you know let me just bring that back and
I'm just gonna go ahead and continue
talking about this in part two in the
follow up tutorial until then I bid you
farewell hello everybody and welcome to
part 2 of this tutorial and now let's go
ahead and save the file
so press ctrl o to write the dual output
to the file it says fire filename to
right you can actually modify it here so
you can type in some letters or whatever
you want you can change the name here or
you can even change the extension the
extension if you want but there is no
need for the time being I'm just gonna
go ahead and save it this test just
press Enter there you go it says wrote
one-line ctrl X to exit there we go
clear the screen and now I'm going to
use cat command to get a listing of this
particular file which is far more
reasonable than the previous one which
you couldn't read the cat command by the
way was functioning properly but it was
mostly a binary file
therefore I mean it gave you a listing
but you couldn't really read anything
from it so let's just go ahead and type
in cat test and there we go it says some
random text goes here that is the text
that we have typed into the typed into
the text file and test file and you can
cat it like this these things are very
good especially with files that you want
to make sure not you wanna you do not
want to change them in any way and you
don't want to make any accidental
changes or anything of a kind and you
want to quickly see what is located
within that file there is another way of
doing this basically it's a less and
let's go ahead and navigate over to Etsy
apt LS and here we have plenty of files
to work with so let's just take sources
dot list as an example here so if I do
cat source sources dot list I'm gonna
get everything that is within that file
as before and it's gonna be listed in my
terminal here there to stay it's not
gonna go away anywhere but there is
another command which I can use let me
just go ahead and clear the screen it is
called less and if I type in less
sources dot list I'm gonna be prompted
with a new tab where I can actually view
things here not a new terminal tab but a
new workspace within that within the
terminal itself and when I press Q it's
gonna exit and nothing will be displayed
here so very nice in terms of being neat
and organized and so on and so forth so
less and cat very nice things but you
can use for example cat sources dot list
and then the command that I have
previously mentioned is grep grep means
basically you pull something you grab
something from something else
now here's what I mean by it you type in
cat sources that list and you type in a
pipe this symbol here it's called a pipe
which basically states whatever the
output of this is pipe it to do whatever
to whatever command comes here so I'm
just gonna type in
and let's say I want to type in SR C
press ENTER excellent so it will only
print lines that have SR C in them
Linux is case sensitive so when you are
graphing it's gonna check whether it's
gonna check the case of the letters
whether it's lowercase or not but you
can you can give it an ignore case you
can type in like this - I mean it's
ignore case oops I bad - all right -
ignore the case you're gonna get the
same output because there are no
different things within this file but
you get you get the general idea so this
is how you would use cat with grep in
order to pull things out of a file very
important this is a huge part of the
Linux terminal filtering through text
files primarily because we're gonna be
doing large network scans and we will
want to create files from which we will
be able to pool useful information which
we will later in turn pass to other
tools to do something with anyway let me
just go ahead and clear the screen for
the time being you also have echo so
echo and I give it the quotation marks
open let's say I am Alive close
quotation marks and it will echo these
words it literally is an echo you type
something into it and it echoes them
here let's just go back to the home
directory now get a listing and use
exactly the same command echo live by
the way you can scroll through the
previous commands by using arrow keys so
up and up there using the up arrow key
and down arrow key you can scroll back
through previous commands and you don't
need to retype them so I am alive and
I'm going to insert this so I'm gonna
use a greater than sign and type in test
so this will echo I am Alive into test
and if I do less I'm gonna use cat test
you see it has replaced the contents of
the test which was some random text goes
here into I am alive
very nice command to have you can change
variable names variable values with deco
and so on and so forth we will use this
a bit more as we progress through the
course and I don't really want to get in
in depth here primarily because later on
when we have clear examples that
directly relate to what we are doing at
the moment which is basically pen
testing then you will see more advanced
usage of pretty much all of these
commands especially grep we have
touch-touch is a quick way to create
files so for example I can do touch and
I can save file one file to file 3 press
enter LS and you see it has immediately
created three files
so touch is a very quick method of but
gone a bit over my head there anyway
touch is a very quick way of creating
any amount of files that you wish and
you can specify folder paths you can
create this file on home this one in var
this point in var log and so on and so
forth anyway down below you have m'kay
dear so if I go ahead and type in m'kay
dear its make directory so you are
making some sort of a directory let's
say this the name of this directory will
be place to be if I get LS there we go
it states that this that this uh that
this file is actually a directory which
is a place to be I can even navigate to
it and say place to be LS there is
nothing in it but get the idea you can
make directories in such a fashion now
CH own if I type CH own it allows you to
change the ownership of a particular
file now since we only have a single
user here which is rude there isn't
really any point in doing so unless we
create some of the new users but we're
not gonna do that as we don't need them
but just show you how this would work
for example if you were if the owner of
a file was not root and if you wanted to
change
to route he would do the following so CH
own and then you would type the name the
username : the user group so the user
group and the user name are usually the
same on your home PCs unless you're in
some bigger server or something like
that and then you just specified the
name of the file I don't know you can
type in test there we go so it will
change it will effectively change the
ownership of file test to the username
root who is from the user group root
root and if I do LS la you can see here
it states who the who the owners are and
which groups actually own the files as
well if I clear the screen there is
another there is another more used
command
it's called CH mode and this command
allows you to change file permissions so
this is something that you will need to
use on daily basis and quite often
primarily because well you see if I have
an executive file in Linux for example
let's just go ahead and edit well
actually we don't need to edit it we can
type in echo echo and not like that
hello close quotation marks and I want
to output this to test and I want to
move test to test dot
sh-sh is basically an executive of one
of the one of the scripting in one of
the scripts that's a bash script for
Linux that in such a way you can
automate tasks we will deal with it in
greater depth as we proceed through the
tutorial you will need to be acquainted
with bash scripting definitely but bash
scripting is very similar to the
terminal itself so pretty much all the
commands that used in the terminal you
can use embarrass scripting as well
basically just combining a bunch of them
in a file and now I want this to be my
executive oh but you see the way to to
start executive balls is dot slash as I
have stated previously that's a command
like any executable and if I type in
test and I press tab it doesn't give me
a list of possibilities why surely now
test thought SH is an executive oh but
no you see it doesn't have a permission
to be an executive of file you see here
the difference that just take a look at
this file and take a look at this file
this one is green this one is not and
now look at their permissions so you see
it has a mark Asian that is executable
for all groups users etc while this one
up here tests this age does not have
such permissions you need to change that
and in the way you change it is CH mod
and you will type in plus X so if you
want if you want the file to be writable
you type in plus W if you want it to be
executive or plus X if you want to be
able to read the file plus are very
simple there is also a way of doing this
with numbers so you can type in 7 5 5
you don't you don't try remembering all
those modes
whatever you need you basically go on
the net and check its it can be quite
complicated but these three you need to
know it's the plus W plus R and plus X
and also 777 which is a global mode this
is this is the mode that is not
recommended for actual usage but you see
H mode to actually test or troubleshoot
things for example if you want to be
absolutely sure that certain actions are
not being prevented due to file
permissions you change the mode of those
files to 777 which is the global mode
that anybody can do anything with the
file and if you still have an error
message you know that it is absolutely
not related to anything in regards to
permissions so those those four things
you do need to know so let me just go
ahead and type in plus X type in R and
up not random it's not so random type in
type in test dot SH press enter and if I
do LS LA once again you will see that
test dot s age is now executive oh let
me just run it and there you go if
I run this it's gonna echo hello onto my
terminal screen now there are there is a
there's a bit more to go
not much more left there is just one
more command that I would really like to
show to you and that can be a very
dangerous command indeed it can mess you
up in ways you can't you can't even
begin to imagine yet that is the command
R M so RM is basically remove and once
you remove things with this command it's
next to impossible to recover pretty
much anything so if I type in RM test
dot SH it's gonna remove it and it's no
longer going to be there but if I go
ahead and navigate over to place to be
and I don't know touch test I'm gonna
make a new file there and if I go ahead
and say RM place to be it's gonna say RM
cannot remove place to be because it is
a directory this is a fail-safe of the
RM so you wouldn't delete a full
directory because you wouldn't be able
to recover it and that would be really
bad what you can do is type in R m dot F
and then place to be cannot remove
directory oops ok no problems you see
you get stuck and I'm deliberately gonna
leave this part in this tutorial just to
troubleshoot it so we type in - - help
and here you have recursive remove
directories and their contents
recursively so that's a that's a very
nice option so let's just go ahead and
do that because this will go into the
folder and remove everything within the
folder and the folder itself hopefully
so let's just go ahead and type in RM -
our place to be press Enter there you go
it has delete of it and there we go it
is no longer there the the - F function
- F that I have used is forced it will
not ask you any questions it will delete
the folder or file which can be also
very dangerous shows you when you're
using RM you always want to be asked
questions in any case I have as I said
I've deliberately left this in order to
show you that even if you get stuck
don't worry about it I get stuck all the
time and if you don't know what to type
in what argument to pass just type in
dash dash dash dash help and take a look
at what you can actually type read read
a little bit and then use the options
try it out it's sometimes it's gonna
work sometimes it won't but more often
than not you will be able to figure it
out from the help menu if you can't
figure it out from the help menu just
type in man RM and you can read pretty
much everything there is to know about
this command here and if you really
can't perform the task but if you can't
find anything useful here then forums
are your next best bet but trust me you
will succeed in doing it in any case
this was a brief introduction to some of
the basic commands that we will use
please make sure that you know what each
one of these commands does at least its
basic functions and then later on we
will get in depth and do more advanced
stuff and use more advanced commands by
combining them and so on in any case I
bid you all farewell and I hope to see
you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
