for the platform app builder or
certification exam and so if you go to
certification salesforce.com you come to
this main screen here where you can
access the different credentials that
are available and then the maintenance
exam schedules programming excitements
etc the verification screen where you
can verify people's certifications and
access support as well but the main
thing to highlight here is the register
for an exam that takes you to web
Assessor which if you don't have an
account you need to create a new web
Assessor login and so I'm going to click
on that and show you what that looks
like where you create a test taker
account and you want to specify your
login your password your email etc a few
things to note of importance is you want
to be very specific with your company
name if you work for a Salesforce
partner company and you want your
certification to count towards their
certification count you need to find out
from your company how their name appears
and web Assessors so that it ties in
correctly if you get this wrong or want
to change it later you can change it
later but it's something that's good to
get done correctly from the start so
complete your account and then once
you've done so you can log in and so
then once you're logged in you get to
the home screen where you can actually
register for a new exam and so if you
click on register for a new exam here
are the different options available
there's a lot of different certification
pads available to you and so the
platform app builder exam is under the
app builder exams a section if you click
the plus sign on that that expands out
now you notice that I have a summer 16
release exam that is due it's actually
overdue I've not exceeded the window of
time to where my certification will
expire but I do need to go ahead and
register for that and get that completed
and every third maintenance exam costs
$100 so once a year in order to maintain
your credentials you'll have to pay $100
u.s. in order to maintain your
credentials and so I just happen to be
due for that third exam so since this
one's costing me money I've put that off
until closer to the deadline and so
in order to register you just click
register but in your own instance you
would be finding the exams that you want
to register for since I've had the old
developer 401 certification I also have
a platform ad builder certification
that's why I can register for this
particular maintenance exam but if you
have the old developer 401 certification
you can do a transition exam and what's
nice about this is it's just 20
questions and cost $100 if you're brand
new to self force and if you don't have
the old developer 401 certification then
instead of the transition exam you'll
have the full-blown platform app builder
certification exam and that'll be a two
hundred dollar fee to register and then
as well it'll be 60 questions so the
idea behind a transition exam is that a
lot of what was on the old developer 401
exam is on the platform app builder
certification exam and so it's just the
20 questions cost less money and you can
register that way as well another thing
to highlight is there's two options here
there's the on-site proctored or the
online proctored and what online
proctored means is that you'll be
hooking up a webcam and taking the test
and there will be someone actually
watching you take the test and making
sure that you're not cheating proctored
just means that it's in a controlled
environment and you don't have access to
the internet you can't Google things and
you can't have any other devices or
material with you you're only allowed to
use your computer or laptop and an
external webcam that it also has to have
a microphone and sound capability so
that the proctor person that's watching
you can see if you're even here if
there's someone talking to you for
example and so I'm going to go ahead and
register for my maintenance release when
I click register and so then in your
shopping cart you'll have the actual
exam that you're going to be scheduled
for if you have a voucher code I'm not
sure how to get these I guess if you go
to some event and get a voucher code you
would enter that here and redeem it and
then when you're done just click
checkout and then for your billing
information you just enter that in and
click continue and so I've just
registered for my maintenance exam and
paid the hundred dollars and so I'm
going to click done and so now I've got
my scheduled exam
in mines the release exam you know since
the summer 16 release exam and then for
a maintenance exam those are not
proctored those are open book and this
is just Salesforce's way of making sure
that you stay up to date on the platform
once you pass the certification and
that's in a proctored environment and
lockdown as far as control the no
internet access and cetera and once
you've passed the certification then
Salesforce is fine with you looking at
like release notes for the maintenance
exam so I'm going to launch this I'm not
going to show any actual questions but
I'm gonna get you as far as I can
through this because this is something
until you've actually done an exam it's
really a curious thing that I know
you've got a high interest level in
because this is why you've gone through
all this for and so it gives you the
test taker instructions and this is very
similar to what you'll experience with
the full-blown certification exam but
you'll also have a webcam set up and
have gone through biometric profile and
they'll send you information on all that
when the time comes
so click Launch and then there's a test
taker agreement that's very long you've
got to agree to that and click Next and
then we get into the actual exam ok so
now I've skipped ahead to the end of the
exam and you see the time remaining
ticking down as I'm recording here and I
selected at the end of the exam to
review all my answers and so I've got
five questions on this release exam the
full certification exam is 60 questions
the transition exam if you're
transitioning from the developer 401 to
the platform app builder that would be
20 questions but I've got five items
answered I could click on these to
review the questions I'm not going to
share these questions with you though
because I would get in trouble with
Salesforce I'm not going to do that and
so please don't also ask for any exam
dumps or anything like that if I were to
do something like that a cell source
would rightly strip me in my
certifications because these
certifications need to mean something so
I'm gonna click Submit exam and here's
the moment of truth and this will be the
same sort of experience when you take
the exam is making sure you're ready to
submit the exam and then you'll just
either get a one word pass or fell
message so I'm going to submit the exam
and it shows that I passed that's a good
thing so I've passed the maintance exam
for my
platform app builder certification and
it shows the time that was taken and you
just simply click exit test and so if
you do happen to fail the test the first
time take heart that you can get it the
next time as well it's not that uncommon
for people to fail the first time and
you just gotta stick with it and keep
studying and get hands-on experience and
eventually you will pass it's just a
matter of time unfortunately Salesforce
does not give you any sort of percentage
on what you got right or wrong or what
you even need to study on more so at
this point after you've taken the test I
always encourage people to do what I
call a brain dump and that's especially
if you fail the test the idea is that
you want to capture as much as you can
remember from the test to help guide
your studies and so what I've done in
the past is I'll either record into my
phone audio or I'll write down
everything that I can remember from the
test from memory and then I try to have
accessible to me soon after I'm done
taking the test the study guide and that
helps trigger my memory as well as far
as any sort of things that I can
remember from the exam such as recalling
certain questions and so in the next
lecture we're going to talk more about
the pluses and minuses of taking the
test either on site or online and get
more into detail and how that works
