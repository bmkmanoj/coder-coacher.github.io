nice application from scratch I would
like to quickly mention the steps that
we need to go through to come up with
this web application so that's what I'm
going to do in this lecture but first of
all though I want to make sure you know
how a web application is built so almost
every web application has a front end
and the back end now the front end is
HTML and the CSS part and JavaScript
when when a website has JavaScript now
we have HTML and CSS in our case so this
here is the HTML of this side and here
you see a link and as the CSS so this is
the code the part that renders these
elements you like this title here and
this line of text and these inputs at
this button and then the CSS is
responsible for sterilizing these things
so without LCSs you'd still have these
elements but you don't have this nice
colors and phones and animations and so
on
so that's the CSS port and this is a
front end now the back end is you know
you expect the user to enter some data
in here so an email address and a number
for the height now the front end gives
you the place where to put this but
there's where the front end roll ends
because then the front end will just
send these two pieces of data to your
back end which is handled by Python so
you'll send this to Python as two
strings or a string and a number that's
where the back end starts so python what
python will do then it will grab these
two pieces of data and then maybe i
analyzed them if it needs to so it can
calculate something out of this data or
later it can send them to a database so
the database is also part of the back
end like the scripting language which is
Python in our case so you use the
database as a storage for your data and
then you can also send back data to the
front-end again like you can say thank
you for registering with this email
address so you can display the email
address of the user there and so you're
interacting back and forth for with the
front end and the back end so that's
about the concept now the steps we need
to go through well first it depends but
I prefer to build the front end first
and then move to the back end
some people they start with the back end
and I prefer to know first the
requirement the user requirement so I
want to have a clear idea of what I
expect from the user so I first want to
build this interface and make sure I'm
getting this two pieces of data so in
the next lecture I'm gonna build the
HTML part and then the CSS part very
quickly so those are the first two steps
as I'll build this files locally as
simple HTML files and I'll try them or
the browser by just double-clicking them
so I'm not incorporating these HTML
files with the flask application just
yet once I do that next what we'll do is
I'll build a basic structure all for
flask application so like a potter
screen where i'll import the flask
library and the other libraries and also
build some some basic functions and I'll
have them ready for adding more code
than and so once I have this structure
concept in mind the ones I have laid
that out I'll then go ahead and make
sure I'm getting these data correctly in
Python so the email address and the
height
and then I'll use some print statements
important to make sure that I'm getting
them correctly without using a database
yet then I'll create a database in
PostgreSQL and once I do that I'll
create a table so as the next typed
creating tables and two fields so email
at height fields once we have a database
and a table ready we will send the data
that we get from these two inputs using
Python we will send them to the
appropriate database table as tall and
as zeros in database table so up to this
point we have stored the data in the
database table and then what we want to
do we want to send some average height
so all the records that we have in the
table so we want to send them to the
user but first of all I'll need to query
so I'll write the code to query data
from the table and also calculate that
average and I'll print that also print
statements just test all things and then
once this value is being calculated
correctly then I'll write the code that
sends an email to the user with this
data so with average height average and
maybe the the height the user input for
themselves so the height of the user and
every joint and then lastly we will
deploy this web application online so
let's send it to anyone and they can
access it from the web and yeah
basically that's it those are the steps
there are quite a few steps but you'll
learn a lot from what I'll do here so
let's get ready and yeah I'll see you in
the next lecture start building the
front end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
