how we make games and in this video I'm
gonna show you how we can set up
collisions in the Unreal game engine now
it's fairly straightforward to do but we
do have to understand a few concepts
such as presets and object types and
collision responses so we're going to be
going through those concepts
systematically and we're gonna be doing
that while constructing a little mini
game basically a little tech demo that
looks something like this so here is
what the mini game actually looks like
and as you can see it is fairly
rudimentary we are just this little
spaceship that can fly around from the
top down and it can shoot so we've got
WASD keys to move around and we've got
the arrow keys to fire out off in
different directions and we've got a
little enemy spaceship that is
stationary but trying to shoot us now
you'll notice when I hide behind this
wall he doesn't shoot at me and I can't
pass through the wall I can't shoot
through the wall however there is
another type of wall here this blue wall
which I can't pass through but
projectiles can so this is going to give
us some idea of how collisions work in
unreal and you can see that when they
when he can shoot through the wall he
will be shooting through the wall so
that's something we're gonna be doing as
well being able to query collisions like
so okay so I haven't said who I am I'm
Sam and I am working with game dev TV we
do lots of tutorials like this one on
unreal on unity lots of different game
engines and I'm gonna show you step by
step how to build this game and
understand collision system in unreal
now you don't have to have any pre
requisites don't have to have done
anything in unreal before but if you
want to follow along it will be much
easier if you have done a little bit in
the past well without further ado let's
dive in to the engine and have a look at
how to achieve this so let's start with
a completely blank slate here we've got
the Unreal project browser open and
we're gonna go to the new projects tab
and under that we're going to go to the
blueprint tab and under that we're going
to look for the twin-stick shooter as
so this gives us most of what we saw in
the demo except for the wall and the AI
shooting at us so that's what we want to
do I'm gonna go ahead and not include
basic go with the default here no
starter content maximum quality and I'm
gonna change the name of the project to
spaceship shooter
you can put it in whatever folder you
like I've got one set up already for
this for this tutorial and for this
series so I'm gonna go ahead and create
that project now this can take a varying
amount of time depending on the speed of
your computer so I'm gonna go ahead and
fast-forward through but do go ahead
pause the video if yours is taking
longer which it probably will no worries
if you're following along and if you're
just watching then you can carry on
watching through so here is what the
base project looks like we've got a
simple map and if we have a look around
the map you can see that there are two
obstacles in our map we've got our
spaceship already in there and we've got
some other yellow obstacles if we go
ahead and play and just move around WASD
as I said before and the arrow keys to
shoot now we've got two obstacles we
can't go through we've also got these
blocks which we can't seem to move
unless we shoot at them and then they
fall over we're not gonna be using those
but they're quite fun to shoot at so to
go ahead and have a little play around
if you have are following along with the
lecture okay so that's fair enough why
though are some obstacles blocking and
others are not so we've can see that
these obstacles the two grey obstacles
don't let the spaceship through and
don't let our particles through our
projectiles but you'll notice there's
also these big out of boxes that
encompass the whole space and we can
pass through just fine so some things
block and some things don't and this is
called a collision response now there's
actually three types of collision X
responses probably more than you were
imagining so of the types of collision
response we have the following we have
block which is fairly simple you know
you've got two objects and they can't
pass through one of they just stop you
know as this ball was coming towards
this wall it just stops for example that
is a block response we have an overlap
response which is as it sounds
the ball will pass through the wall it
will overlap with the wall and we have
an ignore response which at first sight
seems like the same thing the ball will
pass through and overlap with the wall
the difference being there in the
overlap case we get an event which
allows us to trigger something gameplay
like we could for example when the ball
passes through the wall the wall could
self-destruct or there could be an
explosion and the same thing actually
goes for the block response as well
there can be an event in that case again
such an explosion or a sound effect
basically it tells us when that happens
with ignore as the name suggests we
don't even get the event things just
pass through the objects act as if they
don't exist to each other so how does
this actually work how do we have a look
at these block responses how do the
block responses between say our
spaceship and our obstacle get
calculated well it's quite simple let's
go ahead and click on the obstacle as a
starting point and go into the details
tab over on the right-hand side just
underneath the world outliner in the
default layout so anyway and if you
scroll on down there should be a section
there called collision and in this
section called collision there is a item
called the collision preset now we'll
get to what a preset is in just a second
but for now I'd like to go down onto the
drop down menu and select custom and
under custom we see what a preset is
actually made up of there is a collision
enabled there is an object type and
there is a set of responses to different
object types and something called trace
responses will look at trace responses
in a later video but for the object
responses right now it's quite
interesting so we've got an object type
so this obstacle is of object type world
static and we've got responses to other
object types and you can see that
there's one object type down here called
porn that's actually the object type of
our spaceship and you can see that the
response to the porn is a blocking
response so that gets as part of the way
to understanding how that responses can
detect but there is a second bit of
information because actually
porns also has a collision preset it
also has a response to an object type
our world static object type let's go
ahead and click on twin-stick pawn and
we're gonna go and find you need to have
a little look in the component hierarchy
just at the top of the details pane for
the ship mesh component now with this
ship mesh component selected we can go
down to the collision area and have a
look at the presets now here the preset
isn't changeable but we can expand out
that preset and have a look at what it
consists of so we can see that the
object type as I said is porn so we know
that we are looking at the right sort of
thing and then if you go and have a look
at the object responses you can see that
the object responds to the world static
which was the object type of our
obstacle one is also block okay so
that's pretty clear that they're both
block we should definitely they
shouldn't pass through each other but
what does it mean about for example
overlapping if what one of them was
overlapping if one of them was ignore
what would happen then what if I select
obstacle one and set it to overlap so
porn overlap well let's give it a shot
let's go ahead and hit play after having
done that just gonna bring my playback
button back and I'm just gonna move over
to the obstacle and as you can see I
just pass right over the top so what's
going on here let's have a little bit of
a deep dive into this what we've got is
a collision response matrix that's what
we've seen this was called a collision
response matrix if I go onto obstacle 1
it is a matrix because we have rows and
we have columns essentially you could
also call it a table if you like and it
tells us given this particular object
and this particular object type that we
are colliding with what should be our
response should we ignore overlap or
block and what we can do is look that up
and see what the response is on object
one and object two of the collision
there's always two objects in a
collision and we see what their results
are so in this case we have object one
which our spaceship is block and we have
object 2 which is our obstacle is saying
overlap so you can look at
in this table and see that that means
that we should overlap so this basically
tells us that we only overlap if both
responses are overlap or higher we only
block if both responses are block and we
ignore in all the other cases and if
you're ever unsure you can go back and
have a look at this table now in this
lecture I'd like to achieve the blue
obstacle that we had from before a
different type of obstacle where the
bullets can pass through but our
spaceship cannot so for that we need to
understand what is the object type of
the spaceship what is the object type of
the bullets and if you have a look in to
the matrix that we've got here for our
obstacle one you can see that there are
a list of objects responses and
basically object types here and we can
see we've already seen that porn is the
spaceships object type and we've seen
that projectile well we could guess the
projectile is the type of the bullets so
we could go ahead and create a set up
here with this obstacle one where the
porn is blocked but the projectiles
overlap or even ignore in this case
because we don't need to do anything
with the event of the projectiles going
through so I'm gonna go ahead and hit
play and hopefully this should have the
desired effect so I can't pass through
this object but my bullets do they just
pass right through or as it appears
right over the top so that's having the
desired effect
that's because we have been able to
change just one of the objects and
according to this matrix it's enough to
change just one of the objects down from
blocking to ignore to make the whole
thing go to ignore so we've got two
object one that resists the projectile
for example would have said block when
it hits the world static object but the
world static object says actually when
it's a projectile I'd like to ignore it
and we take the kind of weaker of all
the responses and we ignore okay so
we've got that but it's a little bit of
a faff if we wanted to create more
obstacles like this one so I'm actually
going to set the collision pre
set for this one back to default and I'm
gonna take a copy of this obstacle one
so copy paste and just move it across
like so okay and one more thing I'm
going to change the color so that it's
really obvious that we've got a
different sort of obstacle here so to do
that I'm going to go up to the materials
section when obstacle three is selected
and I'm going to select the cube
material and change it to a blue
material which is already in here so
that's just going to make it really
obvious that it's a different kind of
material but we haven't changed anything
about the collisions just yet the
collisions are still with preset default
so what I'm going to show you how to do
is how to go ahead and set up our very
own collision preset so let's go ahead
to the Settings button at the top of the
UI and go down into the project settings
pane now mines appear off screens I'm
going to just drag it onto the screen
like so and then we're going to go down
in the left-hand pane to a section
labeled collision it's underneath the
engine heading and you can see here that
we've got a number of things we've got
the object channels we've got the trace
channels which we're going to worry
about in a later lecture so I collapse
that and we've got the presets which I'm
going to expand out so these presets are
what are available in that drop down
menu and the object channels are mostly
already built in but you can see there
is a custom object channel here which is
for the projectile and we'll look at
setting up custom object channels in a
second but for now we might want to just
set up a preset so we can have a look at
what a preset consists of the preset
really is just that collection that we
have expanded out before this collision
enabled which are not worrying about
just yet the object type there's a
description in this case and there is
this matrix of responses to the other
types of object so we want to create a
new one of these for this new type of
wall which allows us to shoot through it
so I'm gonna go ahead and create a new
preset and I'm gonna give it a name so
I'm gonna call it permeable war
and I'm don't need to give it a
description I it says needs a
description but well maybe let's go
ahead and add one while we're here I'm
just going to call it wall that
projectiles can pass through so and what
are we going to have as the responses
well by default it's going to block
everything but there's one thing that we
don't want it to block and that is the
projectile so when there is a project
projectile I'm actually going to set it
to overlap because in the next video
we're going to be looking at how to deal
with responses to objects going
basically going overlapping through
things or hitting things so let's leave
it to overlap for now and let's accept
that change now we can go ahead and
close down these settings and we can
select our obstacle three and go to the
collision area and select the collision
presets instead of going for default
we're going to select the permeable wall
preset which should automatically if we
go ahead and hit play go up to the wall
we can't oh we can pass through it and
that is a bit of a problem so let's go
ahead and have a look at white that is
if we go down to street level you can
see I think that this obstacle is a
little bit lower hmm not particularly
lower so what's going on here then let's
go ahead and click on our obstacle three
and have a little look at the collision
section so here we've got the collision
preset aha I see the problem so this may
well come up for you as well our
collision enabled is actually set to no
collision so let's go back to the
settings to project settings and then go
to our collision section again and open
up the presets and find our permeable
wall open that up now in this preset you
can see that we've got a collision
enabled drop down menu and in that drop
down menu we've got no collision now
there are a few other options so no
collision obviously means that nothing
ever happens now we've got a few others
we've got query only physics only and
collision enabled query end physics so
what is this query and what is this
physics well basically physics is the
thing that we're trying to do
right now which is stop things from
moving through other objects that's a
physics collision there are also query
collisions which are basically saying
things like can I see through this wall
now we are not particularly interested
in the query just yet but we will be
using it later so we're gonna go for
collision enabled which means that it
will show up both in the query and the
physics type of collision checks so it's
a performance thing if you don't need
query then you should go for physics
only and so on and so forth but it
really just depends on your use case if
you are going to use it then have it if
you're not going to use it then don't
have it and it will be faster to perform
these collision checks so let's go ahead
and accept that close this down go ahead
and play and we're gonna move ourselves
over now we can't get through this wall
but we can shoot through this wall so
that's excellent that's all I wanted to
do in this video so just quickly to
recap what we've actually achieved in
this video so far we have figured out
what presets are what object types are
how you can create a new preset and also
how the collision response matrix works
and how to collision responses come
together to make one response now if you
liked this video go ahead and subscribe
there will be more videos in this series
a couple more at least covering just
collisions and if you really liked it do
give it a thumbs up and let me know in
the comments whether you'd like to see
more videos like this and what subjects
in unreal you would like to see covered
great stuff and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
