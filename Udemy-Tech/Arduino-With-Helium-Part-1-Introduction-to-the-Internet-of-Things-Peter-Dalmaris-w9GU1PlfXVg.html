lecture of a series of lectures in this
section in which I demonstrate how to
use helium helium is an Internet of
Things platform which makes it really
easy to create small or large scale
Internet of Things applications you may
ask what is an IOT and Internet of
Things application there's a few
different definitions out there but I'll
try to keep things simple so let's
consider an Internet of Things
application as an application that
combines things like adrenals and
raspberry PI's or small computers or
market controllers with services that
are running on the Internet
so at the very bottom of that list of
possible services for example could be a
data logger so you are dealing with a
bunch of sensors collect data say from
your home or your factory or some other
facility or location anywhere
practically in the world the data is
sent to some online facility could be a
database for example and the data is
stored so that you can perhaps do some
processing later create graphs and
charts and things of that sort
it's also possible to attach actuators
on your Internet of Things applications
so your Arduino for example could be
connected to a relay and then based on a
command that comes to your Arduino from
your Internet of Things application you
could turn a light on and off or a motor
on and off or a fan things of that sort
so as I said earlier Internet of Things
applications can be very small-scale so
for example you can connect a couple of
home-based devices so that could be say
a temperature monitor in your lab - your
Internet of Things application running
say on an amazon WIPP server and then if
the humidity and the temperature gets at
a particular level then
can get your internet-of-things
application to either turn on the
air-conditioner or sends you and under
like an SMS message saying that the
temperature is it's gone past a
particular level on the other hand
Internet of Things applications can get
very large-scale so imagine you have a
factory for example and you have
hundreds of those devices monitoring
conditions of production parameters
along the production line and then they
report all that information to our
centralized Internet of Things
application which makes decision about
how fast it should resupply with
particular materials where they should
hit an alert if things are slowing down
if there is malfunction somewhere that
can trigger a notification to supervisor
and things of that sort so with helium
all the infrastructure that takes care
of the transport between your gadgets
that are on the side and your Internet
of Things application it could be
anywhere on the Internet is taken care
of and as I'll show you in from up
lectures in this section the process is
almost plug-and-play in effect you can
attach these two devices and I will
explain what these are in a minute to
your Arduino and to your network say the
net network and you almost have an IOT
infrastructure pretty much ready and
with simple sketches you'll be able to
allow for the Internet to communicate
with your on-site gadgets and vice versa
I'll show you how that works very very
soon since I've got these two things in
my hands might as well explain what they
are before we move on so what you've got
here this large white device is called
in helium element router it's
essentially a rather it's job is to
receive signals wireless signals hence
the antennas from multiple client
devices this is the helium atom device
which
likes on to things like Arduinos or
raspberry pies you have got hundreds of
those potentially and they sent the data
communicate with the router and then
from the router the signal or the data
is routed to the helium network and from
the helium network using the helium
dashboard it can reroute that data to
other things around the internet and
those things could be things such as
your own web services application or web
application or MQTT consumers if you
don't know what and get it here is don't
worry about it it doesn't change
anything the bottom line is that the
infrastructure using this hardware and
the helium network allows you to build
small scale or large scale Internet of
Things applications that are very safe
secure fast and basically you just
concentrate on what the application does
none of the in-between bits and pieces
that transport for example the security
and all of those things so I hope that
is a good introduction any now have a
good sense of what helium is and what it
does and it's time to move on to the
next lecture well talk a little bit more
about the hardware before moving on to
an example application that are due
