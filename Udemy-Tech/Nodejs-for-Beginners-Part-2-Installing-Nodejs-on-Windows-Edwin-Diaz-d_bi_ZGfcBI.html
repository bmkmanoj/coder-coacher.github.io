particular lecture we are going to be
installing nodejs
on a Windows computer now throughout the
course I'm gonna be using a macro
operating system but on this lecture as
you can see we're using Windows so let's
go and open our browser this is a brand
new system that I got installed and
let's go to no js' dot-org and let's
download the stable version right here
LTS ok it's a very similar approach very
similar steps as to how we download it
or install it using a Mac operating
system basically we're going to download
installer we're gonna run it this is the
wizard right here as you can see I'm
going to click accept returns nets this
is going to install them Program Files
Nets and I'm just going to leave
everything by default guys you see the
NPM package manager is being installed
as well this is a little program that we
used to download packages from the NPN
jegs.com with a gorg website I'm gonna
say yes in my ask you guys some password
of your computer for some of you so you
might want to put a password to log in
from your computer if it prompts you to
do so
pause the video a little bit because it
took probably like 30 to 40 seconds I
don't want I don't want you guys waiting
there so it does take a little bit it's
pretty quick though it's not the slow
process is quick and well it's done
installing right now what I'm gonna do
is gonna look for my command prompt so
I'm gonna go to the windows search bar
right here CMD I believe I'm so used to
using a Mac operating system that this
looks a little strange to me now so now
that I open a command prompt here I'm
gonna do node - V enter and you can see
now that we have version eight point
nine point four pretty cool stuff right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
