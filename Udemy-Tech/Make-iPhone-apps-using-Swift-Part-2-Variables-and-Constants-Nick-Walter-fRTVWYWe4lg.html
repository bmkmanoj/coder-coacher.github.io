name's Nick and I'm gonna teach you
everything you need to get started so
Swift what is it it's a programming
language that was created by Apple it
came out like I said in 2014 really
awesome because it's very simple to use
and get up from a beginner's perspective
I learned on objective-c and let me tell
you
learning Swift is so much better than
learning Objective C you're gonna catch
concepts much faster than if you had
gone the Objective C route we are
currently on Swift 4 it's the latest
version of Swift it's every year - Apple
typically comes out with a new version
of Swift Swift is now open source which
is a really cool move by Apple which
means a Swift can be used on other
computers rather than just in Mac's like
you can see it on Linux and I think it's
being worked to show up on Windows and
stuff like that but anyways that just
means hopefully more and more Swift is
gonna become very popular and that
skills you learn here can be implicit in
a lot of different places so let's go
ahead and start at the very beginning
the core concept to the Swift
programming language are two things
variables and constants okay variables
and constants it's sort of the building
block of everything that you're gonna do
inside of Swift and the idea with both
of these is that they are a container
for a piece of information so let's
start with variables okay so now that
you have everything delete it out let's
go ahead and create our first variable
so to do that just type var var which is
short for variable space and then give a
name for some variable now this is
completely up to you so you can name it
whatever you want let's say I want to
make a variable that represents my age
so I'm gonna say var age and what that
gives it a name now if we want to put
some information inside of this
container
remember variables of container I'm
gonna save our age is equal to and then
I'm gonna put some number inside of here
so my age is 28 so I'm gonna say var age
is equal to 28 and there you have it you
created your very first variable in
Swift and so let's just walk through
this again I want to make sure you get
into so
our this is saying I want to make a new
variable then when you do a space
whatever is after that that's the name
of the variable so in this case it was
age then you do space equals space and
you're saying okay I want age to be
equal to or put this information in and
I put the number 28 so you can put any
sort of number that you want in here I
could do like negative 14 or something
like that it all goes into where into
that variable age okay so with a
variable something that's really cool
about it is that we can see that the
variable will change over time so down
below if I just type age all on its own
here on the playground you should see
over on the right-hand side it's gonna
spit out whatever value is currently in
there so there you can see the 28 and
you can kind of move this little gray
bar here or you're supposed to be able
to move the gray bar to be bigger or
smaller but for whatever reason it's not
showing me that option well that was a
disappointment but the idea is that you
can change a variable over time so for
example if age right now is equal to 28
right you can see when I typed out age
cells 28 over here it showed 28 the
first time let's say I want to change
age to be equal to 5 or something like
that
I can say age is equal to 5 just like
this okay and now whenever I type age
out you will see that age is equal to 5
so remember a variable is a container of
a piece of information so at first we
said okay create this variable named age
and it's gonna hold the number 28 but
then down here when we said age is equal
to 5 you know we're saying okay get the
28 out of here now replace it with the
number 5 so you can change what number
is gonna be in there over time now you
may be wondering why do I have you know
just age out here without an equal sign
or anything too it's just kind of my way
to see what's inside that variable at
each time you it does show you that when
you set it equal to something but I also
like to kind of just do that for
reference so you can change this
variable as much as you want I could
change this back to 28 I could change it
to like I showed earlier a negative
number if I say age is you know equal to
negative 100 that's totally fine you can
change it as much as
you want the next thing that we're going
to talk about is a constant so a
constant is something that holds a piece
of information it's a container but a
constant once it's created it cannot be
changed over time so for example let's
just do this same example and I'm gonna
delete this code for now but I'm gonna
change this to a constant so to create a
constant rather than saying var you say
let le t and that creates a constant now
if you're wondering why it says let this
has kind of comes from an old
programming thing I really wish Apple
would have changed this to something
maybe like Const or something like that
it just seems like that reads a little
bit easier but let is what they decided
so just remembered let means you're
creating a constant so when I say let
age be equal to 28 I'm saying age is a
constant and it's holding the number 28
now the special thing what this is a
constant cannot change so if I try and
say for example here age is equal to 5
well I'm gonna get this big nasty code
that says hey you cannot assign a value
to age as let is a constant so it's
saying okay you know you said age is
gonna be a constant you set it equal to
20 yet you cannot change it at all over
time now the cool thing is watch this as
soon as I change this to a var all a
sudden X codes happy with this it's like
yes yeah of course you can change age
because it's a variable and you know you
can change what it's gonna be over time
one thing that I would like to point out
is if you're going to be updating a
variable over time you don't want to
ever say var again for that particular
variable so for example when I said var
age is equal to 28
I said var because I wanted to create a
new variable if I try and come here and
save our age is equal to 5 we're gonna
get again a nasty code from Xcode
because it's like hey you know you don't
need to recreate this variable so only
use the word variable when you're
creating something the first time and
just again to prove that point the
difference between variables and
constants if I change this to let we're
gonna see air codes for both of these
lines of code because it's saying hey
you know you can't this is a constant
you can't change it once it's already
been set okay so those are the basics
just remember a variable can hold a
piece of information a constant can also
hold
piece of information the difference
between the two is a variable can change
over time a constant cannot now the last
thing that I'd like to mention here is
that in the Swift Prague playground you
can have as much space as you want or in
between things so for example I could
put like a bunch of lines of code here
that are just empty that's completely
fine in between things for example I
could have a ton of spaces here that's
totally okay but you know for example if
I'm gonna create a variable and give it
a name I can't just say var age now it's
trying to say what the heck is var hours
or something like that right so you do
have to have spaces between things you
can make the spaces as big as you want
but typically this is the common
convention you want to have spaces be
only one you know size in between things
and you don't want to have a ton of
whitespace you could have things be you
know one line after the other like this
if you wanted to I typically like to see
some spacing but I just wanted you know
that having whitespace is totally okay
when you're writing in Swift code okay
so to kind of test your skills and make
sure you're understanding this I have a
quick little challenge for you I want
you to create a variable and I want you
to name it wallet okay so create a
variable call it wallet and set it equal
to however much money is in your wallet
right now so it could be great it could
be $100 it could be terrible it could be
zero I don't know what it is but go
ahead and create a variable named wallet
and set it equal to however much is in
your wallet I'm gonna give you a chance
to pause the video now go do it on your
own and then come back when you're
finished
okay so I'm assuming that you went ahead
and tried that please if you haven't
done it go do it on your own that's
really where this learning takes places
when you do stuff on your own so the
challenge I gave you was to create a
variable named wallet and set it equal
to however much money was in your wallet
I just went ahead and checked mine there
was fourteen bucks in there so I made a
new variable called wallet and I set it
equal to fourteen okay
so our numbers might not have been the
same if they were I'd love to hear to
the comments that'd be kind of cool but
whatever you put here you should have
been able to create your variable and
you've got the very core of Swift down
you know about variables and constants
so in the next lecture we're gonna build
on this just one more step so let's go
ahead and talk about it
there hey thanks for watching what are
you going to make leave a comment below
and let me know and if you want to learn
even more I have a full 16 our iOS
course that I created just for beginners
where I'll show you how to make a ton of
different apps including a snapchat
clone a Pokemon go clone and a talk boy
it's usually 200 bucks but if you use
the link below you'll get a YouTube
