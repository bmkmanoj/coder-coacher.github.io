looking at lists tuples and sets the
first thing to do is to create a new
file and I'm gonna save it and call it
lists tuples
and sets dot py that's just so Adam
knows that this is a Python file and
gives a syntax highlighting and things
like that in the last video we looked at
variables and we saw though we could
create variables such as strings or
integers and we could essentially store
the value of whatever it is to be wanted
to store inside a box called in this
case my variable but what we noticed
maybe maybe we didn't know this but what
was there is a variable for every value
so here's why that can be a problem say
you have a program that calculates the
average grade of a student so a student
can have a number of grades such as
grade 1 which can be 77 great true that
can be 80 great 3 that can be 90 so
obviously getting better over time and
you want to calculate the average of
these things
we know that an average is the sum of
the elements 77 plus 80 plus 90 divided
by the number of elements in this case
three so we could calculate the average
by saying grade 1 plus grade 2 plus
great 3 divided by 3 also remembering
that the divide has preference over the
plus so we have to put the brackets in
there
okay so this is fair enough but what if
there are more exams grade 4 equals 95
grade 5 equals 100 then we have to go
back to our code and change its grade 4
plus grade 5 divided by 5 and then if
this keeps increasing obviously this
becomes more and more unsustainable you
end up with maybe 20 variables and then
you have to change the code every time
then also having something like this
means that if if you've got somebody
using your program and they want more
grades they're gonna need to change the
code and so on so it's not really
sustainable so ideally what we would
have is a way to keep adding grades
without creating more variables
unfortunately we have that is called a
list so we can do something like 77 80
90 95 100
and then instead of grade one we would
obviously call this grades
and here's how we would calculate an
average now that we've got the grades
this is a list of grades or well it's
really just a list of numbers but we can
imagine their grades and they are comma
separated and they're between square
brackets so we've got five grades here
we've got exactly grades dot sorry Lin
grades here Len is a method just like
print is but it calculates the number of
items in a list so Len grades would give
us and I'm here kind of waiting for an
answer that I know isn't coming it would
give us five because there are five
elements there so let's save that and if
we wanted to calculate the sum of grades
take a wild guess as to how you would do
that and I'll give you a hint we want to
calculate this sum of the grades
I'm sure you guessed it it is some love
Greed's and that would be done so we
would sum the grades together divided by
the length of grades which is five and I
would give it an average so what does
that mean well we can add more grades
and then some and Len automatically
calculate the correct thing so that's a
list and there is a fairly similar thing
that is using single normal normal
brackets and this is called the tupple
the only difference with a couple to a
list is that the tupple is something
that's called immutable so we cannot
increase the size of the tuple so this
tuple for example has seven elements
and we can obviously add more elements
here but there are ways for our code to
increase the size of grades we can add
elements using code grades dot append or
an eight for example couple grades
yeah there are ways to increase the size
of the list there are no ways of
increasing the size of a double because
tuples are immutable
immutable they cannot be mutated they
cannot be changed so once you have a
topple you cannot increase its size and
whereas you can do great dot append or
your list variable dot append and that
increases the size of the list by adding
an item at the end finally we've also
got sent grades this is not a very
useful type of data in this case but
nevertheless you could have a set of
grades and what a set of grades is or
just a set really is a collection of
unique unique and unordered so what that
means is they are unique so here we've
got two hundreds and so this would not
be okay for a set and they're also
unordered and what that means is that
that doesn't necessarily have to be an
order to this set um so for example if
we print grades we will always get 77 at
the start because that's the first
element if we print cent grades we may
not get 77 at the beginning we may get
77 at the beginning but we may also not
get 77 at the beginning so let's go
ahead into the terminal and print this
out and as you can see we printed out a
set and we didn't get 77 in the
beginning we got 80 and also as on a
side notice how there's only 100 there
whereas in our set we've got 200s that's
because this was there twice so one of
them just got removed so that's what
unique and unordered means and the tuple
grades and they're just immutable so you
cannot increase the size and finally the
list is sort of the most flexible of
them all you can remove element you can
add elements and all that stuff
in some cases you may want to use a
topple over a list when you don't need
to be able to remove or add elements and
sometimes that can be a bit safer and
you would want to use a set when you
have a collection of unique and
unordered elements that you may want to
set operations with set operations are
very important and we're going to look
at them in the very next video
alongside with a couple other things
that we can do with lists and tuples so
without further ado I'll see you in the
very next video
and we're going to quickly go over what
we can do with these three data types
I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
