going to give you a crash course into
Linux system administration my goal is
to expose you to as much information as
possible in the relatively short time we
have here together because there's
nothing worse than not knowing where to
start
I created this crash course to point you
in the right direction I may not go into
great detail as there just isn't enough
time to cover every topic in depth but
when you need to perform a Linux admin
task you'll at least know where to start
and understand the broader concepts
behind what you're trying to do alright
so who is this crash course for quite
simply it's for anyone who is at all
interested in developing Linux system
administration skills or for anyone who
is interested in developing a broader
understanding of Linux administration if
you're new to the field of information
technology or thinking about pursuing a
career in IT this will give you an idea
of what's involved in becoming a
professional Linux system administrator
finally this video is also great for IT
professionals with experience on other
operating systems and who are
considering adding Linux skills to their
resume even those who already have Linux
experience but want to increase their
existing knowledge and quickly brush up
on their Linux skills will also benefit
from this presentation I sincerely
believe that time is our most valuable
resource that's why I write books and
create courses they're shortcuts to
learning Linux and give people the
skills and careers that they want in the
shortest amount of time possible because
I want to be respectful of you and your
time I'm going to tell you upfront who
this crash course is not for so you
don't waste your time if you're only
interested in linux desktops and
graphical user interfaces this crash
course is not for you now don't get me
wrong I use Linux as my primary computer
every single day and yes I use a Linux
graphical desktop environment but to me
that's the least interesting thing about
Linux the real power is found at the
command line and
is where you can get some leverage
that's what can save you time and that's
what gives an individual person just
like yourself the power to manage
thousands of servers at a time if you're
here just because you're looking to save
money this crash course is not for you
yes Linux is free in the sense that you
don't have to pay to use it but more
importantly it's free in the sense that
you're free to use it in any way you
please and you're free to customize it
to suit your needs if you're not
interested in learning how to use the
powerful Linux command line or you're
not interested in server applications of
Linux this course is not for you
why am I here right now teaching you
about Linux well I want to tell you you
see
I actually dropped out of college to
follow my childhood dream which was to
be a full time musician I played in bars
restaurants and hotels I also played
music at weddings music festivals and
private parties I even spent a couple of
years playing music on a cruise ship and
I worked really hard in the music
business but because I really didn't
make much money from the music business
I had to get a day job my parents told
me to get a safe secure job did your
parents ever tell you that well I hate
to admit it but they were right so I was
looking for job security not only did I
want job security I wanted a decent
salary after spending many years as a
starving artist so that's why I decided
to pursue a career in IT I created a
resume and send it out to everywhere
that I could think of I applied to job
after job after job until someone
finally gave me an opportunity to work
as a desk side support technician I was
only in that support position for just a
few months because I decided that I
wanted to learn an in-demand skill so I
wouldn't have to worry about finding a
job again it was kind of rather hard to
break in to get that first job but I saw
that there were tons of jobs available
for people with Linux skills so I went
about learning everything I could about
Lenna
soon afterwards I landed a job as a
Linux system administrator and as they
say the rest is history
because Linux has given me so much of my
life things like places to live food to
eat vacations I mean practically
everything I feel that I need to pay it
forward now teaching people Linux skills
and helping them in their careers is my
personal way of giving back and that's
why we're here today
now if you've drifted away now's the
time to come back and look at your
screen if you can stay focus for the
next few minutes you're going to learn a
lot and I promise that so just put your
phone on mute shut down your instant
messaging app and stay out of your inbox
it's gonna be worth it
okay so let's start at the very
beginning with the Linux boot process
now BIOS stands for basic input/output
system it's a special type of firmware
used in the booting process and it's the
first piece of software that's executed
when a computer is turned on the BIOS is
actually operating system independent
its primary purpose is to test the
underlying hardware components and to
load a bootloader or an operating system
there are two primary boot loaders for
Linux the first one is Lillo which
stands for Linux loader L ILO the next
one is grub which stands for grand
unified boot loader grub has really
replaced Lillo at this point but you may
run into some older Linux systems that
still use Lillo so I just wanted to
point that out the primary purpose of
the boot loader is to actually start the
operating system it typically does this
by using an annette rd which stands for
initial ram disk the annette rd is a
temporary file system that's loaded into
memory when the system boots this file
system can contain helpers that perform
a hardware detection and load the
necessary modules to get the actual file
system mounted once the anit rd mounts
the actual root filesystem it's job is
done and the operating system continues
loading from the real root filesystem
the Linux kernel the initial RAM disk
and some other files that are needed to
boot the operating system are stored
/boot the linux kernel is typically
named VM Linux or VM Glynnis if the
kernel is compressed it's named in the
vm lineage format now that ends with a Z
when a system boots up there can be a
lot of messages that just fly by the
screen these messages are generated by
the Linux kernel there are two ways to
see these messages the first way is to
use the D message command which dumps
the contents of the kernel ring buffer
to the screen by the way that command is
spelled DM ESG now since the messages
are stored in memory and a ring buffer
when new messages get added to the
buffer old messages get dropped off the
good news is that the kernel messages
are typically stored on disk in the VAR
log D message file so if something
Scrolls off the end of the buffer you
can still find it in that log file Linux
uses runlevels to determine what
processes and services to start each
distribution can be configured slightly
differently but in general run levels
zero is used to power off a system run
level one is single user mode run levels
two through five are for normal system
operations with run level five starting
the graphical user interface and finally
run level six is used to reboot the
system traditionally run levels were
controlled by the anit program to change
run levels you would use the Telenet
command to literally tell an it what run
level to use however a Nannette
alternative named system D is quickly
taking the place of an it it's currently
widely adopted so for the most part
you'll be dealing with system D just
know that some distros especially older
ones or some that are not well supported
still use the original anit system an it
uses the concept of run levels while
system D uses the concept of targets
these targets are roughly equivalent to
run levels you can use the system CTL
command to change to a desired target
for example if you want to start the
graphical user interface run systemctl
isolate graphical to stop the graphical
user interface and switch back to the
command
interface run systemctl isolate multi -
user in addition to run levels and
targets there are some special commands
that allow you to control the system as
well for example you can use the
shutdown command - while shut down the
system
the reboot command to perform a reboot
and of course the power off command to
power off the system in reality these
just invoke the proper corresponding an
it or system D commands Linux uses the
syslog standard for message logging this
allows programs and applications to
generate messages that can be captured
processed and stored by the system
logger it eliminates the need for each
and every application having to come up
with and implement a logging mechanism
on their own and also means that logging
can be configured and controlled in a
centralized location the syslog standard
uses facilities and severity x' to
categorize messages facilities are used
to indicate what type of program or what
part of the system the message
originated from for example messages
that are labeled with a kernel facility
originated from the Linux kernel
severity x' on the other hand are used
to categorize messages based on their
urgency the severity czar emergency
alert critical error warning notice and
info a syslog server accepts syslog
messages and processes those messages
based on a set of configurable rules
traditionally the syslog d daemon filled
this role but many Linux distributions
now ship with alternatives such as our
syslog and syslog in G by the way in G
stands for next-generation a syslog
service uses configurable logging rules
to determine what to do with the given
message these rules use combinations of
facilities and severity x' in most cases
messages are simply written to a file in
the VAR log directory somewhere but you
can do advanced things such as send the
messages over the network to a central
location if you want to generate your
own log messages for example when you're
writing shell scripts use the logger
command-line utility to automatically
prune
and keep your disks from filling up with
old messages use the log rotate utility
speaking of deaths and filling up disks
let's move on to disk management now
when a disk or storage device is
partitioned it's divided into parts and
each one of those parts is therefore
called a partition now partitioning a
disk allows you to allocate different
sections of that disk for different
purposes there are two types of
partition tables one is the MBR
partition table MBR stands for Master
Boot Record and it's an older technology
that can only address up to two
terabytes of storage space now it's
quickly being replaced by GPT which
stands for GID partition table okay
so now the acronym in the acronym GUI D
stands for global unique identifier and
GPT supports up to 128 partitions and
storage devices up to nine point four
Zeta byte a mount point is simply a
directory that is used to access the
data on a partition at the very least
there will be one partition mounted on
slash any additional partitions will be
mounted on mount points below /in the
directory tree for example if you
allocate a partition for user home
directories that partition would be
mounted at /home the files and
directories that are at or below the
home mount point will reside on that
partition for example the files in my
home directory ford slash home forward
slash Jason are actually on the
partition mounted at ford slash home in
this particular example when performing
interactive Linux installations you'll
most likely end up using a partitioning
tool provided by that Linux distribution
however if you want to manipulate disks
after the initial installation you need
to use a standard Linux tool the eff
Disk Utility has been traditionally used
to create and modify partitions on the
disk but there are other viable
alternatives including G disk and parted
before a partition can be used by a
Linux system it needs a file system you
can use that mkf
command to create file systems simply
provide the file system type to the
Dashti option and then provide a path to
the device for the partition once you
have a file system created you can mount
that file system using the mount command
just follow the format that you see here
on your screen it's melt followed by the
path to the device and finally the mount
point to show how much disk space is in
use use the DF command which you can
think of as the disk free command if you
want to disconnect a file system from
the Linux server use the you melet's
command
now that's unmount without the first in
supply the mail point or the device to
unmount that device in order to control
what file systems get mounted where and
in what order use the Etsy FS tab file
FS tab is short for file system table
the first column in the FS tab is used
to specify what device you want to mount
the next column is the mount point or
where that partition is going to be
attached to the filesystem the third
column tells Linux what type of file
system resides on that partition the
fourth field is used for any mount
options that you want to specify the
fifth field controls how the dump backup
utility behaves in reality no one uses
dump any longer so you can just ignore
that column the final column tells fsck
which is the filesystem check utility
what order to perform file system checks
at boot time not only can you use device
pass to control mal points you can use
labels and uu IDs a UUID is a
universally unique identifier to view
the labels and UUID so the storage
devices attached to your system use the
LS blk space - F command or the blk ID
command each filesystem type has a
utility to create disk labels for
extended file systems which is one of
the most commonly used Linux file
systems you can use the e to label
command to set the label of a dead
or partition let's move on to accounts
each account consists of a username and
a unique number called the UID
which is short for user ID also each
account has a default group to which it
belongs some comments associated with
that account a shell to start when the
user logs into the system and a home
directory and all this information is
stored in the Etsy password file and
note that Etsy password is spelled pas
swd historically encrypted password
information was also stored in the Etsy
password file however the Etsy password
file is actually readable by anyone on
the system so storing password
information even though it's encrypted
is actually a security risk so now by
default the encrypted password
information is stored and forward slash
Etsy 4 / shadow and that file is only
readable by the super user or the root
account on the system managing users on
a Linux system is fairly straightforward
if you want to create an account use the
user add command and to delete accounts
while you use the userdel' command and
to modify existing accounts just use the
user mod command now these commands here
listed on your screen are the low level
Linux commands and they're available on
all the Linux distributions however some
distros provide their own account
creation tools that you can use if you
so choose just like the Etsy password
file contains account information while
the Etsy group file contains group
information to create a group use the
group add command the group del command
will delete a group and to modify a
group while you sleep group mod command
to see what groups an account is in use
the groups command if you specify an
account after the groups command it will
show all the group memberships for that
specified account if you happen to
execute the group's command without any
arguments it displays the groups that
the current user is in if you want to
switch to another account use the su
command which stands for switch user to
verify what account you're currently
using simply run the Who am I
command and it will return the account
name the sudo command is used to allow
one user to run commands as another user
this is most commonly used to allow a
normal user to execute a program as the
super user so you can think of sudo as
super user do to start a shell as
another user run sudo space dash S or
you can also run sudo su by the way the
file that stores the sudo configuration
is Etsy sudoers to modify the sudo erse
file use the VI sudo command
it has syntax checking built-in so you
don't accidentally break the sudo
configuration Linux servers are most
commonly connected to a tcp/ip network
so we're going to spend the next couple
of minutes here talking about networking
now the tcp/ip protocol is the de facto
standard for transmitting data over a
network
tcp/ip stands for transmission control
protocol and Internet Protocol for
device on a network to communicate
properly it needs three pieces of
information those are an IP address a
subnet mask and a broadcast address each
one of these IP addresses or numbers is
comprised of four octet
separated by a dot an octet represents
eight bits and therefore can have a
value starting at 0 and going up to 255
the class of an address determines what
a portion is used as the network address
and what portion is used for host
addresses by looking at the first octet
of an IP address you can tell what class
it is in an IP address with a first
octet that falls anywhere between 0 and
127 is a Class A IP address by the way
IP addresses that start with 0 in the
first octet are actually reserved for
special use cases and they're not
normally assignable IP addresses now
Class B addresses begin with 128 0 and
end at 191 255 Class C addresses start
with 192 dot 0 0 and end with 223 dot
255
2:55 a class determines the possible
number of networks and the addressable
space per network for example a class a
network can accommodate about 16 million
host addresses
whereas a Class C Network can only
address 255 hosts a subnet mask splits
an IP address into two parts the first
part is the network address or network
ID the second part is the host address
the network portion of an IP address
corresponds to the 255 s in the subnet
mask for a standard class a network the
subnet mask is 255 0 0 0 since the first
octet is used to identify networks and
the remaining three octets are used for
host addresses cid are sometimes
pronounced cider stands for classless
inter-domain routing it allows networks
to be subdivided regardless of their
traditional class by explicitly
assigning subnet masks these subdivide
networks are called subnets also there
are IP addresses that are dedicated for
use in private networks these private
addresses are also called non-routable
IPS since they are not routed through
the public Internet to show the current
IP address of your linux server or to
get a list of all the IP addresses and
use on your Linux system run IP space
address or if config that's AF conf IG
at this point really the if config
utility is considered deprecated but you
can still find it installed by default
on many Linux distributions a host is a
device connected to a network since
we're talking about tcp/ip networking a
host in this case is a device with an IP
address a host name on the other hand is
simply a human readable name that
corresponds to an IP address you can run
the hostname command to display the
hostname of your Linux system you can
also run you name space - in if you want
to display the fqdn or fully qualified
domain name run hostname space - F the
Etsy host file on a Linux system
contains a list of
P addresses and host names after you
create an entry and Etsy hosts you can
start communicating with that IP address
by using the name you've specified in
the host file this can be useful if you
want to communicate with computers that
do not have dns host names also it's a
common practice to override the DNS
entry of a system for example if you
have a cluster of web servers you
probably have a private network that
only the web cluster members can access
you can create an entry for those
members of the cluster in the Etsy hosts
file and use their private addresses
thus forcing network communications
through the private network typically
the Etsy hosts file is checked first
before a DNS server is queried but you
can actually change this behavior by
editing the Etsy NS switch comp file in
SS stands for name service switch and it
controls the order in which lookups are
performed the primary purpose of DNS
which stands for domain name system is
to translate human readable names into
IP addresses of course DNS does the
reverse - as it can translate IP
addresses into host names if you want to
lookup or resolve a DNS name or an IP
address you can use the host or dig
tools and their most simplest forms you
just specify the IP address or a DNS
name that you want to look up as an
argument to one of those commands and
they'll reply with the appropriate
response
just like IP addresses identify hosts on
a network ports identified the services
on a host when a service starts on the
system it binds itself to a port and
listens for traffic destined for that
port ports range from 1 to 65535 ports
from 1 through a thousand 23 are called
well-known ports or system ports these
ports are pre assigned ports and are
used for common system services these
ports are also called privileged ports
since it requires super user privileges
to open these ports ports above a
thousand 24 can be opened and used by
normal users on a system and are called
unproved
which two ports DHCP stands for a
dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP
is primarily used to assign IP addresses
to hosts on a network you have to decide
if you want the network interfaces on
your system to use DHCP or static
addresses for Red Hat based systems this
configuration is stored in the Etsy sis
config network - scripts directory there
is a configuration file for each network
interface on the system in that
directory for Debian based distros like
a bun to the network configuration is
stored in the Etsy network interfaces
file you can manually assign IP
addresses to network interfaces by using
the IP or if config commands however
many Linux distributions include if up
and if down scripts that can be used to
easily bring a network interface up or
down now quickly a GUI is a graphical
user interface and a tui is a textual
user interface some distros come with
GUI or tooie tools that you can use to
configure these network settings on a
linux server instead of editing the
configuration files by hand these tools
include nmt UI and system - config -
network for Red Hat based systems and
yes for su se systems one Linux system
can be running multiple processes and
obviously performing many different
tasks at the same time to query the
process table and see what processes are
currently running on a system use the PS
command the most helpful options - PS
are actually - EF which shows every
process and a full format listing so
remember PS space - EF if you want to
stop the execution of a command that you
entered in on the command line simply
type control C if you want to suspend
that currently running foreground
process type ctrl Z to send that
suspended process to the background so
that it keeps running use the BG command
when you're ready to bring that job back
to the foreground type FG to display a
list of jobs use the jobs command if you
want to kill
or a job use the kill command and supply
the process ID or the job ID if you need
to repeat a task on a schedule use the
cron service the cron service is a
time-based job scheduling service that
starts when the system boots cron jobs
are often used to automate a process or
perform routine system maintenance such
as rotating log files to free up disk
space you can schedule cron jobs by
using the crontab command you can see
the format of a cron job here on your
screen if you're going to be using Linux
systems then you need to know how to
install software on them well packages
are used to do that on Linux systems you
can manipulate packages with a package
manager and two of the most popular
package formats are rpm and Debian or
Deb for short for rpm based
distributions like Red Hat and CentOS
use the yum and rpm commands to manage
packages or Debian based distributions
like a bun to use apt and dpkg if you
