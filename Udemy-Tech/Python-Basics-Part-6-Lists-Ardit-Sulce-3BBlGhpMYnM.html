previous lecture we were looking at
strings and indexing and splitting
strings and I will be working with lists
which are very similar to strings they
are similar because they are both
referred to as sequences so there are
sequences of items the difference is
that I like the oven Python see the
difference is that a string is made of
other strings so it can contain only
string so characters or strings whatever
you like to call it
however lists can contain various other
data types let's say H a letter a number
and also a string so this is a string
the first one this is a number an
integer this is also string with
multiple characters and that is a list
so for this you want to use square
brackets to create a list execute you
can call it and so this is a list of
three items and you can also store other
objects in a list but we'll cover other
objects in later sections you know we
have table of objects with lots of data
you may store files in a list you may
store widgets or graphical user
interface that you are building as well
so these are very useful analysts also
have indexing and you can split list you
can extract items and so on - the good
news is a three at least have the same
indexing system as strings and so you
learned that in the previous lecture and
you can go ahead and apply that system
not see let's extract number two that
would have an index of one execute that
oh yeah you get to there if you check
the type you'll see that on integer so
every item of lease has its own data
type you can also access more than one
one item off the list let's say well the
first two items you do so you want to so
like that or zero to two whatever you
like now that will produce another list
so the type of this split is a list the
type of the split of a string is a
string so as for the string here see for
the list least now have methods
associated with them just like strings
do and so you can check what methods you
have available there but just doing deer
list so list is the blueprints you can
use least you can pass empty square
brackets in there it's the same thing
and then you can use help to look at
each of these methods so these are the
methods without the under school and
let's look at the append methods so to
apply method you do see the dontation
append and here
oh that three but what that does is it
adds another item to the ends or to the
end of list so it depends on item to the
list and you can explore the other
methods if you like so let's say help
remove like that and you'll see how to
use that remove method so you do see
remove and then you pass the value of
the item that you want to remove some
other index about the value let's say we
want to remove two and you see that two
is now gone from the list
so you look at the other methods of the
lease and try to experiment with lease
and play around with them access items
and split them and you'll be good to go
then you know thanks I'll talk to you
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
