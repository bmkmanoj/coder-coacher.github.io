more time or are you gonna see me plenty
of times you know you're not gonna be
able to see my face in this video
because this video or this lecture is
going to be about using the packet
tracer yes
using the packet tracer I've got a lot
of requests for people let me know hey
how do you use it I don't understand how
do you connect from here to there so
we're gonna take a look at the packet
tracer I'm gonna take our time I'm gonna
be an hour long video but it it will
show you what you need to know for
people like me that can't see okay on
the top you have a menu bar I'll go to
options and I'll go to preferences and
get this window right here alright and
there's the packet tracer 7.0 there's a
newer version 7.1 one of the things that
you want to have is this guy right here
always show port labels it's unchecked
by default it is turned off by default
make sure they turn that on so you can
see the interfaces that you're connected
to right away that's one of the key
things there okay after you finish your
configurations after you finish your
configurations for your devices and
stuff you can export a log into a text
file that's pretty cool because I'll
give you everything you've done for all
your for your routers individually
obviously and you can see and you can
just keep a copy of it so you know
exactly what you could type instead of
you know doing yourself by my hand
the next tab down we'll talk about is
the font tab as you can see I have it at
18 for the CLI I'm not gonna talk about
anything else I mean you can play with
the color of the background with the CMD
and something like that I'm not worried
about that my concern is the CLI so I
make sure that that's very high one I
can't see and to make sure that
everybody out there can see so I turn
that all the way up to 18 I think it
goes it goes up to 20 but I think 18 is
good 20 will be an overkill I just apply
it it looks like nothing happened but it
did
okay so again this would be under
Oh your menu bar under options and then
preferences okay preferences that's one
thing to always keep in mind you have
you're just being smart you have a tool
bar that's gonna give you four new open
save prints you know all you means about
all these different things well now they
do have something called the logical
topology and behind it you have the
physical topology I've never used the
physical topology since I've been doing
this I do the logical topology alright
but if you go into you know colleges and
whatnot and they want to go into
whatever scenario that's cool I mean
there's nothing wrong with that getting
it really advanced labs they go ahead
into the physical apology to make you do
things okay but for the most part
especially those you're taking this a
like I never plus or CCNA or see sense
good enough good enough all the way to
the right we have our pointer we have
the one that allows us to put text on
the screen okay so we can put text on
the screen or we can delete there's an X
we click on the X and then we simply
click here
careful careful because if you do have
something selected already hit the X
you're gonna delete that so you don't
want that you have your magnifying glass
you can actually create shapes and let's
get drawn in elliptical this palette
dialog you can select what is it that
you want to draw do you want to have an
outline do you want to have a fill color
let's say you do want to have a fill
color well so like the full color that's
like this color right here and we click
OK and then the color that we selected
was the rectangle here okay cool we just
see how we got those crosshairs and then
we just were and I forget on a fill
color why not
why didn't I get a fill color I mean all
of that instead so color Oh had the
wrong thing selected sorry it's not
doing it for me so it again alright yeah
so I fill color fill the color
the circle supposedly is red it's not
changing there's one more time make it
purple okay and we got me an outline
right against like that that's the only
one okay now I did it see that this and
again this is a simulator you will have
things having to you again just make
sure that you just do it over and over
again so you get eyes you can see look
see I'm gonna go ahead and select all
these right here they're selected
already I was gonna click X you sure you
want to delete this yes I do
so be very careful obviously below
though the palate dialogue you have your
resize shapes if you wanted to and you
have these envelopes now these envelopes
will come into play
these are simple PDUs or they're more
complex people use alright so if you
want to go at the very bottom you see it
says real time real time right behind
that if you click that tab on the back
you see that you can actually use those
envelopes if you had you know routers
and switches out here instead of pinging
you can select a simple PDU which will
give you this envelope right here you
see me I'm going around yay it's a
simple one you click on the first device
click on the second device and it'll
show up here and then you will just go
ahead and auto capture and play and will
do it and it'll go ahead and do a
regular ping that you said will take
going doing the are coming back down
going back up going across playing boom
coming back up going back and all that
good stuff so you'll see it happening if
you want it to so it's pretty cool that
does that don't forget to go back to
your real time so you can do whatever
you need to do okay now on the bottom
towards the left side on the very corner
on the bottom left you have your routers
you have your switches you have your
hubs which we don't use we have wireless
devices we have cables okay and then
when this is cheating like I sometimes
do them because it'll select the cable
you need
for you this is your console cable this
is just straight through cable twisted
pair cabling crossover cable okay fiber
optics this is for phones right viewing
analog phones these are your serial DC
because this means the clock rate
therefore hey here's a clock okay yeah
but notice your DT and this is something
new which is called it octal which is
really one cable with eight different
connectors on it you're not gonna use it
for the CCNA I don't okay so how do we
get things out there oh and by the way
on the lower left hand corner you have
any devices obviously that you can
select all right you have a firewall if
you have the license like a s550 500
okay you have cloud base if you're doing
some sort of frame relay connections or
whatever else are you doing and then you
just have customized made devices you
need to do this is pretty interesting I
like this one is gonna click and drag
this out there so you can see what I'm
talking about on the zoom in to it you
can actually if you're in a classroom
setting or you know in a company but
really the lab environments where you're
gonna do this so people can learn and
what have you you can actually peer if
you're not work together within your
classroom you can use these clouds to
connect these peer clouds to other
pocket racers so you're within the same
network doesn't matter what network you
have in here songs as appropriate your
routing appropriately your your configs
within your packet racers are correct
you can actually peer to another packet
tracer it's very nice very good to do
but one of the things that you need to
do with that believe is in tools know
it's multi-year in extensions and multi
users all right you will go to listen
and you need to make sure you need to
find out hey what am i listening on and
what is a port number and you have a
password that you can set it says always
accept existing remote networks new
remote networks always and I didn't do
it to always accept however you want to
do it just to make it easy but you will
need to go into that menu which is
extensions multi-user and then listen
alright you need to know the IP address
and the port number that you're using
you see it's already populated here and
you can password protect it or you can
stop from listening we're happy but
we're not gonna do that but I know that
the pirate racer has a cap that capacity
that capability of doing that particular
one all right so how do we start setting
things up well normally I used normally
the 18:41 routers it's completely up to
you you choose whatever you want
alright you click up here I say practice
with each one 1941 1841 and the reason
that he's doing that you see how I put
it up here and it skips down because I'm
zoomed in that's why it does that
ok now by default I'm gonna open this up
and I'm gonna open it up nice and big
I'm gonna all right so you guys can see
it and I'm going to zoom in right here
you can see the 1840 long routers you
have your slots right here this is where
you can put any one of these interfaces
on these particular slots look at where
the iOS is going to be these are those
compact flash cards ok that's why you
don't put routers where people can get
access to it because I can simply press
that button and Boop out comes your
flash ok so you have your slot cards you
have your Ethernet ports you have your
console port and you have your auxiliary
port all right turn it on turn it off
and force your power adapter this is not
hot swappable ladies and gentlemen so if
I wanted to add port here let's say
we're adding WIC one T's right Y WIC one
t /y week one T's or Y week two T's
what's the difference there's the
difference this is only one slot it's
slower as far as the bandwidth is
concerned this is considered a smart
cereal why they call it that I have no
clue alright find out for me let me know
alright but you have two ports and the
bandwidth is much faster okay so
normally what I do is I just take it
from you know from here if I'm not gonna
use that take it out I can get up okay
there you go it's picky I hope it
already
I can I can do that year okay
week to teen and this is important and
then you turn on the router again this
is important because if you're out there
trying to purchase a router one of the
things I can ask you what cars do you
want you see there's different ones
alright there's easy ones with Ethernet
ports one with fiber so yeah make sure
to see what is it yeah high bandwidth so
all that you need to take in
consideration if you are purchasing the
equipment are you gonna have any WIC
slots and how many fascinating reports
do you have or can you get a slot with
more fast ethernet or Ethernet ports if
you want to alright so let's go ahead we
have this router okay let's go ahead do
the other router same damn it's gonna
chart off I'll put a wick 1t right here
boom turn it back on
don't forget to turn it back on turn it
back off turn off went to T boom turn on
all right now for our purposes we're
gonna go ahead and use a serial cable
okay so we're gonna simulate that there
and different you know I think cities
let's say I can click on the actual name
here and I can say no but we say router
Wan writer towards me you probably want
we call this mi a for Miami
we call this NYC
oh that's excited there alright and then
we can call this Texas
alright so we're creating a circle Nitro
and actually you would have a cloud here
and this is the reality of it using a
frame relay or what have you
MPLS high res that you're going across
okay but for just lab purposes we're
gonna go ahead and use a console cable
because CCNA the last few this serial 0
0 0 2 serial 0 hey go inside this rock
green if this happens and you want to
change your mind go back and click on
the cable go back into NYC and you see
what I did I put a wick 1 teen in there
that's why only had that one I didn't
want that
that's because that's an issue different
bandwidth now that won't work but it's
different bandwidth so why would I do
that
as usual zero and zero zero one there
you go see why you want to have things
pop up so you know what's what and then
we click again clock rate at 0 0 and
then 0 0 there you go so now we have
that particular network right there
but we need IP addresses we need IP
addresses okay so what now where I click
on the middle notepad thing here I click
over here it goes where everyone's
10.1.1.1 are 30 there is your favorite
stuff right IPS
all right you have to appease this is 5
this is 6 all right and you see when
it's red like that I'm gonna click away
and I'm just gonna go right over it I'm
gonna click on it that means I selected
it so I'm gonna do a ctrl C and then
click away control B there it is see how
easy that is
it's simple look how quickly we're
setting up our network packet tracer
especially for very basic certifications
it's good enough it's good enough don't
mind if I throw it's not the real thing
wise it's it's it's a fake simulator
it's like it's a simulator to simulating
an actual router ok and you're taking a
test
ok so don't nobody tell you any
different and then you come over here to
end devices alright I'm not gonna put a
switch ba you know what let's put a
switch anyway so I'll go to switches and
I'll use a 29:16 I'll just put one under
Miami alright and then I'm gonna put one
under Texas alright and then we're gonna
put go to end devices and one for the
computer of course there it is down
there I'm zoomed in and I'll put one
there now me personally I like to you
can cheat I'll show you how to cheat you
get that right there because I'm a
lightning bolt and then I click on this
lightning bolt then I'll choose the
cable for you
but it won't let you choose the port it
will just choose the first available for
maybe in this case is everyone or if you
know what you're doing you know PC the
switch is a straight-through you get
this one cop or straight through you
click on the PC tells you all will port
you wanna go to oh well that's a season
important of course and then we'll use
the same port right here okay and I like
to use that because I like to use the
last available port which is not bigger
but it's obviously but I'm gonna do
fasces in the you know 24 to the fancy
there 0 0 I just like doing it that way
it's just me you want to do it any other
way
knock yourself out as long as you know
what you're connecting to okay this is
not setting stone ladies and gentlemen
all right it's your network do what you
want okay but if it's a real world
environment please you know aim document
everything and then we're just gonna put
the IP addresses for these networks 492
the one six eight dot one dot 0 last 24
make it very simple we're gonna just
understand how to play with it how to
make it all right
that's read control C control V and then
obviously this will be the to network oh
and there you go
you just created a little topology with
its networks right yeah one broadcast
domain to broadcast domain three
broadcast to me for broadcast domain
okay that's just where it is and then
collision domains yeah one collision
domain two collision domain three
collision domain well it's really one
two so this is configure to another port
so one two three four five six six
collision wings alright but we're really
kind of broadcast so that's basically it
and then when you want to configure
something you want to click on that
device was that cannot launch PC
software okay there's been giving me
errors lately I don't know why just the
way it is
you click on the PC and then you have
tabs the same thing you have tabs on
your router your switch and you you go
to config you go to the desktop you go
to IP and we're in the one that works
for you but 192 don't 168 not one not
one you can tab and put the default
which is fine and then the Gateway
192.168.1.254 last why are you using
that scheme because I want to okay
because I don't follow the rules okay
they always to tell me no you can't do
that Microsoft states at the first ten
and the eleven and the next number
it's my network I want to understand in
my way I put whatever it is that I want
okay
and especially if I'm doing it in a
simulator alright so this is I always
use my last available IP address for the
subnet as the gateway I don't care what
it is it's just just me okay and then
you do the same thing over here
I was in a different network 192.168.1
192.168.255.255
you can expand this and they can you
start typing away I enable config T
equals name is one and so forth there's
not a configuration classes just to show
you right now you we got into it by
clicking on it right just like we can
click into the router and go into the
see your line right when we say no and
we just start we're in the router but
normally you would use a console cable
click on the computer click on rs-232
let's say the switch right and the
console cable but you can only do that
on one this doesn't have only one serial
port so you need to go then if they on
the other computer click on accounts
rs-232 go and now I just want to connect
to a router and we'll select console so
what happens how do you use that cable
instead
just clicking on it well in the computer
you have something called a trade or
desktop tab you have the terminal
session so you click on terminal session
these alone learn these know these if
they ask you question in the test about
these this is what it is okay that's it
that's all you need to know this is what
it is do not go off on a tangent don't
try and be changing stuff this is what
it is I can tell you this much change
this number go ahead are you gonna get a
whole bunch of different funny little
things little hearts and stars and
exclamation marks or you're gonna go
ahead and be so slow then you'll type
the you know cone you type C you'll be
waiting for it to come out
all right so leave it as is okay and
there you are
but you see how small that font is
that's what your purposes come in and
you may want to increase that the CLI
for or the terminal session or that
preference is that you make this bigger
alright you make this bigger but you're
in a few pipe and for no you're not in
the router and this is how really how
you're gonna do it in your test through
a terminal session through a console
cable okay but that's the way you do it
here now similar I will just simply
click on there go to CLI tab and knock
yourself out it's not configuring but
that's it that's always to remain you
save it and listen the packet tracer you
save it it'll tell you to save it again
after you close even though you saved it
it'll tell you save it again it does
that watch I'll show you
I'm gonna save I'm going to go to just
put on a desktop
I'm gonna put on a desktop I'm gonna
call it practice or learning how to use
the PT not physical training but a
packet tracer right click Save they say
I say that you saw me save it you can
see it right up here or in red account
or not in the title bar all there is hey
this is where it's at this is what it's
called so I'm gonna close the packet
tracer and it's gonna tell you any
unsaved changes will be lost
do you want to save your work so it's
like I guess a
let me make sure I do save it just in
case I didn't save it and you click yes
okay and you click yes well that's it
that's all there is to the packet tracer
is very easy and simple to use this is
les see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
