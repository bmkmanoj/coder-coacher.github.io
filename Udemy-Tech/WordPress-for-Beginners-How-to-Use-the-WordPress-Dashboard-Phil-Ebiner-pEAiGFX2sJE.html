video I'm going to give you a free
preview of a lesson from my wordpress
for beginners course on udemy calm in
this lesson I show you how to navigate
the WordPress dashboard once you have
WordPress installed now you have a
WordPress installation for your own
website whether it's through server
press or through your own hosting the
first thing that opens up is this
welcome mat and if you want WordPress
can help guide you through building your
own website but for those of you in this
class you probably don't need any help
because that's what I'm here for so just
click that I don't need help button this
is your homepage this is the dashboard
of WordPress and in this video I just
want to quickly go over the main menu
and help you navigate getting around
WordPress you can see on the left hand
side a menu with different options right
now we're highlighted on the dashboard
and that's because we're on the
dashboard there's a lot of things
happening right now and when you first
install WordPress a lot of things are
going to be needed to be updated or
installed because with the latest
versions of WordPress depending on who
you're hosting with they will already
come pre-installed with certain plugins
or certain tools for example with Bluest
we already have this Bluehost this
marketplace option things you might not
see if you're using server press contact
form
optinmonster these are plugins that are
pre-installed when we installed via
Bluehost don't worry if you don't see
these that's okay the main things you
need to know are the dashboard this is
your homepage we're going to learn how
to customize it and really dive into
what you can do on your homepage in a
future lesson going down the left-hand
menu we have this first plug-in it's
kind of an all-star plug-in called
jetpack and this comes with a ton of
cool tools we're going to be going over
all the different plugins and tools that
I recommend in a later section below
that we have our posts now when you
hover over some of these menu items a
different sub
menu pops up so for example under posts
you can click all posts to view all of
the posts you've written and post think
of posts as your articles or your blog
post you can click add new or you can
see your categories and tags media this
is all of your uploads such as photos or
files that you upload pages these are
all the pages of your website again you
see the submenu where you can view all
pages or you can click add new to add a
new page I'm gonna skip over contact
form because that's only for this
install of WordPress you have comments
so if you have comments on your website
you can moderate them their appearance
this is a very important one where you
were going to customize your theme your
menus what everything looks like and
we're going to be diving into this in
the next lesson including installing and
finding a new theme plugins are all
kinds of tools that you can install for
your website doing everything from
commenting security contact form social
media sharing SEO all kinds of things
happen with the plugins users you can
add users to your website if you want to
have other authors or other people who
help with your website that's in this
user menu tools this is another menu
that when you do install certain plugins
you might actually have more tools
appear under this menu and then same
with settings we have some basic
settings for how our website works in
terms of which page is the homepage
verses the blog page if comments appear
or not different things that we'll be
covering in the rest of this course up
at the very top you have our site title
which we didn't edit when we installed
WordPress via Bluehost but we're going
to edit that in a moment and if you want
to view your site you can just click
this view site button then you have
these different icons up here some refer
to comments if you have any comments you
have a new button if you want to easily
and quickly add a new post page user or
upload new media and then for me I have
this marketplace which is there because
I downloaded via Bluehost and so there's
different marketplace options so let me
just click on that and I'll show you
what it looks like
so because I installed with Bluehost
Bluehost gives us all kinds of tools and
things that we can use right within our
WordPress site we're not going to use
this tool because I'm going to be
showing you free tools and other plugins
that I suggest using so back to our site
I clicked visit site and it opened up
this new tab and here is our website
it's already up there live and if anyone
goes to it you can see this now at this
point if you actually go to eben or
designs com it might not be live I'm
probably not gonna publish it for the
world to see but if you have created
your website and you share your link
this is what it's going to look like now
WordPress has pre-installed a theme that
I'm using right now each year WordPress
comes out with a custom theme so this is
the 2017 theme but we're going to be
looking into installing a new theme in
the next lesson so that's the basic
WordPress layout the main thing when you
log in is you'll appear on your
dashboard and one other thing I'll
mention is updates this is something you
should do every time you log in go under
dashboard to the updates to see if there
are any updates for your website this
might include updates for plugins for
themes or for WordPress itself right now
I'm using WordPress version four point
seven point two
but sometimes WordPress does get a
facelift or some sort of update that
might have to do with security so you
want to make sure that you're updating
to the latest forms of your plugins or
themes or whatever so to do that you
will click on whatever needs to be
updated and then click update plugins
now there are other ways to update
individual plugins via that plug-in page
but that's the easiest way right from
this updates page now I've updated that
plug-in that was already pre-installed
and I have no more notifications for
updates cool so that's it for the
dashboard right now in the next lesson
I'm going to show you how to install a
new theme thanks for watching like I
