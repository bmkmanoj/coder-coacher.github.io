mega cause beef Terry old applications
course hosted on udemy it has 24 hours
of content and you can find the link of
course down in the descriptions together
with a discount coupon code having
thousands of students on my a Python
course and thousands of questions from
students or in the question and area
section inside the course has led me to
understand what are some common problems
that students face with Python or some
errors that they make in the code and I
spent hours and hours trying to
understand them so if you're a beginner
in Python
please watch this video because this
will help you to understand some common
problems with Python and it will save
you time one of these problems occur all
right so one very easy thing that
students don't realize is that lists and
strings and tapas like for indexing for
vamp starts from zero so if you have a
list like a equals two one two three
you know a zero will return one biggest
one has an index of zero mm index of one
and three has an index of two also if
you do zero to two you'll get one and
two why because the list indexing
splitting is upper bound exclusive which
means the item with index two which is
item three it's not included in the
split so you only get zero and one and
then it stops there so this is the items
that's one of the confusing parts of - a
second misconception among students is
that when they define function they are
not sure whether to use the return or
print in the function if you use print
let's say this function returns x times
- so exit I'm still like that mm-hmm
so if you call the function and say you
passed a forgiver you're going to get
six the problem with this function is
that you know you can print the you can
call the function and the call with
execute whatever is inside here so in
this case it's you have a print function
inside the function so you'll get
printed this number however if you want
to use the function as you do in normal
programs in your real life programs if
you want to use the function for other
things let's say like that you want
multiply out you want to add let's say a
hundred to the function output you'd get
an error
it says unsupported overrun type 4 plus
non type and int so these critters ain't
non type actually a non type is returned
when there is no return statement here
so basically this function is not
producing anything of course it does the
instructions you have given it here but
if you call it this it's actually type 3
so it's non type therefore the correct
way to normally call a function would be
to use return instead x times two then
you can print the output and of course
you can do math operations now because
this will actually be equal to 6 so k3
is it equal to 6
yes it is it's true so use return
instead of print unless you have a
specific reason not to deserve another
misconception is about printing you know
in this is an interactive shell and here
you can assign a variable like that be
equal to 6 and then you can just
called be and you go you get six bring
it all directly or you can do print B
and you get six so it's the same thing
but since you are in the interactive
shell Python assumes that if you're
calling B and you you want to print it
out over if I exit this and I create a
file a Python file assign B 60 and I
just got be there and like execute that
file I'll not get any output because I
didn't print out the file so in a Python
script things have to be explicit this
is different from the Python shell okay
that's about it something else student
students ask is they say how how do you
know what methods to use for example
let's say I want to replace a oh so you
get this excuse to say oh how do you
know all these methods well I don't know
all these methods i but i can use cold
introspection to get a list of methods
right like say let's say dear or did the
shrink to see what methods you can apply
to that stream and you can see that the
replace is here and there are also other
things like lower but if you don't know
what lower is you can use the help
function all did dot lower like that
onion you get the description for that
method are you doing a copy of a string
as converted to lower case so this is a
string let me demonstrate this like that
with brackets methods work with brackets
and yeah this will lower the case of the
first letter actually all the letters
when this case since this was the only
upper case you see this so dear and help
are two very important functions in
Python remember that this doesn't have
to be a string instance it can be the
key word STR and you get the same output
so STR actually type off or did is STR
okay I'm a problem that students usually
have is when they try to install
something with people like people's tall
volume let's say and they execute this
and they'll get an error it says that
people's not recognized in your system
and so on
well you can use an alternative just
like you executor
whether you use Python or Python three I
use Python 3 so you can access pip via
Python commands or Python 3 commands and
you pass em and then pip install for you
I forgive that and that will install the
library so that's an alternative to pip
install volume alright
some students ask oh how do you know
what library to use and how how can you
use these libraries for something you
want to do well the answer is I don't
know all the libraries out there but if
I I want to create something let's say I
was given a task to to read an excel
file which has a thousand records and in
each of these a thousand records there
are some instructions on creating one
thousand text files with some content
inside so if I don't know how to do this
with Python what you do is you're going
to do some Google research you know how
to manipulate Excel files how to create
text files and so there are
forums on the web that's what people I
have asked today's questions before and
so you need to do some research to read
some some posts and if you're not clear
yet just post a question on forums such
as they reddit.com are sorry comm slash
are slash learn Python or Stack Overflow
calm anyway people will suggest
libraries that you can use for such a
task now the particular question about
manipulating the Excel files would bring
me to the palace library and so pandas
how to use panels then well you're going
to go to the panels official web page
which is the first Google first result
of Google and then go to the
documentation of pandas and usually
they're there is a tutorials tutorial on
the documentation in here tutorials or
you can get this at ten minutes to
pandas so you go in Portales SPD you
know to get familiar with with Panasonic
works and you can browse through the
menu of the food documentation you can
see excel here so it's very easy to a
load excel data into Python like that so
it's quite a documented library and of
course then you can use the dear and
help commands inside Python to explore
more about panels import and as dear
panels you see what things you have here
like you have read read excel so pandas
read excel and you can pass a file an
excel file there to load it as a table
in Python so this is approach basically
and these are I think some very common
questions from students who are just
starting out with Python and I hope you
find this useful all right remember if
you want a complete program for learning
Python you can take the Python mega
course give 10 real-world applications
I'm the author of the course and inside
of course you'll find 24 hours of video
content and text lectures and thousands
of exercises quit quizzes and you can
also ask me questions in the question
and area section inside the course and
I'll be happy to help you and as a
follower of this YouTube channel you can
get a course for a deep discount for
that you simply follow the link in the
descriptions below and you'll be able to
enroll in the course for a very cheap
price get it now and I hope to see you
inside course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
