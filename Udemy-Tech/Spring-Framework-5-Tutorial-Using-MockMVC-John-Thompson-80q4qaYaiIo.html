introduce you to spring mock MVC test
now this is a feature that was added to
spring around Version three three two I
think and it gives us capability to test
spring MVC controllers and actually unit
test them and it's gonna bring in a mock
servlet context so it controllers can be
tricky little beasts to test when you're
you're looking at testing things like
response codes and media types and
different things like that and a lot of
times to test like request path mapping
and things like that in the older days
you'd have to bring up an entire web
server to get this tested now we we have
the capability to do a mock web server
and I actually are not even using a mock
web server we're going through a mock
dispatch or server let and the spring
team has given us these tools that we
can utilize it and our tests around the
controller's now become very very
lightweight and you see a lot of people
testing this and bringing up the spring
context when you really don't need to
and I'm gonna show you how to use the
spring mock MVC in a standalone set up
so I'm IntelliJ and let's go ahead and
add a new test method doing command and
test method and we're going to do a test
mock MVC and the first thing we want to
do is create our mock MVC and alt enter
and we'll get that imported and we can
use a builder and we want to mock MVC
builders now you have two options here
standalone setup or web context setup
there's a lot of testing you'll see a
lot of examples using the web app
context setup and that's gonna bring up
a spring context and our tests will no
longer be a unit test so but standalone
tests we can do and keep our tests
running nice and fast and what it's
going to ask for is a controller or a
set of controller
and we have our controller that's being
configured already for us and this is a
builder so we want to say build so this
is running to build a pattern so now we
have our mock NBC and it's affluent I
have a P I so what I want to do is mock
and we see perform I want to say get and
the static imports are a little tricky
and I just type mock to narrow down
unless it seems like there's a thousand
static get methods and the one we want
is the mock NBC request builder so we're
gonna do a static import for that bring
that in and we want to say get from the
root context now we can say and expect
and this is another static import that
we want import that and we want the mock
and receive status and that's going to
assert that we get back a 200 status
from our controller which is exactly
what we want and expect and we have a
view again there's another static import
we're gonna say import that name index
so now let's go ahead and run this and
we can see that our test is running I'll
double check make sure that everything
runs we're on the whole class here and
with both our tests ok so you can see
how quick this is running and so there's
still a very much a unit test so we we
are using basically a mock servlet
context created by the guys at the
spring team and this gives us a lot a
lot of capabilities and that this is a
way I prefer to test spring MVC
controllers and it keeps your test very
light and you don't need to bring it be
bringing up the world in the spring
context so this is a just a great way to
be doing things and going forward in the
course we are going to be using this
quite a bit more I'm just showing you
the justjust meant to be an introduction
to mock NBC there's a lot more
capabilities here and we will definitely
be getting into those capabilities going
further or forward in the course
