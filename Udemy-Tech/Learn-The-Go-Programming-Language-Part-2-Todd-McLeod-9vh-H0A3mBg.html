why programming is so amazing and if you
program if you know how to program you
have a superpower knowing how to program
is like having a superpower because
knowing how to code if you know how to
code you people who program create and
destroy
let me flip at people who know how to
program destroy industries and create
entire new industries and that's an
incredible power and programmers like
the Silicon Valley it's an amazing place
and you know if you gain this ability to
code and and you totally can it's
totally within your ability to program
anybody can program if you gain that
ability to code you gain that superpower
you get to create applications which can
completely destroy industries and create
new industries and so I really love the
programming community because the
programming community is full of really
smart hard-working people and very
creative people and they look at the way
and they're very they're visionaries and
they're optimistic and they look at the
way things are being done and they say
how can we do them different and how can
we do them better and to me that's just
like everything I want to be smart
hardworking having fun
visionary looking at how things are
being done now and trying to figure out
how can we do them better how can we
make this planet better and and so
knowing how to program you get to join
that community you get to become a part
of it and and to become a part of it all
you have to do is say hey I want to
learn how to code and that's another
thing by the way that I really like
about the go programming language is
that it's got a really great community
so there's a lot of people just like me
who are right like you know genuinely
genuinely welcoming others and excited
and enthusiastic to have them come and
join the party and willing to help and
yeah just like all of that so different
different cultures different languages
have different programming cultures but
the go programming language has a great
culture they even have rules about their
culture that
say be nice that's my cliffnotes my
synopsis of the rules it's just like be
nice be good to each other and so the go
community's got is a great community and
being part of the programming community
is also a great thing and so learning to
code you're going to get this superpower
and one of the things I'll point you
towards and one of the things I always
like to show my students is that you
could go on to YouTube and that's where
you are right now and you could search
for Burning Man videos and so one of my
favorite YouTube Burning Man videos let
me bring it up here for you alright
sweet so here's my favorite YouTube
video about Burning Man and you could
find it by you know you tubing Burning
Man 2012 robot heart directed and shot
by cream Tabar so that deal right there
and not only is it a really cool song
but it also gives you some insight into
Burning Man and Burning Man is basically
the party that all of Silicon Valley
goes to for a week nine days every year
and so here are these really
hard-working super smart creative
superheroes who are destroying
industries and creating a whole new ones
making the world a better place but for
one week every year like all of the Bay
Area Silicon Valley basically becomes a
ghost town and everybody like 60,000
people go up to Burning Man and these
are people who have made tons of money
and so they throw this incredible party
out in the desert where they dress up
like their characters from another
planet you know literally when I was
there it felt like being in that bar in
the first Star Wars movie with all those
wild characters you could find whatever
you want there from art to anything else
and they have incredible art and people
in costumes and and and it's super cool
and super fun but that just kind of
gives you a taste of the programming
culture super smart super hard-working
super creative super innovative you know
super powers destroy industries create
new ones have a good time work hard play
hard have fun make money make the world
a better place like to me that's really
what it's all about programming and so
this is like one of the videos that
really represents that for me and then
the other video I'm gonna bring that up
here for you too alright sweet so here
are those other videos I want to show
you there's
two videos that I came across recently
which I really liked and one is a really
quick questions with Geo hots George
Hotz and you could Google that really
quick questions with George Hotz but he
created comma AI he was the first person
to jailbreak the iPhone when he was like
18 and now he's jailbroken the Toyota
and the Honda and you could for like
eight hundred fifty bucks you could buy
equipment from him to make your Honda or
Toyota a self-driving car , AI is the
website you could go check it out comma
AI and here it is like whoa right like
makin ghost riding for the masses he
calls it but he created this thing where
you could turn your Twitter Honda and a
self-driving car for 850 bucks pretty
amazing and this is a really awesome
interview and if you look for other
interviews about him you'll find him and
he's a guy who's really into machine
learning and artificial intelligence
which is the next big thing but it's fun
just kind of meet some of the
personalities be behind these different
programmers and see like wow actually
the programming culture and the
programming community is really awesome
so you might check out that video and
then the guy who created this video was
Suraj Raval and he does a channel here
on a AI and machine learning and I like
this smarter music video that he did
which is like all about artificial
intelligence and machine learning but
it's like set to a club beat and rap so
that's kind of fun to check out that's a
little bit about programmers from my
perspective and the programming
community and and how I think it's a
really amazing thing to do to learn how
to program and because when you learn
how to program you get these superpowers
and you get to join a culture and
community of other people with
superpowers who are super smart super
hard-working super creative innovative
destroying industries creating new
industries generating tremendous wealth
and just having a kick in the ass fun
time while doing it so it's a it's
totally awesome and learning to code is
awesome and once you learn to code like
you know journey journeying to the Nexus
the the epicenter of coding right now
you know finding your way to Silicon
Valley in the Bay Area if you can do it
and get it involved with companies and
and you know just having a good time
creating stuff man
it's a great opportunity and and all you
got to do is
like spend a year or two every day for
five six hours learning how to code and
in a year or two you'll be awesome
enough to be able to make that
transition and I totally know that
believe it because I did it myself I'm a
self-taught coder and I've seen plenty
of other students do it too
some of my former students nike
engineers Amazon engineers and doing
amazing things so kudos to you good on
you as good on you as the Australian say
for being here and for feeling that
impulse within yourself to learn to code
and then for following it in the next
video I'm gonna talk a little bit about
what it takes to be successful as a
programmer because this is getting our
game mine on and you got to have the
right game mind before you get into the
game whatever the game is so we're going
to talk about that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
