hero courses comm and in this video
we're gonna continue on with the
frequently asked questions regarding as
your exams 70-53 to developing microsoft
azure solutions this is the second video
and this is gonna address something you
don't see often talked about what kind
of questions are on the 70 - 532 exam
tell us about the exam itself Scott I
sure will so it's important to know if
you're coming from other certification
vendors if you're like an Amazon
certified or toga for any of these other
certification providers Microsoft is
does things a bit differently you are
not going to get an exam full of mic
multiple-choice questions they do not
just give you 55 multiple-choice
questions and that's it okay so that's
the overriding thing that you should
know so what are the question types well
there are two major categories of
questions one you should know are called
case studies or scenario based questions
and I've heard it's typically around 1/2
of the exam they're not gonna release
the details and I'm not probably not
gonna tell you the exact breakout and it
can change every time but about half the
exam will be scenario based questions
and approximately half of the questions
are standalone questions okay I've heard
people I will should give you a tip I've
heard of one person who took the test
said that they got three scenario
questions our case study questions in a
row and then they moved on to the
standalone questions they thought they
were done they managed the clock and
finally there they hit enter and it's
now on to another case study question so
clock management is going to be a big
concern in this exam now let's talk
about the scenario based questions again
it's called so cogs case studies so
there's a lot of reading involved
typically there will be three or four or
five tabs on screen and you can flip
between the tabs to read the basis of
the scenario so it's gonna be overview
of the company and interview with the
executive
interview with the tech leaders
interview with the business owners the
technical requirements the business
requirements and so you're gonna get a
bunch of tabs just containing a lot of
reading now several of those items that
are mentioned in the text are just
completely not relevant like they'll
talk about something and then you'll
find in the questions that done ever
even comes up okay then
so once you've read through the scenario
or the case study you're gonna be
answered as asking a series of questions
maybe four or five six seven eight nine
questions in a row having to do with
that case study that you just read okay
so there are multiple questions relating
to that one scenario you can go back and
forth between the questions and the case
study so you don't have to read and
memorize everything you'll just tab back
and forth between them between the
question and then go look it up on the
case study now myself my strategy is I
don't read the scenario thoroughly I'll
skim it I want you know I want to get
this sort of the flavor for what they're
asking or what they're describing but
I'm not gonna go in there and then think
about they need a series of five servers
on-premises networked in a cluster
environment I don't care about that
stuff until the question comes up so
then I go to the questions and so I read
through the questions and if the
question says how do you migrate their
server environment into the cloud then
I'll go back to the scenario and I'll
read the section on their business
technical requirements and come up with
the answer from that the other thing to
note is once you've completed a single
scenario you can't go back to it ever so
you'll review you'll fill out the
questions you'll review your answer so
there's a review stage and once you
click Submit you'll never ever ever be
able to go back to scenario number one
okay so it's a each scenario is its own
thing so manage your time carefully
you'll go in there you'll have whatever
time you have on the clock you'll have
to sort of do some math in your head to
say well I can't spend more than two
minutes a question and so keep an eye on
the clock okay don't waste most of your
time answering scenario
questions then realize you've got
another scenario to do let's talk about
the standalone questions I like to
standalone questions easier because it's
just sometimes you know the answer right
away you read it oh okay this they're
asking about Active Directory and you'll
find that that answer you click it and
then you move on there's less reading
involved of course one tip for greeting
about these questions is keep in mind
that the person who wrote the question
is trying to test you on your knowledge
of something and so they want to know
let's give an example they want to know
that you need to use Azure Active
Directory b2c when you want to connect
Facebook login to your application right
Facebook Connect inter application and
so if you see something talking about
Facebook Connect in the question then
that should pop in your mind even before
you've read the answer oh this is a b2c
function and then you skim down the
answers and b2c is one of the answers
there should be some relationship of
what they're trying to ask versus the
answers and so just keep in mind that's
that's that's what they're trying to get
at is do you know which scenarios are
best the good thing about standalone
questions is it's just like a normal
test you go through all of them let's
say you go through 30 of them and then
you can go back and review all 30 writes
it's a they're handled again manager
your time because it could be another
scenario based question after that how
long is the exam and how many questions
are on it well you're not gonna like
this answer right so Microsoft
specifically does not publish how many
questions are on the test or how long
the test is the thing is it can change
all right I can tell you that the exam
is gonna be something like two hours but
you might walk in there and it's like 80
minutes or you might walk in there and
it's like a hundred and forty minutes
and you'll say Scott you said 120
minutes well that's that's what it could
be it's gonna be something like that
they also don't tell you the number of
questions and the questions do change so
if you had a friend that took the exam
say six months ago
well the exam has changed in the last
six months they've actually published
changes and Microsoft also
sigh close the questions every few
months so there might be something like
60 questions you might have something
like hundred twenty minutes you're gonna
split between these case studies and
standalone questions and like I said
there's a lot of code on it passing
score also I should mention Microsoft
tries to keep their passing score what
they call 700 now 700 does not equal 70%
okay so you can't do a simple math add
up that you answered 32 out of 45
questions and that equals 71% and
therefore you must have passed Microsoft
doesn't release that each question could
be a little bit more a little bit less
than one point and anyway so Microsoft
publishes 700 is a passing score but
they don't tell you how 700 is
calculated and that's the breaks right
so that's what we have to deal with now
what kind of questions do you think I
said at the beginning of this video that
Microsoft's move beyond the plain old
multiple choice question so there are
some multiple choice questions there are
some multiple correct answers Microsoft
will typically tell you to choose the
best two answers choose the best three
answers or sometimes they'll say choose
all that apply but but not often
sometimes they'll say specifically how
many ok or sometimes it's just one
answer and they want which whenever one
is the best answer
there's also drag-and-drop so you'll see
boxes on-screen and you have to pull
them from one left on to the right put
things in correct order they've got this
build a list scenario where you can have
10 answers and you got to pick 5 or 6 of
the steps and put the steps in order or
sometimes it doesn't matter the order
and also recently added to this exam is
coding and that includes like complete
the code question so you can imagine
there's one line of code missing and
then there's a text box and you have to
infer what is the thing that you need to
do anyways that's the type of questions
you can expect be sure absolutely go and
seek out
the official Microsoft exam questions
and and you they'll still show you all
of these question types and I'll put a
link in the description specifically to
tell you all of these drag-and-drop
multiple choice multiple best answers
etc etc go through them and see them for
yourself so you're not looking at them
for the first time when you take the
test anyways my name is Ben Scott Duffy
this video has gone on long enough
I do have a certification course on this
topic 70-53 to developing microsoft
azure solutions on the udemy platform I
do also have courses for beginners I
have courses on some of the other
certification tests I have 65,000
students I have tens of thousands of
reviews I want you to come and check out
this course if you're at all interested
the link is also in the description
thank you so much and I'll see in the
next video
