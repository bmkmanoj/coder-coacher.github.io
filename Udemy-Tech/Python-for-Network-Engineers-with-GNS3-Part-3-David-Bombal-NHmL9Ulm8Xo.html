you network program ability using Python
and genus 3 so currently we have two
scripts Python or one script one and
Python s one script one what I'll do is
copy the S one script to a file called s
one script to py notice we've changed
the extension to be py if I try and run
at that script notice we told that the
command is not found we could still use
Python s 1 and run the script of this
way and notice the changes have been
made to the switch we can see here that
the switch was configured but we may
want to improve things by simply running
the script as follows so let's use nano
to edit the script
notice the difference it's now showing
the text in colors so that's a lot nicer
but what I'm also going to do is a
reference Python in the script now in
UNIX an executable file that's meant to
be interpreted can indicate which
interpreter to use by having hash
exclamation mark or pound bang if you
prefer after the start of the first
align followed by the interpreter so as
an example how does the operating system
know if this is a bash script or a
Python script this allows us to indicate
is that information so I'm going to save
the script
now when I run it it's still not running
a good Linux command is clear to clear
the screen so at the moment we have our
script but it's not executable I'm going
to change the permissions on the script
to make it executable so I'm going to
specify that the script is now
executable by adding the executable
permission using change mod + X notice
it's a lowercase X Alice now shows us
that the script color has changed so I
can now run the script simply by
entering its name
and notice the script ran now the best
way to find files within this directory
is to use dot ford slash and then search
for the name
notice when I press tab it autocompletes
but if I do this it's not going to order
complete so get into the habit of using
dot forward slash for files in the local
directory or break that script so to
prove that this works Nano and specify
the script so let's edit the script and
what I'll do is simply add another VLAN
to our switch
so I'm going to specify VLAN 7 and give
it a name of Python VLAN 7 I'll save the
script so on the switch show VLAN brief
shows us that we have VLANs 1 to 6
configured but cat and the script name
shows us that we're gonna add another
VLAN to the switch so I'll run the
script enter a username of David enter
my password of Cisco in this example
notice we are told that a VLAN 7 was
created on the switch we can see that
David connected to vty 0 show VLAN
briefed we now have a new VLAN
configured on the switch now remember
I'm not trying to do everything
perfectly from the beginning babies
don't run marathons don't try and run a
long-distance marathon when you start
out don't try and be the best program in
the world just learn to get something
done and then improve or to use a
developer term iterate your program and
refine it and make it better as you
learn more so one of the things we may
want to change here is to no longer in
bed our password of Cisco so we could
delete to those two lines now before we
delete stuff let's create a backup so
copy s1 script to you
and let's call it s1 script to backup
file so we now have a backup of our file
if we have a problem we can always
restore or copy back that backup file so
nano again and let's edit our script
so what I want to do here is I want to
delete these two lines so ctrl K cuts
those two lines and I'm gonna save the
script now that's not going to work
unless we do this change on the switch
so on the switch we want to change the
vty line to provide privileges as soon
as we login so what we'll do is do that
on the user account so we've got a user
called David and we'll say user David
privilege 15 and to just prove that it
works show IP interface brief shows us
the IP address of the switch so let's
tell it to ourselves and ensure that it
works manually first so David it's a bit
of a typo they can't spell my own name
try again notice we are ready in
privilege mode so we can type a con for
T straight away so we don't need the
option enable show line shows us that no
one's connected at the moment let's try
and run our script so David
Cisco looks good we can see that David
logged into the switch so now we are no
longer embedding user names and
passwords in our script we are being
prompted for that information when we
run the script so just to prove the
point once again I could copy this
configuration and paste it in and let's
create VLAN 8 on the switch
save the script rhonda gain david
password is cisco looks good on the side
telnet who was successful to the switch
show VLAN we can see that VLAN 8 was
created on the switch so let's look at
our script again
now this is not efficient this is not a
good way to write programs where you've
got to duplicate code it becomes a very
difficulty scale as an example if you
want to add a hundred VLANs to the
switch you're going to end up having to
copy and paste and then manually edit a
large amount of text that often leads to
mistakes often leads to other problems
that's not something we want to do so in
the next video I'll show you how to tidy
this up and use loops to improve our
text I hope you enjoyed to this video if
you did please like it and please
subscribe to my youtube channel I wish
you all the very best
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
