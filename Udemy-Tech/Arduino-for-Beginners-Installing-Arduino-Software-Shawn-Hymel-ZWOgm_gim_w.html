you'll need to install the Arduino
integrated development environment or
IDE for short navigate to Arduino CC and
click software at the top you'll see a
link for the arduino web editor which
allows you to write code in your browser
if you install a plug-in for Chrome
Firefox Safari or edge you'll be able to
upload your program directly from your
browser to the Arduino this feature
however is relatively new when this
course was made so I have not been able
to thoroughly test it we'll be using the
cross-platform IDE software that you can
find by scrolling down the latest here
is one point eight point three but you
should see whatever the latest revision
is for Arduino click the link for your
operating system I'll show you how to do
this for Windows and Mac although the
steps for Linux should be fairly similar
in Windows click Windows installer and
on the next page click just download
although you can donate if you feel
particularly inclined go to your
downloads folder and double-click the
arduino installer to start the
installation process follow any
on-screen prompts and when asked leave
the installation components to default
most importantly we'll need to install
the USB driver in order to send programs
to our arduino click Next leave the
destination folder as Program Files x86
slash Arduino and click install
if you open a file explorer and head to
see program files x86 arduino you can
double click on arduino to start the ide
similarly on a mac after you've
downloaded the arduino ide open a finder
and navigate to your downloads if the
arduino file is still compressed as a
zip file double click to unzip it you
can then copy the file to your
applications directory in applications
double-click arduino to open the ide and
that's it
installing the arduino ide is a fairly
easy process now you should be ready to
start coding thanks for watching if
you'd like to learn more check out my
Arduino fundamentals course on udemy in
it I'll show you the basics of C and C++
programming how to build circuits and
how to make things like robots and
internet connected sensors if you use
the coupon in the description you'll get
a YouTube exclusive discount for the
class see you there
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
