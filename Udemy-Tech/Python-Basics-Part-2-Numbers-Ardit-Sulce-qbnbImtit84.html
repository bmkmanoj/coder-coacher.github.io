open an interactive shell here to
explain this Foster and so numbers you
know what numbers are to create a
normally just type the number in Python
and that's it and you also have
operators like this is the plus operator
and you can also store numbers in
variables let's say a equals to 2 B
equals to 3 and then if you do a plus B
you get 5 something to note is that you
know if you do that in here a equals to
2 B equals to 3 and then if you just do
a plus B and then you execute the script
let me open another terminal you will
not get any output in there the reason
is that you are not printing out
anything in your program so this is
different from an interactive session
here if you simply do an operation or if
you simply call a variable like that you
get the output promptly so this is just
for simplicity when you're when you try
things out so you don't have to pass
pruned explicitly but python will
understand that you met print but here
things are more strict so you if you
want to print all the altitudes
you want to say print a plus B and then
execute and you get the office and yeah
basically that's the only difference
between executing a program from a
Python file and running the code in the
interactive shell so these are numbers
and I can prove that if I do type 2 for
instance you'll see that this is an INT
type which means is an integer so
basically we have integers and we have
floats these are the two main types of
numbers I float is let's say 2.4 it's a
float and I can prove that 2.45 2.4
you'll see that this is a float
however if you do type 2 in brackets
you'll see that this is a shrink it's
not a number therefore you cannot make
operations using a string and a number
so Python will give you a type error and
this is saying cannot convert integer to
string implicitly so when you do a
string plus something else python
expects that you were adding another
string after a plus sign so that's why
it says I cannot convert integer object
so it cannot convert this to a string
implicitly because if you were to do 2
plus 3
you'd get 23 because python treats these
two as text so to understand it better
let's add some text here B so you get 2
a 3 B so it's a concatenation operation
while the plus operator is used with
strings it is referred to as
concatenation now let's go back to our
sample program that we used earlier
which was this one in here so no now
what if instead of getting a greeting
from the user you ask therefore
their age enter your old age so this is
just a message you can write anything
you want there but just try to have a
message that makes some sense to the
user and so also I'm going to change the
variable name to something more
meaningful age and then what I want to
do is let's say new age I want to
calculate their age plus 50 why not a
lamprey note the new age
save the script and let's go on execute
this we are going to get an error here I
warn you both it's good that you see the
errors that we get because that's how
you learn better
so for iPhone my program executes for
now it's working fine because what
happens is Python execute a script a
line by line so it goes to the first
line and if there is no error it execute
that line and in this case we have an
input function cell a program is on
standby mode so it expects from the user
to enter the input and so let's enter
the input here lights 8:28 and here's
the error that we get so again who is
you so this error before this is saying
type error cannot convert int object to
shrink implicitly and also have a law in
here that error occurred so these are
important messages and line two in here
so what's happening is that age is a
string it's not a number therefore
python cannot add up a string with a
number and so why is age a string
because that's what the input function
produces so the input function gets the
user input and converts it to a string
so even if you pass a number there this
will always convert
everything to a string therefore Python
you know cannot concatenate 28 plus 50
so what can you do in that case well you
want to convert that string into an
integer for that you want to use the int
function so it's a Python function that
does the work as you can see it outputs
now overcorrect output so 28 plus 50
equals 278 and similarly you can convert
numbers to strings and let's say H 3 or
50 and I think we'll get an error here
now I'd say stop error also called over
and type 4 plus so you're adding up an
integer with a string so integer with a
string if you like to convert this to a
float let me remove that save execute 28
you get seventy eight point zero because
what Python does when you use float is
you know float 28 it converts it to 28.0
so floats can be useful in certain
scenario and you will have a lot of
scenario in the course so don't worry
about that now because because we have
real world applications later on where
you see the real benefit of everything
that we are explaining here in this
early sections that cover the basics so
this is about numbers try to practice
them a little bit and I'll talk to you
in the next lecture
