have a look at some common react
questions I see quite a lot let's dive
right into it and by the way this is
just a collection of the questions that
came into my head that came to my mind
you got more if you've got other things
you see a lot please share them in the
video comments and I'll see what I can
do in the future so let's start
let's start with one super popular
question do I need a complex setup and
workflow for reactors can be really
confusing because on the official page
if you use that QuickStart tutorial on
reaction org you simply use some code in
code pan so you drop in air import and
you're ready to go
and still thereafter and then the
majority of all courses and tutorials
you got more complex build workflows
with webpack with a local dev server and
all that fun stuff
so which setup do you actually need it
depends on which kind of app you're
building you can drop the react imports
react Jas and react Dom Jas into your
HTML files and start using react
functional he's on these files you can
also use create react app which is like
a CLI for react to get a feature-rich
work flow with zero setup that still is
100% customizable because you can eject
or you build your own workflow or use
some boilerplate you find on github
there you can of course tailor your
workflow from scratch or build up on the
existing boilerplate now the drop in
approach is great for multi-page
applications so where react should not
manage the entire front end and for
smaller projects for bigger projects and
single page applications I recommend
using create react app though it gives
you a really cool and optimized workflow
and project setup that is still being
worked on create react app is actively
maintained and therefore it gives you a
lot of features you want to have in big
apps a lot of optimizations and so on
and a custom workflow could also be
great for that but you need to know what
you do so for highly specific
requirements that might be best because
there you can't build everything exactly
as you want it to be right from the
start but in general create react app
with the option of ejecting and then
customizing everything anyways seems
like the best way to me except for
multi-page applications where you often
work with
drop in imports here's another thing I
see sometimes single curly braces versus
double curly braces if you are coming
from view or angular you know that in
your templates you output dynamic
content between double curly braces in
react templates you use single curly
braces the reason for it is simple react
doesn't use templates it doesn't use
HTML it uses JSX which behind the scenes
is just JavaScript just some enhanced
version that looks like HTML and since
it's just JavaScript you don't need a
specific templating language which it
can be distinguished from normal HTML
you use single curly braces like you do
in normal JavaScript anyways for example
to create an object this is a syntax
then understood by react or transformed
to normal JavaScript in the end and
therefore we have no specific templating
language we have no specific syntax for
that you can see the same for loops by
the way where you use an array and map
it to an array of JSX elements instead
of using directives and stuff like that
it's really all coming down to the
JavaScript only nature of react speaking
of the nature of react there's another
important thing functional vs.
class-based components which one should
you use in which circumstances so
functional components also refer to as
stateless components receive props as an
argument and return some JSX
this is what they do they create a
component with this minimum set up they
don't manage any internal state state of
course is an important concept and react
you know that but it's not relevant for
functional components they don't have
internal state all the day that they use
are or is received wire props and you
don't have lifecycle methods in there
you can't run through the lifecycle of
the component in a stateless component a
class-based or state full component on
the other hand has a render method to
return JSX and excesses props why are
this props
it also manages internal state
accessible wire this state and can
change the state to rerender parts of
the app parts of the JSX code to the dom
and also can you use lifecycle methods
so that's the core difference when
should you use which use state less
components whenever possible which
actually is in a quite a lot of times
you can use stateless components a lot
use state full components whenever you
need to manage state in a component and
mostly you should use them as containers
so you have a couple of route containers
class-based components in the end which
manage state which then passed down the
state and therefore of course also any
state changes wire props to a bunch of
functional components why is this a good
pattern because if you manage your state
in a selected few components then it's
much easier to manage your app and
maintain your app because it's always
clear only in places where the state can
change and if that's just a couple of
components that's much easier to manage
so therefore try to keep the usage of
class-based stateful components to a
minimum and another thing that sometimes
unclear is the set state syntax is you
can use so this is set state we can set
a new state with it and calling it will
trigger react to re-render the Dom if
there are changes at least so this is
set state and one thing not everyone
knows is that it runs asynchronously so
old state updates might not be reflected
in this state immediately if you execute
some code after set state often they are
but it's not guaranteed it's
asynchronous there is a second version
of set state this one here where you
pass a function to set state a function
that receives the previous state and
previous props now the important
difference to the first version is in
the first version we used this state
inside of set state and due to the
asynchronous nature we
referring to an older dis state than we
expected
we're guaranteed to always get the last
valid previous state and if we then need
some property from that old state we now
guaranteed got the latest version of it
and use it to set a new state important
in that function you return the same
object you would have passed to set
state in the first syntax anyways
speaking of syntax what does this map
method do you see that map method a lot
in react apps and it's basically used to
output an array of items to the screen
so if you come from angular this would
be your equivalent to the ng4 directive
kind of now since we're not working with
a template in react apps but with just
JavaScript code we use just JavaScript
features and outputting an array of data
onto the screen with this syntax does
one thing essentially it Maps this array
into a new array so the goal is to
output the JSX elements or die's this
data as JSX elements I should say and
map maps it into a new array react is
capable of outputting an array into the
Dom but that array needs to consist of
JSX elements so this is what we do with
this map syntax we just return a new
array where every element of the array
is based on elements in the old array
but of transformed elements so we can
transform that array with the syntax you
see at the very top of the slide to
disarray where we now have an array of
JSX elements incorporating the old data
and this is really the whole idea behind
map we map an old array of just strings
numbers whatever it is into a new array
of JSX elements that can be rendered to
the real dawn styling react is another
common source of issues we get a lot of
different styling approaches which one
should you choose why is it so difficult
the first thing you learn in most
tutorials is inline Styles ie you assign
the style
directly on DJ sx elements with the
style prop this works but becomes
cumbersome if you need media queries it
essentially doesn't work or if you got
more complex styles Radium then is a
package that could be a solution so
google Radium to learn more about it it
essentially is a package that allows you
to use media queries and more CSS like
features in your react app because keep
in mind with inline Styles you're not
really using CSS style components is in
our package you could Google for so
these are all really package names
Radium and style components you can
search for that too follows a different
approach than radium but also with an
approach or with the idea of giving you
scoped styles so Styles that only apply
to one component and giving you access
to the full feature bandwidth off CSS
you could all use BM which is a CSS
concept which allows you to or which is
all about creating CSS class names that
do the scoping so if your issue is that
you want to ensure that certain Styles
only apply to certain components then
you could create clearly defined class
names in normal CSS and a normal CSS
file no package is needed for that and
then use these CSS class names in your
JSX code and you can google for BM to
find more information about it and how
to structure these class names the idea
is to really create kind of components
in CSS with normal CSS features so
without any package if you don't want to
create these long CSS class names on
your own though you can have a look at
CSS modules which is a feature you can
unlock and create react app for example
if you google for create react app CSS
modules the idea behind it is that you
create a normal CSS file still but this
package world is changed configuration
in your workflow as you do it for the
create react app setup for example will
transfer
you're short normal CSS names into
unique ones on a per component level so
then each component will get its unique
CSS class names which you don't have to
write but which you get ones compilation
once the build workflow is finished so
this is a nice approach which I
personally like a lot because it gives
you really scoped Styles without you
having to worry about manually creating
the appropriate CSS class names and
these are just some of the features some
of the possible solutions I can
recommend that you google that you'll
learn about to find the one you enjoy
the most
speaking of CSS how can you use
third-party CSS libraries it's actually
pretty simple
you can add a CDN link to index.html or
a link in index.html to a local file of
course or you use a local file and in
most workflows you can import that into
your JavaScript files even though it's a
CSS file but most react setups like the
one you get with create react app also
support imports of CSS files which
behind the scenes will of course not be
mixed with your JavaScript code but will
be kept separate but your bundler web
Pakistan aware of them and can process
them that's the idea behind the imports
so this is another common approach you
can of course also use the NPM or yarn
to download to install these packages if
you're using bootstrap for example but
still adding a import to your JavaScript
files should work fine
and this the approach I recommend it
sounds strange but it works in most
workflows and if you use create react
there for example it definitely works
what about third-party JavaScript
libraries how can you add these
essentially you get the same options you
can add script imports to see the end
links or local files in index.html and
this is of course all referring to
single page applications but you can
also import it like that and multi page
applications of course or you import the
local files into your JavaScript files
which of
it works in a react app especially when
creating a single page application
you're importing JavaScript files from
other files all the time you're
constantly writing import statements and
of course you can import any third-party
library into your JavaScript file into
your react JavaScript file as well and
you can start using the features of that
library just like that that should work
fine and of course you can always use
NPM and yarn for that this should also
work let's go back to some claw react
functionalities and let's talk about
immutability that's something I see that
can be hard to understand so let me try
to make it a bit easier what is
immutability about we hear about it a
lot when we're working with redux for
example and you can find an article with
a lot of information on it in the video
description actually so the idea behind
immutability is simple objects and
arrays are reference types in JavaScript
reference types mean that when we store
an array in a new variable and the same
is true for objects we don't actually
create and copy a copy of the value but
only of the pointer pointing to some
point in memory so the value still is
the same even if we store it in two
different properties or variables
therefore to fix this to get a real copy
which we can change without also
altering the other one which would
happen by default we have to manually
clone so really copy deeply copy any
array or object we want to manipulate
and which we also want to copy so how
does this work well here's the situation
let's say we have an array once you free
and we're storing it in a new constant
new array this does work but what
doesn't work what I mean with that that
if we then would try to change new array
we would also change all array because
of that reference type thing so the
solution is to instead clone the old
array for example with the slice method
which returns a brand-new array object
so not a pointer to the same array but a
brand new one if we then change cloned
array
we don't also change all the rain if
you're using a setup which allows you to
use next-generation JavaScript features
you can also use the spread operator
instead of the slice method now for
objects is pretty much the same here we
get the same problem we can't copy it
like that there we could use object
assign to create a copy of an old object
into a new object or the spread operator
for objects with this syntax you can see
at the bottom of the box important still
what we're doing here is shallow cloning
so we're only copying or cloning the
first level of properties of an object
for example let me show you what I mean
with that here we have an object which
also has an array not just a name
property but also the hobbies property
which is an array of strings
if we now clone the older object with
object assign we do have a real new
object with new properties that match
the old properties but the array hobbies
all there's a reference type and it
didn't clone that because it only cloned
the first level so only the property
names you could say so therefore if we
now push something onto the hobbies
array in the cloned object we would
actually still edit the array in the old
object the solution to that is to really
manually clone all the levels we plan on
changing doesn't hurt if we don't do it
if we don't plan on change it changing
it but if we do plan on changing
something we need to clone it so here
the cloned object would spread out the
old object and then explicitly overwrite
the hobbies property by overwriting it
with a new array where we also use the
spread operator to clone the elements of
the old object hobbies array and now we
get an object with a new hobbies array
too this is something to keep in mind
again there is a link with more
information in the video description if
you want to dive deeper I hope it's a
bit clearer now at least here's another
thing I see a lot everyone can see my
code and it's true every
one can see your code if you open the
developer tools in your browser and you
inspect a react app there you can access
the source files the script files and
you can read the script code of course
and there's nothing you can do it's
JavaScript it runs on the client so you
can't hide your code the solution is to
not put any security relevant
information in there don't put anything
in there that you don't want others to
see because you can't hide it you can't
prevent this that is just how the web
works in the end can I use react without
redux and now a question I see a lot and
the answer is yes of course you can
react by default if you start a new
react app doesn't use Redux it can be
confusing for newcomers because the
majority of tutorials is always react
plus Redux so it's my course by the way
because it's such a popular combination
but in my course for example we start
without Redux because it's not a must
you can use it it becomes important for
bigger apps it makes managing the state
much easier then but it's not a must and
especially for smaller to medium-sized
apps there might be no need to use Redux
another question I see a lot is if you
can use react with PHP or the lateral
framework for that or node or any other
server-side language or framework and
the answer is yes let me show you how it
depends on whether you're building a
single-page application or a multi-page
application though if you're building a
single-page application then react
controls the entire front end through
that one single index.html file which
was sent by the server if you're
building a multi-page application then
react controls only parts of the various
pages your server sends you the views
the server sends you react controlled
so-called
widgets so maybe image carousel or maybe
an accordion on something like that now
for these single page application
approach we have the server which sends
the index.html file and that could also
be a different server than the server
where your business law
then runs on by the way any static host
does the trick and then your a react app
which runs in the index.html file still
can communicate with that or another
server through a restful api this is how
that works you communicate through a
restful api the server doesn't render
views you have the dress API instead now
if you're creating a multi-page
application with react then you also
have a server which renders a couple of
views not just one and whenever you
interact with that views you click a
link or something like that you send a
new request to the server and you get
back a new view and react can be part of
a couple or all of these views to
control parts of these HTML pages the
widgets I already mentioned this is how
these two different approaches work and
it shows of course you can use react
with any server-side language by the way
because it only runs in the browser it
doesn't care about the language you're
running on your server
it also doesn't care about any databases
you might use there speaking of react
running on the client something I hear a
lot is my state is lost after page
reloads what can I do it's true if
you're coming from a traditional webpage
world where you use sessions on the
server to manage user state like if the
user is logged in then this doesn't work
for react if you hit that refresh button
your JavaScript code runs again and
since it's detached from the server
there is no session management there is
no session now you've got two
alternative approaches for managing
state one is local storage and one is
using a data base on the server
important with neither of the two
approaches you're going to use a
classical traditional session unless
you're using a multi page building a
multi-page app so this is all referring
to single page apps I should say so
local storage is a client-side storage
sitting in a browser it's accessed by
our JavaScript and with not under your
control I mean that you can't access it
from the server and it's a simple key
value store it's great for storing a
JSON web token for example
a common authentication mechanism in
react single page applications which
allows you to kind of rebuild a session
like experience because you can when
your app start check whether that token
already is stored in the storage and you
can pick up that state and that's not
just true for the token you can of
course store any information and local
storage that you want to check for on
the next app start and that you want to
possibly initialize your app with now a
server-side database of course is well
running on the server and therefore
fully under your control the user can't
clear it uninstall it or anything like
that as you can do with the local
storage it's accessible only from the
server which improves security and it of
course can be any database you want so
you're not limited to a key value store
here it's of course the right solution
for data that needs to be long
persistent so if you want to ensure that
data can't be erased by the user or by
the operating system if the operating
system is running out of space it might
clear unnecessary data like data and
local storage of browsers so any data
that needs to persist should be stored
on the server therefore it can you host
your app on here OCO and so on that's
not a question I get a lot now an
important thing is that we need to
understand what a react app is in the
end once it's done it's just a bunch of
build artifacts generated by our build
workflow if we run or run our production
build process and this again refers to
single page applications if you're
building a multi-page application of
course if you're building it with PHP or
node or any language supported by Heroku
your just deploy it there for single
page applications though we get these
build artifacts which is just the
index.html file some JavaScript files
and some style files for example now all
these are static files there is no
server-side code in there the JavaScript
file is not no js' but a JavaScript file
for the browser
hence hiroko and so on might be overkill
because there you need to write an
application with PHP with no js' or
stuff like that just to serve that
index.html file and the other static
files so a better solution here is to
use a WSS free firebase hosting or some
other static host simply Google for
static web host to find some possible
services you can use these services are
best for serving your react single page
application because you have no
server-side language why would you take
the overhead of installing everything
and setting up some dummy app that just
serves some static files here's another
common error my routes don't work after
deployment so let's say you're the user
and you're visiting a page on the server
my page comm now on the server you then
return the index.html file where your
react app runs and where you display
content then you click somewhere in that
app and you navigate to my page comm
slash products and since we have routing
set up in our single page application
and this is referring to single page
applications only what I'm saying here
since we have routes set up there do you
react router parses that new URL and
renders the right content on the server
you have no routes set up because it's a
single page application all that logic
lives in your client side app in your
react app now if you don't navigate
around by clicking where react and the
end catches the click and doesn't send a
real request but just see what you
wanted to do and re render the page if
you instead hit refresh you really send
a new request to the server now the
problem is you will get back a 404 error
because the server doesn't know the
slash products route it only exists in
your react routing setup so to go around
to this problem we need to set our
server up in a special way we need to
ensure that we always return the
index.html file also in 404 error cases
this then allows react and its router to
always take
and parse the incoming requests and
render the right page and if you want to
still render 404 pages for certain
routes you need to set this
configuration up in the react single
page application while at the router
they're not on the server you always
need to return the index.html file and
that was it
I hope you enjoyed it you learned some
new things maybe got some answers to
some questions you might have had about
react definitely share any other
questions in the video comments I
probably won't answer them there but I
will note them and I might you an
additional video in the future so all
the best to you
I hope to see you again on a keto mind
in the future bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
