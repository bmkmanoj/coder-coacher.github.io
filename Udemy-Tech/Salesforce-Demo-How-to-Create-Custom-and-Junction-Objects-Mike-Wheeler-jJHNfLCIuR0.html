activity and this will be where we're
going to create a custom object for our
own application that we're building
throughout the duration of this course
and then we're going to make a couple of
junction objects basically that is
emitting too many relationship between
two objects and so we have most of our
custom objects in place already on the
schema builder I've selected the custom
object selection from the drop down here
and I'm in the objects tab in order just
to show the custom objects and I've
selected these top four for episode
person production and production
position these are for custom objects
that we've previously created and in
this lecture we're going to create one
more custom object and then we're going
to start to relate these objects to one
another in order to make some of these
objects junction objects and so you
notice here at the top I have the
production object and this has to do
with any sort of movie or TV show or
video game and so the thing about a
movie is is those are standalone units
at one movie at a time whereas a TV show
will have episodes and so we've got this
relationship here this master detail
relationship between episode and
production so that a production could
have multiple episodes we will later tie
in the episodes to only tie in two
productions with a record type of TV
show we won't have episodes for movies
and so we'll clear that up later in this
course but for this lecture you are
going to start to connect people through
this person object here to productions
and then also tie these people to a
production position so this production
position object is actually intended to
be a junction object tying together the
production with the person so how we do
that is we need a couple of master
detail relationships defined on the
junction object which is this production
position object but before we dive into
creating these master detail
relationships I want to have you go in
and delete a couple of records from your
Salesforce instance and so if you right
click on set up here at the top right
and open this link in a new tab
that way we can
go into the setup menu in this other tab
without losing our place in the schema
builder and so I want to go to the
production's
records that we have and we need to
clear those out in order to add new
master detail relationships looking up
to this Productions record since we
already have some data already populated
here I'm going to go ahead and delete
these records now in the real world
there's a way of getting around this to
where you don't have to delete these
records but for sake of learning and the
point we're in right now I want to
simplify this process by just clearing
out our two records since we only have
these two and so I'm going to click on
Wizard of Oz and delete this record and
click OK and then as well when I click
on the cheers TV show that we entered
previously and deleted as well and click
OK and then I'm going to go to my
recycle bin just to be safe and I'm
gonna clear these out by selecting both
and then selecting to empty my recycle
bin and click OK
so on the other side of this
relationship are the production position
records I want to go ahead and clear out
any that we may have there as well and
so if I click on the all tabs link and
then select production positions you see
that we do have one production position
that I created previously I'm gonna go
ahead and delete that as well and we're
not gonna go into the complexities of
why that is at this point just follow
along and go ahead and delete this
record and just to show you remind you
what that record look like it's not
anything important at this point for our
application and so no of course not to
get blocked and creating these
master/detail relationships in the
schema builder I'm just gonna go ahead
and delete this production position and
confirm the deletion and I'm gonna go
back to my recycle bin and empty my
organization's recycle bin just to clear
out everything just to be safe and then
as well I'm gonna go ahead and close the
schema builder and go back to it just to
make sure that the latest things from
memory are in place here and we're not
pulling any old data and that may not be
necessary to do that but I want to just
be safe so that we don't get blocked and
creating these master detail
relationships so we're on the production
position custom object we're going to
make this a junction object between
production and person that will be to
master detailed relationships one
looking to the production object and one
looking to the person object both
originating on the detail side from the
production position object and so in
order to
you enter into these relationships I
need to click on the elements tab from
the schema builder and drag and drop
master detail onto the production
position object this would be the child
or the detail side of the master detail
relationship so the first relationship
that I'm going to establish is with
production and someone enter that
fluid-filled label and then I'm going to
tap out therefore the field name to also
display production and then I'm going to
tab down to related to and relate this
to the production object and then I'm
going to allow the child relationship
name to enter the default and I'm gonna
accept the default for the readwrite
ability and that allows users with at
least readwrite access to the master
record to create edit or delete related
detailed records and then the related
list label this will appear as
production positions this is the title
that I'm specifying that the related
lists will have in all the layouts
associated with the parent and then I'm
going to allow these child records to be
repairable so that they can be moved to
a different parent or a different master
record so now I'm going to click Save to
establish this first relationship so the
field has been saved and we can hover
over here to see the master detail
relationship from production position to
production I'm gonna do this again in
order to connect this production
position object with this person object
so I click and drag master detail and
remember we're going to associate this
with the person object now so I'm going
to just keep it simple by just going
with the defaults and this will start to
make more sense as you see the app from
the front-end later on in this course at
the main point of this particular
lecture is getting familiar with
entering relationships and the schema
builder and creating custom objects as
well which will do a new custom object
here in a moment
so we're associating this relationship
with the person object and then the
child relationship name we're going to
take the default of production positions
for that as well except the default of
readwrite for the sharing setting keeps
the default for the related list label
and then slightly printable for this as
well and click Save and so now we've
created a junction object we've got the
two master detail relationships on the
production position object and that is a
junction object between a production and
a person because a person can be on
multiple
actions and also productions will have
multiple people associated with them so
you need this Junction object called
production position and this object is
where you capture what sort of position
or role someone plays on a production so
they make the key grip or actor or
writer or director for example so now
let's talk for a moment about the need
for another Junction object we just
created the junction object between
productions and persons with this
junction object called production
position and then we also have TV shows
which have individual episodes now when
you think about TV shows individuals or
persons or people here they may fulfill
one role on a TV show in one episode
then they could fulfill other positions
on other episodes of the TV show example
would be someone that serves as a writer
for one episode of the TV show and in
the next episode they serve as a writer
and also appear in the show as an actor
and then in the next episode they could
serve as executive producer writer
director and so you see the need as well
for there to be an additional Junction
object between episodes and people we
can just simply fill in this production
position in order to take care of the
multiple different types of positions
that people could fulfill on TV episodes
so next we're going to be creating a
custom object called episode positions
so I'm going to drag object from the
elements tab onto the canvas now I'm
going to fill in the information
regarding this new custom object that
we're now creating and this is the
episode position here in the plural
label of episode positions and this does
start with a vowel sound and so I'm just
going to keep the defaults on this
screen and then check here and then
finally click Save so now that we have
the episode position object created we
need to enter into a couple of master
detail relationships in order for this
episode position object to be a junction
object between the episode and the
person and so if we click on the
elements tab and then select master
detail and click and drag into the
episode position object we'll make the
first connection and that being to the
episode so we will relate this to the
episode object and then accept the
defaults here and then
laughs Laura parenting of the master
detail by checking this bottom check box
and clicking save and now you'll see the
relationship line here and you can hover
over that to see the master detail
relationship from episode position to
the episode so now we need to create one
further master detail relationship and
that would be between the person and the
episode position and so once again we're
going to drag master detail on to the
episode position that would be the
detail side of the master detail
relationship and then release to drop it
in place and then for the label this
will be connected to the person object
so we're gonna relate this to person I'm
gonna go ahead and do this first to help
us remember what we're dealing with so
it's the person object and so we're
going to say person for the field label
in the field name we're going to keep
the readwrite sharing setting and then
for the related list label I'm gonna
enter persons here in case there's
multiple persons I'm gonna check to
allow for repairing and click Save so
now we've done a lot in this particular
lecture we've created a new custom
object in the schema builder and that
was the episode position and then as
well we've made not only episode
position a junction object but also
production position a junction object we
did that by establishing two master
detail relationships from these objects
the first one being production position
being the detailed side of the
relationship to both the production
object and the person object and then
for the episode position junction object
it's the detail side of the master
detail relationship on both episode and
person and so we will revisit our IMDB
clone app more as we progress further
into this course but for now we've set
up our objects we've got our schema set
for the most part there'll be additional
things we'll do later on in this course
as far as establishing record types on
production that will be several lectures
later but we will revisit this
production object and create record
types that's where we'll be designating
movies TV shows and video games in order
to segment the different types of
productions and once we do that that's
where this episode will come into play
for just TV shows where as the
production position we'll be dealing
with movies and video games so the good
news is we've now completed
data modeling and management section of
this course and so it's time to move on
to a quiz to test your knowledge and
retention of the topics that we've
covered in this particular section of
the course then after this quiz I'll see
you on the other side as I introduce you
to the next section of the course which
deals with security</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
