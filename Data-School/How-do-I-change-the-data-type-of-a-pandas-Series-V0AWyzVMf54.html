series on the pandas library in Python
and the question for today is how do I
change the data type of a pandas series
alright let's just jump right in
with an example data set so we're going
to import pandas as PD and then the data
set we're going to start with is alcohol
consumption by country so drinks equals
PD read CSV and then I'm going to use
the bitly URL bitly slash drinks by
country okay so we run that let's take a
look at the head and we see six columns
four of which are numeric and let's
actually take a look at the data types
of these columns and we use the D types
attribute of the drinks data frame to
find that out and what we see is that
three of our columns are integer columns
and we've got one floating-point column
the total liters column and then two
columns which say type object which
basically means string okay so country
and continent are just strings now let's
pretend for a second that we want to
convert the beer servings column to
floating-point Kai rather than integer
so all we have to do is we use the
series method so we say drinks dot dear
servings dot as type float and that just
means convert it to type floating-point
now if you want to actually modify the
data frame you know you can either add a
new column or I'm just going to
overwrite an existing the existing beer
servings column okay so we'll run that
and if we check the D types now we'll
see that it has changed and beer
servings is now a floating-point column
now you might be wondering what's the
usefulness of that on
and it's not the most useful example I
admit you'll usually do this when for
example you have a data file where the
numbers are stored as strings so when
you've read it into pandas their strings
but you want to do math on them well to
do math on a column it has to be a
numeric type and you'd use something
like this you'd name the column as type
float okay so that's the more common use
case for that all right I want to show
you a follow up question from the
YouTube comments which is from Eli and
let me show you that
and Eli asks and we're going to look at
number three here how did it find the
type of each column before actually
reading this CSV okay great question
thanks for that Eli so what we're going
to do is actually just change the data
types
during the CSV reading process okay so
I'm going to copy and paste this line
and all I have to do is add one more
parameter D type equals and I pass it a
dictionary and the dictionary key is
beer servings and the dictionary value
is float and if I do this and check the
D types you'll see that once again beer
servings has been converted to floating
point so the only difference between
this and above is that this method does
it during the reading process up here we
converted it after the data frame had
already been created okay so I'm going
to show you one more data set and we'll
do another example with that and this is
the data set of orders from Chipotle
so we'll say orders equals PD read table
and it's bit dot Lee slash ship orders
okay and let's take a look at it and the
column I want to focus on is the item
price column and you might be wondering
is that a float or is that some special
currency type or what is that and what
you'll actually see is that pandas is
storing that column as an object meaning
a string because it doesn't really
understand that these are numbers so if
you wanted to do some math with it
you're going to have to convert the type
now we saw in a previous video how if we
want to remove for instance
a character from a series like this
dollar sign you can use a string method
so we'll say orders dot item price dot
stirrer dot replace and we'll say I want
to replace the dollar sign with nothing
okay now you might think that's enough
but if you try to do like a mathematical
operation on the series it will give you
an error because even though I removed
the dollar sign this is the rest of it
is still a string so I have to cast it
to a float in order to do any math with
it so when I cast it to a float I can
now do a mathematical operation on it
okay so as always we're going to end
with a bonus and for the bonus I want to
talk about the item name column okay so
let's say orders dot item name and ah we
saw in a previous video about using the
stur contains method to check for the
presence of a substring chicken is what
we're going to check for in this case
and it returns a series of trues and
falses indicating whether or not a given
substring was found in
column now we've got trues and falses
but you can imagine a case in which we
need these as zeros and ones and for
instance if you are building a machine
learning model and this was one of your
input features you'd need it to be
numeric and you would use zeros and one
to represent false isn't true and that's
actually super simple you can just say
as type int and it has been converted to
zeros and ones okay so that's it for
today thank you so much for joining me

see more videos like this please leave a
question or a tip in the comments below
and we can all help each other to learn
but that's it for today so I hope to see
you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
