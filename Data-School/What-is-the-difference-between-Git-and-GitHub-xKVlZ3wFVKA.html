to Git and GitHub.
In this video, we're going to cover the difference
between Git and GitHub.
Future videos in the series will contain walkthroughs
and demos, but this video is largely conceptual.
So, what is the difference between Git and
GitHub?
Git is a system for version control primarily
used by programmers and others who write code.
It runs at the command line on your local
machine.
It allows you to keep track of your files
and modifications to those files in something
called a repository (or &quot;repo&quot;).
For example, here's a repository on my local
machine.
These are the files and folders being tracked.
And here are the last 5 changes to the repo.
You can use it alone, or you can use it with
a team of people who are working on the same
project.
It's useful in a team environment because
everyone can work independently on those files,
merge their changes together, and there is
a permanent record of who made which change.
So how does GitHub relate to Git?
GitHub is a website that allows you to upload
your Git repositories online.
Why would you do this?
Well, it provides a backup of your files.
Second, it gives you a visual interface for
navigating your repos.
Third, it gives other people a way to navigate
your repos.
And finally, it makes repo collaboration easy.
All of these concepts will become much more
clear in the upcoming videos.
One final note is that Git does not require
the use of GitHub.
However, it's very common to use GitHub if
you are using Git.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
