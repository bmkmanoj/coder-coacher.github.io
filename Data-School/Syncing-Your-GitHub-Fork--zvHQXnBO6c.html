your fork, what that means, and why you might
want to do it.
To start, let's go through what we already
know about forks. Here's a diagram from my
blog, and I'll link to this in the video description.
In this diagram, the top level is the GitHub
level, and the bottom level is your local
computer.
Remember that if you want to copy a GitHub
repo, you just fork it, and then you can clone
it to your local computer. After making changes
and committing those changes, you can push
the changes back up to GitHub. We won't cover
pull requests in this video, but that's simply
how you ask the owner of the original repo
to pull your changes into their repo.
Anyway, let's pretend that you forked a repo
yesterday, and then today, the repo owner
made some changes that you want to incorporate
into your fork. Remember from a previous video
that forks do not automatically stay in sync,
and thus you have to do this manually.
Let's look at another diagram. If you want
to sync your fork with the original repo,
which we call the &quot;upstream&quot;, this actually
happens through your local computer. You simply
&quot;fetch&quot; the changes from the upstream, you
&quot;merge&quot; them into your repo, and then you
&quot;push&quot; them up to GitHub. Note that the &quot;fetch&quot;
and &quot;merge&quot; steps are often combined into
a single step called a &quot;pull&quot;, but it's generally
recommended that you fetch and merge in two
separate steps.
Let's actually do this for one of my repos.
Here's the commit history of a repo that I
forked, and here's the commit history of my
fork. You can see that the original repo has
one additional commit since I forked it. I've
opened Git Bash, and we're already in the
working directory for that repo.
First, let's check our remotes with &quot;git remote
-v&quot;. We've got an &quot;origin&quot; remote, but we
also need an &quot;upstream&quot; remote that points
to the original repo. We'll copy the URL from
GitHub. You'll probably be using the HTTPS
URL, but I set up SSH so I'm using the SSH URL.
Then we &quot;git remote add upstream&quot; and
paste the URL using the &quot;Insert&quot; key on Windows.
Let's check that it worked.
Now we're ready to fetch. You type &quot;git fetch
upstream&quot;, and then type your password. That
command fetched the changes, and stored them
in a branch called &quot;upstream/master&quot;. You
can actually switch to that branch and look
at the changes if you like, but we're going
to go ahead and merge those changes. You type
&quot;git merge upstream/master&quot;, which tells git
to merge that branch into your working branch,
which also happens to be called &quot;master&quot;.
If you like, you can also push those changes
up to GitHub, so that your GitHub repo is
in sync. Just like before, we type &quot;git push
origin master&quot;, then your password, and you're done!
You can see that the change is now in
my repo.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
