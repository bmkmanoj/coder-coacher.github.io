machine learning in psych and learn in
the previous video we went through the
entire data science pipeline including
reading data using pandas visualization
using Seaborn and training and
interpreting a linear regression model
using scikit-learn we also covered
evaluation metrics for regression as
well as feature selection using the
Train test split procedure in this video
I'll be covering the following what's
the drawback of using the Train test
split procedure for model evaluation how
does k-fold cross-validation overcome
this limitation
how can cross-validation be used for
selecting tuning parameters choosing
between models and selecting features
and what are some possible improvements
to cross-validation let's start by
reviewing what we've learned so far
about model evaluation procedures one of
the primary reasons we evaluate machine
learning models is so that we can choose
the best available model the goal of
supervised learning is to build a model
that generalizes to out-of-sample data
and thus we want a model evaluation
procedure that allows us to estimate how
well a given model is likely to perform
on out-of-sample data we can then use
that performance estimate to choose
between the available models our first
idea was to train each model on the
entire data set and then evaluate each
model by testing how well it performs on
that same data this produces an
evaluation metric known as training
accuracy unfortunately training accuracy
rewards overly complex models that are
unlikely to generalize to future data
which is known as overfitting the train
data the alternative procedure we came
up with is called train test split in
which we split the data set into two
pieces known as the training and testing
sets we train the model on the training
set and we evaluate the model by testing
its performance on the testing set the
resulting evaluation metric is known as
testing accuracy which is a better
estimate of out-of-sample performance
than training accuracy because we
trained and tested the model on
different sets of data as well
testing accuracy does not reward overly
complex models and thus it helps us to
avoid overfitting however there is a
drawback to the train test split
procedure it turns out the testing
accuracy is a high variance estimate of
out-of-sample accuracy meaning that
testing accuracy can change a lot
depending on which observations happen
to be in the testing set let's see an
example of this in scikit-learn using
the IRS data set which we've worked with
previously
first we'll import the relevant
functions classes and modules then we'll
read in the iris data set and define our
feature matrix X and our response vector
Y in this next cell we'll use the Train
test split function to split X&amp;amp;Y
into four pieces this splits a random
but I've set the random state parameter
so that if you run this code at home
using the same random state value your
data will be split in the exact same way
as my data will also instantiate the que
neighbors classifier model with the
parameter and neighbors equals 5 fit the
model with the training data make
predictions on the testing data and
evaluate the accuracy of our predictions
the reported testing accuracy of our
model is 97% but what if we reran this
code and the only thing we changed was
which observations were assigned to the
training and testing sets if we change
the random state parameter to 3 and
rerun the cell we get a testing accuracy
of 95% if we change the random state to
2
we get a testing accuracy of 100% this
is why testing accuracy is known as a
high variance estimate naturally you
might think that we could solve this
problem by creating a bunch of different
train test splits calculating the
testing accuracy each time and then
averaging the results together in order
to reduce the variance in fact that is
the essence of how cross-validation
works let's walk through the steps for
k-fold cross-validation which is the
most common type of cross-validation
first we choose a number for K and split
the entire dataset into K partitions of
equal size these partitions are known as
folds so if K was equal to 5 and the
dataset had 150 observations each of the
5 folds would contain 30 observations
second we designate the observations in
fold 1 as the testing set and the union
of all other folds as the training set
in the example I just mentioned the
testing set would contain the 30
observations from fold 1 and the
training set would contain the hundred
and 20 observations from folds 2 through
5 third we train the model on the
training set we make predictions on the
testing set and we calculate the testing
accuracy then we would repeat steps two
and three k times using a different fold
as the testing set each time since k
equals 5 in our example we would be
repeating this process a total of 5
times during the second iteration fold
two would be the testing set and the
union of folds one three four and five
would be the training set during the
third iteration fold 3 would be the
testing set and the union of folds one
two four and five would be the training
set and so on finally the average
testing accuracy also known as the cross
validated accuracy is used as the
estimate of out-of-sample accuracy
here's a diagram of five fold cross
validation that may be helpful to you as
you can see each fold acts as the
testing set for one iteration and is
part of the training set for the other
four iterations one thing I want to make
clear is that we are dividing the
observations into five folds we are not
dividing the features into five folds
that might be confusing from the diagram
since normally we represent observations
as rows
whereas this diagram represents
observations as columns
I've written some simple code to
demonstrate the process of splitting a
data set into folds it's not important
that you understand this code rather I
just want to focus on the output pretend
that you have a data set with 25
observations numbered 0 through 24 and
you want to use five fold cross
validation this is an example of how
that data set might be split into the
five folds each line represents one
iteration of cross-validation in which
the dataset has been split into training
and testing sets for each iteration we
can see the ID numbers of the 20
observations in the training set and the
ID numbers of the 5 observations in the
testing set you'll notice that for a
given iteration every observation is
either in the training set or the
testing set but not both you'll also
notice that every observation is in the
testing set exactly once let's briefly
compare cross-validation to train test
split to clarify the advantages of each
the main reason we prefer
cross-validation to Train test split is
that cross-validation generates a more
accurate estimate of out-of-sample
accuracy which is what we need in order
to choose the best model as you've seen
it also uses the data more efficiently
than train tests split since every
observation is used for both training
and testing the model however there are
two primary advantages to using train
tests split instead of cross-validation
first train test split runs K times
faster than k-fold cross-validation
since k-fold cross-validation
essentially repeats the train test split
process k times this is an important
consideration for larger data sets as
well as models that take a long time to
train second it's much easier to examine
the detailed results of the testing
process from train tests what as you'll
see below scikit-learn makes cross
validation very easy to implement but
all you get back are the resulting
scores this makes it difficult to
inspect the results using a confusion
matrix or ROC curve which are tools for
model evaluation
whereas train tests split makes it easy
to examine those results before we walk
through some cross validation code I
want to present two recommendations for
the use of cross-validation first we've
been using the value k equals 5 for our
examples and in fact any number can be
used for K however K equals 10 is
generally recommended because it has
been shown experimentally to produce the
most reliable estimates of out-of-sample
accuracy second when you use
cross-validation with classification
problems it is recommended that you use
stratified sampling to create the folds
this means that each response class
should be represented with approximately
equal proportions in each of the folds
for example if your dataset has two
response classes ham and spam and 20% of
your observations were ham then each of
your cross-validation folds should
consist of approximately 20% ham
thankfully
scikit-learn uses stratified sampling by
default when using the cross valve core
function which is what we'll use below
unless you don't need to worry about
implementing stratified sampling
yourself let's now go through an example
for how cross-validation can be used in
scikit-learn to help us with parameter
tuning we're again using the iris data
set and our goal in this case is to
select the best tuning parameters also
known as hyper parameters for the K
nearest neighbors classification model
in other words we want to select the
tuning parameters for K n n which will
produce a model that best generalizes to
out-of-sample data we'll focus on
tuning the K in K nearest neighbors
which represents the number of nearest
neighbors that are taken into account
when making a prediction
note that this K has nothing to do with
the K in k-fold cross-validation our
primary function for cross-validation in
scikit-learn will be cross Val score
which will import from the SK learn
we're going to try out the value k
equals 5 so we instantiate a k neighbors
classifier model with the n neighbors
parameter set to that value and save the
model as an object called KN n note that
we didn't have to import K neighbors
classifier because we already imported
it previously will now use the cross Val
giving this function five parameters
the first parameter is the model object
KN the second and third parameters are
X&amp;amp;Y meaning our feature matrix and
response vector it's very important to
note that we are passing the entirety of
X&amp;amp;Y to cross Val score not X train and Y
train as we'll discuss below cross Val
soar takes care of splitting the data
into folds and thus we do not need to
split the data ourselves using train
test split the fourth parameter is CV
equals ten which means that we want it
to use 10-fold cross-validation the
final parameter is scoring equals
accuracy which means that we want to use
classification accuracy as the
evaluation metric there are many
possible evaluation metrics so I
recommend that you always explicitly
specify which one you want to use you
can see the complete list of metrics in
scikit-learn z' model evaluation
documentation which i've linked to in
the resources section below before we
run this code let's discuss what the
cross foul scorn actually does and what
it returns basically cross Val score
execute the first four steps of k-fold
cross-validation it will split X&amp;amp;Y
into 10 equal folds it will train the KN
model on the Union of folds 2 through 10
test the model unfold 1 and calculate
the testing accuracy then it will train
the KNN model on the union of fold one
and fold 3 through 10 test the model on
fold two
and calculate the testing accuracy and
it will do that eight more times when
it's finished it will return the ten
accuracy scores as a numpy array in our
code we're going to save that numpy
array as an object called scores and
then print it out we can see that during
the first iteration the model achieved a
testing accuracy of 100% in the second
iteration the accuracy was 93% and so on
as mentioned above we'll usually average
the testing accuracy across all 10
iterations and use that as our estimate
of out-of-sample accuracy it happens
that numpy arrays have a method called
mean so we can simply print scores dot
mean in order to see the mean accuracy
score it turns out to be about 97%
because we use cross-validation to
arrive at this result we're more
confident that it's an accurate estimate
of out-of-sample accuracy than we would
be if we had used train tests split
our goal here is to find an optimal
value of K for K and n which we set
using the N neighbors parameter thus we
will loop through a range of reasonable
values for K and for each value use
10-fold cross-validation to estimate the
out-of-sample accuracy we first create a
list of the integers 1 through 30 which
are the values we'll try for k then we
create K scores which is an empty list
in which will store the 30 scores we use
a for loop to loop through the values 1
through 30 during each iteration of the
loop we instantiate K neighbor's
classifier with n neighbors equal to the
selected K value we run 10-fold
cross-validation with that model and
finally we append the mean accuracy to
the case scores list let's run this code
and print the results these numbers are
a bit difficult to scan through visually
so we'll use a line plot with matplotlib
in order to visualize how the accuracy
changes as we vary the number for K
the maximum cross validated accuracy
occurs at K equals 13 through K equals
20 the general shape of the curve is an
upside-down u which is quite typical
when examining the relationship between
a model complexity parameter and the
model accuracy as I mentioned briefly in
a previous video this is an example of
the bias-variance tradeoff in which low
values of K produce a model with low
bias and high variance and high values
of K produce a model with high bias and
low variance the best model is found in
the middle because it appropriately
balances bias and variance and thus is
most likely to generalize to
out-of-sample data when deciding which
exact value of K to call the best it is
generally recommended to choose the
value which produces the simplest model
in the case of K and n higher values of
K produce lower complexity models and
thus we'll choose K equals 20
as our single best KN model
so far we've used cross-validation to
help us with parameter tuning let's look
at a brief example to demonstrate how
cross-validation can help us to choose
between different types of models
specifically we want to compare the best
KN model on the iris data set with a
logistic regression model which is a
popular model for classification first
let's run 10-fold cross-validation with
the best KN model to see our accuracy as
we saw above the accuracy is 98% note
that instead of saving the ten scores in
an object called scores and then
calculating the mean of that object
I'm just running the mean method
directly on the results we'll compare
this with logistic regression by
importing and instantiating a logistic
regression model and then again running
10-fold cross-validation this gives us
an accuracy of 95% and so we would
conclude that KN is likely a better
choice than logistic regression for this
particular task
finally let's check out how cross
validation can help us with feature
selection if you remember the
advertising dataset from the last video
you may recall that we were using linear
regression to predict sales one question
we had was whether to include the
newspaper feature in that model we start
by importing pandas numpy and linear
regression and then reading the data
into pandas will first try a model with
all three features to build our feature
matrix x we create a Python list of
feature names and then use that list to
select just those columns from the data
frame we also select the sales column as
our response vector Y we instantiate the
linear regression model and will again
use cross-validation since it works with
both classification and regression
models we can't use accuracy as our
evaluation metric since that's only
relevant for classification problems we
want to use root mean squared error but
that is not directly available via the
scoring parameter so we'll instead ask
for mean squared error and then later
take the square root anyway let's run
10-fold cross-validation on our model
and examine the scores
this doesn't seem right if you remember
the formula for mean squared error from
the last video you'd agree that the
results should be positive numbers and
all of these numbers are negative what
happened here it's complicated to
explain but it boils down to the fact
that classification accuracy is a reward
function meaning something you want to
maximize whereas mean squared error is a
loss function meaning something you want
to minimize there are other cycle learn
functions that depend on the results of
cross Valspar and those functions select
the best model by looking for the
highest value of cross-filing the
highest value of a reward function makes
sense for choosing the best model but
finding the highest value for a loss
function would select the worst model
thus a design decision was made for
cross valve or to negate the output for
all loss functions so that when other
scikit-learn functions call cross valve
or those functions can always assume
that higher results indicate better
models if you found that confusing
you're not alone there is a long
discussion of this issue in cycle urns
github repository that has been going on
since 2013 which I'll link to in the
resources below if you want to read
further this behavior is likely to
change in a future version of
scikit-learn but for now we just need to
work around this issue
the workaround is simply to take the
negative of scores and store it in MSE
scores will convert mean squared error
to root mean squared error by taking the
square root finally we'll calculate the
average root mean squared error across
the ten cross-validation folds thus we
would estimate that the out-of-sample
root mean squared error for this model
would be one point six nine our goal
here was to compare the model including
newspaper with a model excluding
newspaper so let's create a new X that
only includes the TV and radio features
we'll compute the average root mean
squared error in a single line this time
by using cross valve
taking the square root and then taking
the mean
the resulting estimate is 1.68
since this is a lower number than the
model that included newspaper and root
mean squared error is something we want
to minimize we would conclude that the
model excluding newspaper is a better
model to wrap up I want to briefly go
through some common variations to cross
validation that are likely to make it an
even better procedure the first is
repeated cross validation in which K
fold cross validation is repeated
multiple times with different random
splits of the data into the K folds and
the results are averaged this provides a
more reliable estimate of out-of-sample
performance by reducing the variance
associated with a single trial of
cross-validation the second improvement
is to create a holdout set instead of
running cross-validation on the entire
data set a portion of the data is held
out and not touched during the model
building process the best model is
located in tuned using cross-validation
on the remaining data at the end of this
process the holdout set is then used to
test the best model the performance on
this holdout set is considered to be a
more reliable estimate of out-of-sample
performance than the cross validated
performance since the holdout set is
out-of-sample for the entire process the
final improvement is for all feature
engineering and selection to take place
within each cross-validation iteration
performing these tasks before
cross-validation does not fully mimic
the
application of the model to
out-of-sample data since those processes
will have unfair knowledge of the entire
data set and thus the cross validated
estimate of out-of-sample performance
will be biased upward as such a more
reliable performance estimate is
generated when these tasks only take
place within the cross-validation
iterations obviously all of these
procedures add some amount of complexity
to your modeling process or your
modeling code and may also be
computationally more expensive depending
upon the particular problem the benefits
of using these improved procedures may
not be worth the costs so ultimately
it's up to you whether or not simple
k-fold cross-validation is good enough
for your application the proper
application of cross-validation is a
deep topic and so ultimately there's no
way for me to offer a universal advice
that applies to all situations
I've got a lot of great resources for
you this week
first is scikit-learn documentation on
cross-validation which goes into many
different cross validation strategies
including how to build your own cross
validation iterator there's also the
documentation on model evaluation which
covers many different evaluation metrics
including advice on when and how to use
each metric if you're interested in the
discussion behind why cross Val score
returns negative values for mean squared
error check out this issue in Psych it
learns github repository for a bit more
depth on cross validation at a
conceptual level read section 5.1 of an
introduction to statistical learning and
watch the two related videos scott fort
monroe author of the excellent article
on the bias-variance tradeoff that i
mentioned in a previous video has
another good article which compares
adjusted r-squared AIC and bi SI train
test split and cross validation as
estimates of model performance machine
learning mastery has a friendly
introduction to feature selection which
provides some good general advice and
touches on the issue of doing feature
selection within each cross-validation
iteration there's also a great ipython
notebook from Harvard's data science
class which demonstrates how feature
selection within cross validation
iterations is important when the number
of features is significantly larger than
the number of observations in your data
set
finally I've linked to a readable paper
that examines many different variations
of cross validation in detail and argues
for repeated cross validation among
other recommend a
Asians thanks so much for your feedback
on the last video in which I asked
whether I should cover more pandas
functionality or just focus exclusively
on scikit-learn the majority of you
asked that I focus on scikit-learn but
introduce useful pandas functionality as
needed so that's what I'll do in the
next video we'll discuss how to search
for optimal tuning parameters in a more
automatic fashion until then I look
forward to your comments and questions
