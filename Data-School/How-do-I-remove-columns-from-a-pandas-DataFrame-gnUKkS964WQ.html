series about the pandas library in
Python so the question for today is how
do I remove columns from a panda's data
frame great question
so the pandas data frame is of course
the primary unit of data storage in the
pandas library
it's like rows and columns so how do I
remove a column as always we are going
to pull up an example data set and but
first we need to import pandas as PD and
then we're going to pull up the UFO data
set a data set of UFO sightings or
reported sightings and so we'll use the
read CSV function and we'll pass it the
URL of the data set bitly slash UFO
reports okay so this creates a panda's
data frame and we'll just look at the
head as a reminder of what is in this
data frame they're just UFO reports it
has five columns and in case you're
curious you can use the shape attribute
and see that there are 18 thousand two
hundred and forty-one rows that's what
this is telling us anyway let's pretend
that we don't care about the colors
reported column so we want to get rid of
it okay how do we do that well let's
we'll just use the drop method which is
a data frame method so you say UFO dot
drop and then we're just going to pass
it as a string the name of the column we
want to drop so colors report it now
there are two more things I'm going to
add here the first is the axis so I'm
going to say axis equals one and we'll
talk more about axes in another video
but in brief and
axis is just kind of a direction okay
so axis 0 is the row axis um it kind of
is a dirt like directionally like down
is axis 0 I think of it as the row axis
axis 1 is the column axis it's the one
that kind of moves across and that
movement will make more sense when we
talk more about it in a future video but
axis equals 1 is the way I say to pandas
I want to drop a column and its name is
colors reported okay one more thing
we're going to say in place equals true
what does that mean it just means I want
this operation to occur in place ok so
we will run this and we will just rerun
the head method and you will see that
the colors reported column aka series is
now missing it's now gone ok so um you
can actually drop multiple columns at
once so I'll show you how to do that now
so let's say I wanted to get rid of city
and state I didn't care about those
let's do UFO drop and what you do is
very similar except you just instead of
passing a string you pass a list of
strings okay so I'll say city whoops
comma state okay so the first argument
is that list the second argument is X is
equals one third argument in place
equals true we run that and UFO dot head
is now down to those two columns okay
they are gone they are no longer part of
the data frame and that's really it
okay as always I like to end these
videos with a bonus tip and the bonus
tip is what if you want to remove rows
instead of columns well turns out you
just use the drop method except you use
axis zero because as I said axis one is
the column axis axis 0 is the row axis
okay so so we're going to use UFO drop
and we know there's going to be
something here and then we're going to
say axis equals 0 and in place equals
true but what is this first thing let's
say I want to drop rows the first two
rows because I don't care about UFO
reports before 1931 so I don't care
about these two rows I don't want them
in the data set so how do I refer to
them by name I actually the names are
right here the names are 0 and 1 okay
just like these are the names of the
columns these are the names of the rows
they're officially called the index also
called the labels and so I'm just going
to pass a list and I'll just say 0 comma
1 run that UFO dot head and you you can
see those two rows the 1930s have been
dropped and if you really want to be
sure that they're gone you can see that
the shape the number of rows has
decreased by two rows okay
so one final note about this axis equals
0 is actually the default so technically
I did not have to specify axis equals 0
here however I always like to specify
the axis just to be really clear about
what I am doing ok so that's all for
today thanks as always for joining me
please click Subscribe if you'd like to
see more videos like this as always
leave a comment telling me your question
about this video or your panda's
question in general I will try to answer
it maybe I'll even make a video ok so
that's it thanks again and I will see
you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
