series on the pandas library in Python
and today I'm actually only going to be
answering questions from the YouTube
comments okay so we're gonna start with
a question from Eli and Eli asks and
we're gonna start right here
what about reading from a CSV file only
two columns and ignore the others and
second what is the fastest method to
read from a CSV file okay
so let's pull up an example dataset and
answer those questions so we'll import
pandas as PD okay and then we're gonna
pull in a dataset of reported UFO
sightings so UFO equals PD read CSV and
pass a bitly link of UFO reports okay so
if we look at the columns we can see
that there are five columns and let's
pretend we only want to keep two of them
all we actually have to do is to modify
the parameters of the read CSV function
and just say use calls equals and we can
say city comma state so we pass it a
list and then I'll just go ahead and put
UFO columns here so when we read that in
now we're only reading in the city and
state columns you can also reference
columns by position so I could reference
them as 0 comma 4 that would also work
ok so that's how to read in only a
selection of columns now your second
question about the fastest method to
read from a CSV file so I'm not sure
exactly what you mean but I want to show
you at least one way to speed up the
reading of a CSV file which is and again
I'm just gonna copy this line and um you
know it obviously won't work in many
scenarios but if you only need a certain
section of rows you could just say n
rows equals three and that will just
read in the first three rows now this is
probably mostly useful for um let's say
you have a really big data set and you
want to take a look at it
before reading in the entire thing you
just pull in the first few rows and
that'll take care of it okay so now my
data set is literally just these three
rows okay next question is from Elliot
and Elliot asks how do data frames and
series work with regard to selecting
individual entries and iteration okay so
we're gonna stick with the UFO data
frame and turns out that pandas series
are actually iterable just like say a
Python list so you could say for C in
UFO dot city and just say print C and
you'll see that I'm just iterating
through the city series and I printed
out these three series okay now for
iterating through a data frame pandas
actually has specific methods that
you're supposed to use okay so and it's
kind of like enumerate and you'll see
what I mean
so for index comma row in UFO dot it
arose that's one of the methods I'm
gonna say print index comma Rho dot city
Rho dot state okay and so you can see
that when I iterate through the rows of
a data frame with it arose I can grab
the index I can grab and I'm grabbing
the row and in fact I'm just printing
out two of the series from that row okay
next question is from
pod Leeza and they said what's the best
way to drop every non numeric column
from a data frame okay so I'm gonna pull
up a different data set for this we're
gonna pull in a data set of alcohol
consumption by country so PT dot read
CSV and past the URL fit dot Lee slash
drinks by country okay and let's take a
look at the D types okay and we see that
we have four numeric columns and two non
numeric columns which are objects okay
so how do I only read in how do I only
keep the four numeric columns so it's
kind of hard to remember but here's the
recommended way so we're actually gonna
import numpy as NP and then we're going
to use a data frame method called select
D types okay and then you say include
equals and in a list NP dot number okay
so if I do that and I check the D types
you'll see that it only keeps the I've
only selected the four numeric columns
okay all right
finally a question from Sergei and my
apologies Sergei if I'm getting your
name wrong I had to google it to figure
out the pronunciation and the internet
told me I should say Sergei so my
apologies if that's incorrect but his
question was for example in this video
there is movie dot describe include
equals something so where should we use
brackets and we're not it is a bit
confusing because why don't we use
describe include equals something as a
string instead of a list of us
single-string okay great question so um
let's take a look at the describe method
for drinks in this case so by default
describe the described method describes
all of the numeric columns okay so let's
take a look at the help for this method
so we're gonna hit shift tab one two
three times and then we'll scroll down
here and we'll see that for the include
parameter it takes a list like all or
none which is the default okay so if you
read through this you'll see that when
none is the parameter for include it
only shows numeric columns but if you
want to show all columns you pass the
string include equals all just a string
and it includes all of the columns okay
but if you pass it a list of d types so
for example object and then we'll say
float 64 it will only include those
types all right so the reason it wanted
a list is because it wanted to give you
the option of specifying multiple types
so if you want to select just one type
you still have to use a list and it'll
just be a list of length one okay now it
can be tricky to figure out how to use
pandas parameters correctly the
documentation is a great source of
figuring that out
but as well searching online for good
examples of usage is another way to
figure out how to use pandas functions
properly okay so that's it for today
thanks so much for joining me and as
always feel free to click Subscribe if
you'd like to see more videos like this
and of course please post a question in
the comments and maybe I will make a
video about your question next time okay
thanks again and I hope to see you again
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
