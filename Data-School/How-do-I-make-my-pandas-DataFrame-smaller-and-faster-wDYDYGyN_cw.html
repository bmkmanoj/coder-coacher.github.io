series about the pandas library in
Python and the question for today comes
from a YouTube viewer who says this is
something I've read in PB Python comm
and the author uses type category like
this can you explain to me what does the
type category do and how to properly use
it okay excellent question
so as always we will start by importing
pandas as PB and then we need an example
data set so we'll say drinks equals PD
read CSV and it's some bit dot least
slash drinks by country and this is a
data set of alcohol consumption by
country okay so drinks that head and you
can see it's it's one country per row
and let's use the info data frame method
which we have not seen before to get
some more detail on this data frame okay
so tells us about the index there are
six columns how many non null meaning
non missing values are there in each
column and it tells us the data types so
we've got int float and object so object
usually means a string is being stored
but um you may not know that you can
actually create a pandas series of
Python lists or a pandas series of
Python dictionaries in other words you
can store arbitrary Python objects in a
panda series and pandas basically just
stores a reference to that object okay
and that it just calls it type object
okay the thing I want to focus on is
this memory usage at the bottom and it
says 10
point six plus kilobytes okay now why is
there a plus there well this is telling
us that the data frame takes at least 10
kilobytes of memory pretty small data
frame but why the plus and here's the
reason
um because object columns are references
to other objects pandas wants this info
method to run fast so it doesn't
actually go out and look at the objects
and figure out how much space they take
it actually just figures out how much
space the references to those objects
takes so it's saying it's at least ten
point six kilobytes but it might be a
lot more depending upon what's in those
object columns and again in this case
they're just the strings for country and
continent okay
so turns out you can actually force
pandas to count the true memory usage
okay so we just say drinks dot info and
memory usage equals deep okay and you'll
see the same stuff except it will tell
us
pandas actually looked at the object
columns and figured out how much space
they were taking and it says 25.8
kilobytes so more than double the actual
estimate now this takes a little bit
longer to run but it is accurate okay
now you might look at that and think
well how much space is each column
taking CAI each series and you can
actually do that so let's say we
actually just use the method drinks dot
memory usage okay and this time it will
tell us the memory usage in bytes so
fifteen hundred and forty four bytes not
kilobytes now the thing this doesn't
tell us is just like drinks that info
it does not kind of inspect those object
columns by default so if you want the
real numbers you have to say deep equals
true okay
and now we've got the actual size in
bytes used by each of those series okay
so uh and and one final thing I want to
mention about this memory usage is
because this outputs a pandas series
right this is just the index of the
series and these are the values we can
actually say just dot sum and we'll get
about 25 kilobytes which is what we saw
up here okay so on the bottom line of
trying to what I'm trying to tell you is
that object columns can take up a lot of
space so the question is especially if
this was a really large data set and you
know we were storing too much that the
data frame was growing to too large how
can I reduce that how can I be more
space efficient especially with object
columns well think about this what if we
were able to store our strings as
integers because integers are more space
efficient than strings now
what do I mean by this well think about
this okay um there are only six unique
values in the continent series for
example so drinks dot continent dot
unique series method and I'm going to
sort it that's just a Python function
and you can see that here are the six
unique values of continent so let's
pretend that instead of storing strings
we said okay I will store a zero to mean
Africa a one to mean Asia a two to mean
Europe a three to mean North America and
so on okay now by doing that we're only
storing into
so uh just to make sure this is very
clear let's just do drinks
continent-continent dot head so uh if
this is stored as strings but if I
wanted to store them in as integers I
would just say something like okay Asia
that's 1 this is 2 this is 0 this is 2
this is 0 chi and so on now if we did
this if we invented this system then
you'd still have to store like a little
lookup table that said when I say 0 I
mean Africa so um we would basically we
would still have to store the strings
but we would only have to store them
once ok now if you like this idea
thankfully we don't have to implement
this ourselves because pandas has
created this system for us there's a
category data type and this was
introduced in pandas 0.15 and I'll show
you how to convert a column an object
column to the category type so we're
going to say drinks bracket continent
equals drinks dot continent dot as type
category okay
that's all okay so let's check out the D
types to see what we've got now and you
can see that country is still object but
continent is now type category ok
and if you it still looks the same so if
you say drinks that continent dot head
still looks the same here but now notice
you've got this thing down here it says
categories 6 and it lists them here the
six categories okay and I'm telling you
that under the hood
it is storing these strings as integers
okay and here's kind of like a
representation of that lookup table now
I can prove to you this storage so I'm
going to say drinks dot continent dot
cat dot codes got head okay
let's deconstruct this continent series
and then you'll remember from a previous
video how when you're like using a
string method for a series you would say
like drinks continent dot stir dot
contains or something like that well
with categorical stuff it's the same way
I say drinks continent dot cat and then
there's some other stuff in there so I
can say dot cat dot and I hit tab and
there's a bunch of things you can do
okay so I'm saying dot cat dot codes and
let's just go ahead and look at the head
okay and you can see just like I was
saying one two zero two zero that is
exactly how pandas is now representing
the continent series as integers okay
now we talked about doing this to reduce
our memory usage well let's take a look
drinks dot memory usage deep equals true
okay look at that before continent was
over 9000 bytes now it's less than 500
bytes okay now to be very clear um
instead of storing 193 strings we're now
storing 193 integers that point to a
lookup table of six strings that says 0
is Africa 1 is Asia so the strings only
have to be stored once the rest is
integer storage thus much more space
efficient okay now let's try to repeat
this for the other object column country
so let's just say
banks bracket country equals drinks dot
country dot as type category okay and
let's check the memory usage drinks dot
memory usage deep equals true and you
might have sensed this wasn't going to
go very well when we look at country it
has now gotten larger why is that well
if you remember the country series every
country was a different string okay so
we created a hundred and ninety three
categories okay so if we say during
stock country dot cat dot categories
it's an attribute you'll see there are a
hundred and ninety three categories so
previously up before we converted it to
a category with strings and we were
storing 193 strings now we're storing
193 integers which are very small but it
points to a lookup table of 193 strings
so we're actually spending more memory
than before to store it the same thing
so the bottom line here is you use the
category datatype when you have when you
have an object column of strings that
only has a few different values okay not
a ton of different values now besides
just reducing your memory usage when for
continent at least okay it actually
speeds up your computations so if you
are working with an object column of
strings and you're doing computations
with it say you're you're doing a group
by with that column it will actually
speed up your operations um if you use
the category datatype so simply
converting a column to a category
Woori will not only save you space as
long as there aren't too many values
unique values and it will speed up
computations it is such an easy way to
make your data frame smaller and faster
okay now as always I want to end with a
bonus and to do this bonus I need to
create just a very small data frame and
so I'm just going to say DF equals PD
data frame and we'll talk more about how
to use PD data frame in a future video
um but I'm actually going to pass it a
dictionary in which the key is the
column name and the values R is just a
list of values I want to put in the data
frame so and you'll see how this looks
in a second three and we're gonna get
quality okay list of strings good very
good good and excellent
okay create my data frame and let's
print it out okay so I've created a data
frame with two columns and four rows
don't worry so much about this code
this is just an example data frame and
you can pretend that these the ID column
or like ID numbers for some sort of item
so it's a ring or a stone or who knows
and the quality column is a rating of
the quality of that item okay kind of
makes sense on what if and you'll see in
a moment why we're doing this what if I
said DF dot sort values quality meaning
I want to sort this data frame by the
quality series well how does it sort
well it seems kind of obvious it sorts
in alphabetical order
it says excellent good
it very good so eg G V okay now here's
the thing there's a logical ordering to
these categories right um how can we
tell pandas that there is actually a
logical ordering well here's what we're
going to do we're going to use the
category data type and we're going to
define ordered categories okay so DF
bracket quality equals DF quality dot as
type category and then we're going to
say two more things so we're converting
it to type category we're going to say
categories equals and we're going to say
good very good very good excellent
okay so we're telling it the ordering
the logical ordering of the categories
from like lowest to highest kind of
that's how it and that's how we specify
and then we say ordered equals true okay
so if you look at the series it still
looks the same
okay I remember we didn't we didn't
change the sorting in place so DF dot
quality is still good very good good
excellent
just like here okay however it now tells
you for the categories good is less than
very good is less than excellent this is
now ordered categories and here's the
cool part when you've defined ordered
categories if you sort things sort
values quality it now sorts them in
logical order
so from good good very good excellent so
it's not sorting by letter it's sorting
by the ordering we define
for the categories and probably the
coolest thing about this in my opinion
is that you can now use boolean
conditions with this such as DF dot lope
and what I mean is let's say I want to
see all the rows where the quality is
better than good what rows do I want DF
DF dot quality is greater than good and
I want to see all columns and check that
out we only see the very good and
excellent and it did that you can now
use these comparison operators with the
string because the categories are
ordered and it understands that very
good and excellent are greater than good
