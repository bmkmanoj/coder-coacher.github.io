with the &quot;test-repo&quot; we created previously.
Specifically, we're going to edit an existing
file, add a new file, commit those changes,
and push those changes up to GitHub.
To start, we've already opened up Git Bash
and changed our working directory to test-repo.
As you might recall, there's just one file
in the repo, which is the &quot;README.md&quot; file.
We're going to edit that file.
Since it's a Markdown file, you can edit it
in any text editor.
I've opened the file in Windows Notepad, and
am just going to make a simple edit and then
save the file.
Let's also create a new Markdown file called
&quot;new.md&quot;.
We're going to use a command called &quot;touch&quot;.
It's not a Git command, but it's especially
handy on Windows since it can be hard to create
a file with a non-standard extension.
Simply type &quot;touch&quot; and then the name of the
file.
You can see that it has been created.
The file we created is empty, so let's open
it in Notepad.
I've written some Markdown code in this Markdown
Live Editor, so that you can see a preview
of what it looks like.
The Markdown code is on the left, and the
rendered version is on the right.
I'll link to this tool in the video description.
Anyway, let's copy the Markdown code to the
new.md file and save it.
We're back in Git Bash, and are going to run
the &quot;git status&quot; command to see the status
of our files.
It tells us that we've got one tracked file
that has been modified, and one untracked
file that has been added.
We want to stage both of these files for committing.
We use the &quot;git add&quot; command to do this.
You could do this one file at a time using
&quot;git add&quot; and then the filename.
But instead, we're going to use &quot;git add .&quot; which
adds both of them at once.
Let's run the status again.
We can see that the changes are ready for
committing.
To commit, use the &quot;git commit&quot; command.
We use the &quot;-m&quot; argument and write a message
because every commit should have a descriptive
message.
The commit is complete, and we can run &quot;git
status&quot; to confirm that there is nothing else
to commit.
We can also check the log to see that the
commit is there.
Everything we've done so far has only affected
our local machine.
To get our GitHub repo up-to-date, we need
to push up our changes.
To push our changes, we use the &quot;git push&quot;
command.
The specific command is &quot;git push origin master&quot;,
which means that we want to push the &quot;master&quot;
branch to the &quot;origin&quot; remote.
Remember that in a previous video, we set
up the &quot;origin&quot; remote to refer to our GitHub
repository.
Type in your password, and you're done.
Refresh GitHub, and you can see that the &quot;README.md&quot;
file has been modified, and the &quot;new.md&quot; file
has been added.
You can also see the commit history.
On my blog, dataschool.io, I've got a Git
quick reference guide that I wrote specifically
for beginners, containing these and other
common commands.
I'll link to it in the video description,
and hopefully you'll find it to be useful.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
