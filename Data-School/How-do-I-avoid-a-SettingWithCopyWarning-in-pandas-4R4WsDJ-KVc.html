series about the pandas library in
Python and the question for today is how
do I avoid a setting with copy warning
in pandas okay so if you've been using
pandas for a little while you've
probably gotten this warning at some
point and the proper response to the
warning is to figure out how to deal
with it and figure out what pandas is
asking you to do but the warnings a bit
complicated to understand so many people
just turn it off instead and that's not
a good practice unless you are really
sure of what you are doing okay so we're
gonna look at two scenarios in which
this warning arises and we're gonna
figure out how to address it okay so
let's get our example data set for today
so import pandas as PD and we're gonna
say movies equals PD read CSV bit dot
Lee slash IMDB ratings and this is a
data set of movies from the Internet
Movie Database
so movies dot head and here are our
first five rows okay so we're gonna
focus on the content rating column right
here and let's look for missing values
okay so movies dot content rating dot is
null dot some okay so we're just
counting how many missing values there
are okay and there are three now let's
take a look at these three real quickly
so movies and we'll say bracket movies
dot content rating dot is null so this
part inside the bracket is generating a
boolean series that we're passing to the
data frame and it will display the
three movies okay now we see the na n in
the content rating column and that is
the special value that means missing all
right now um let's let's take a look at
the content rating all the unique values
so movies dot content rating dot value
counts is one way okay and we see this
year and we decide for the purpose of
this video that not rated on these
sixty-five movies this should be
represented as a missing value okay now
sometimes in datasets there is a flag
that means missing and it's best to
replace those values with the na n we
saw here so that we can take advantage
of the missing value of functionality
okay so our first step here is going to
be to find the relevant movies so we're
gonna say movies dot actually movies
bracket movies dot content rating equals
equals not rated okay so if we run that
we'll find all the movies with the not
rated content rating okay then the
second step is to say well that is the
series I want to overwrite with na n so
let's select it so we'll say dot content
rating and now we've just got that
series and finally we want to override
it with na n now how do we do that well
the na n is not a string it's a special
value from the numpy library so we're
gonna actually say import numpy
and P and then we will be able to
overwrite these not rated values with MP
dot n a n ok so we're overriding all
these values with not a number okay run
it and we get our warning ok setting
with copy warning a value is trying to
be set on a copy of a slice from a data
frame that is not crystal clear to most
people you can read this link and read
the documentation and that may not be
crystal clear either so I'm I'm gonna
show you how to fix this then I'm going
to explain why this happened okay
so first let's take a look and see if it
worked
so because it's just a warning it is not
an error it's just a warning
so we're gonna say movies dot content
rating dot is null dot song okay and
it's still three if it had worked it
would be 68 because these 65 would have
been added so we know it didn't work
okay so here is the solution to getting
this line of code to work and I'm just
actually gonna copy it and you'll see
the simple modification I make we are
instead actually going to use what it
suggested here try using dot Lok okay so
we're going to change this to movies dot
Lok and we're gonna say comma content
rating and delete this end part okay and
run it and you'll see that it did not
throw a warning now how does that look
work I've got a video about it but just
briefly we the the format of dot Lok is
specify which rows so these are the rows
I want and then specify which columns I
want and that's the column okay
so let's let's do check that this work
and actually I'll just rerun this line
of code and you'll see it's now 68 so it
did work now what exactly is going on
here the clearest explanation I found is
from Tom augsburger in his modern pandas
series and this is part one and I'll
link to it in the description below but
let me summarize it for you okay and
he's got this section setting with copy
that you can read if you're interested
but here is the summary ok this line of
code right here the one that threw the
warning is actually two operations so
this part is known as a get item ok
that's the first operation this part
with a reference to whatever was
produced by the first part is a set item
so we've got a get item and a set item
ok here's the problem
pandas can't guarantee whether the get
item the first part returned a view or a
copy of the data if it returned a view
of the data this would affect the data
frame the set item would affect the data
frame but if it returned a copy it still
would modify something it would be
modifying the copy but the copy just
gets discarded and it and thus the
original data frame does not get
modified so again pandas does not know
if this resulted in a view or a copy so
it's trying to warn you that it's not
sure what has happened ok now loke
solves this by turning it from two
operations into a single set item
operation ok that's why this does not
throw the air so the summary
here is if you are trying to select rows
and columns in the same line of code use
a dot Lok and that will work better with
pandas okay so that is the first example
of the setting with copy warning let's
let's go into the second example okay so
we're gonna pretend here that we only
want to focus on movies with a very high
star rating okay for the moment so let's
create a separate data frame called top
movies and we're gonna select out movie
style okay we're gonna say we want all
the movies with star rating greater than
or equal to 9 and then we want all
columns okay so I'm selecting out what
we'll see is actually just for movies so
this is the entire top movies data frame
okay so presumably we'll pull these out
we were gonna do on some analysis on
this and we didn't want to constantly be
telling a condition we just want to only
look at those four movies okay
so we're gonna pretend that we look at
this and we notice that the duration for
the Shawshank Redemption is incorrect
okay we notice that and we want to fix
it so we're gonna say top movies dot Lok
cuz we've learned our lesson about using
dot Lok I want row 0 and I want the
duration series okay so it's selecting
this cell without Lok and I'm gonna say
the proper duration is 150 so we run it
and we get the same setting with copy
warning and this is confusing because
it's suggestion is to use Lok and we
just used look here we just used Lok
here so we have no idea what is going on
okay so what before I tell you what the
problem is
let's check if it worked okay so let's
look at top movies
and it did actually modify top movies
okay so this is one reason why it's not
a good idea to turn these warnings off
because sometimes the warnings mean it
didn't work and sometimes the warnings
mean well I'm gonna warn you but it
still worked okay so you need to be able
to see the warning so you can check if
your code worked okay now what was the
problem why did this generate a warning
well pandas actually isn't sure whether
top movies is of view or a copy of
movies okay it's not sure if it's a
reference to the original movies data
frame or it's a copy and so it's trying
to warn you are you modifying one thing
top movies are you modifying two things
okay so what is the solution the
solution is and I'm just gonna copy this
line of code up here the problem
actually came here not the line of code
we've wrote
okay the problem was this line of code
any time you are trying to create a data
frame copy you should explicitly use the
dot copy method and then pandas can be
sure it is a copy and thus it is never
confused about is top movies a copy or a
view of four rows from movies it is now
sure that it is a copy at this point and
I'll just copy this line of code at this
point we can now use the line of code
right here to edit top movies and it
will not throw warning and you will see
it has it has edited top movies and by
the way movies had it did not edit the
duration here
okay so that's actually it for today no
