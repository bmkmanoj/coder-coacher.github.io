useful and free resources for learning more
about Git and GitHub.
I'll link to all of these resources in the
video description.
First is Pro Git, which is an excellent book
that will teach you how Git thinks as well
as walk you through a ton of useful examples.
Just read the first two chapters for now.
Next is the GitHub help section.
Their articles are full of diagrams as well
as Git code samples.
You might want to start with the Bootcamp.
GitRef.org is probably the best reference
guide out there.
Its examples are well-written, and every entry
links to the relevant section of Pro Git if
you want to read more.
I've also got a Git Quick Reference for Beginners
on my blog, which presents all of the most
common commands on a single page.
Finally, these are the GitHub Guides.
Each guide is a relatively quick read, and
walks you through some aspect of GitHub.
It also links to their Video Guides on YouTube,
which might be worth checking out.
These are just my favorite resources, but
there are many, many other resources out there
that might work better for you.
Feel free to share your favorite resource
in the comments.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
