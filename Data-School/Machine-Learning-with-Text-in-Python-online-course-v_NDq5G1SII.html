good to see all of you here super
excited I will introduce myself in a
moment but this is the info session for
machine learning with text in Python the
upcoming online course and I just want
to make sure you can see me and hear me
so if you can see me and hear me feel
free to post where you are coming from
in the chat some folks have already
already but I love to see where everyone
is from let's see Marvin from Germany
and Anthony from Texas Joseph Atlanta
many many more shtetl Arizona Spain DC
all right that is where I am living
saddle France India Miami San Fran LA oh
this is great Philly Philippines oh wow
mark if I don't know my time zones
offhand but it might be in the middle of
the night for you umm Spain great New
York City Nigeria wow this is awesome
I love the data school community by the
way it is so cool for those of you who
have been in the community for a while I
sent out some stickers around the world
a couple months ago and I mailed to like
20 different countries it was great um
okay let's see science says video stream
is not loading we have you know any time
that has happened
the most common resolution is just to
refresh your browser and it will
probably have to reload um if that
doesn't work you can always try a
different browser or device and I'm
sorry if you have problems with
crowdcast it usually works quite well
and worse comes to worse this is being
recorded and the cool technology is that
like within a minute of this info
session ending
you can watch the entire recording so
that's just to say that's your kind of
out if you really can't get it working
so um all right so welcome it's great to
see all you all of you here as I said
I'll introduce myself in a moment but
let me just give you the agenda for
today
first thing or the main thing is we are
gonna be chatting about the course
machine learning with text in Python I'm
gonna be walking through the course info
page of course I'm not just going to
read it to you I'm mostly going to kind
of comment on it answer your questions
about it give you context why I created
the course the way I did um so that is
the main thing I would strongly
encourage you to open up the course info
page if you don't already have it open
and there's a green I think green button
below on the screen that says click here
to view detailed course information if
you click that button it should open the
info page in a new window and highly
encourage you to do that um in terms of
your questions I will I will be
answering some of them as we go and the
rest I will answer at the end this um
I'm planning for this to go about an
hour and at the very end of the hour I
will if there's extra time I will answer
your questions about machine learning or
data science in general I'm happy to do
that if we have time and then in an hour
or like fifty-six minutes or something
enrollment will open for the course so
um yeah that's the plan um let me
introduce myself and then once I know
it's tiny bit more about you so as I
said or maybe not my name is Kevin
Markham I live in Washington DC and I'm
a full-time data science educator I
founded data school and my goal with
data school is to help you master
crucial data science topics so that
you can begin or accelerate your data
science career so that's my goal I've
been doing data school for about two and
a half years I think and for those of
you who are familiar with data school
I'd love to hear in the chat if you know
how you first heard about data school
was it a particular video was I a TA in
some course
do you know me from an in-person course
so yeah Eric vikon 2016 all right I was
speaking at PyCon 2016 the huge Python
conference and if you've not been which
is probably most of you really recommend
it the Python community is very
welcoming and PyCon is where you feel it
especially if you don't have like a
Python community locally so highly
recommend it but I was doing that
William you taught a short course for GA
yeah I've taught a number of things at
GA at General Assembly in DC now I'm
focused online but mark learning pandas
from you awesome my pandas video series
YouTube Twitter all right awesome
well great it's great to have all of you
here
one thing I I would love to know a bit
about a bit more about you and rather
than obviously I can't get into it in
too much depth but if you scroll below
the screen there's a tab there that says
polls and it'd be cool if you click on
polls and then I've got three questions
in there about Python experience machine
learning experience and NLP natural
language processing experience so I'd
love it if you take a minute to answer
it I understand some of you probably on
your phone and it's annoying to have to
switch around stuff don't worry about it
I just want to gauge the experience
levels of the group and we will tie this
back in a little while too
this course is a good fit for you um in
terms of Python experience machine
learning experience
NLP so just a comment briefly got a lot
of beginner and intermediate folks in
Python and a few advanced nobody that
has never used it which which is good
machine learning experience level some
that don't know anything about it I've
got a good I did a previous crowdcast
about getting started with machine
learning but a variety they're both
folks that have built machine learning
models on either in Python or not in
Python or they get the concept they just
haven't written the code so all of that
is fine and then NLP experience natural
language processing is skewed mostly
towards little experience with it
no people working professionally in NLP
okay so that is useful for me to know
thank you for sharing that and as I said
I'll kind of get back to how we can use
this information to help you decide
whether it's the right course for you um
before I start walking through the
course page I want to tell you one thing
about questions and this will help it
work best for everyone there are
essentially two ways you can ask me
questions one is the chat on the right
side of the screen and I see what's on
the right for everyone and the other is
these questions below the screen okay so
if you I will try to monitor the chat
while I am talking okay in I won't try I
will because I want to know when you
have questions about what I'm saying
so the chat is great when you have a
question about what I'm saying right
then and you're trying to get my
attention or you're just sharing
something with someone else and
interacting with others and you want an
answer which I'm happy to give you the
questions below the screen I you should
post there
you don't need it answered right at that
moment or it's not relevant to that
moment but you want to make sure they
answer it today in this webcast and I
will go through all those questions by
the end of this hour I promise okay
so chat for immediate questions under
the screen for like questions for a
little bit later okay all right
um that's that's the intro and let me
get right into the content I am going to
I've got two monitors set up here so I
just got a mintage a few things and I'm
going to try to share my screen so that
we can walk through this together and
let me see how this works let me get it
going
whoops that did not do it oh here we are
share my screen all right
okay so I think right now you can see me
and the screen I'm actually gonna close
let's see I think I will hide me so that
you can see the entire screen okay so I
think that worked okay um if anyone
could just give me confirmation can you
see my screen all right great
I will trust it thank you thank you all
okay so this is the course page you've
probably seen it but I'm just gonna give
you some commentary on it and walk
through some of the key points and I'll
try to do it quickly I don't want this
to get too too boring but um what is
this course about this course is about
mastering machine learning in Python um
if you're not interested in machine
learning this is not the course for you
um that part is critically important now
one question I get often is well I love
I'm really want to get good at machine
learning I don't know if like text is
what I want to focus on that's okay um
text is the content we will focus on in
this course in terms of machine learning
with text but it's not critically
important that you are passionate about
working with data and in fact you don't
need any experience working with text
data you don't even have to be convinced
it's useful I promise you will see that
working with text is critically useful
in machine learning because there is so
much unstructured text data out there
like everything that is text there are
so there are so much more text out there
than just your numerical data sets okay
so if you see the value of text-based
data this is definitely a good course
for you even if you're not sold on it
but you're just interested in mastering
machine learning I think this also is is
a good course for you okay I am gonna
focus in the course on hands-on
experience
this is not a fury course we're not
going to learn things um just to learn
them and know a bit about them with the
tiny exception of I'll introduce like an
overview of natural language processing
and tell you a lot about what you can do
with it without us doing it okay so with
that exception it is very much a
hands-on course it is a complex topic
and so I want you to get the support and
feedback you need okay so I want you to
get it really far with machine learning
with text during the course of these
eight weeks and ultimately I should be
able to apply these techniques to your
own problems okay so I've designed the
course in a way that there's a lot you
can reuse and reapply to other problems
as well as understanding the entire
workflow okay so I love this from Ryan
one of my students from April and I was
able to apply topics covered during my
first week to work that was awesome
when he shot me an email with that I
thought great you're one week in and
you're already using it at work and I
just think that's that's awesome
okay let's see how let's see Ari asked
how much of the course will be done
outside of scikit-learn and NLT kay I
will come back to libraries in a little
bit yeah I'll come back to that in a
little bit thank you a question okay so
how is this course different from other
online courses I will not you probably
also know the pain of that online
courses I've taken some you probably
have too and I'm not going to focus on
what's wrong with other courses some are
great some are not a lot or not but
that's not important what's important is
what am I gonna do in this course that
is
different and I think better we are
gonna be application focused okay so
yeah I really want you to be able to
apply what you're learning okay
you're not understand every single line
of code we write I say that I mean
there's one thing in the course that I I
remember skimming over because it wasn't
important for you to understand that
thing but basically I am walking through
every line of code because I want you to
be able to reuse this code knowledgeably
and modify it to suit your needs you're
gonna get practice with what we're
learning okay and you're gonna get
feedback when you submit homeworks okay
so you don't have to submit homeworks
you don't even have to do homeworks
you're all adults you can do what you
like but if you do the homeworks you
submit them you're gonna get feedback
from us okay when you need help during
this course that will be myself and my
assistant
Alex eager and cough it's just the two
of us Alex is amazing he used to be one
of my in-person students then he was my
ta now he's instructor as well he's
worked with me on the two previous
versions of the course he is a data
scientist just like myself we are the
ones who are gonna help you and and I
know I'm comparing this between help
from us forces a volunteer ta I'm not
criticizing volunteers yeas there are
lots of great volunteer TAS I used to be
one for the first course in Coursera's
data science specialization feel free to
post in the chat if you've ever taken
that course I was a TA for 16 sessions
in a row I think and know I was a good
TA but I was a TA when I felt like it
and uh and you know when I had time okay
so that's the difference here between
this and most courses is we are
dedicated to your success someone asked
what's a volunteer TA
um a TA stands for teaching assistant I
I realize now maybe that's not universal
terminology basically like on a Coursera
course those are previous students who
help out okay they volunteer they're not
being paid to be there there's no
requirement that they help every day
it's just they're there to help but we
will be there to help every day okay um
okay I think that's all I'll say about
how it's different I'm gonna scroll down
to a bit of the course description and
this is an eight-week course that a
lease does not start today that
eight-week starts the first day of
course you get a full eight weeks and it
runs from September 28th the Wednesday
through a Tuesday November 22nd okay and
what is included in the course fourteen
hours of videos okay if you're if you
watched my mini lessons that I sent out
in my email newsletter you've seen a
sample of what this looks like these are
recorded from past classes I have taught
this course live before um why is it
recorded this time instead of live well
there are lots of things to like about
live classes but there's a couple huge
problems one is I have an audience from
around the world that wants to take this
class and it's hard to get everyone or
even a majority in the same place at the
same time online for a class and second
I had a lot of students that are just
like I want to watch this class whenever
I want
I want to watch it in an hour trunk not
a three-hour chunk I get tired during
class I want to pause it I don't have a
three-hour block to sit and participate
in a class so I want to use the videos
or people who say I like to watch the
videos faster because you talk too slow
which is fine I'm not offended by that
some people a lot of people I think will
go back in the video to help them
you think missed a point they don't get
it you can immediately go back in a
video so that's why I like using video
and I'm doing it this way and the
classes are carefully edited I've spent
over 50 hours 5-0 hours editing the
videos so that they're as packed as
possible and there's not a lot of time
wasted in there every moment that's in
there is there for a reason
okay instructor-led webcasts this is a
new thing I'm doing um this is gonna be
great we're gonna do this twice a week
for half an hour you can show up if you
want you can watch the recording if you
don't I'll be answering your questions
and when there aren't questions I'm
gonna teach stuff that's not in the
videos and the rest of the course
material okay so that's gonna be really
fun we're gonna use crowdcast
so if hopefully you're liking this
platform this is exactly what the live
webcasts twice a week are going to feel
like so there you go ah two questions up
here what's the average daily effort
required just a ballpark based on past
incoming student skills
great question past students have told
me six to eight hours per week okay
so forty to sixty hours I think over the
course of your eight weeks is I think
what what folks have said five to eight
hours a week sorry that's what people
have said depends upon your experience
and how deep you want to go Felipe or
Filipe sorry asked what time will these
webcasts be all it's on the page below
and I'll you'll see it again
Sundays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Tuesdays at
1:00 p.m. Eastern okay I tried really
hard to pick two times that would appeal
to them to nearly everyone in the world
at least one of those times hopefully
works for you but you can always watch
the recording okay um can we have a pen
cache can we have the instructor-led
webcast over
weekend well I realize for some the
Sunday night is not the weekend for many
of my students it is um you know I tried
really hard to come up with two times
that would work for as many people as
possible hopefully one of those can work
for you I understand if it's not if
neither is IDL hopefully the recordings
are good enough for you you can always
post it ahead of time and watch a
recording see the chat so hopefully that
it's helpful
Wolfgang asks will the topics for the
two webcast in a given week be the same
I don't think so but I'm not sure this
is this is a new thing I'm trying so I
don't want to promise it will be one way
or another I tend to think it will be
different um I tend to think there will
be questions and I will spend a lot of
time on that and maybe I'll teach the
same thing each webcast if I'm eating an
additional little lesson but it's it's
really hard to say what I will say is
even if you don't want to attend it
should be really easy to kind of scan
through that 30 minutes sometime during
the week see if you missed anything um
yeah hopefully that's that's helpful
it's a new thing so I just I don't want
to promise it'll be a certain way um
well commented lesson notebooks if
you've gone through my scikit-learn
series or my panda series and seen the
notebooks you know that I am obsessive
about really good comments you will get
well commented code okay
the homework assignments they are long
and thorough they contain a lot of
guidance to help you the solutions are
long and detailed and everything is
explained so I really want you to get a
lot out of the homeworks um feedback we
will usually give feedback on your
homework within one day within 24 hours
sometimes it'll be 48 because you know
it it takes time
so it'll mostly be Alex but I will be
doing any he's not able to get to in
time because we want to make sure you
get feedback quickly how long Eleanor
asked how long do the homeworks take per
week so that is baked in to the the
hours estimate of five to eight hours a
week so just to give you a preview
videos per week is going to be usually
two to three hours and you could easily
spend a ton of hours going through the
pre-class work or the post class
resources most people pick a thing or
two in there and consume those during
the week but that amount of time is up
to you for the homeworks in particular
Vic differ the shortest homework for
someone who's already like comfortable
with the material is probably like 30
minutes to an hour one of the homeworks
is super long and pretty hard and even
if you're pretty good already at some of
this material it would take you a couple
hours but you could take a lot longer
now that being said the homeworks um
what was I gonna say about that um so I
was reading the next question and you
lose your train of thought the homeworks
oh okay this is super important a week
to homework which by the way is I think
the longest homework you don't have to
submit it during week two you have eight
weeks so it's if you're finding that
homework is taking too long
don't worry there's no homework
deadlines other than you have eight
weeks for everything okay you have eight
weeks total for the course so the week
two homework you have seven weeks to
work on if you really want to okay so
the homeworks will probably on average
take a few hours but it's really
dependent upon your level of fluency no
no worries
Philippe or Philippe yes the materials
are both Python two and three compatible
okay
um let's see I want to make sure I get
through all this stuff so I will I will
try to move quickly here slack team
that's where you can ask myself and Alex
for help we will usually get back to you
within like 12 hours if not sooner but
rarely will it be more than 24 hours
before you get an answer there are some
pre class resources before every class
there are post class resources after
every class and new this time around
is a private Kaggle competition which
should be fun I love private capital
competitions and I've done them before
in my in-person courses and I think this
will be a lot of fun completely optional
um let's see I understand the way Peng
Kosh I'm not clear on your question feel
free to clarify or shoot me an email
afterwards I'm not clear about that
Eleanor asks for intermediate I read
this course is for immediate Python
users I'm more of a beginner um does
this mean I won't be able to do the
coursework let me um that's too tough
one let me get back to that in a little
bit and when I talk about prerequisites
and I think you'll see you'll have a
better sense and if it doesn't give you
enough sense let's communicate over
email and figure it out okay okay
and finally money-back guarantee just
you know out of a hundred plus students
only one person's ever asked they they
were just like I don't have time for
this never mind and that's fine within
the first two weeks of the course um no
problem I want this course to be a great
fit for you I'm just saying it's only
happened once where anyone's ever done
it so okay
course outline there's a lot of detail
in here
I will save most of this I'm just going
to give a high level over
real quick there's five modules these
modules are spread out over six weeks
um module one is about the basic machine
learning workflow for working with text
module two is about using natural
language processing techniques to
benefit your machine learning models
okay so this is not a kind of like this
is not a classic NLP course okay this is
a machine learning course that uses
natural language processing to its
benefit okay um and I could spend a
while talking about that I had a lesson
in my mini course that talks about kind
of the difference between machine
learning with text and natural language
processing but yeah I'll leave it at
that this is a machine learning focused
course okay module 3 is about extracting
text features from mesti data sources
using regular expressions if you've
tried to learn red X regular expressions
and you found it painful or confusing I
promise I teach it in a different way
and I think it's better I'll let you
decide ultimately but um I think regex
is a powerful tool and you'll be glad
you learned it and if you've had pain in
the past learning it um it will be
better this time around
okay module four is about the entire
workflow for solving a text-based data
science problem using scikit-learn and
pandas so I want you to get good at
using scikit-learn and pandas together
and I want you to see and participate in
how you work a data science problem from
start to finish
not just how do we do the machine
learning part but how do we do the
entire workflow okay and then module
five super fun advanced machine learning
techniques
um this is the stuff that a lot of
people on YouTube keep asking me for um
and I it's just in the course I haven't
put it publicly but this is advanced
machine learning techniques to improve
model accuracy and the efficiency of
your workflow okay so most of this it's
hard to understand if you haven't done
it and I don't expect maybe there's a
few of you who have used all of these
techniques but for the most part this is
new material for everyone okay lots of
cool techniques you will learn in
scikit-learn especially okay couple
questions I'll catch up on that pen Kosh
being a working professional I only find
time over the weekend yeah I think that
if I will say two things one is if you
are dedicated and you can really put in
time like and you can really focus on it
for an entire day on the weekend yes
um one downside is you know I want you
if you get stuck to ask a question and
if you get stuck at one point and then
you ask a question and you really can't
get any further without it there's some
benefit kind of splitting up your work
over multiple days so that would be the
downside but ultimately it's up to you
can you focus for that amount of time on
a weekend day um and yeah I mean I
definitely have had students do that
okay it's just there's a downside of
being able to ask questions at the right
time asked asks is the cowbell
competition similar to a data science
project that we can publish on a resume
um it is a data science project but it's
it's like a cattle competition in that
I've defined the problem for you but
I've given you the data so I don't know
if like I think the most valuable
projects for a resume in particular our
projects you've done from start to
finish
and the cowgirl competition is not like
I'm only giving you I'm being the data
set in defining the problem so whether
or not you would put it on your resume
it's hard to say but I tend to think
start-to-finish projects are our best
okay
and Marvin suggested in EDX course on
Python that I've heard is very good so
feeling to check that out
okay boy I I know I'm probably not as
far in this page as I should be but
that's okay I'm answering questions and
we're we're getting to the right stuff
so okay when is the course September 20
through November 22nd is this a beginner
course and actually there's this neat
feature where let me click on start
answering let's see sorry one second
this is just to be of benefit to folks
who will watch this later are there okay
so I just clicked a button that
indicates I'm answering the question
what are the prerequisites for this
course and that will answer a couple
questions folks have asked um so this is
not a beginner course but what does that
mean okay here are the prerequisites you
should be comfortable working in Python
now what is comfortable mean comfortable
means does not mean you're a stirrer it
means you understand the basic data
structures you know like how to use like
functions you know how to run code you
know how to use lists and dictionaries
may be sets may be tuples you know how
to create strings you know how to
interact with the interpreter you're
comfortable with your environment I
don't care if you've I mean I welcome
you to be a Python master but that is
not required for the course
so it's hard for me to say you know how
comfortable do you need to be um it
should not make you nervous to open your
Python environment and start working on
well it's really hard for me to give
like a general answer other than
comfortable with data structures and
writing basic code I'll come back to one
other thing that might help on that
um second prerequisite you should
understand the basic principles of
machine learning and almost everyone
that is here has said in the poll that
they do understand the basic machine
learning principles okay um probably
more challenging you should be
comfortable using scikit-learn okay so
scikit-learn I've got a video series on
that this if you are wondering if the
course is right for you um I would say
uh going through if you if you've never
used I could learn it is possible that
you in fact it's very possible you can
be ready for the course in two weeks now
I've had students that have never used
scikit-learn and sign up for the course
and get ready and are successful in the
course most of them have built machine
learning models in other languages and
they're just picking up like how
scikit-learn thinks now if you've never
built a machine learning model in any
language it's hard for me to say whether
you can be ready in two weeks I will say
I have an excellent for our video series
on machine learning what's I could learn
it will take you from the basics to
intermediate level okay um I highly
recommend going through that and if the
level of code and this may answer your
question Eleanor I think if the level of
code in the scikit-learn video series is
not too challenging for you if you can
get it then you're going to be fine with
the level of Python in the core
okay so that's a tricky one feel free to
email me more about this point and we
can talk through it but you do like the
my this course the master course does
not assumes you know some scikit-learn
okay basic socket line you should have
at least limited experience with pandas
you don't have to be fluent you can
definitely get up to speed on pandas
between now and the course and you don't
need any advanced math skills okay um
let me answer some questions if I'm late
on some homework will I be able to
submit and get feedback after November
22nd um no I'm sorry I can't like I
can't commit myself or my assistant to
you know kind of help for the course
after November 22nd so that is the end
date of the course I will be in slack
every now and then for the students and
I'm happy to answer questions but we
won't be doing homework review after the
course officially ends um let's see will
this be a paid course yes and I'll get
to the cost in a little bit um great
Eleanore asks can you share the second
link video series you just mentioned yes
I will just paste it in I was gonna say
slack but in crowdcast right now um
check that out okay it is already 2:40
sorry 2:40 eastern time so I will try to
browse through let's see let me uh go
back to questions and done it okay um
next up how do I know whether I'm ready
for the course um we we talked a little
bit about that what types of people have
taken this course a lot of different
folks a lot more than I expected
you are most likely if you're wondering
am I going to be out of place in this
course the answers probably no I've had
a lot of
analytics folks and data science folks
take the course business intelligent
folks a data journalist lots of
Engineers directors of engineering folks
who manage data scientists as well as
kind of classic scientists researchers
computational linguists mathematicians
but also plenty of grad students
actually a lot of grad students and then
people who's at least job title doesn't
necessarily indicate data or science
like a creative director project
managers Python instructors I even had
one kaggle master enroll which was
pretty cool yeah why should I learn how
to work with text well I don't have time
to really sell you in-depth but most
knowledge out there is in text form and
if you can learn how to use text in your
machine learning models you are far
better off in terms of how your fluency
with machine learning okay um this slide
I did not make it let me just make sure
you know I don't make beautiful images
like this it's not my it's not my forte
let's see let me kind of continue on
lower as I mentioned previously Python 2
and python 3 both 100% acceptable what
libraries will we be using this was
asked previously we're gonna be focusing
on scikit-learn and some pandas we're
gonna use the re module for regular
expressions we're gonna make limited use
of numpy scipy matplotlib c1 and text
blob um you do not need to know anything
about modules other than scikit-learn
and pandas to enroll in the course okay
so don't worry if you've never even
heard of SCI pie or Seaborn okay we'll
use them a little bit
we will not however be using NLT kay and
that's the subject for a longer
discussion but
basically my philosophy is learn a small
amount of libraries in Python and learn
how to use them really well and if you
are machine learning focused you
probably belong in scikit-learn rather
than ml TK and there's a lot you can do
with text in scikit-learn so I find NLT
k unnecessary for almost all of what I
do
okay so SCI NLT k definitely has its
place for classic natural language
processing but um you know scikit-learn
is where we're going to spend our time
and you'll find you can do a ton in
terms of machine learning with text data
now that brings us back to one of the
poll questions that I wanted to mention
which was what's your experience with
natural language processing and I want
you to know you do not need to know
anything about natural language
processing in terms of enrollment this
course even if you have no understanding
of it totally fine okay it's different
when I'm talking about machine learning
you do need some knowledge there and it
looks like most almost all of you have
some already okay but natural language
processing you do not need to know
anything about NLP in order to enroll in
this course okay let's see the course
material is definitely up-to-date I
challenge you to find other online
courses out there where every time a
library gets instructed sorry every time
a library gets updated the instructor
goes back and make sure all their code
still works
so like scikit-learn point one eight is
gonna come out and there's going to be
some breaking API changes maybe in the
next month or two I think I will go in
update the code so that it still works
or at least provide different options so
you can make sure the code you are
from this course always works I continue
to work on this course adding resources
improving lessons I've still got more
stuff I'm gonna record or create this
time around out okay um okay let's we've
already talked a lot about how this
course is different from other courses
so I'm gonna skip by that um you know a
little bit about me um and you can read
more if you like Alex as I said is
excellent and we are super lucky to have
him in the course it's not just like I
posted an ad like I desperately need a
helper this is someone I know and trust
and in fact you know sometimes in fact
many times he answers questions and I
think man Alex you know more than me and
certain things so we are super lucky to
have him here Pankaj asked any specific
reason not to choose Python and not R
for this course I have a long blog post
called should you teach to Python or are
for data science and I enjoy both and
this course is in Python but you could
create a course like this in our I will
say I don't like working with text in
our personally I find the packages
clunky as well I prefer machine learning
in Python but that is a personal
preference which is why the courses in
Python let's see
Miguel which distribution do you
recommend to follow the course anaconda
yes yes I do recommend anaconda but you
are welcome to use whatever distribution
you like or you can install packages
yourself when you enroll you'll get
instructions for getting set up I'm
interested in that link on our vs Python
I will I will
make a note to paste that are and I'll
paste it in the chat for you Philippe
any ruta well we have access to
materials after the
oh thank you um will we have access to
the resources after the course is
finished the answer is yes and I will
say more about that in a moment okay
we're getting near the bottom and then I
will take all the rest of the questions
let's see 40 to 60 hours to complete the
course five to eight hours per week on
average
um I've designed this course in a way
that you can stay on track with it
more easily I think and here's how we're
gonna do it the course materials will be
released to you one week at a time for
six weeks which should help you to focus
so that'll be materials get released on
Wednesday the webcasts will occur on
Sunday and Tuesday so that you have a
chance to work through some of the
material ask some questions and slack
and then if you like attend to the
webcast get more depth on a particular
topic or assignment okay so that will
hopefully help you to focus on the
material and keep track on because it is
a lot of material and I want you to
succeed in the course I don't want to
just sell you a course I want you to get
a lot out of it and I think this will
help okay um homework feedback will come
in a day or two
slack feedback will come usually in
about a day the course material will be
released over the course of six weeks
and the final two weeks is the cago
competition now if you fall behind
during the course you don't have to do
the caracal competition well it's always
optional but you can spend the last two
weeks hashing up and this addresses some
one question someone's question about
you know what if I don't submit it in
time well I can't accept it after in
terms of giving you feedback but we are
giving you two weeks of buffer to catch
up because this has happened um
frequently before where folks are like
oh I just need a little more time okay
um Pankaj I'll come back to I
I'll have to come back to that let me
just make a note about the Python stack
um let's see what else do I want to say
um okay what if I don't have enough time
to complete the course oh I want to
let's see so one of the questions it was
Joseph's question will we continue to
have access to the course materials
after the course ends and I want to make
very clear yes when you enroll in this
course you will have lifetime access to
everything in the course the only thing
that ends on November 22nd is assistance
from the instructors okay so the videos
the materials the notebooks as I
continue to update notebooks and add
things to the course add new resources
you will continue to get access to it so
it really is lifetime access okay let's
see what else and then I promise I will
jump over to the question the rest of
the questions you will receive the
certificate of completion at the end of
the course I do send out anonymous
post-course surveys at the end of the
course students are asked to rate the
scale the course on a scale from one to
five from poor to excellent you can read
my ratings right there very close to
five on average in terms of content
quality instructional quality and value
provided by the course a hundred percent
of students have said that it helped
them to make progress to their own
personal or professional goals okay so
take that for what it's worth but past
students have been happy Harvey has has
been really nice in just kind of sharing
data school with others and basically
said this course is better than what he
takes at university courses which I
really appreciate
as I mentioned I offer a what I call a
love it or leave it
Teek and i'm happy to give you a full
refund if you are not if you enroll and
you find this is not the course for me
or I just don't like it okay um okay
course options so um I'll just talk
briefly about this and you can ask me
more questions about this if you like
but let me find that what is the
different Benny asks what's the
difference between the master and the
standard course so the difference
between the master and the standard
course they are the same exact content
not a thing is different in terms of the
actual course content and the videos
okay however the standard course does
not include instructor support so what
does that mean the master course
students have access to the live
webcasts twice a week they have a bin
ability to submit their homeworks to us
for feedback master course students can
get help from the instructors in slack
and master course students can compete
in the private cattle competition okay
so those are the four things that
differentiate the master course from the
standard course by all means if those
four things are not of interest to you I
would encourage you to enroll in the
standard course because I mean you know
why why pay more than what you need okay
so this the standard course is great if
you just want to work through it on your
own you know you don't need any help you
don't want to ask questions and you you
know the private caracal competition
doesn't interest you okay Aaron Prasad
asks do we get a recording of the
webcast um that is not a part of the
standard course so the mass the webcasts
are really just it's a little community
we'll have in the master course myself
Alex and fifty students and the web
or just for them both in terms of the
recordings and in terms of participating
live okay
all right let's see what else did I want
to mention um oh well of course you
asked how much does the course cost the
master course is five hundred and ninety
five dollars this standard course is two
hundred and ninety five dollars okay
both include lifetime access to the
course both include a money-back
guarantee I realize that this course is
not affordable for many people and I
understand I totally get that I offer a
lot of free content I'm gonna continue
for years to come to put out more free
content and I want my free content to be
better than what everyone else is
selling um but migranyan content that I
take hundreds of hours to build
well my free content takes hundreds of
hours also but some some content I do
sell and I hope that you'll find it's
the best best content out there in in
this particular topic area um okay
I've said a lot about the structure of
the course but just kind of a quick
recap when you enroll in the course
you'll get immediate immediate within a
day you'll get access to the slack team
and pre course materials so if you are
asking me like what do I need to do to
prepare for the course to be successful
in the course you will get that as soon
as you have enrolled in the course or
within a day okay um starting September
28th every Wednesday a new week of
course materials will be released live
webcasts being an October 2nd every
Sunday and Tuesday homework solutions
will be posted a week after the homework
has been released and the course ends on
November 22nd I've mentioned the timing
of the live web live webcasts Sunday at
8:00 and Tuesday at 1:00
both pm
both Eastern Time figure out if one of
those is a good good fit for you
the cago competition is during the last
two weeks of the course and as I said
you can use those two weeks for your own
purposes just to catch up will the
course sell out I don't know it might I
set a limit because I can't myself and
Alex can't support an unlimited number
of students we want to provide a high
quality student experience for every
person that enrolls and we can't give
our attention like answering questions
and reviewing homework with an unlimited
number of students so I've set it at 50
students it has sold out before twice
before um but I can't tell you whether
it's going to sell out
I just don't know um but it could happen
uh okay I think that's it for what I had
kind of prepared I'm gonna switch back
to my face and then I'm gonna start
answering some of the other questions
and and I in in about two minutes I'm
gonna have three minutes I'm gonna have
to pause I'm gonna like actually pause
the webcast um sorry let me
I've whoops oh okay ah all right
my apologies I need to share my oh here
we go
sorry I'm new to craft test and let's
see how I can there we go sorry about
that okay so um you should be able to
see my face once again and not my screen
um okay so great great so I'm gonna
start answering some of the questions
below the page but in two minutes I'm
gonna stop for about 30 seconds
and turn on course enrollment so if you
already know you want to enroll I would
encourage you to go ahead and enroll
um okay let's see here other questions
top voted question okay will there be a
course in the winter in case we can't do
this one great question it will
definitely not not be this cost in the
winter okay so um you know obviously I
have to kind of plan my life around when
I run these courses and I'm not
available to for substantial projects
this winter I've got other things going
on um that follow-up question is when is
the next course and I would say the
earliest it might be March April May
June next year
um I can't give you any more specifics I
haven't decided I haven't planned it out
I I just can't tell you so if you know
you want to take this course I would
encourage you to roll and try it out and
you've always got lifetime access to the
material if if you run out of time and
that's why I've given you eight weeks
rather than six but it's really up to
you what timing works for you I just
can't tell you today when I'm going to
UM offer the course again okay alright
so I am going to answer the rest of
these questions as well as once people
have posted in chat I am going to like
literally take 30 seconds and I am need
to launch the course using Gumroad I
will pick a link you can use to enroll
and thank you for bearing with me while
I do this that's that and publish okay
you should I'm gonna paste a link
in chat to enrolling in the course if
you're interested in enrolling you
should be able to enroll right now and
let me know if that link doesn't work um
okay
and let me back to answering your
question and I will just so you know I
will stick around here while there
continue to be questions about the
course you're welcome to drop off if
you've got what you need um but yeah
next question okay from Jonah Keegan in
my limited experience the often boring
data cleaning process for unstructured
text is equal in length and complexity
to the sexy and fun classification work
does the course cover the date of
cleaning stuff that's essentially what
he said and I like that you describe
classification modeling and analysis as
sexy yes the answer is yes we're gonna
be building a day stat we're gonna be
extracting features we are going to be
dealing with talking about how we handle
the Unicode errors we're gonna be using
regular expressions to clean clean messy
data sets we're going to be using pandas
to get good at um we're going to learn
how to use pandas to clean data okay so
the answer is yes there's a lot of
modeling of course but I try to provide
a realistic workflow okay um Erik just
said enrolled see you guys on the inside
and Erik welcome to the course glad to
have you so you have the next Python
probably um okay next question from Saul
what NLP problems are best solved via
machine learning versus classical
language analysis approaches great
question so um machine learning and NLP
okay here's how I would summarize it
okay super my supervised machine
learning
is its primary focus is prediction and
predictive accuracy and understanding is
a secondary goal of the methodology I'm
not talking about people I'm talking
about the methodology understanding is a
secondary consideration it's a
side-effect okay
natural language processing in those
classic techniques they are focused on
analysis and understanding first and
prediction second okay
in fact there's lots of NLP that's not
focused on prediction it's just
understanding so it all depends what
your interests are if you are into
machine learning you are probably
interested in prediction and may be
interested in understanding your models
in depth and we will talk about that but
that's not core to the Michigan learning
workflow whereas the NLP classic
procedures focus on analysis and
understanding um if you're someone who
already knows some NLP um this course
provides kind of like an alternative
mindset okay a different way of thinking
about how to solve problems with text
okay all right let me just catch up here
Arun Prasad has enrolled awesome Allen
or enrolled awesome Howard says
enrollment page the only option is
standard class not master um
just use this link right here then I'm
gonna paste in slack whoops it's telling
me I've already sent that message but
I'll say use this link um let me know if
you have any problems once we're done
with the webcast shoot me an email and
I'm happy to troubleshoot any problems
folks are running into with enrolling
okay
I'll answer these and then there were
some other questions I missed in the
chat oh alright what is the demand for
these skills machine living with text in
the job market compared to other
specializations love it great question
so link to about this about the course
it will help you become better at
machine learning and machine learning is
a super useful data science at its core
to the data science workflow most most
people would say I would agree so even
if you're not interested in the text
part it will help you become more
marketable as a data scientist because
you are better at machine learning that
being said being able to work with text
may be a lot more flexible in that a lot
of times I mean you as a data scientist
are generating questions and answering
them and questions don't always come
with data sets here's the data set you
need to use to answer it
rather you need to be able to find data
sets and create data sets and when you
can work with text you can work with a
lot more data so that really helps um
the final thing I would say is that even
if you don't find most job posting
saying I want someone who could do
machine learning with text I think you
will find if you ask people in like an
interview meaning you're interviewing
you would find that they have data that
is in text form that they may not even
have thought about working with but you
as the data science can provide that
expertise ok I hope that I hope that
helps okay Miguel will the techniques
and tools taught in this course also be
useful for machine learning for
languages different than English yes so
there is so there's a couple things one
is I don't I do talk about text and
coatings and about Unicode we teach how
to
I teach how to arm deal with Unicode
Aires okay um and all of those processes
will work with other languages now that
being said if the language does not use
kind of discreet like English words are
separated by spaces right German Spanish
also is that is the case in a language
where the units the tokens are not words
or the tokens are not necessarily dis
discrete and separated by spaces it can
be harder to apply the same approaches
but for most languages yes the
techniques learned in this course can be
applied to other languages okay I may
have fumbled through that let me know
Miguel if I fail to answer your question
I keep seeing the chat and I get
distracted and I'm like no focused on
answering the question you're you're
you're answering okay lots more
questions here all right let's see for
Marvin for normal practice programming
you can use simple problems from daily
life
calculating credits or similar topics
what daily topics could be used for
training in machine learning um I'm not
sure I understand that question I'm
sorry Marvin maybe you could comment and
let me know some more details um if
you're if you're asking like give me
some examples of where I could use this
um let's see if you're on Twitter you
might want to predict how many retweets
a text is a tweet is going to get based
upon the content of apt tweet um
you could build a a summarizer
of your emails actually that'd be a
great project we'll talk about text
summarization in the core
and you could build a little program
that does summarization for you um you
could find I mean then it's kind of
unlimited um anything where you have
training data meaning some sort of
target or response and you have text
that's related to that response that's a
great application of machine linking
with text um I don't know that I was
super helpful my apologies if if that
was not what you were asking please feel
free to comment um okay let's see I
liked how less I'd like to know how
intent analysis done by chat bots like
with a I and API day I works will your
course teach me how intent analysis um
I'm not familiar with that I could
speculate as to what intent analysis
means um if I if you frame it as a
supervised machine learning problem
probably is a classification problem
meaning here's an example you work for a
company and that company receives oh
actually let me just go straight to your
chat box example you build a chat bot
for a company and that company uses it
for customer support and they want to
predict whether a something someone has
typed is about a complaint or is praise
or is a billing question or something
like that you could frame that as a
supervised machine learning
classification problem okay and um that
that you might say that that is intent
analysis I don't know I don't know the
definition of that problem but
determining intent
that's just a possible response to a
machine learning supervised machine
learning that's the response value what
is the category you're just framing it
as a classification problem now the
challenge is going to be how do you
engineer the appropriate features that
will allow you to build a useful model
to do that classification and feature
engineering we will talk about in the
course whether or not the things we do
in the course will produce a successful
intent analysis model
I don't know cuz I don't know what
features you need to do that but I bet
you could build something simple that
would categorize chat messages into a
small number of categories or analyze
sentiment or something like that
hopefully that helps okay how to master
machine learning how to master machine
learning master is a strong word but the
things I would say is my video series
introduction to machine learning with
scikit-learn is a good place to start if
you're a Python user after that quite
frankly I would encourage you to take
this course because there aren't a lot
of good courses on machine learning in
Python with scikit-learn and I and I
would encourage you to do it in
scikit-learn um but mastering machine
learning that's like a lifetime pursuit
there are lots of good books I will
comment on this afterwards but that's
that's my shy answer ah
Fiona asked what I need to be familiar
with Python already yes unless you are
an exterior a quick study and in the
next two weeks
some people can learn any programming
language quickly okay if you are someone
who learns programming languages quickly
and can get up to speed on that in two
weeks and get up to speed on
scikit-learn
then it might be the right course for
you still but in general I would think
it's probably not the right timing for
you
if you don't already have some comfort
with Python how will there be a way for
students of the course to connect with
each other after or during the course
yes during the course you'll have access
to a slack team where you can connect
with one another in fact you'll have it
later today if you enroll and so we will
connect that way you will also be in the
same slack team with alumni of the
course I want people to ideally
collaborate with one another on projects
help each other out and I will be in
there even after November 22nd as I said
I just won't be there to provide you
with necessarily timely help like I'm
not gonna be there every day answering
questions and I'm not there to do
homework review after November 22nd but
I will be continue to be there answering
questions sharing resources sharing jobs
posting other opportunities etc all
right how could you give a couple
example applications one could build
after your course sure you could build
something to do sentiment analysis you
could build a simple text summarization
tool you can build anything in that uses
machine learning with text and in fact
you can anything you want to do with
machine learning you will be better at
it after this course and I think this
help this course will help to structure
your mind in terms of what is a good
machine learning problem for supervised
machine learning um um
here's here's something so there's a
podcast I'm gonna be on in the Python
ecosystem I won't I won't say which one
yet that I'll be on probably later this
year next year and they publish their
transcripts and when they told me that I
was like oh you know what I bet you
could um let's build a model to predict
how many listeners or downloads you're
gonna get from your podcast based on the
text present in your transcripts very
cool I mean maybe that
useful to them but it's a fun
application anything where you want to
use tax in a machine learning model
that's what you will be better at after
this course could you please send the
link to today's lecture as oh sorry
can you please send the link to today's
lecture as I am late no worries you can
actually stay on this page and you will
have you can actually stay on this page
and view the recording like within a
minute or two after it ends okay so you
don't need a different link um you will
have this is the link you're on the
right page okay let me go back to the
chat because a lot of people have asked
questions that I think I skipped over
arm okay all right back to add a sock
will we be able to access the new added
content of the new class in the future -
the answer is yes if I um up as I update
the course I will continue to make
additions to the course in the future
you will have permanent access to that
now I'm probably not gonna build new
lessons I might you never know I've
continued to build like my past students
who enrolled a year ago are still
getting updates okay they got a ton of
updates but um you will have access if I
build a separate class you perhaps
obviously won't have access but any
updates to this course you will we get a
recording of the webcast Aaron Prasad
asks answers yes it will be available on
this page Filipe asked what is the next
session after this one I think you were
asking about session of this course and
as I mentioned I won't know it's
probably no earlier than last six months
from now okay
in terms of the master course where do
we sign up if you Eleanor asks I think
you've already seen the answer to that
so I'll skip it um anti-shock asked can
you talk more about the homework
what kind of data will it be about great
question so um I select data sets and um
like one of the hallmarks is on Yelp
data one of the homeworks is on
McDonald's customer comment data another
is on a data straight from a website
another is on data from Stack Overflow
I'm actually in a couple different ways
so there's all kinds of data sets um the
homeworks I structure is like here's the
problem and here are the eight tasks I
want you to go through and the tasks get
increasingly difficult as you as you go
on okay okay
hopefully that that answer to your
question mark will there be a
certificate yes you will receive a
certificate of completion at the end of
the course it's not dependent on you
proving a fluency if by the way um there
are no grades in this course if I
haven't said already so the certificate
is offered regardless as at the end of
the course you just requested okay um
okay let's see I think that is old Eric
was asking about the upgrade link that
was from folks who enrolled in my
standard course are able to upgrade to
the master course later on and so um he
pasted the upgrade link and that that is
only let me be very clear okay
the upgrade link is only for those in
fact I'm just going to delete it because
you'll have it in your email if you need
it um whoops
hope I didn't delete the wrong link but
well that's like there's a bug here oh
I'm I'm misunderstanding the way they're
deleting system works I think um anyway
the point is the upgrade link which I
have keep failing to delete is for
people who have already paid for the
standard course and are upgrading to the
master course okay
Penn can we have access to the complete
content as soon as we enroll well if the
standard of course the answer is yes
it's kind of work through the course on
your own the master course materials
would be released once a week and that's
just how I've decided to do it and there
are lots of reasons I'm happy to talk
with you offline about that if you like
um let's see uh Howard asks about $100
discount if you're someone who has
access to a discount link for various
reasons like people in my data school
community have access that link is in
your email and that's where you should
go to get that um let's see act
Hakeem asked I have a question are we
gonna cover deep learning this course is
not going to cover deep learning I would
love to but I only teach something that
I'm proficient at and courses have to
end at some point and you keep a
year-long course on deep learning I will
eventually teach a course on deep
learning it's just not this course and
yeah it's just you know the course has
to have its scope and let me say that I
know deep learning has a lot of Appeal
but you have to get good and many people
maybe already but you have to get good
at if you will regular machine learning
first like those are fundamental
principles you cannot ignore and no I'm
not saying you are trying to ignore them
I'm just saying deep learning builds
upon machine learning of expertise
you've already developed and you don't
need deep learning to solve many
problems it's better solved using
simpler faster approaches much of the
time you use deep learning when you need
it okay Miguel just sign
for the course great great to have you
okay um Hakeem asks about the link for
enrollment you'll want to get if you
need a special link you'll need to get
it from your email just check your email
from today if you're not if you're not
able to find it feel free to shoot me a
note and I will get back to you okay all
right
still almost all the folks still with me
so I'll continue answering questions
uma asks this course training for the
job data scientist yes it is in the
sense of machine learning and machine
running with text is a useful data
science skill this is not a a like you
are not a data scientist you will be at
the end kind of course and in fact I
don't think such a course exists um
maybe it does if you're doing a full
time course and you spend a couple
months or longer you could potentially
be depending upon your previous
experience say now I am a data scientist
and I was not before um so this is a
course good for getting better at data
science but it's not kind of the end-all
end-to-end data science course okay this
focuses on machine learning which is a
small part but important part of the
data science workflow because data
science involves data gathering data
cleaning Chi machine learning data
exploration visualization communication
of results and so on okay alright I will
just answer it right here just mention
that yeah I did I'm not gonna be
covering deep learning in the course I'd
mentioned it previously but I just
wanted to tag it here so that people who
watch the recording can see that answer
directly and who max any links to
learning Python and psych it quickly
okay Python
there are I actually scikit-learn yes I
have a video series and I will paste it
in here as a comment to your question
shortly after Python there's lots of
different options I'll paste some
options here quickly is a relative term
but my course will get you up to speed
my video series will get you up to speed
on scikit-learn quickly how long it
takes you to become comfortable with
Python depends on how good you are at
learning programming languages okay I
came will you start answering will you
go a bit deeper and talking about
classifiers there difference in
application or we can be focused on the
natural language processing itself okay
we're gonna be focusing on machine
learning and natural language processing
techniques that will assist in machine
learning so I haven't found stemming to
be super useful in natural sorry in
machine learning and so we won't cover
it in the course
same with limitation feature engineering
is super critical to machine learning
and so we will do a lot of that okay but
it's not a classical NLP course it's a
course about machine learning with text
as the data source okay all right I
think I have answered every question
that has come up um there are still many
of you hanging out I will hang out for
another minute or so just looking for
questions and I'm happy to answer them
um if you're ready to head out or if
there are no more questions I'll just
say go to data schooled I click the
green button that says click here for
detailed course information it's right
below the video go there if you're still
thinking about the course I assume it's
not gonna sell out in the next five
minutes but I have no idea I haven't
looked I hope it hasn't sold out because
it's probably I'm
over them um but I would encourage you
to take a little time look at the course
give some thought to it and then if
you're ready for the course or if it
seems like the right course for you um
go ahead and enroll I'd love to have you
remember there's the money-back
guarantee if you decide it's not right
for you if you have questions my email
address is all over the place on my
website but it's Kevin at data school
dot IO email me anytime I'm I will get
back to you as soon as I can if you have
questions about enrolling I know it's
time-sensitive so I will get back to you
like five minutes from now so feel free
to let me know if you have more
questions or concerns or any problems
enrolling if you have a problem with gum
road etc okay a couple more questions
just got post-it and then I will head
out
Uma may I no please the other courses
that would help to become a data
scientist and the total price if we are
interested in learning all those courses
boy um I don't have a course that I
offer that is a tizzy on data science I
will paste some links to some Python
courses to a Python course I like and
I'll paste the link to my machine
learning course but you're asking like a
really broad question and it's hard to
give there's no one path to becoming a
data scientist and I know that's not a
very satisfying answer but there's no
single path and it depends on where
you're starting with and it depends on
where you want to go a data scientist
does not have to be an expert at every
step in the data science workflow you
just need to understand the entire
workflow and you need to be able to go
deep in a couple key areas machine
learning is often one where people go
deep okay so I'll do my best to provide
some links but I don't have like an
eight is the answer for you I'm sorry
we're closed hours a week on average
five to eight hours per week all in in
terms of consuming the course going to
webcasts working on the homework etc
watching the videos pre coursework
people have said five to eight hours a
week that's just what they've said so
I'm going with it it will vary based
upon the person okay yeah I think I've
I've already answered that one let's see
can you please Pankaj s can you please
include conceptual working detail of
implementing machine learning algorithms
in your hundred-plus carefully selected
resources list um I do have many of
those links in there you'll see once
you're in the course um if you don't see
what you're looking for you can always
let me know and I will do my best to
provide you with links that I haven't
already provided okay oh and I think I
have already answered that okay that
looks like it thank you so much for all
of you who join me regardless of whether
you are planning on enrolling in the
course for those of you who have
enrolled welcome you will get an email
from me later today about it for those
of you who haven't I'd encourage you to
subscribe to the data school newsletter
and keep in touch with data school shoot
me an email any time let me know your
questions and I'm happy to help and I'd
love to engage with you for for years to
come final thing is crowdcast has this
little follow feature so if you want to
here every time I have a crowd cast
event because you like this format go
ahead and find my name in the chat and I
think you can click on it and then
you'll go to another paging you can
click follow so if that interests you
feel free to do that I think that's it
again thank you so much for joining me
and I'm going to stop the broadcast
right now thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
