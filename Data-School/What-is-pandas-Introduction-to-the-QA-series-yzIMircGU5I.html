video series about the pandas library in
Python my name is kevin markham and i'm
the founder of data school so here are
the four things i'm going to cover in
this video thing number one who is this
video series for number two what is
pandas number three how can you get
pandas and number four what should you
expect from this video series so number
one who is this video series for this
series is for python users who want to
work with data and use a powerful and
efficient tool for doing so
okay so you don't have to be an expert
python user to get a lot out of this
series but you do have to know some
Python and because I'm not going to be
teaching you I'm not going to be
focusing on Python itself during this
series now you can be brand new to
pandas okay or you can have some
experience with pandas and you just want
to get better
either way this series is for you
alright number two what is pandas well
in a sentence it's an open source
library in Python for data analysis data
manipulation and data visualization so
all of those things were certainly
possible in Python before pandas existed
however I'd say that um it's no surprise
that after pandas came out a lot more
data people get excited about working
with data in python that's because
pandas just makes it easier ah to work
with data and I'll tell you a few things
I like about pandas it's got a ton of
functionality it's well supported
by the community lots of people know
pandas and want to share that knowledge
it's under active development it's got a
lot of documentation um and it plays
well with other packages so for instance
it's built on top of numpy for numerical
Python numerical computing and it also
works well with scikit-learn for machine
learning so I use pandas
I teach pandas and I think it's a
worthwhile tool to learn if you work
with data in Python okay so number three
how do you get pandas well if you just
do a Google search for pandas
installation you'll be taken to this
page and this page shows you lots of
different options but it's going to say
that the easiest way to get pandas is by
downloading the Anaconda distribution of
Python which includes pandas and a lot
of other tools including all of the
pandas dependencies so that's what I
recommend ah annek the Anaconda
distribution is what I use so it's an
easy way to get up and running but you
can install pandas however you like
alright and finally number four what
should you expect from this video series
so first every video is going to start
with a question and I'm going to try to
answer that question all right so I'm
going to be writing code live um writing
it on screen and explaining what I'm
doing and why I'm doing it and giving
you different options to accomplish the
same objective every video we'll use a
real data set so that and it's going to
be hosted online that way
you can get the experience with working
with actual data in pandas without
having to do with
having to make up data or to download
stuff you're actually just going to be
able to access the data set by URL and
follow along exactly with everything I'm
doing on screen okay every video will
also end with a bonus tip related to
what we just went over all the code I'm
writing will be in the ipython notebook
also known as the Jupiter notebook
however you don't need to use the
ipython notebook you can use whatever
Python environment you are comfortable
with however if you want to use the
ipython notebook it does come with the
Anaconda distribution and I've got a
video that I'll link to below that
explains how to have the basics of using
the ipython notebook so that you're not
completely lost at first all right my
plan is to release a new video every
Tuesday and Thursday videos will be
about 5 to 10 minutes and I'm going to
start with questions that my real past
students have asked me about pandas but
then I'm going to move on to making
videos that the community is asking me
that you're asking me in the YouTube
comments so let's get that started right
now if you have a question about pandas
right now just go ahead and put it in
the comments below and if you already
know some pandas go ahead and share your
favorite resource in the comments that
helped you to learn pandas and just help
out your fellow students by sharing
those resources with each other ok so
that's all for now I appreciate you

if you want to keep up with this series
and then I will see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
