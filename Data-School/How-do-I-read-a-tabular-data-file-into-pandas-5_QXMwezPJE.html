on the pandas library in Python so the
question for today is how do I read a
tabular data file into pandas great
question so what is tabular data quick
reminder tabular data is just data that
looks like a table meaning data with
rows and columns looks like an Excel
spreadsheet that's all a tabular data
file is common formats like CSV comma
separated value that's tabular data okay
so if we're going to read it into pandas
we first need to import pandas and the
conventional import is import pandas as
PD and then we're going to use a example
data set that I've picked out and that
data set is a data set of Chipotle
orders the Chipotle restaurant chain
online orders okay and we're going to
use to read it in we're going to use the
read underscore table function so PD dot
read underscore table and then for me
what I could do is to say data slash
Chipotle dot TSV now Chipotle dot TSV is
the name of the file and it's in the
data subdirectory relative to my working
directory so read underscore table the
first argument is the name of the file
or its path and I can use a relative
path here now this would work for me but
it's not going to work for you and so um
I'm going to give you something that
will work for you so I want you to type
this along with me HTTP colon slash
slash bitly slash ships okay so read
underscore table can read directly from
a URL and at this URL I have put the
data file okay and we can even take a
look at it so I am just going to put I'm
going to run
that URL in my browser and what will
come up is the underlying data file okay
so when we run this we get back a
perfectly formatted data file looks
great so we've got the the index on the
side we've got some column headers up
top and we've got the the body if you
will the the data itself kind of in the
middle okay so this turned out perfectly
now why did it turn out perfectly well
because this file the underlying data
file happen to be formatted perfectly
that it would ah
works with the read underscore table
default parameters meaning by default
read underscore table assumes that your
file is tab separated and this data file
Chipotle TSV is tab separated okay
another thing is that it assumes that
the first row is a header row and this
um this file does have a header row on
just which is this right here as you can
see in the final okay so this file it
was we got lucky this one worked
perfectly and we'll you know it's it's
how we like it so we're going to save it
as it has a data frame object called
orders and then you can always look at
the first five rows just to remind
yourself of that without overflowing the
screen okay alright so that was an easy
case let's take a harder case alright so
this time we're going to say PD dot read
underscore table and we're going to pass
it the URL another bitly link bit dot
Lee slash movie users okay bit dot least
slash movie users these are users of a
website that rated movies its
demographic information so we'll run
this and this time around you can tell
something is clearly wrong because it
did not it put everything in one
column and you don't even have to open
up the file to notice that there are
these pipe characters that are
separating the fields and that's the
problem so we need to communicate to
pandas that there is this pipe separator
now how do I tell that to read table
well what you want to do is google
pandas read underscore table and you
will be taken to this page which is the
documentation and you will find things
like the second argument here is called
SEP and it's the delimiter to use and
the default as I mentioned is the tab
character so we need to instead tell
pandas our separator is the pipe
character okay so when we run that you
see this looks a lot better than before
because now each of the fields are in
their own column now that's not the only
problem there's also this problem that
the first row is being being interpreted
as the header row and it's not the
header row okay so that's just a row of
data so we need to tell pandas that
there is no header header equals none
and that's great so it's now replaced it
with default values which are just
integers but at least now the data is in
the data section of the data frame if
you will okay
so there's one more thing here we we
probably actually want to have column
names so we can define them alright so
I'm going to create a Python list called
user calls and it's going to be a list
and it's a list of strings and I happen
to know what each of these columns
represents so I'll just type these in
here the first column is user ID the
next is age
the third is gender the fourth is
occupation and the fifth is zip code
okay so I'm just creating a Python list
of strings
Wellum names and then I'm going to pass
that to read underscore table so I'm
going to say names equals user calls so
I'm passing that list as the value of
the argument names so that pandas knows
to use those strings as the column names
so we'll run that and now it looks
perfect
and this is ready for us to work with we
can save it as an object like before so
this is now a data frame object and then
anytime we want to look at it we can
just print it out or look at the first
five rows or whatnot okay so that is how
you work through are using read
underscore table if you have tabular
data just try reading it see what
happens if it doesn't look right just
iterate through that process until you
get it right look at the read table
documentation and you'll be able to
figure out which arguments you need to
tweak in order to get it to work okay so
I'm always going to end these videos
with a bonus tip the bonus tip for today
is on a just a read table argument that
I think is super useful actually two
arguments one is skip rows and the other
is skip footer so what do we use these
for well let's pretend you have a data
file and someone has inserted some text
or some notes at the top or the bottom
of the file and it's not really data
it's just notes about the file but they
put it in the file itself you can use
this to Towel pandas please skip those
certain rows or at the top or at the
bottom so that it can just focus on the
actual data part of the file okay all
right thanks so much for joining me
please click Subscribe if you want to
see more videos like this and please let
me know your pandas
question in the comments section below
and I will probably answer it I might
even make a video about it okay
thanks so much and I look forward to
seeing you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
