series about the pandas library in
Python and the question for today is how
do I use string methods in pandas
alright so in Python we're used to
having access to lots of string methods
for example if I have the string hello
and I want to make it uppercase I just
use the string method upper okay so ah
there you actually have access to a lot
of string methods in pandas you just
have to know how to find them so let's
pull up an example dataset so first we
import pandas as PD and our data set for
today is online orders from the Chipotle
restaurant chain so I'm going to say
orders equals PD read table and pass the
URL bit dot Lee slash ship orders okay
and here are the first five rows of the
data frame and so let's pretend we want
to make the item name uppercase okay
so um you might think oh this would be a
series method and I would just say
something like orders dot item name dot
upper and you've almost got it right but
that's not going to work if you want to
use a string method on a pandas series
you actually use you say dot STR dot
upper so that's saying it's a string
method and when we do that you can see
that we've gotten back the uppercase
versions of each of the item names and
if you like you could overwrite the
original item name series with these
values okay so let's look at another
method as an example so another string
method is contains so this is how I
check for the
presence of a substring so I could say
STR doc contains and I'm going to look
for chicken okay and when I run that I
get back a series of boolean's a series
of trues and falses indicating whether a
particular item in this series contained
chicken so we see false false false
false true and that's because this has
chicken in it and you might ask well why
would we use that well we might want to
filter the data frame like this and only
look at rows in the data frame that have
chicken in the item name okay so there
are tons of string methods you have
access to what you'll want to look at is
the pandas API reference so I'll link to
this in the description below but you
can just google pandas API reference and
you'll get to this page and once you get
here you'll want to search for string
handling okay and find this section and
then you'll want to you'll be able to
see all the different string methods you
have access to okay all right as always
I'm going to end with the bonus and in
fact I have two bonuses for today and
the first bonus is just to show you that
you can chain together our string
methods okay so let's say that I want to
remove the bracket characters from these
strings in choice description okay so if
I said orders dot choice description dot
STR dot replace and then the way replace
works I say I want to replace a left
bracket with nothing okay if I run that
it indeed removes the left bracket okay
from all every element in the series
what
if I also want to remove the right
bracket well I can actually just change
the chain this with another replace
method so remember this returns a panda
series and as such I can run another
series method on it
so I just say dot STR dot replace and
this time I want to replace the right
bracket with nothing and there you go
okay so that's the first bonus the
second bonus is just to tell you that um
many pandas string methods actually will
accept regular expressions okay so if
you don't know regular expressions this
won't make much sense but um I'm going
to write that previous line of code it's
more simply with a regular expression so
I want to say I'm just going to define a
character class you know so using
brackets that defines my character class
and then I'm saying I want to replace
either a left bracket or a right bracket
with nothing so actually looks a little
funny but I put brackets in there I have
to escape both of them but when I run
that um it indeed does work in replacing
the left and right brackets
okay so that was using regular
expressions all right well that is it
