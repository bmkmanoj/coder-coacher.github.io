repository to your local computer. The process
I'll show you will work for a repo you created
yourself or a repo you forked from someone
else. For this demo, I'm going to use the
&quot;test-repo&quot; that we created in the last video.
Let's open up Git Bash. This shows my working
directory. I'm going to change my working
directory to the Desktop.
Now we're ready to go. Note that all git commands
start with the word &quot;git&quot;, and then the name
of the command, and then usually one or more
arguments. In this case, we're going to use
the &quot;git clone&quot; command to clone a GitHub
repo.
You simply type &quot;git clone&quot; and then the URL
of the repo. How do you get that URL? I recommend
that you go to the repo, scroll down here,
and click the &quot;Copy&quot; button. Now go back to
Git Bash, and at least in Windows, you can
hit the &quot;Insert&quot; button on your keyboard to
paste it. (The usual paste keyboard shortcut
doesn't seem to work in Git Bash.) If all
else fails, just paste the URL somewhere else
and retype it.
If you're following along at home, you should
hit &quot;Enter&quot; at this point. I'm actually going
to change my URL because I use SSH instead
of HTTPS to communicate with GitHub.
I now hit Enter, and it asks me for my password.
When typing, it won't show you anything. Hit
Enter when you're done, and if you typed the
wrong password, just try again.
The cloning operation is now complete. It
has copied the repo into a subdirectory of
my working directory, and that subdirectory
has the same name as the repo. So, I can just
&quot;cd&quot; into &quot;test-repo&quot; and &quot;ls&quot; to see the
list of files.
Notice that it now says &quot;master&quot;. That indicates
that I'm now in a folder that is being tracked
by Git, and I'm currently working on the &quot;master&quot;
branch. I don't need to run the &quot;git init&quot;
command, because git has already been initialized
in the folder. On Windows, if you're set up
to show hidden files, you can also see this
&quot;.git&quot; folder where all of the Git information
is stored.
Next, let's check on your &quot;remotes&quot;. Remotes
are simply references to repos that are not
on your computer. To see your remotes, type
&quot;git remote -v&quot;. You'll see a remote called
&quot;origin&quot;, which links to your repo. This reference
was automatically created during the cloning
process.
If you don't have an origin remote, you can
add one by typing &quot;git remote add origin&quot;
and then the URL of your repo. The same one from here.
We've now cloned the repo and set up a remote.
In the next video, we'll actually make some
changes locally, commit them, and then push
them up to GitHub.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
