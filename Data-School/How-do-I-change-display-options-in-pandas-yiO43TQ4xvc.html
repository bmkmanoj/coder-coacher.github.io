series about the pandas library in
Python and the question for today comes
from a YouTube viewer who asks is there
a simple way to format large numbers
with commas when printing or graphing on
the axes okay great question I will
answer that but first I'm gonna answer
the more general question which is how
do we change display options in a pandas
okay so as always need an example
dataset and so we're gonna import pandas
as PD and the data set for today will be
alcohol consumption by country so drinks
equals PD read CSV and it's a URL Vili
slash drinks by country okay and instead
of checking out the head let's drop just
try printing it out okay so we'll just
type drinks and hit enter okay
and what you'll see is that it prints
out the first 30 rows then this ellipsis
dot dot dot and then the last 30 rows
okay and it's doing this because it you
know it doesn't want to over on your
display but you'll notice there are only
a hundred and ninety three rows okay so
what if I want to change this and I want
to show all of the rows how do we do
that well it turns out that pandas has
display options and I will show you how
to modify those okay so first you need
to find the relevant option you want to
change and one easy way to look at the
options is to go to the documentation
for pandas dot get option okay so you
can Google for this or there is a link
to this page in the description of this
video below okay so what you want to do
is go to get option
and then scroll down and you will see a
list of all the available options and
their descriptions and we are gonna find
display dot max rose okay and it tells
you it's an int and it's as if max Rose
is exceeded switch to truncate view okay
and none value means unlimited okay so
this is the option we want to change
display dot max Rose okay so what I like
to first do before I change an option is
look at its current value okay so we're
gonna use the top level function PT get
option and then all you do is pass it
the name of the option so display dot
max Rose and we see that it is 60 which
is why it printed out by default 30 Rose
at the top and 30 rows at the bottom so
to change that it's just easiest to edit
this we're going to change it to set
option PD dot set option we pass it the
name of the option and the new value so
I could just say 200 and yes that would
accomplish it but um I think what I'll
do instead is to say none which means to
show all rows okay
and you want to be careful with this
because if you have a million rows this
is not going to work very well but we
know that we only have under 93 so this
will work just fine okay
so we'll go ahead and print out drinks
and now you will see that I can see
every single row scroll all the way down
to the bottom and now I can kind of
browse the data okay alright now let's
say I finish browsing the data and I no
longer want to keep this option how do I
change it well you actually just reset
again I will just edit this because it's
easiest so all I will say is reset
option and I pass it the name and then
you can confirm by rerunning this and
you'll see that it's back to the swing
the first 30 rows and the last 30 rows
okay
so again all I did was PD reset option
passed it the option to reset okay I
will note there's another option if you
have a lot of columns let's say you
might have guessed this already but
there's an option called display dot max
columns and the default that for that is
20 okay or at least it is on my system
and you know if you have 25 columns and
you want to look at them all then just
change it to the appropriate number or
just change it to none okay so I want to
show you two more options then I will
get back to Mark's question okay so for
my next example I am going to use a
different data set and it is the
training data set from Carol's Titanic
competition and so what I'll do is train
equals PD read CSV and as always it's
Vitaly and then this time it's Kegel
train and I'll just go ahead and say
trained on head okay so this is our data
set and the important thing I want to
highlight the first thing is this
ellipsis here the dot dot dot why is it
here well this is a column that contains
strings and there is some sort of
maximum it is set about how many
characters it will display why well
again it just doesn't want to overrun
your screen if this is 10,000 characters
but sometimes you know well it's
actually not that many characters and I
just want to see
the data I don't want you to hide it
from me okay so how do we change that
we're gonna say PD get option and this
is display dot max call width and that
is what's controlling this it's saying
only show the first 50 characters okay
so let's change that and see if it works
and we'll change it to set option and
you can't use none in this case so we're
just gonna set a large option we'll just
say a thousand okay and then I'll break
this into two cells and I'll just
display the head again and now you can
see there's no more dot dot dot in this
cell
okay it's gonna show all the text
actually in all the columns okay up to a
thousand characters all right um I also
want to point out this fare column this
is fair like dollars I think and or
maybe a different currency and you know
you might have noticed there's like four
decimal points and you might think I
don't really want to see four decimal
points I want to see maybe two decimal
points so let's change that will say PD
get option and this one is display dot
precision okay and it's six which means
six digits after the decimal point now
if we change that to two with the set
option function okay now when we do
train got head it will only display two
decimal points after okay now let me be
clear that did not affect the underlying
data that only affected what is
displayed okay all right let me finally
get back to Mark's question which is how
do we format large numbers so that they
have commas when you're printing or
graph
well I'm gonna use the drinks dataframe
so well let's show that one again
drinks head and we don't have any really
large numbers in here so I'm gonna add
some columns that are really large okay
so I'm gonna say drinks bracket X so I'm
just creating a new column called X and
I'm just gonna say drinks dot wine
servings times a thousand okay now I'm
just broadcasting this operation of
multiplication times an entire series
the wine servings now I'm X is not like
a meaningful column I just need
something with large numbers and I'm
gonna add one more I'm gonna say drinks
bracket y equals drinks total total
times one thousand okay
and now let's say drinks that head okay
and you can see the two new columns X&amp;amp;Y
it's just this column in this column
times a thousand and Mark is asking how
do we get like a comma so that's like
fifty four thousand and four thousand
nine hundred okay how do we get some
commas in there
okay so the option we're gonna use is PD
dot set option and we're gonna use
display dot float format okay and here's
the thing we're gonna pass it which may
look confusing if you haven't seen these
before in braces I'm gonna put colon
comma and then after the string I'm
gonna put dot format okay so what I've
done is I've passed a Python format
string and that format string actually
means use commas as the thousands
separator okay now this is not something
that pandas invented this is something
we're using that exists
Python generally which is format strings
okay so when we do drinks that head you
will notice we've got forty nine hundred
and you've got the comma you've got
twelve thousand four hundred etc but it
affected why and not X so the question
is why did that happen and you might
have already figured this out by the
name of the option which is float format
because drinks dot d-types tells us that
X was an int and Y is a float so there
is no int format option there's a float
format and it only affects floating
point columns okay so there isn't
actually an easy way I know of to get it
to effect integers as well but it does
it is pretty simple for floating point
numbers okay the second part of Mark's
question was how do we get this to
effect plotting and the axes
unfortunately there's no option for that
for that you will actually have to learn
some matplotlib and there should be a
way to get it to do that with matplotlib
matplotlib is the plotting library that
controls the plots that pandas produces
okay alright as always we're gonna end
with a bonus and in fact I've got two
bonuses for you today the first bonus is
let's say you're not connected to the
Internet or you just don't want to do
yet another Google search to the pandas
documentation but you want to read up on
the pandas options how can you do that
and I'm going to show you a cool
function called PD describe option you
run that and it will display every
option the name of it the type the
default value and the current value on
your system okay you can scroll through
it and you can see every last option
pretty cool and another trick
with this one is um you can if you know
a particular option you're trying to
search or maybe you remember part of the
name like you search for rose it will
search and only show you the options
with rose in the name
okay it's not searching this this text
it's just searching the names of the
options okay alright second bonus is
let's say you've changed a bunch of
options and you want to reset them
without like restarting your kernel or
restarting your IDE there's another
trick for that which is PD dot reset
option and you're thinking like what do
I have to do it one by one no there is a
special keyword all you just pass it as
a string and it will reset all of your
options to the defaults now you will get
a warning and that's because some of the
options being reset have already been
deprecated but you can safely ignore any
warnings here okay so that's it for
