series about the pandas library in
Python and the question for today is how
do I handle missing values in pandas
okay so let's get an example data set so
we can figure out what to do will import
pandas as PD as always and then our
example data set for today is a data set
of UFO reported sightings
so UFO equals PD I read CSV and then vit
dot Lee slash UFO reports okay
so we'll read in that data into a data
frame and this time let's take a look at
the tale the last five rows okay so we
see this value n a n and what does that
mean is that a string like it's a color
or what is that it actually stands for
not a number n a n but what it means
conceptually is a missing value now what
does that mean well it means that when
building the data frame read CSV
detected what it thought was a missing
value and it flagged it with this
special n a n and you'll see why in a
bit now let's take a look at the source
file for a second this is on github and
here are the last five rows and for
instance in this very last row we've got
Ybor comma comma Oval and this is a CSV
file so normally you'd have something
between there but it's missing and if we
compare that to the data frame we see
Ybor na n meaning missing and then oval
okay so why is it missing I don't know
I'd probably guess that there was a web
form where people submit these UFO
reports and Colour where
some of the fields are optional and some
are required okay so let's take a look
at some methods for working with missing
values
the first method I want to show you is
called is null and it's a data frame
method so we'll say you fo dot is null
dot tail okay and the way is null works
is it shows a false if something's not
null if it's something's not missing and
it shows true if it is missing so you'll
see City for these last five rows it's
not missing at all
so it's false false false false false
four colors reported it's mote it's true
true true false true because these ones
are missing now it's only because pandas
uses this special value na n that is
null can detect them and produce trues
and falses as a result now there's
actually a inverse method called not
null so UFO dot not null dot tail and
you'll see that we just get the exact
opposite now why are these methods
useful is null a not null
let me show you some examples so one is
a really cool pandas trick which is to
say UFO dot is null dot sum and what
that tells us is the number of missing
values in each of the columns now how
did that work I'm going to break it down
for you because there's a couple things
you have to understand so um let's
create a pretend pandas series so PD
series and I'll pass it a list of
boolean's
so I'll say true false true okay so
that's all I've just created this series
of three boolean x' okay and if I do dot
some you're thinking how do you some
boolean x' well it turns out that when
you do that if you ask pandas to do a
mathematical operation with boolean x'
it will convert throughs to one and
falses to zero so it shows you the
number of throughs okay so that is
hinting you towards why this worked
because I'm summing boolean x'
but you can tell that I'm summing them
at the column level and why is that well
if you think back to a previous video
about the axis parameter um some is
doing axis equals zero by default and if
you remember how the axis works for a
mathematical operation axis zero is
saying I want you to do the operation in
the direction of the zero axis throw
axes so I want you to do a sum across
the rows which means down the columns
okay so in summary when we say you fo
dot is null dot some UFO dot is null is
creating this data frame of trues and
falses and then the sum is doing column
sums of the trues and falses converting
the ones to the truce to one and the
falses to zero okay so that's why that
worked um this is something I do on
basically every data frame for every
data set I read in because I want to
know where the missing values are okay
now I want to show you another way to
use this some is null method and is null
it turns out is also a series method
so I can say like UFO dot city dot is
null okay
now I'm actually going to pass that
series of boolean's to this using this
bracket notation we've seen many times
I'm passing in a condition that will be
used to filter the data frame and when I
do that we know that there are only 25
missing values in all of this in all of
this city series we can see the 25 rows
where city is missing okay so that's how
we examine a subset of the data frame by
only looking at a portion of the data
frame okay all right so that's some
basic functionality but I haven't
answered the question
what should you do about missing values
and there's not one right or wrong
answer to that I can't tell you what to
do I can just give you some options and
pandas for how to do it and you can
decide okay so it really depends upon
the data set and the analysis you're
doing or problem you're trying to solve
so one common thing to do is to drop
missing values okay so let's see some
options there I'm going to say UFO duck
shape just to see what is the shape of
this data frame eighteen thousand two
hundred and forty-one rows five columns
now there's a data frame method called
drop na and if I say UFO drop na how
equals any dot shape now this is the
default so you don't have to put it but
I want to emphasize it drop na how
equals any that means I want you to drop
a row if any of its values are missing
okay so if I do that we lose almost all
of the rows except for about
2,500 rows okay so this is all that it's
left that all that's left
if we drop it rows in which any of the
five columns have a missing value okay
now I want to mention for a second that
there is an in-place parameter here it
for drop na and that is false by default
which is y if I fight a UFO - ape right
now it hasn't changed from the original
this is just because it's in place
equals false it just temporarily drops
it and then they come right back okay
all right now let's see how we might
modify drop na okay so now let's try UFO
drop na how equals all shape and that
says only drop a row if all of its
values are missing and we knew that
wasn't going to drop any rows because up
here we saw that state and time don't
have any missing values so how equals
all is not going to make any changes um
in this case okay so one more option for
drop na is called subset so UFO drop n a
subset equals and I'm going to pass it a
list of columns to consider so I'm going
to say city and shape reported and I'm
going to say how equals any okay
so this is saying I want to drop a row
if either city or shape reported are
missing if any of those two are missing
for a given row I want you to drop it I
want you to drop the row
okay and we're left with about 15,000
rows okay now you can change this again
you can change this to how equals all
and that means only drop a row if all of
these columns have a missing value for
that row and this time only four rows
gets dropped because there were only
four rows where both city is missing and
shape reported is missing okay
all right as always we're going to end
with a bonus and we're going to talk
about filling missing values and so
let's take a look at our old good old
friend value counts so UFO bracket shape
reported dot value counts and value
counts is saying how many times did this
value occur in in the shape reported
series so the most common was light
we've got disk triangle circle cigar
rectangle egg lots of fun values in here
okay
so you might be thinking wait a minute
that doesn't add up to eighteen thousand
and you're right because by default
missing values are excluded okay so we
if we say drop na equals false we can
see that shape reported has those twenty
six hundred and forty four missing
values okay and we saw that up here
those twenty six hundred and forty four
missing values okay so what if I wanted
to fill those in maybe I thought and and
what to do here depends a lot upon an
understanding of your data but you might
think well maybe I should fill in the NA
ends with various that kind of makes
sense for for it being missing so to do
that I'm going to use another method
called fill na so I'm going to say UFO
shape reported dot fill na value equals
various okay and I'm going to say in
place equals true which means make the
change in place Chi in in the UFO data
frame and I'll run that and if I rerun
the value counts you'll see that various
now has the 333 that we're already there
and then all of the missing values were
converted to various okay so that's it
