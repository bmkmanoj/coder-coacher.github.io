on the pandas library in Python and the
question for today is how do I sort a
panda's data frame or series all right
so just a quick reminder on terminology
a panda's data frame is just kind of
like a table of data it has rows and it
has columns and a pandas series is a
single column from a data frame now you
can't have a series that's not part of a
data frame but we're not going to handle
that here so as always we need a data
set to work with so we'll import pandas
as PD and then we are going to read in a
data set of movies scraped from the IMDB
website so this is data about movies
movies equals PD read CSV and then we'll
pass it a URL and it's bit dot Lee slash
IMDB ratings okay so just a reminder if
you haven't seen it before what this
data set looks like it is movie ratings
from the IMDB website okay so let's talk
about sorting first I'm going to show
you the new way and then I'll show you
the old way what do I mean well in
version 0.17 the way you sort changed so
I'm using version 0.1 7 if you're using
it or you're using a later version you
will see exactly what I'm seeing when
you do this and this will all work if
you're using an earlier version the
first part of this video is not going to
work the second part will okay so just
hang on if that's the case for you
so you'll find out shortly ok so first
thing we're going to do is to sort a
series so how
do I do that well um remember this is
the new way to do things
so you if I want to grab the title
series for example I can say movies dot
title and then I say dot sort values
okay so what I've done here is I've
grabbed the title series using dot
notation and then sorted it so it's
sorted first in alphabetical order but
numbers come first and you'll see the
A's and all the way through these Z's
here and it is sorted okay so a bunch of
notes about this first of all you can if
you don't like dot notation you can use
the bracket notation instead so this is
how I grab the title series and then
sort the values in that series that is
identical to what we saw before this
does return a panda's series let's just
check that so if you check the type it's
series so what this is telling us is
sort values is a series method ok now it
returns in ascending order by default
but you can change that to descending
order by saying ascending equal false
okay so now you get the Z all the way
through the a at the bottom the final
thing I want to say about sort values
for a series is that it is not changing
the underlying data like if we just
change this back to movies titled
bracket title you'll just see the
original order ok the original order we
saw here of the title series it has not
changed it you can tell it to do it
quote in place but we didn't do that so
it did not affect the underlying data
okay alright so that is sorting a series
now let's sort
a dataframe by a series okay
still the new way movies the dataframe
dot sort values and then you just pass
it the name of the column you want to
sort by
so we'll do title okay so this is
different than before we see the titles
are in the same exact order as we saw
when we just sorted the series but now
we're seeing that we can still see the
entire data frame
alright so that's the big difference um
if you wanted to just see the series in
sorted order just sort the series but if
you want to keep the rest of the data
about each of the movies with it you
sort the data frame by um by some
particular column and we could do the
same thing sort by duration for example
okay so now it's in the data frame is in
sorted order okay alright couple notes
and then I'll show you the old way to do
things um like before movies dot sort
values returns a data frame it's a data
frame method that returns a data frame
just like sort values when working with
a series you can say ascending equals
false and that will work and now we can
see the longest movies in the data set
and just like before this did not affect
the underlying data if I say movies dot
head you can see that nothing changed in
terms of the overall order it's just
shawshank redemption' than Godfather etc
okay so that's the new way I'm going to
briefly show you the old way for people
who are using versions earlier than 0.17
and then I'll show you the bonus tip so
before 0.17 this is how you sort it a
series you say movies title dot order
and it works exactly like we just saw
except it gives you
a future warning order is deprecated
meaning in a future version it's not
even going to work okay so that's how
you sort a series the old way and to
sort of data frame the old way you just
say data frame name dot sort not sort
values dot sort and then you pass it
title for example and again you see the
same thing as before except you get a
future warning okay all right so let's
move on to the bonus tip and this will
come back and this will work in the new
version of pandas or 0.17 and beyond
let's say you want to sort a data frame
by multiple columns so what do I mean
movies dot sort values and rather than
just sorting by one column we're going
to sort by two columns so let's try
content raiding and then sort by
duration so what you'll see is the data
frame is first sorted by content rating
so there used to be one called approved
maybe there still is
and within each content rating so among
ties if you will within each content
rating it's then sorted by duration okay
so you can sort by as many columns as
you want just keep in mind it will first
sort by this and second sort by this
you're passing a list of strings instead
of a single string okay
that is it for today thanks so much for

rest of the data school community might
see it and help you out as well maybe
I'll make a video about it and we can
all help each other out okay so thanks

we'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
