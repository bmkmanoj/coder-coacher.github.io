repository, so that you can understand the
GitHub interface.
Right now, we're looking at the repository
for the &quot;ggplot2&quot; package, which is an R package
that you'll be using later in the Data Science
Specialization.
It was created by Hadley Wickham, who is probably
the most well-known creator of R packages.
Anyway, here are the files being tracked.
You can see that it uses a folder structure
just like Mac and Windows.
You can click on any folder, and see the folder
contents.
You can also click on any file, and see the
contents of that file.
If it's a code file, GitHub will render it
with bold and color and italics so that it's
easier to read.
You can click &quot;Raw&quot; to see the plain text
file as it was uploaded, or you can click
&quot;History&quot; to see the history of changes to
that file.
Let's go back to the main screen for the repository.
There is often a special file in the root
directory of the repo called &quot;README.md.&quot;
It's special because that file is automatically
rendered on the main page of the repo, which
you can see right here.
The convention on GitHub is to always include
information about the repo in this file.
If you click on it, you'll see the exact same
rendered file.
Again, you can click &quot;Raw&quot; to see the plain
text file.
The &quot;.md&quot; extension means that it's a Markdown
file, which you will learn about later in
the Specialization.
You can compare the raw and rendered files
to see how Markdown works.
For example, using the pound (#) symbol creates
a header, and using asterisks (*) creates
bullets.
In the next video, we'll walk through the
rest of the GitHub interface.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
