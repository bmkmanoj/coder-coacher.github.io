machine learning with scikit-learn in
the previous video we covered the pros
and cons of scikit-learn showed how to
install scikit-learn walk through the
ipython notebook interface and then
talked about a few resources for
learning Python if you don't yet know
the language in this video I'll be
covering the following what is the
famous iris data set and how does it
relate to machine learning how do we
load the iris dataset into scikit-learn
how do we describe a data set using
machine learning terminology and what
are psyche it learns four key
requirements for working with data let's
start by talking about the famous iris
data set this is a picture of an iris
which is a type of flower in 1936
Edgar Andersen collected 50 samples each
of three different species of iris or
150 samples total for each sample he
measured the sepal length and width and
petal length and width and recorded
those measurements along with its
species this is what the data looks like
in comma separated value or CSV format
for example this first row indicates
that Andersen found an iris with a sepal
length of five point one centimeters a
sepal width of three point five
centimeters a petal length of one point
four centimeters and a petal width of
0.2 centimeters this particular iris was
the species so Tosa
the dataset also contains iris
measurements from the species versicolor
and the species virginica in 1936 sir
Ronald Fisher wrote a paper about the
iris data set specifically about how a
technique called linear discriminant
analysis could be used to accurately
distinguish the three species from one
another using only the sepal and petal
measurements in other words Fisher
framed this as a supervised learning
problem in which we are attempting to
predict the species of a given iris
using the available data this is
supervised learning because we're trying
to learn the relationship between the
data namely the iris measurements and
the outcome which is the species of iris
if this was unlabeled data meaning that
we only had the measurements but not the
species we might frame this as
unsupervised learning by attempting to
cluster the samples into meaningful
groups anyway the iris dataset has
become a famous data set for machine
learning because it turns out to be an
easy supervised learning task there's a
strong relationship between the
measurements and the species and thus
various machine learning models can
accurately predict the species given the
measurements the data set is described
in more depth in the UCI machine
learning repository which is a
repository of hundreds of data sets
suitable for machine learning tasks
because the iris data set is so popular
as a toy data set it's actually built
into scikit-learn let's load it into
scikit-learn and examine it so that we
can use a machine learning model in the
next video to actually predict species
using the iris measurements we start by
writing from SK learn dot datasets
import
load iris which imports the load iris
function from the SK learned datasets
module
note that the convention in scikit-learn
is to import individual modules classes
or functions rather than importing
scikit-learn as a whole we then run the
load iris function and save the return
value in an object called iris this
object is a special container called a
bunch which is psych it learns special
object type for storing data sets and
their attributes one of those attributes
is called data
you'll recognize that this is the same
data we saw previously with a hundred
and fifty rows and four columns each row
represents one flower and the four
columns represent the four measurements
I'm now going to introduce some
important machine learning terminology
that we'll be using for the rest of this
video series each row is known as an
observation some equivalent terms are
sample example instance and record thus
the iris dataset has 150 observations
each column is known as a feature some
equivalent terms are predictor attribute
independent variable input regressor and
covariant thus the iris dataset has four
features next let's print out an
attribute of the iris object called
feature names as you can imagine this
represents the names of the four
features you can think of these like
column headers for the data now let's
print out two more attributes called
target and target names
the target represents what we're going
to predict which is a zero representing
site OSA a one representing versicolor
or a two representing virginica some
equivalent terms for target our response
outcome label and dependent variable I'm
going to use the term response in this
video series before we move on from
terminology I want to mention the two
types of supervised learning which are
classification and regression a
classification problem is one in which
the response being predicted is
categorical meaning that its values are
in a finite unordered set predicting the
species of iris is an example of a
classification problem as is predicting
whether an email is spam or ham in
contrast a regression problem is one in
which the response being predicted is
ordered and continuous such as the price
of a house or the height of a person
when looking at iris dot target you
might be wondering how you can tell that
this is a classification problem and not
a regression problem since all you can
see is the numbers 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 the answer is
you actually cannot tell the difference
as a machine learning practitioner you
have to understand how your data is
encoded and decide whether your response
variable is suited for regression or
classification in this case we know that
the number is 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 represent
unordered categories unless we know to
use classification techniques and not
regression techniques in order to solve
this problem if you remember the first
video in the series we talked about how
the first step in machine learning is
for the model to learn the relationship
between the features and the response we
will actually do this in the next video
but first we have to make sure that the
features and response are in the form
that scikit-learn expects there are four
key requirements to keep in mind which
are as follows first scikit-learn
expects the features and the response to
be passed into the machine learning
model as separate objects
iris dot data and iris dot target
fulfill this condition since they're
stored separately second scikit-learn is
only expecting to see numbers in the
feature and response objects this is
exactly why iris target is stored as
zeros ones and twos instead of the
strings so Tosa versicolor
and virginica in scikit-learn the
response object should always be numeric
regardless of whether it's a regression
problem or a classification problem
third scikit-learn expects the features
and the response to be stored as numpy
arrays numpy is a library for scientific
computing that implements a homogeneous
multi dimensional array known as an ende
array that has been optimized for fast
computation it turns out that both iris
data and iris dot target are already
stored as nd arrays
fourth the feature and response objects
are expected to have certain shapes
specifically the feature object should
have two dimensions in which the first
dimension represented by rows is the
number of observations and the second
dimension represented by columns is the
number of features all numpy arrays have
a shape attribute so we can verify that
the shape of iris data is 150 by 4 the
response object is expected to have a
single dimension and that dimension
should have the same magnitude as the
first dimension of the feature object in
other words there should be one response
corresponding to each observation we can
indeed verify that the shape of iris
target is simply 150 by the way the L
refers to the long data type that Python
is using to represent the data we have
now verified that iris data and iris dot
target meet scikit-learn z' for
requirements for feature and response
objects in a future video I'll show you
how to get your own data into the same
form the scikit-learn convention is for
the feature data to be stored in an
object named X and for the response data
to be stored in an object named Y thus
we'll store iris data in X and iris dot
target in Y note that the x is
capitalized because it represents a
matrix whereas the y is lowercase
because it represents a vector
to wrap up I wanted to highlight a few
resources that are useful for going
deeper on some of the topics mentioned
today the first is scikit-learn
documentation on data set loading
utilities which explains how to load a
number of other example data sets into
scikit-learn in case you want to explore
some additional data sets the second
resource is a talk on numpy by Jake
Vander plas at PyCon 2015 he explains
how numpy can be used to speed up the
execution of numerical computing in
python browsing through the slides would
give you a quick overview of num PI's
functionality if you decide that you
want to learn how to use numpy I
recommend Scott shells excellent
introduction to numpy which is a 24 page
PDF written in the style of a tutorial
although a deep understanding of numpy
is not critical in order to use
scikit-learn knowing numpy would
definitely help you to learn pandas
which is an extremely popular Python
library for data exploration and
manipulation that I may touch on later
in the series in the next video in the
series we'll learn about a specific
machine learning model that can be used
for classification we'll train that
model on the iris data set and then use
that model to make predictions please
let me know in the comments if you have
any questions and then subscribe on
youtube if you want to know when the
next video is released thanks for
watching and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
