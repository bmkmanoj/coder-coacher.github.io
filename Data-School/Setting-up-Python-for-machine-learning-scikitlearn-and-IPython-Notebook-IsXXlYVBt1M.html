machine learning with scikit-learn in
the previous video we define machine
learning split it up into the two types
of supervised and unsupervised learning
and then discussed how supervised
learning actually works in this video
i'll be covering the following topics
what are the benefits of cycle earn and
what are a few drawbacks how do I
install scikit-learn how do I use the
ipython notebook and if I don't yet know
any Python what are some good resources
for learning Python so let's get started
with a brief overview of some of the
benefits of scikit-learn here are the
things that I like best about
scikit-learn it provides a consistent
interface to lots of machine learning
models which makes it easy to learn how
to use a new model it provides you with
many options for each model so that you
can tune them for optimal performance
but it also chooses sensible defaults so
that you can get started quickly it's
documentation is exceptional and helps
you to understand the models as well as
how to use them properly besides just
the machine learning models themselves
scikit-learn provides a rich set of
functionality for companion tasks like
model selection model evaluation and
data preparation and finally it's under
active development and has an active
community on Stack Overflow and
especially its mailing list then lorica
from O'Reilly has a thoughtful article
about why he recommends scikit-learn
which I'll link to below this video as
well a link to a very readable paper
written by the authors of scikit-learn
describing their API design philosophy
are there any drawbacks to using
scikit-learn for machine learning as
compared to machine learning and are for
example personally I find that getting
started with machine learning is
actually easier in our the once you've
mastered the basics it's actually much
easier to go deeper in machine learning
with scikit-learn I discuss this issue
in more depth in a blog post linked
below and there are lots of thoughtful
comments below the post one other
potential drawback depending upon the
goals of your project is that
scikit-learn tends to have a machine
learning philosophy rather than a
statistical learning philosophy what's
the difference between the two well
machine learning places a greater
emphasis on predictive accuracy
whereas statistical learning emphasizes
model interpretability and uncertainty
in other words you'll find that
scikit-learn focuses more on helping you
to maximize the accuracy of your models
whereas R tends to offer more
capabilities for understanding your
models again that may or may not be a
drawback depending upon your own project
goals anyway let's move on to
scikit-learn installation the
scikit-learn website has a thorough page
covering installation across various
operating systems note that it works
with python 2 or 3 and then it requires
both numpy and Sai PI alternatively you
could download a Python distribution
that includes scikit-learn such as the
anaconda distribution from continuum
analytics anaconda is known as the
scientific distribution of python
because it includes hundreds of popular
packages that are useful for scientific
work as well it includes ipython
and the ipython notebook a convenient
package manager called Conda and an IDE
or integrated development environment
called spider the anaconda distribution
of Python is what I personally use and
recommend for my data science students
and throughout this series I'll be using
the ipython notebook to demonstrate
scikit-learn
however you're welcome to use any setup
that works for you now let's take a look
at the ipython notebook we're actually
looking at an eye Python notebook right
now
there are two main components to the
ipython notebook the ipython interpreter
and a browser-based notebook interface
the ipython interpreter is an enhanced
version of the standard Python
interpreter that includes additional
functionality such as tab completion
syntax highlighting a better help system
access to operating system commands and
more the browser-based notebook
interface allows you to weave together
code formatted text and plots into the
same document it was recently renamed
the jupiter notebook to reflect the fact
that languages other than python are
supported but the functionality is the
same to install ipython in the notebook
the ipython web site provides simple
instructions for how to do this using
pip if you installed the Anaconda
distribution of Python you will already
have ipython in the notebook so no
further action is necessary let's now
take a look at how to actually use the
ipython notebook to launch it simply go
to the command line and type ipython
then a space then type notebook and hit
enter this dashboard will open which
provides a list of notebooks in the
current directory you can see that I
have one notebook that's running and one
notebook that's not while using the
ipython notebook it's important not to
close the command line window since it's
acting as the notebook server anyway
let's click this button to create a new
notebook
you can think of this as Python running
in your browser each block is known as a
cell in which I can write one or more
lines of Python code I can then click
run or hit ctrl + enter on my keyboard
to actually execute the cell if there's
output it's displayed below the cell I'm
now in command mode indicated by the
gray border around the cell which allows
me to create new cells above or below
the current cell by hitting a4 above or
b4 below on my keyboard I can also
navigate between cells using the up and
down arrows when I'm ready I can hit
enter to switch from command mode to
edit mode indicated by the green border
and now I can type more code
I can switch back to command mode at any
time by hitting the Escape key
I'll now navigate up to the first cell
using the up arrow I can hit the M key
to switch the cell type from code to
markdown and then switch to edit mode by
hitting Enter
I can now input markdown code which is
an easy to read easy to write markup
language I'll demonstrate some markdown
code and then hit ctrl + Enter to render
the cell
in a future video I'll show you how to
display plots within the notebook in the
meantime you can hit the H key to see
the rest of the keyboard shortcuts
once you're done with the notebook you
can click Save and checkpoint
to save the notebook and then click
close and halt to shut it down
all of your code has been saved but the
environment itself has not been
preserved the next time you open that
notebook you will need to rerun the code
cells in order to load the relevant
objects the final thing I want to show
you about the ipython notebook is the
excellent NB viewer website n be view
allows you to view a notebook that's
already online without actually running
it on your local computer first let's
copy the URL to a notebook such as the
github link for the notebook from my
first video then paste the link and
click go
and it will render the notebook in your
browser note that this is a static HTML
document in order to actually run or
edit the cells you'll need to make a
local copy of the notebook
I've listed a few resources here that
you might find to be helpful if you want
to learn more about ipython itself
I recommend the official documentation
for a longer introduction to the
notebook
I recommend the official ipython
notebook tutorials to learn some basic
markdown github provides a nice
introductory guide to wrap up I want to
talk about a few resources that I
recommend for learning Python the first
is code academy z' popular Python course
which teaches Python in the browser and
includes tons of exercises the next is
data quest which has a similar interface
to code Academy but teaches Python
specifically in the context of data
science note that some of their lessons
require a paid account the third
resource is Google's Python class which
is slightly more advanced but includes
hours of useful lecture videos written
guides to the material and downloadable
exercises with solutions I like this
class because it mostly focuses on areas
of Python that are useful for data
science the final resource is Python for
informatics a beginner oriented book
that also includes slides and videos due
to its slower pace and thorough
explanations it's an excellent resource
if you have never programmed before in
any programming language in the next
video in this series we'll load a famous
data set into scikit-learn we'll discuss
how it relates to the machine learning
process and then we'll talk about psych
it learns for
key requirements for working with data
as always I'd love to hear from you in
the comments if you have any questions
about today's material or if you have
any resources you'd like to share please
subscribe on youtube if you'd like to
keep up with the series thanks for
watching and I'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
