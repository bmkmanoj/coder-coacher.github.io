basic features of a GitHub repository.
If you click on &quot;Commits&quot;, you can see the
commit history for the repo.
A commit is a set of one or more changes made
to one or more files.
Each commit has a comment explaining the commit,
and you can click on the comment to see the
actual changes.
When you go back to the main page, note that
the text here is actually the comment from
the most recent commit to that file or folder,
and the date of that commit.
It's not a description of that file or folder.
Next let's click on &quot;Issues&quot;.
Issues is a system for tracking bugs or other
problems with that repo.
Anyone can submit an issue.
Now let's go to &quot;Pull Requests&quot;.
This will make more sense once we have talked
about forks, but basically, a Pull Request
is when a contributor (Tony in this case)
has made changes to the ggplot2 code, and
they are requesting that the repo owner pull
those changes into the repository.
Next is &quot;Branches&quot;.
I'm not going to explain why branches are
used, but I'll just say that for a simple
repository, there is often only one branch,
and it's called &quot;master&quot; by default.
Next is &quot;Contributors&quot;.
These are everyone who has ever contributed
to this repository.
As for &quot;Forking&quot;, we'll get to that in the
next video.
&quot;Starring&quot; is like favoriting a repo, and
&quot;Watching&quot; is similar to starring.
Finally, let's leave the repo and go to Hadley's
profile page.
This is his summary page, showing his most
popular repos and his contributions across
GitHub.
If you click on repos, you can see all of
his repos, the language they were written
in, the commit activity in the form of a graph,
and the number of stars and number of forks.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
