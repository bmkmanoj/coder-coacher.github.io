Q&amp;amp;A video series on the pandas library
in Python and the question for today is
how do I select a pandas series from a
data frame so there are two basic object
types in pandas that hold data and one
is called the data frame and it's
basically just a table of rows and
columns and then each of those columns
is known as a pandas series okay so you
can have a panda series that's not part
of a data frame but in my work I find
that mostly I'm working with series that
are part of a data frame so the question
is how do I select a series from it
perhaps I want to do an analysis on a
particular series or perhaps I want to
manipulate that series that's why you
might want to do it so let's go ahead
and create an example data frame and
then answer this question so first we're
going to as always import pandas as PD
and then on the data set we're going to
use today is a data set of UFO reports
reports of UFO sightings from 1930
through 2000 okay so I'm going to say
UFO equals PD dot and there's two
options here we're going to start with
read table okay we're going to pass it
the URL where the data file is stored
and as always I'm using a bitly URL so
that you can follow along so bitly slash
UFO reports okay and then I'll say SEP
comma now the file at that location is a
CSV file a comma separated value file
read table assumes tab separated files
by default so we're going to say this up
is calm now I could do that and that
would work
run it and it will work but the shortcut
is actually to use read CSV and the
literally the only difference between
read table and read CSV is that read CSV
uses the comma as the default separator
so let's run that okay so we want to
confirm this is a data frame so we'll
just say type UFO and it is indeed a
data frame type is just a built-in
Python method for looking at the type of
object and if we do dot head we can see
the first five rows okay so it's the
city the state the color and shape
reported and the time of the UFO
sighting okay so to actually answer our
question which is how do we select a
series let's go ahead and do that and
the basic way to do this and we'll see
more is to use what's known as bracket
notation so this is kind of like
selecting well I'll just show you first
UFO bracket city and that will select
out the city series okay and so this is
just city this is the first 30 rows and
the last 30 rows of that series okay so
um that's the that's the basic method
and let's just confirm this is a series
we'll just say type and we see it is
indeed a series okay so couple notes
about this seems pretty simple but a
couple notes that might be useful to
remember so um this bracket notation
this is case sensitive so if I just put
on a lower case city that'll generate an
error it'll generate a key error okay um
there is a shortcut to this that is very
common and useful to remember okay so um
you can actually instead use what's
known as dot notte
chin and it looks like this UFO dot city
and that does work
now pandas is using a little trick here
in which um every time a series is added
to a data frame okay
it all its name automatically becomes an
attribute of that data frame okay so if
I say UFO dot and I hit tab you can see
right there is city along with all of
these other methods and attributes I
just hit the tab character after
anything dot it literally makes the the
column name the series name one of the
attributes which is very handy now why
would you want to do this well just
because it's less typing to say UFO dot
city then this much longer
you know brackets quotation marks city
so UFO dot city is quite quite handy
okay so a question that might have come
up in your mind is how would I select
the series colors reported well would I
do this that doesn't seem quite right
because there's a space and house what's
Python going to think that will air you
could say well maybe I just delete the
space and no that doesn't work either
you can try lots of different variations
but if the column name is colors space
reported dot notation simply does not
work okay if you want to select out
colors reported you have to use bracket
notation okay alright so I know that
might look strange these are not a
number we'll talk about that in a future
video but um you have to use bracket
notation to select a series if the
series has a space in it this is also
the case
if you name a column something that
conflicts with a built-in method or
attribute okay so this is a tricky one
ah let's pretend you had a column named
shape okay
lowercase H a sha pe if you tried to use
dot notation to select that column it
would fail because shape is already a
built-in attribute of a data frame so um
that would conflict that would not work
you would just get back you know you
would get back the shape of the data
frame you would not get back the pandas
series named shape if there was one the
same thing would hold if you named a
column head and then tried to access it
using dot notation you would also not
get what you expected okay so the bottom
line here is that dot notation only
works under certain circumstances
whereas bracket notation will always
work so if you like bracket notation
just use it just know that there are
people out there like me who like to use
dot notation because it's faster to type
so you want to recognize it um but it
will not dock notation will not always
work for selecting a pandas series okay
so I'll always end with a bonus tip and
the bonus tip for today is how do I
create a new pandas series in a data
frame so quick diversion on that um so
in a regular Python if you have two
strings like a B I'm sorry a B which is
a string and C D which is a string and
you use the plus sign that combines them
that concatenates them okay you can do
the same thing with pandas series that
are strings okay you could do the same
thing with pandas series that are
numbers and it would do them
but we've all of our series here are
strings um so if we said UFO dot city +
UFO dot state I think what's going to
happen it will actually just put the
city next to the state so you can see
ethica and new york Willingboro New
Jersey Holyoke Colorado okay
now that looks kind of funny um maybe we
want to actually put in a like a comma
space if you're familiar with that
American Way maybe worldwide way of
listing out cities and states or city
and country and now we get the city
comma space state okay now perhaps we're
doing this because we want to create a
new column that includes both of those
you might think well maybe I just assign
it so UFO dot and we'll call it location
equals okay this is what you might think
this is not the right way this is not
going to do what you think okay you have
to use bracket notation when creating a
new series in a data frame so that will
work and you will see info dot head you
will see now we've got this location
column that is the city and the state
okay so if you're going to create a new
column in a data frame you should you
have to use bracket notation when naming
that column you can use either notation
on the right side of the equal sign but
when assigning it you have to use
bracket notation I could not have said
UFO dot location here okay so that's it

you'd like to see more videos like this
as always put a comment below if you
have a question about the video or a
question about pandas in general maybe
I'll make a video about it
or I will at least answer your question
in the comments
okay thanks again and I will see you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
