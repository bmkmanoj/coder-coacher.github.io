scraping with Python this is a four part
introductory tutorial in which you'll
use web scraping to build a data set
from a New York Times article about
President Trump if you'd like to follow
along at home you can download this
jupiter notebook from github and there's
a link to it in the description below in
this video you'll learn what web
scraping is and why it's useful as well
I'll explain the three basic facts about
HTML that you need to know in order to
get started with web scraping so let's
start with what is web scraping on July
21st 2017 the New York Times updated an
opinion article called Trump's lies
detailing every public lie the president
has told since taking office because
this is a newspaper the information was
of course published as a block of text
this is a great format for human
consumption but it can't easily be
understood by a computer in this
tutorial we'll extract the president's
lies from the New York Times article and
store them in a structured data set now
this is a common scenario you find a web
page that contains data you want to
analyze but it's not presented in a
format that you can easily download and
read into your favorite data analysis
tool you might imagine manually copying
and pasting the data into a spreadsheet
but in most cases that is way too
time-consuming a technique called web
scraping is a useful way to automate
this process so what is web scraping
it's the process of extracting
information from a web page by taking
Vantage of patterns in the webpages
underlying code let's start looking for
these patterns take a second and notice
how the article presents its information
when converting this article into a data
set you can think of each lie as a
record with four fields first is the
date of the lie second is the lie itself
as a quotation third is the writers
brief explanation of why it was a lie
and fourth is the URL of the article
that substantiates that claim that it
was a lie now importantly those four
fields have different formatting which
is consistent throughout the article the
date is bold red text the lie is regular
text the explanation is gray italics
text and the URL is linked from that
gray italics text so why does the
formatting matter because it's very
likely that the code underlying the
webpage tags those fields differently
and we can take advantage of that
pattern when scraping the page so let's
take a look at the source code for this
page known as HTML to view the HTML code
that generates a web page you
right-click on it and select view page
source in Chrome or Firefox view source
in Internet Explorer or show page source
in Safari now if that option doesn't
appear in Safari just open Safari
preferences select the Advanced tab and
check show develop menu in menu bar
again that's for Safari users only so
notice the first few lines you'll see
when you viewing the source of the New
York Times article then let's locate the
first lie by searching the HTML for the
text Iraq so ctrl F and then I are a
queue thankfully you only have to
understand three basic facts about HTML
in order to get started with web
scraping fact one is that HTML consists
of tags you'll see that the HTML
contains the article text along with
tags specified using angle brackets that
mark up the text HTML actually stands
for hypertext markup language for
example one tag is strong which means
use bold formatting there's a strong tag
before January 21st and a strong tag
after January 21st the first is an
opening tag and the second is a closing
tag denoted by this forward slash which
indicates to the web browser where to
start and where to stop applying the
formatting in other words this tag tells
the web browser to make the text January
21st bold now don't worry about this
nbsp we'll deal with that later
okay fact two HTML tags can have
attributes which are specified in the
opening tag for example span class
equals short desc indicates that this
particular span tag has a class
attribute
with a value of short desc
now for the purpose of web scraping you
don't actually need to understand the
meaning of span class or short desc
instead you just need to recognize that
tags can have attributes and that they
are specified in this particular way so
that's fact 2 fact 3 is that tags can be
nested let's pretend my HTML code said
hello strong M data school
eeehm students strong ok the text data
school students would all be bold
because all of that text is between the
opening strong tag and the closing
strong tag the text data school would
also be in italics because the e/m tag
means use italics the text hello would
not be bold or italics because it's not
within either the strong or e/m tags
thus it would appear as follows hello
data school bold and italics and then
students just in bold the central point
to take away from this example is that
tags markup texts from wherever they
open to wherever they close regardless
of whether they are nested within other
tags ok if you've got that you now know
enough about HTML in order to start web
scraping in the next video we'll read
the New York Times article into Python
parse its HTML
using the beautifulsoup library and then
start building our data set by taking
advantage of the patterns we noticed in
the article formatting if you have a
question or a tip let me know in the
