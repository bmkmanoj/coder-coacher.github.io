series about the pandas library in
Python and the question for today is how
do I use the axis parameter in pandas
alright
this is a bit of a technical topic we've
seen the access parameter once before in
this series in the context of dropping
rows and columns so we're going to start
with a recap of that we're going to talk
about the axis parameter and then we're
going to use it in another context okay
so as always we'll start by importing
pandas import pandas as PD and then
we're going to read in a data set and
this is going to be a data set of
alcohol consumption by country so PD dot
read CSV and then pass at the URL fit
dot Lee slash drinks by country okay so
run that and then take a look at the
first five rows and what we see is that
each row represents a country and
they're reported alcohol consumption per
adult okay so let's say we want to
remove a column let's say we don't care
about the continent column we would what
we would do is use the drop method to
data frame method so drink stop drop and
then we pass it as a string the name of
the column we want to drop and then we
say axis equals one okay and I'm just
going to go ahead and throw on the head
method so that we're only looking at the
first five rows of the resulting data
frame now what you can see is that the
continent column was indeed dropped okay
and I had to specify axis equals one to
say I want to drop a column Chi
now this did not I did not use the in
place parameter arm so this did not
actually remove the column this is just
a temporary thing okay so let's say
instead I wanted to drop a row so I
wanted to drop Row two for example this
is the index and also instead I say drop
two and I change it to axis equals zero
and this time you can see the continent
column is back but this time row two is
now gone okay so what exactly is going
on here
so pandas could have created a drop
columns method that was specific to drop
dropping columns and it could have
created a separate drop rows method for
dropping rows but instead the pandas
philosophy is to make a single method
called drop and then we use the axis
parameter to specify which what we want
to drop do I want to drop a row or a
column so axis one is the column axis
axis zero is the row axis okay so
anytime you run across a panda's command
and you think it could refer to rows or
columns that's how you'll specify which
you want to refer to okay now let's try
using axis in a different parameter um
so what we're going to do is a
mathematical operation a mean and let's
just say I say drinks dot mean what's
going to happen so I'll run that and
what we're seeing is that pandas has
told us the mean of each of the numeric
columns this is the mean value of the
beer servings series of the spirit
serving series wine servings and total
liters of pure
alcohol okay so why did it give us the
mean values for each series um great
questions so basically this is doing
column means and that's because the
default behavior of mean is axis equals
zero so I'm just making it explicit this
will have the same result I'm just
making it explicit that when I said
drinks that mean it was assuming the
zero axis and in other words axis zero
for an operation is saying I want you to
move down I want you to move across the
row axis this is the row axis and the
direction I want the operation to occur
is down so the way I like to imagine it
is that these four columns the numeric
columns are kind of being collapsed down
into a single set of four numbers that
represents the mean of each column okay
so if instead you wanted the mean of
each row you could say axis equals one
and now you can picture that operation
moving the mean operation moving along
the column axis the one axis it's moving
this way and that way what it's doing is
its averaging it's taking the mean of
these zeros which is zero it's taking
the mean of these which is 69 etc etc
now this is not a meaningful number
because these are different units these
are servings
this is liters so there are different
units so this isn't like a meaningful
number but I just wanted to show you the
principle of how to use the axis of zero
or one okay so just to reinforce this
when you're moving along axis
one you're preserving all the rows and
there's a 193 Rose which is why that
result has a shape of 193 whereas when
we did axis equals 0
we got a shape of 4 because it was
collapsing all the columns down into one
number so again I think of the axis for
an op a mathematical operation as like
the direction of the movement of the
operation ok all right so as always
we're going to end with a bonus tip and
one one thing I want to show you is that
you can actually they're actually
aliases for the axis numbers so if you
find 0 you might find this more
intuitive than axis 0 and 1 so if you
want to say axis 0 you can actually say
axis equals index as a string and you'll
get the same thing as axis equals 0 ok
axis equals 1 which again would have
given us 193 numbers this way you can
say access equals columns okay so you
decide which is more intuitive up to you
I tend to use 0 and 1 um but index and
columns is also valid in pandas alright
so that's it for today thanks so much
