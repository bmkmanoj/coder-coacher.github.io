and why to fork a repository, and also how
to delete a fork.
Forking is one of the simplest GitHub operations.
In this case, we're going to fork the repo
for the &quot;Open Source Data Science Masters&quot;,
which is basically just a Markdown document
linking to good resources for learning data
science topics.
To fork this repo, you just need to be logged
into your GitHub account, and then you click
&quot;Fork&quot;.
Wait a few seconds, and it will be done.
So, what actually happened here?
You've simply made a copy of the repo in your
own account.
That copy includes all of the repository files,
and even the commit history is preserved.
There's also a link to the original repo that
you forked, which is often called the &quot;upstream
repo&quot;.
So, why did we fork this repo?
Usually, you fork a repo either because you
just want a copy of the files, or because
you intend to contribute to that repo.
We'll talk more about collaboration in a future
video, but basically, here's how it works:
Step 1 is that you fork the repo, which we've
already done.
Step 2 is that you make a modification to
your fork of the repo, perhaps by adding a
new link.
And step 3 is that you send a &quot;pull request&quot;
to the repo owner, asking them to pull your
changes into their repo.
So to be clear, once you've forked a repo,
your fork does not automatically stay in sync
with the original upstream repo.
I'll show you in a future video how to sync
your fork with the upstream.
Also, you might have noticed that we did all
of the forking in GitHub, not in Git.
That's because forking is a GitHub concept.
Nothing happened to your local machine just
by virtue of forking a repo.
Finally, let's say you want to delete a fork.
Simply click on &quot;Settings&quot;, scroll to the
bottom, and click &quot;Delete&quot;.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
