series on the pandas library in Python
and today's video is actually a
continuation from last time when we're
talking about the pandas index so today
we're going to talk about the series
index and as well talk about alignment
so if you haven't watched that first
video I would go ahead and watch that
now and then come on back here okay so
we are gonna start with the same data
set we used last time
so we'll import pandas as PD and then
we're going to use this data set of
alcohol consumption by continent our
sorry by country so we're gonna read CSV
and it's bit dot Lee slash drinks by
country okay and we'll take a look at
the head and just like last time we saw
in the data frame always has an index
right here okay and what I want to show
you is that a series also has an index
okay and it comes from the native frame
so if for example I select the continent
series and I say head you will see 0 1 2
3 4 which is the index for the series
which came from the data frame so the
index is on the left and the values are
on the right now let's pretend that we
didn't use the default index for the
data frame and instead we set something
else as the index of the data frame so
let's say for example drinks dot set
index and we're going to set the index
as the country in place equals true
let's take another look at it and we see
that the country has been turned into
the index okay so now what's gonna
happen when we select the continent
series okay
so drinks dot continent dot head and
this time we're seeing the same thing as
last time okay
the index is on the left the values are
on the right this is just a panda series
the real contents is this but the index
just came from the data frame and is
attached to each row okay now you've
actually seen series many times before
in these videos and they all include an
index and you probably just didn't
notice it or notice what it was so for
example if I say drinks dot continent
dot value counts this is actually a
series and as such unless just copy and
paste this as such it has for example an
index and here it is and it has values
okay now because it's a series that is
output and not some special value counts
object or something we can actually use
the index to select values from the
series what I mean is I can take this
and I can refer to an index such as
let's say Africa and I put it in
brackets and I'm saying from this series
find the index Africa and show me the
value okay this is kind of like how we
used dot Lok with the data frame to say
oh I want to pull out the contents by
referring to the
index and the column name in that case
here I just say what's the index I'm
looking for it's Africa and it shows me
the value and again this worked because
this is a series object okay now next I
want to talk about sorting okay so again
pasting that and do you remember how you
can sort the values of a series we saw
that in a previous video and you just
say dot sort values and that sorts in
ascending order so now you can see that
the series is sorted okay but what if I
want to sort the index itself say in
ascending order I can actually use
something called sort index whoops and
there you go it's now in ascending
alphabetical order okay so in the last
video we talked about three reasons the
index exists and it was identification
selection and alignment and so I want to
show you what alignment means and for
that I need to create another series
okay so I'm gonna call it people and I'm
gonna say PD dot series and just follow
along with me here I'm gonna pass in
three million and a list of the numbers
three million and eighty five thousand
okay and I'm gonna pass I'm gonna say
index equals and pass a list Albania and
in door and I'm gonna say name equals
population okay so this is one way to
create a pandas series and let's just
look at it so the population of Albania
is approximately three million
population of Andorra is about eighty
five thousand and this is how I
constructed this series I gave it the
values I gave it the
index and I gave it a name now this is
my tiny dataset and let's say I want to
use this plus the drinks data set to
calculate the total beer servings for
each country and I'm going to do that by
multiplying these numbers so the number
of people times the data in the beer
serving series which tells you the
average per person so I'm going to take
the average per person multiply it by
the number of people okay
to see the total beer servings per year
in that country so all I'm gonna do is
say drinks dot beer servings which by
the way I'll just remind you of what
that looks like
there's the drinks that beer servings
I'm going to say that times people and
when I run that check out what happens
okay obviously for countries that were
not represented in this series it's
gonna say well I can't do that math
because I need I need the number of
people so it marks it with not a number
which is means of missing value however
for the ones in which it does have the
population amount it does the
multiplication and here's the thing it
aligned them by the series it didn't
just take these two numbers and multiply
them by the first two rows it found
Albania three million and multiplied
three million by the beer servings
number for Albania Andorra did the same
thing okay so that's in summary
alignment allows us to put data together
and work with it together even if it
doesn't if it's not exactly the same
length as long as you tell it which rows
correspond
- which other rows so I took the Albania
data here in the Andorra data here and
it knew to do the math because they
shared based upon this shared index okay
so I want to end today with a bonus as
always and the the question I would pose
is how if I just wanted to take this
people series and add it to the data
frame how would I do that
and I'm going to use a method called PD
dot concat short for concatenation now
concat can be used to concatenate rows
on top of other rows or columns next to
other columns and the way we control
that is with the axis parameter so I'm
gonna say I'm gonna pass it the truth
I'm gonna pass it a list with the drinks
object which is the data frame and the
people series and I'll say axis equals 1
which means essentially put these
objects side by side and when we do that
and say dot head check that out we've
got a new column and even though it
didn't have complete data it put the
data in the right spots because of the
series index and that is the beauty of
the automatic alignment that pandas does
using the index okay so that's it for
today please click Subscribe if you'd
like to see more videos like this I'll
be talking about the multi index which I
know some of you want to hear about in a
future video let me know in the question
in the comment section below if you have
any questions and that's it so thanks
again for joining me and I hope to see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
