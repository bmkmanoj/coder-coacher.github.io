series about the pandas library in
Python and the question for today comes
from the YouTube comments from Vladislav
Surkov and he says the indices are one
of the most confusing things in pandas
for me what are the advantages of using
indices instead of just storing its
values
in columns alright that is an excellent
question as always we will jump right in
with an example dataset so we'll import
pandas as PD and then we are going to
use a data set of alcohol consumption by
country so ours a drinks equals PD dot
read CSV and then bitly slash drinks by
country and we'll take a look at the
head and you can see that each row
represents a country and some data about
that row all right and the thing you
might have noticed is there's this part
over here in bold and as well the part
up here in bold
now this over here is known as the index
this up here which we've seen before is
known as the columns so we're focusing
mostly on the index let's just look at
it as an attribute so if I say drinks
dot index it will show me that the index
is the integers 0 through 192 and the
length is 193 okay one index for each
row alright and turns out that every
data frame has an index and a columns
attribute for that matter um so it's
always there it's not something that's
optional and these are sometimes called
the row labels okay so the index
sometimes known as the road
Able's now I want to mention the columns
because you might notice that when you
look at the columns attribute you'll see
that it says index here and that's the
type of object it is it's a special
object it's not referred to as the index
though when someone says the index or
the row labels they're talking about
this and when someone says the columns
or the column headers they're talking
about this but it is an index
technically okay now neither the index
nor the columns are considered part of
the like the data frame contents and as
such when you do drinks that shape you
see 193 which is the number of rows and
it doesn't include the column headers in
that 183 and the six one two three four
five six does not include the index the
index is not part of the data frame in
that way all right so it turns out that
the the index and the columns will both
default to these integers if no index or
columns are specified so I'll just show
you a quick example and we'll use a
dataset we've seen I think once before
and fit dot Li slash movie users and
we'll say header equals none and Sep
the oops sorry
except the pipe character and we'll take
a look at the head okay and this is
users who rated movies on a website and
you can see this is all the data but we
actually didn't specify a header and so
that the header is also these default um
zero one two three four okay so a lot of
times people will leave the default
index of integers but rarely do people
leave the default columns as integers
because
usually you want to identify them by
what's in them okay so we haven't
answered the question yet why does the
index exist and there are three main
reasons one is identification the second
is selection and the third is alignment
and we're going to cover identification
and selection in this video and we will
talk about alignment in the next video
okay so for identification I want to
show you an example of filtering the
data frame and we're going to go back to
the drinks data frame so let's say
drinks bracket drinks continent equals
South America let's just take a look at
that and the thing I want you to notice
is that the index also known as the row
labels stayed with the rows it didn't
just show us it didn't kind of renumber
them as 0 through 11 or or whatever it
kept the original row numbers this is
what we mean when we say the index is
for identification it's so you can
identify what rows you are working with
even if you filter the original data
frame okay alright let's talk now about
selection okay and what I mean by that
is what if I want to grab a piece of
this data frame and I'm going to use a
method that we've seen a couple times
before but we'll talk in much more depth
in a future video which is the loke
method and the loke method allows me to
say if I want this number I can say what
row is it in and you refer to the index
so I want row 23 column beer servings
okay and I can pull out this 245 number
now loke is much more powerful than this
but you can use it just like this
now you might think well that's not that
impressive um I'm not going to one I'm
not going to remember if I want the beer
servings in Brazil I'm not going to
remember that Brazil is 23 I'm going to
have to look at it anyway so you know
why do I need this
you know the index for this but this I'm
going to show you the answer to this
question by setting a different index
and this answers the original the
viewers question about why use an index
why not just put everything as columns
and here is the reason so we can say
drinks dot set index and we say set it
as country in place equals true look at
the head and by saying in place equals
true it occurs in place you don't have
to reassign it to another data frame and
you can see now that the data frame has
changed because the country series that
column has now become the index and the
pre-existing index the default index of
integers has disappeared okay so if you
check drinks index you will see that it
now is Afghanistan through Zimbabwe okay
it still has length 193 okay if you
check the columns you will see it's no
longer country is no longer one of the
columns and in fact um if you check
drinks dot shape it now says 193 by 5
because the index isn't again it's not
part of the data frame okay so
because we have now set the country as
the index we can now use the lok method
and we can say brazil instead of 23 we
say brazil beer servings and we get that
245 number okay so by setting the index
as something that was meaningful to us
we can now select data from the data
frame more easily okay
now couple follow-up issues one is you
might be wondering what is this right
here like it's not a column but it's
just kind of hanging out there and
that's actually the name of the index if
you look here you can see name equals
country okay
now you don't have to have an index name
it's helpful as kind of an identifier of
what it's being used for what it
represents but you can actually clear it
out if you need you can just say drinks
dot index name equals of none pythons
and none object and if you look at the
head it's now gone so it's still the
index it just doesn't have a name okay
now let's say you decide at this point
you know what I kind of prefer to use
the default index and I'm going to move
this back into a column KY and you can
do that okay now the thing I'll show you
is that you will first probably want to
give that index its name back so drinks
that index that name equals country and
then we're going to reset the index and
say in place equals true and then look
at the head
and if you check that out you'll see
that we are back to having the default
integer index and the country which was
the index rejoined the data frame as one
of the columns okay now it was important
to set the name of the index before
doing the reset because pandas decided
what to call this column based upon the
name of the index okay
all right arm as always we are going to
end with some bonus content and I just
want to show you ah we've seen this many
times before
but the described method okay and it's
just a numerical summary of the
numerical columns and I want you to
notice that this is actually a data
frame and as such data frame it has an
index okay let me just copy that
you know this is the index okay and
these are the columns okay so the point
here is not so much that you're going to
do something with that described you
might but I want you to be aware that
lots of methods output data frames and
if you know about the index and the
columns and you recognize that you can
interact with that resulting data frame
okay so for example we can say drinks
dot Lok and we can say 25% this 25th
percentile and beer servings
and pull out whoops what did I do wrong
drinks dot describe dot Lok pardon me
so it's drinks that describe outputs a
data frame dot Lok is a data frame
method and then we pulled out using the
index and the column attributes we
pulled out this twenty number okay
so just be aware of the type of objects
you're interacting with and take
advantage of the index and the columns
wherever you can okay so that's it for
today as I mentioned I'll cover
alignment in the next video and as well
I'll talk about the series index okay um
