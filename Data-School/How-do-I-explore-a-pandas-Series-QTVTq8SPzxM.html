series about the pandas library in
Python and the question for today is how
do I explore a pandas series okay ah so
let's start as always by importing
pandas as PD and then we need an example
data set and we're going to use a data
set of movies ah top rated movies from
the IMDB website so we'll say movies
equals PD read CSV and we'll pass the
bitly URL bit dot Lee slash IMDB ratings
okay and let's take a look at the head
and we see that each row is a movie and
some information about that movie okay
um let's take a look at the d types the
data type of each column and we're going
to be focusing on two columns today one
is genre which is an object column which
usually means string but not always it
does in this case and then duration
which is an integer column it's the
duration of each movie in minutes
alright so we're going to start with
genre and then we'll move on to duration
so ah the first thing you might do with
a non numeric column like genre movies
genre is to describe it okay so we've
seen the described method before it's
not only a data frame method it's also a
series method okay so dot describe and
this shows us the count of non null
values in that series the number of
unique values in that series 16 the most
common value in that series which is
drama and the frequency of that most
common value so out of the
979 non null values 278 of them were
drama okay
so that's useful but it kind of leaves
us wanting more so I'm going to show you
something similar that provides a lot
more information which is the value
counts method
so we'll say movies genre dot value
counts and I use this all the time it
shows us a count of each value and how
often it appears in this series so drama
which we saw above appears 278 times in
this series comedy 156 times and so on
okay now one cool modification you can
make to this is you can say movies John
rot value counts normalize equals true
and that actually just turns these raw
counts into percentages so 28% of the
movies in this genre series are of type
drama okay now one thing I really like
about pandas is that very often series
and data frame methods output new series
and data frame objects okay so for
example if we check the type
of this okay we will see that the output
of value counts is itself a series and
as a result you can use a series method
like head okay you can use any series
method on it you like and this is just
useful ought to know about pandas in
general that every time you run a method
think to yourself what other data frame
and series methods do I already know
that I might like to chain on to the end
of this command okay all right I'm going
to show you a couple more methods up
before we move on to duration so we're
going to say movies genre dot unique and
that allows us to see what are all the
unique values in this series and as well
we can do movies genre dot n unique to
see the number of unique values in this
series there are other ways to get these
pieces of information from pandas but
these are some nice convenient methods
for doing so okay
finally let's do a cross tabulation so
PD cross tab and we can pass it two
different series and we'll say movies
genre and movies dot content rating okay
and this allows us to see a tally
account of how many movies belong to
each combination of genre and content
rating so there are for instance 44
action movies that are rated PG pg-13 in
this data set okay alright let's move on
to duration so this is a numeric column
and let's just say movies dot duration
dot describe okay so describe is a seer
method that also works on numeric
columns and will see a variety of we'll
see a summary of some statistics about
it for instance the mean the minimum the
max the median and so on okay we might
also we might just want to pull out one
of these statistics such as the mean and
in that case we just say movies dot
duration dot mean and we get out this
120 value that we saw up here okay so
there are lots of different calculations
available as series methods that you can
use for numeric columns now you could
also use value counts so movies that
duration not value counts and um if
you're confused by what this result is
telling you it's saying that there are
23 movies with duration 112 minutes and
22 movies with duration 113 minutes and
so on okay
so probably not the most useful um
useful method in this case but you could
imagine that if you had categorical data
that was represented as integers then a
value counts might be useful otherwise I
mostly use value counts with object
columns okay alright as always we're
going to end with a bonus and this bonus
is to do some visualization so if you
want to do visualization in a in an
ipython notebook you need to say percent
Matt plot live in line that allows plots
to appear in the notebook and we'll do
two different plots one is movies that
duration
and if we want to plot this you can
actually just throw on dot plot at the
end of the series and then you tell if
the kind of plot you want so if we
wanted to see a histogram that's all it
takes this is a histogram of the
durations a histogram just shows you the
distribution of a numerical variable a
single numerical variable okay
another plot that might be interesting
is let's take a look again at movies
onra dot value counts and you could
actually represent this as a plot really
simply so we just say dot plot kind
equals bar and we get a nice bar plot
representation of this okay so there's a
lot more we could say about
visualization that'll be coming in some
future videos there are tons of
customizations you can do to these plots
as well to make them look and display
exactly what you need all right so
that's all for today thank you so much
