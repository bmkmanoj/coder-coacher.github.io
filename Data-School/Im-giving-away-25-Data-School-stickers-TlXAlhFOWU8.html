Just a quick announcement for you today:
We have reached the two year anniversary of
Data School, and so to celebrate, I decided
to have some stickers printed. And here they
are. Turned out awesome, really nice quality
stickers from Sticker Mule.
Anyway, to thank you for your support, I'm
giving away stickers to 25 fans, for free,
including shipping, anywhere in the world.
So there's only one thing I'm going to ask
you to do for me, which is to subscribe to
the Data School email newsletter. Now, why
would you want to subscribe to my newsletter?
Well number 1, you'll get notifications about
my new blog posts and YouTube videos and other
exclusive content that I don't share anywhere
else.
Number 2, you'll get early access to my live,
online courses that I teach.
And number 3, you'll get early access to any
free webinars or hangouts that I host, which
I'm going to start doing this year.
So to subscribe, just go to my blog: The URL
is &quot;dataschool.io&quot;, and there's a link in
the description below. Find the subscription
form on the left, fill out your name and email
address, click Subscribe, and then go to your
email and confirm your subscription. That's it.
You should do that now, because in a few days,
I'll be announcing in the email newsletter
how to enter the sticker giveaway, and I'll
only be announcing it in the newsletter.
And by the way, the Data School logo was designed
by my incredibly talented fiance, Annie Riker,
who also designed all of the food stickers
you see here on my laptop. So, I've linked
to her online shop in the description below
just in case you want to check out some more
of her really cool designs.
Okay, that is all for today! Thanks for watching.
Many more data science videos will be coming
soon, I promise. And as always, just let me
know in the comments below if you have any
questions for me. Okay? I'll see you soon!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
