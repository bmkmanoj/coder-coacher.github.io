series about the pandas library in
Python and the question for today is why
do some pandas commands and with
parentheses and other commands don't
that is a great question we need as
always an example dataset to work with
so let's import pandas as PD and then
we're going to use a dataset scraped
from the IMDB website the Internet Movie
Database
and it's just some of their top rated
movies
so we'll say movies equals P dot read
CSV because it's a comma separated value
file and we'll read directly from a URL
and it's fit dot Li slash IMDB ratings
and if you run that you will download
the data into a data frame named movies
so let's look at some example commands
and compare and contrast okay
so first we're going to use movies dot
head which um which is how we look at
the first five rows of the data frame
and you can see this is just some data
about movies that you might recognize
another command we're going to try out
is movies dot describe and just like
head it ends with parentheses and this
one uh the way described works is as
long as there's at least one numeric
column it will show you descriptive
statistics of all numeric columns which
in this case are star rating and
duration so if these are just
descriptive statistics on these two
columns
I mean median count of non null values
standard deviation etc okay so those
both have parentheses after them
you noticed now let's try some that
don't we got movies that shape and
that's a tuple that tells us there are
nine hundred and seventy-nine rows and
six columns or we can look at movies dot
d types which tells us the data types of
each of the six columns
okay so floating floating-point column
and integer column and for object
columns which basically just mean
strings okay so we've got these ones
with parentheses and these ones without
so what's the deal well this just comes
back to the fact that movies is a data
frame that is its object type and as a
data frame it has certain methods and
attributes simply because it's a data
frame the methods are like head and
described they're the ones with
parentheses and the attributes are the
ones without parentheses like shape and
D type and when thinking about methods
and attributes I um I like to think of
methods as actions action oriented and
attributes as just like descriptions
about who you are okay so if I was a
Python object Kevin some some actions
which are methods might be Kevin dot
talk with parentheses or Kevin dot eat
parentheses some attributes might be
Kevin dot age no parentheses because
it's an attribute or Kevin dot height so
that's an attribute okay so this is kind
of something you'll just have to get
used to in Python in general but with
pandas especially because most things
you're going to do will either be a data
frame method or attribute or a series
method or attribute
so if you want to see all of these
things you can do using methods or
attributes you just type movies the name
of the object hit it hit a period and
then hit the tab character and then you
can scroll up and down with your
keyboard and you'll see both methods and
attributes now unfortunately this list
doesn't actually tell us which ones of
these are methods and which are
attributes you'll just kind of have to
memorize that or try it out and see what
happens okay so a couple more things um
methods just like a pan dysfunction so
pan dysfunction is PD dot read CSV
that's not a method of an object that's
just a pan dysfunction okay because it
starts with PD but um just like read CSV
a data frame method will have
potentially required and optional
arguments so movies dot describe it
doesn't have any required arguments um
as you can see you didn't have to put
anything in the parentheses but there
are some optional arguments so for
example you can say include equals and
you pass it a list of strings and we're
just going to pass it the string object
and now it will only describe the
columns with the type object okay so for
those four columns it tells us account
of nominal values how many of those
values are unique so there's like 12
different content ratings for example
what is the top meaning most frequent
value in that column so the the
plurality I guess on the most common
content rating is are the most common
title is the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
um and the frequency of that top
so out of these 976 movies with non null
values 460 have an R rating anyway that
was just a long description of dot
describe the point there was that the
describe method just like pandas
functions have required and optional
arguments okay so as always I'm going to
end with a bonus tip your bonus tip is
that any time and this is for the
ipython slash Jupiter notebook only any
time you have a method or a function and
you want to remember what the arguments
are you just click anywhere inside the
parentheses and then you hit shift tab
if you hit shift tab once it shows you
just a brief signature and dock string
if you hit it a second time the window
gets bigger if you hit it a third time
it stays there for longer and if you hit
it a fourth time it takes up a whole
half of your screen which is super handy
if you're trying to use a function and
you need to reference it it's now a
split screen you can even change the
size of it if you want to get rid of it
just hit the X okay so again you click
anywhere in the parentheses and then you
hit shift tab one two three four times
to get a split screen but just hit it
once if you want to just see a pop-up
okay so that's it for today thanks so

panda's question or a tip that you want
to share with others please share it in
the comment section below I'll be
reading there too and we can all help
each other to learn okay thanks so much
and I will see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
