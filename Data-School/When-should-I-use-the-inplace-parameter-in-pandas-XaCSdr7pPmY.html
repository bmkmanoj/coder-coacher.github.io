series about the pandas library in
Python and the question for today is
when should I use the in-place parameter
in pandas okay so we've seen the
in-place parameter many times throughout
this video series and so I just want to
make sure that it's really clear what it
does and when you should use it okay so
as always we need an example data set
we'll first import pandas as PD and then
our data set will be a data set of UFO
reported sightings
so PD read CSV bit dot Lee slash UFO
reports okay so let's check out the
shape and we see there are 18,000 rows
and five columns and let's just check
out the head so each row represents a
UFO reported sighting okay
so first let's pretend that we don't
care about the city column we know we're
not going to use it and so we want to
just drop it from the data set we're
just going to use the drop method which
we've seen before so UFO drop and we say
city as a string and this is a column so
we say axis equals 1 and that will just
throw that head on the end okay and you
can see that when I run this the city
column is gone okay now the question is
is it actually gone and let's check the
head again and you can see that the city
column is not gone so why is the city
column still there and the reason is
that the drop method and I'm going to
hit shift tab here the drop method has
this in place parameter that is false
by default okay so in other words when
there's a method and it says in place
equals false and that's the default that
means that the operation won't affect
the underlying data by default so if I
want to make this permanent all I have
to do is add in place equals true okay
and we'll remove dyad from there when I
do that you'll see that nothing prints
out and that's usually a tip-off in
Python that something has happened in
place okay so if we check UFO dot head
again you'll see that the city column
has indeed disappeared it is actually
gone so when we did in place equals true
it it affects the underlying data and
it's gone now you might be wondering why
is in place false by default and the
answer is that it allows you to
experiment so if you're not sure you
want to do something and you just want
to see the impact without permanently
affecting the data in place is good for
in-place equals false is good for that
and you can change it proactively to in
place equals true when you are ready so
let me give you a good example of that
let's pretend we are thinking about
dropping missing values so we've got
this method drop n/a and I'm going to
hit shift tab and it has an in-place
equals false parameter okay so drop na
by default I'm going to specify it
anyway I'm going to say how equals any
will drop a row if any values in a row
are missing meaning na n okay so if I if
I just go ahead and run this
you'll see that what happens is that a
lot you can look at the index you can
see the default index is the integers
here's the index if we do that drop in a
howl equals any so you can see there are
a lot of rows now missing okay so in
fact we can say dot shape and we'll see
that without if we use drop in a howl
equals any we will lose about 16,000
rose out of 18,000 so we wanted to know
what would happen and now we know what
would happen if we did this but
thankfully because we didn't use in
place equals true nothing has been lost
so it allowed me to experiment check the
impact of using that function without
actually affecting the data permanently
now there are lots of other examples of
this we've seen lots of methods with in
place equals false by default and some
examples so we've got UFO dot rename for
renaming usually renaming columns and
you can see you if you actually scroll
down in there you'll see there's an
in-place parameter um there is UFO dot
sort values for sorting the data frame
okay and we've seen set index that's
another one that has in place an in
place argument so um it's it's it's all
over the place in pandas you just have
to look for it and it's always going to
be false by default to my knowledge okay
so um you might be thinking at this
point wait a minute I don't actually
need the in place parameter I could just
do an assignment statement instead so
let's say I said UFO equals UFO dot set
index time so ah that's another way of
saying
in place equals true so this is what
I've been doing or what I've done in a
previous video but you might think why
don't I just do this I haven't run this
so I'm going to run this line of code do
that
and let's just check out the tail okay
and you'll see the index is now time so
this did work remember I did not run
this line of code I ran this line of
code and it worked now your question
might be well what's the difference so
on the assignment statement looks like
it has the potential to create a second
copy so temporarily there's two copies
of this data frame what if it's a
gigantic data frame maybe gigabytes
large and your computer is going to run
slower as a result or the operations
going to fail that's possible whereas in
place using in place equals true makes
it sound like it will occur in place and
won't create a second copy now based on
my reading it turns out that there's no
guarantee that in place equals true is
actually more efficient than doing an
assignment statement okay so I'm going
to use in place equals true because it
might be more efficient but there's no
guarantee it will be more efficient than
the assignment statement so if you
really like the assignment statement
just go ahead and do that okay so as
always we're going to end with a bonus
and the bonus is just to show you how I
take advantage of the in-place equals
false default for exploring panda's
methods so for example if I wanted to
fill in missing values so if I did UFO
dot fill and a and then I may hit shift
tab and I'm going to hit it 1 2 3 4
times so it fills up the bottom part of
my screen here and there's this whole
thing this thing method ok and there's
this back
Phil which is be Phil and there's F Phil
four forward Phil that's what it stands
for
so maybe I'm trying to figure out
exactly how those work okay so because
in place equals false
I can experiment and I don't have to
worry about screwing things up so if I
said method equals B Phil I could say
dot tail and then in a different cell I
say you fo got Phil and a method equals
F Phil tail okay so in each of these two
cases because in place equals false it
didn't affect the underlying data and I
can figure out okay which one did the
thing I want if either of them turns out
backfilled four and forward Phil are
much more useful for time series data
than anything else so it's not really
appropriate here but it's a good way to
explore without any danger of affecting
the underlying data frame okay so that's
it for today as always please click
