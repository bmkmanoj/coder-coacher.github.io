up tutorials and in this what is
Wednesday I'm going to be covering
webpack so I'm gonna be talking about
what is webpack why might you use it why
it's a little confusing sometimes
understand what it is or how you'd use
it or maybe even some of the syntax or
some of the code involved so we're gonna
be talking all about webpack and what it
can do for you
okay so in this what is Wednesday I'm
gonna be talking about webpack what is
web pack and this one is a good one for
this type of video because honestly what
is wetback bundle your styles bundle
your assets
modules and dependency static assets all
okay up front here yeah this makes sense
we have a little bit of an image giving
us a hint to sort of what this does it
takes a bunch of files that are
connected in some way we have sass files
and JavaScript in images it runs them
through this cube which you're assuming
is webpack and spits them out as well
just standard JavaScript CSS Bing and
JPEG you know stuff the browser
recognizes and so this might seem like
kind of interesting right we're taking
all this stuff for running it through
something and we're getting this stuff
out and to me that screams build process
and you know when web pack came out and
people were talking about it there was
such a rush to call it like a module
loader and all sorts of stuff but not a
build process because it's it's
different than a build process well in
my 100% understanding of web bag it's a
build process if you come from grunt or
gulp it's essentially doing the same
kind of things it's taking your files
it's running them through some sort of
conversion and it's spitting them out
into something the browser can
understand if you've used gulp or grunt
you remember that you could add in
something like a sass package to pipe
into your gulp and it spits out CSS and
web pack is very very similar to that
it's going
to do that in fact there isn't really an
instance in which you would want to use
gulp with webpack or grunt with webpack
unless you had a gulp a build process
already in place that you didn't want to
leave so the reality of it is is it
takes the place of something like that
now I should mention when I'm talking
about some of these features within this
video I am NOT meaning to say in any
sort of way that gulp or grunt can't do
some of these things in fact this is
just going to be about what webpack can
do specifically so if you scroll down
you'll see we get a little bit more
information right you write your code
well we have app dodges we have bar dot
J s and we have a WebP a config file and
we have an HTML page and well what
happens here well we run this web pack
config we we run web pack essentially
and it's going to use our JavaScript
files and it's going to be able to
import and export and do all that great
stuff to keep your JavaScript modular if
you've worked in any sort of modern
JavaScript environment for application
development it's extremely common and
definitely if you've worked in you know
create react app like we do in the react
16 for every one course small plug their
head over to low level up to Torrez comm
you can become a pro or purchase this
series sorry about that small plug had
to do it but what this is here is we're
splitting up our JavaScript into many
different files and because of that we
can import them and we can export them
and we can organize our code in a way
where well things are no longer global
if you had a giant JavaScript file or
several giant JavaScript files then
you'll run into things like namespace
collision where you have two variables
that are named something and when you're
working with modules you'll never have
to worry about that because if I import
poster from movie then this is what
poster is right but if I defined poster
in another file somewhere else it's not
gonna have any effect on this file in
particular because I'm importing it
directly from here and
things very explicit and if you're
working in any sort of any sort of
JavaScript web application write angular
react view any of this stuff this
modularity becomes so extremely
important you don't want a bunch of
global stuff sitting around your files
because that's just going to lead to a
complete disaster very quickly
so what web pack does this allows you to
use this sort of importing and
modularity and modular system and that's
not really just it because it allows you
to plug in different things right so in
addition to handling our JavaScript
modules it also handles well conversion
from es next to current version of
JavaScript that works in the browser
using Babel and so by using things like
web pack with something like babel with
something like sass with something like
autoprefixer basically allows you to
write this code in a way that makes
everything nice and organized module all
that good stuff and it builds your code
into something that the browser can read
again coming back to this thing if you
think about a web pack is really just a
build process and it's an advanced build
process at that and there's a lot of
advanced features there like things like
dead code elimination right it can find
code that you're not actually using or
maybe it can bundle up smaller modules
of JavaScript so you're not serving your
entire application to every single user
that just visits your homepage right and
so web pack is is great for these super
advanced features because well it has so
much flexibility in configuration now
the problem is is when we get into
config files they can look like a total
well I don't know in my opinion it's
difficult to parse this in fact is the
config file that comes with the create
react app after you eject from create
react app now that said this config file
is definitely a bit more crazy than some
others but as you can see here the
syntax is by no means as concise and
nice is something like gulp where you're
just writing a function
you can keep track of everything and in
my opinion it's filled with a bunch of
jargony terms like a loader and module
and rules and and all sorts of stuff
that well it doesn't lend itself to
being super easy to pick up I mean for
instance look at this config file that
is output as the dev config file for
create react app this thing is so
intense that they have to have multiple
line paragraphs of comments sort of
explaining what each of these things
does I mean look at this there's three
lines here and so in my opinion the best
way to work with something like web pack
isn't to always write your own config
files from scratch or but to look for
config files that do what you want them
to do and borrow them or if you have the
ability to just work in a system that up
that obfuscates the web pack config
itself like something like next is or
gatsby both are using webpack as their
build process but you don't have to
visit those files if you don't want to
because they're already taken care of
for you in fact one of the reasons why I
like meteor so much is because you don't
really ever have to touch a build
process config file despite it not using
webpack itself so so and that's not to
say that web packs syntax is unreadable
or anything like that if you take the
time you can learn all of the ins and
outs of web pack pretty pretty
significantly that said yeah look at
this yikes so if you want to learn Lepik
I mean they're they're Doc's are great
so if you head to web pages org you
looked at their getting started they do
a basic set up where yeah we create a
basic JavaScript file we create a basic
HTML file and then we learn about adding
bundles and adding packages and stuff
like that and you start to write your
own web pack configuration see how this
first web pack config dot J's file this
right here is way way way way way
infinitely nicer to read then the one
that's going on here that said this is
doing a lot more so what you
have here is you have yep you're
bringing in path which is a note package
and we are exporting well the entry to
our app which is at index J s and we're
going to output bundle J s and we're not
really doing anything else at that point
well it's just going to work for us all
we're doing in this javascript file is
simply importing lo - I believe scroll
up top here yeah all we're doing is
really importing lo - into this file and
that's it so what web pack is going to
do is it's going to use that NPM package
lo - and it's going to import it allow
us to use this import/export syntax so
at the end of the day is web pack worth
it absolutely web pack is worth it it's
the best build system around even if you
don't want to call it a build tool or
build system it does all of this - very
excellently but it handles modern j/s
applications in a way that you couldn't
necessarily do before with all of the
modern bells and whistles that said
given the opportunity if I had to choose
between not writing web pack config and
writing a web pack config I would always
choose not writing a web pack config so
using something like next or deaths B or
whatever and maybe you want to just
borrow some web pack configs so well
maybe you'll just want to head over to
Google and start googling like react
application web pack and fig and start
copying and pasting instead of
necessarily starting from scratch
although it is a great thing to sort of
learn this there is a lot here and most
of it is worth your time for instance
lazy loading and code splitting and tree
shaking and hot module replacement and
all that great stuff is something that
is going to make your application better
and your development experience better
so like I said you will want to spend
the time to learn web packing and get
this going if you plan on writing your
own script if you're happy with systems
like next or Gatsby that will save you
the headache of having to write this
stuff yourself or you can always just
head to google and grab some config that
adds the stuff that you want
to use maybe that sass or autoprefixer
or whatever so at the end of the day web
pack is something that simply just
collects your JavaScript modules and
when I say module I mean a file that's
imported somewhere and exported
somewhere else right is a contained file
a containment module again these like
syntactical things sort of get in the
way sometimes you see it it's a module
Bunder not a build system like okay I
get it but what it's doing is its
collecting your files it's converting
them into something the browser can
understand and it's spitting them out
into actual files so I hope that made
sense and I hope you have a better
understanding about what the heck web
pack is and maybe have it not be so
confusing in the future because it's
definitely one of those things that's
easy to look at and just go okay if you
just not know what to do next so this is
the second iteration of what is
Wednesday as someone mentioned before
you tubers keeping schedules are
difficult and I totally understand I
fully intend on continuing this week
after week after week so let me know
what things you want to hear about I
already got a ton of amazing suggestions
from the first video and I'm hopefully
going to keep plowing through these
until we have covered everything there's
possibly is to know about what the heck
is this thing and how we can learn it in
a more basic way because of all the
stuff web dev stuff can be often filled
with tons and tons of jargon okay so if
you found that this to be excellent and
you would like to see more level up
tutorials the react 16 for everyone
course was just released and covers get
this a web pack less configuration
because it's using create react app now
that said you can eject from create
wracked up and have access to these
lovely web pack config files if you'd
like but they're there nonetheless right
so if you like this you head over to
level up tutorials calm for it slash
store it's the react 16 for everyone or
you can become a level up pro and get a
new premium tutorial series every
new month for instance this one that
just came out for October was react 16
for everyone
November's premium tutorial series is
going to be modern CSS layouts where I
cover not only CSS grid and flexbox but
all these modern CSS properties that
work together to help you build
excellent excellent
modern layouts it's going to be an
excellent course and I'm really super
excited about it so head on over to
level up to Torrez comm forward slash
Pro and subscribe today that wouldn't
make me SuperDuper happy and help fund
and fuel videos like this one itself so
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
