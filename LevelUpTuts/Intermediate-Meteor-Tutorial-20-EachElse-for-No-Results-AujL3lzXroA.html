tutorials in this video we'll be showing
you how we can handle our menu when
there are no items added to the menu
itself we're also going to be cleaning
up a bunch of the code and refining some
the HTML building out some new templates
and just improving the app overall so
let's get started right now so in the
last video we created this menu template
and we just said essentially iterated
over our recipes and we just output a
name and description let's go ahead and
take this into a little bit more of a
modular approach and let's turn this
into a menu item template here so we can
say template and the name can be menu
item now I very frequently have a one
template / file sort of rule however
this isn't necessarily that big of a
case in fact we might not even need an
extra template here but it's always nice
to make extra templates so that way you
have things broken out and two smaller
little bits we can now say div dot menu
item if you're using Emmet that will
autocomplete when you hit tab if not
it's just a menu item class on a div now
what we can do is take our name and
description from before and we can paste
that in here now inside of here we can
say each recipes and with this wknd pass
in the menu item template like so now
let's check this out if we come to our
page your tattoo our menu we should not
see a better-looking menu this is my
current menu and we have our main item
cards with a name like so and you can
see it fits the styling a little bit
more like the recipe book itself now
let's go ahead and remove both of these
items from the menu peps are going to
remove this from the menu and to remove
this from the menu its head back to our
menu and what we have is a blank menu
now ideally what we would want if
there's no items in this array here we
would want this to actually be
outputting some sort of text letting you
know that there's no items available so
luckily we can do that really super
easily off of this each statement let's
it back to our sublime text and you'll
see we wrap this each up with a forward
slash each well if we come in here you
can actually use something that you
might be used to with an if statement
you can use an else now this is awesome
because it now says if there's no
recipes do something else here now
easily what we can do here is just add
so let's say like an h3 and this can
just say please add recipes to your menu
and we can even have like let's say a
link here so let's add a link to the
recipe book page that way it can link
your user back to their own recipe page
so we can say recipe book like so okay
so let's check this out so now once
meteors live reload sort of happens now
keep in mind we'd maybe you want to have
some sort of styling on this it looks
fine it just doesn't look perfect but
please add recipes to your menu we can
come here and add to menu add to menu
head back and here they are and notice
how that else text doesn't show up so
this is a nice little way for us to have
some alternate text here if there's no
listings so in additional let's actually
clean up something on a recipe book we
had these buttons and what we were doing
was removing the button itself with a
class well in the last video we actually
made a helper on our recipe book page so
if we come to recipe HTML you remember
we use this if in menu to actually hydra
display this in menu class
we were doing some hiding and displaying
with classes on the btn-primary BTN
denied and that's obviously not going to
work in a larger sort of situation let's
go ahead and head to our stylist code
I'm just going to do find and we can do
BTN and let's look for where we have
those being hidden here so that's right
here I can just simply have you both of
them set to display block in this
instance so we can say comma here this
is line 3 17 and we can say delete
hiding BTN display none and likewise we
can delete in menu these ones as well
that's going to remove some of these
sort of default classes even though they
are within this recipe class it's going
to delete us from having to deal with
any sort of issues of adding buttons to
this any wear down the future so you'll
notice they're both showing up now okay
perfect because what we can do once
again on recipe HTML is we can use this
if in menu and if the current recipe is
in the menu then we're going to want to
show this remove for menu button
likewise else we're going to want to
show the button that adds to our menu so
if it's not in the menu show the button
that adds to the menu and then we can
rips all off with a forward slash if
perfect so this is now going to show and
hide the buttons correctly just like we
wanted and we're having to mess with any
CSS classes here perfect this is all
working really well and it's looking
really great in the next video we're
going to go ahead and we're going to
handle our shopping list page which
currently does not exist so as always
