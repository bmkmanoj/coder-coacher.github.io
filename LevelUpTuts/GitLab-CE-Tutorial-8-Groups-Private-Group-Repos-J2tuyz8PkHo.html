of tutorials and endless fear gonna be
showing you groups in gitlab where we
can create a group and have a private
repo within that group all of the users
were associated with that group will
have access in the outside world will
not so let's get going on that now so
we've gone over a bit about user
management permissions but we haven't
talked about teams yet now teams are
essentially just groups within gitlab so
if we head to our side here when we
select groups you'll be able to see that
we don't have any groups currently
created now as an admin I'm able to
create a group so let's go ahead and do
that we can have this just be level up
okay and this can be level up
contributors okay now we could even have
an avatar now for visibility level we
have a private internal in public so
this is actually not just a group itself
but a group and the group's projects so
if the group is private the group itself
and its projects can only be viewed by
its members of its internal the group
and any internal projects can be viewed
by any logged in users and if it's
public it's just totally anonymous
anybody who has the address can see it
now private groups are a great thing
because what you can do is have repos
that various people only have access to
if they have a certain role in the group
so let's go ahead and set this up as a
private group let's click create group
ok now that we have our group let's go
ahead and you can see we have some
projects so now from our group let's go
ahead and actually create a project we
just go ahead and select new project and
we can just have this be store and let's
just have this be all private ok so now
that we create our project here you can
see that we have this project and it's
not going to be available to anyone
outside of this group so if you were a
user let's go ahead and actually we have
this project level up store and if we
actually click on this URL path here you
can see it shows up here and if we
wanted to have another user let's go to
our admin
where we had another user Courtney we
can say let's impersonate Courtney and
now we want to go ahead and see projects
I mean we can click projects and all you
can see is that we have the
administrator test and the Courtney test
project which is public now we don't
have access to any of this group stuff
I'm not a member of any of these groups
and because of that we're not going to
have access to any of those projects but
the moment that Courtney gets added to
the group so let's go ahead and remove
that and I'm no longer personating her
so let's go ahead and enter to the group
we can go ahead it from the admin
section you should look like this we can
click groups and now you can see our
level up now let's go ahead and click
level up here and you'll notice from the
administrative section of this we can
now click Add users to group we can even
search for a user here since obviously
we don't have that many we can just
select Courtney and then click Add users
to group now Courtney should be in this
group and when we click her we'll have
access to impersonate her again so we
can do that and now while impersonating
Courtney you can now see she has access
to all of the level ups store projects
here so perfect I've created a group and
I have projects that are in that group
and because of that anyone who is a
member of that group now has access and
as an administrator you can move and
around and add people to the group as
you see fit cool so I'm gonna click this
red guy stop impersonating her and now
we have a group we have a project in a
group and we have a member that's been
added to that group and we're able to
define permissions based on who's in the
group so as always this is Scott with
