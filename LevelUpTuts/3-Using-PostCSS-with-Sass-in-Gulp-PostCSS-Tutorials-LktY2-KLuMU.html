love tutorials and in this video we're
gonna show you how you can add pose to
CSS to your sass workflow using gulp now
this is super easy and it's not gonna
take any time at all so let's get
started right now so for this video
we're gonna be using gulp sass now gulp
sass is a sass plugin for gulp that is
using it node sass which is a node
wrapper around libsass which is a
version of sass that is not written in
Ruby but written in C now if that all
sounds ridiculous it's kind of because
it is but it works really well and it
plays really nicely with node based
anything so it fits really nicely into
your curtain call workflow so let's go
ahead and install this plugin just with
the NPM go Python sass we can do that in
our terminal p.m. install gulp - says
save dev added to our package file here
and we're gonna get post CSS in our
project and as you can see it's
installing some dependencies and it says
it's just going to take one second ok
great so we now have this gulps s
installed let's go ahead and add it to
our gulp file like we do for everything
now the easiest way to do this is simply
just to add it at the top here sass
require sass and now we can really just
pipe in in this pipe and we don't have
to use any of the other features right
now since we're not exactly highlighting
the sass features for this but what we
can do is say s CSS files particularly a
style dot s CSS and in addition we're
going to change this to s CSS instead of
watching CSS files now I can go ahead
and rename my Styles dot CSS to Styles
dot s CSS and we could save that now if
everything should be fine we should be
easily using a sass with post CSS so
what its first going to do is run
through and compile our sass it's gonna
take care of anything like the nested
CSS or anything like that and it's going
to output
ESS it's then going to run that through
the post CSS processors since the only
one we have right now is the CSS ring
it's it's just going to minify it and
there you might be thinking well I can
do compression and minification without
post CSS but there's actually a ton of
other these processors that we're going
to go over in addition this one is
really just to show that everything is
up and running right now so now let's
change this background from red to blue
now we can go ahead and run that command
just by gulp styles and it should
compile even though it's giving me some
weird message about the semicolon being
deprecated it's still ran and compiled
so if we check out our Styles that see
as you'll see that we did in fact have
this body background is now equal to
blue and of course if we were to be
running this as the watch command it
would be changing this every single time
that we modified this style CSS so there
we have it we now have a gulp taking in
the styles s CSS file
it's then running it through the sass
processor and then running it through
the post CSS processor it's in the next
video we're going to show you how you
could do this exact same thing using
stylus so if you use stylus it's just as
easy to get up and running with that
after that we're sort of done with these
preparation videos we're showing you
sort of process and then after that
we're going to get into some of the
great and amazing post CSS packages
starting with autoprefixer so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
you have any questions or comments leave
a comment the video artists up at level
up Tut's we love to hear from you thanks
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
