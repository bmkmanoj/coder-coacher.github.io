up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be installing a theme in Drupal 8
now there are a lot of themes out there
so if you don't like the one we install
here install a different one it's really
nice and easy and a big improvement in
Drupal 8 so let's get started so now we
have some content we know how to add and
manage our users we know how to add and
manage our contact form we need to we
know how to use our menus let's go ahead
and make this site look a little bit
better by looking for some themes
if we click download and extend from
drupal.org we can head to the themes tab
now a lot of these themes are going to
be sort of development and parent themes
we will just use a sort of standard
looking theme so I'm going to go core
compatibility and click 8x since we're
on Drupal 8 this is important for
anything that you're looking to install
we're going to now scroll down and the
one I'm looking for is down here a
little bit but it's nice and clean it is
called clean blog nice and easy let's
actually head to our site and let's
click on appearance now if we want to
install a new theme we can click install
new theme right here now just like we
installed modules you can actually paste
the path in like so so let's come to our
theme page let's right-click on the
development version of this clean blog
you can find a theme that you like for
yourself now this isn't the only place
you can find themes if you google around
for Drupal 8 themes you'll find some
more you'll even find some premium ones
on paid sites that have some nice extra
features let's go ahead and just click
copy link address this is a nice clean
and easy one that's instantly going to
make our Drupal site look less bad
because let's face it the Bartik theme
that comes with Drupal is not and has
never been great so let's go ahead and
paste this path in here just like we did
when we install the module and let's
click install it's now installed let's
head back to the theme page here and as
you can see we have Bartek 8.2 and we
have seven which is the admin theme but
if you see we have bootstrap now you'll
notice
something really interesting a lot of
themes occasionally have a base theme
required so this theme is requires the
base theme of bootstrap to operate
correctly okay let's actually click
install a new theme once more let's head
back to the theme projects and let's
scroll up until we find the bootstrap
theme so let's keep going up we barrio
bootstrap rainbow open Church let's keep
scrolling up because bootstrap is pretty
high at the top here and let's keep
going and there it is bootstrap here we
have bootstrap 3 for drupal let's go
ahead and click tar.gz and let's copy
this link address right here where this
current video is the 3.0 - beta - lets
click install new theme paste this in
here once more and after this installs
we should be ready to use our new themes
ok let's go install newly added themes
alright and let's kind of and we now see
that we have Drupal 3 and we now have
bootstrap clean block what we want to do
is click this install and set as default
this is going to do two things it's
going to enable the theme and it's going
to make it the theme that anyone sees
when they're in the front of our website
you'll notice the administrative section
of our site is still in this 7 theme
considering this is not Bartek so let's
come to the front of our site let's
click back to site and you can now see
the site is been totally transformed it
looks completely different in fact if we
hide this administrative toolbar or
let's actually go ahead and just open
this up in an incognito window here so I
can see this without any sort of admin
menu you can see this looks very far
from the base Drupal theme and if we
click level up you can see we have our
posts they're coming in as a nice blog
posts so this is using bootstrap if you
want to get in here to the CSS and edit
it you can our tags show up fine we have
some nice stuff and the footer has all
of these social links in here so we can
now from here click about us and see
what a page looks like
we have our headline we have our page we
have our content here and our contact
form which we just saw so by no means is
this perfect you might not want this
photo of horses on here in fact if you
wanted to get rid of this photo of
horses on here you'd want to click
pearance come to our theme and click
settings and you can see we have buttons
where we can change the type of button
size we can change what type of buttons
containers we can give them a fluid
container for forms we can change some
things with images so you have
responsive images or a default image
shape we have some tables settings where
you can make them bordered or not
bordered condensed so there's a lot of
nice little things and you'll see if you
keep scrolling down site header and now
for this site header for not to be this
default image you want to actually
select the field for the particular type
of content for instance we have this
image field and you would want this
image field now to be used as the site
header now it's a word of warning here
let's come to our page and actually
check this out I'm going to click back
to site here you can see we still have
this horse photo for our contact form if
we go home you can see we also still
have this horse photo but if we come to
our my edited post you'll see we have
this giant Shia LaBeouf photo so
choosing the photo from our post as the
main heading post and if our page or our
piece of content doesn't have a photo
it's using this sort of default horse
thing get rid of this photo or to change
the default photo you were gonna want to
replace that image that's in the theme
itself now since this video in this
tutorial isn't on earth isn't a tutorial
on covering all of the deep down
features of this theme I'm not going to
be showing you that however there are
tons of Drupal 8 themes so keep looking
until you find the one you like you can
install it through the same process and
the settings are always going to be in
appearance and your particular themes
settings many themes will have settings
and many themes won't have set
some will have more than others and some
will have a lot more advanced features
so check out let me know if you find any
themes that you really like as always
