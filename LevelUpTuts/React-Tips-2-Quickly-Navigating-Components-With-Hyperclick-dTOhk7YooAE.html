different compared to the last one last
one was a little bit code based this one
is going to be a little bit more based
in your tools now when working in react
you find yourself making a ton of
components in fact that's often really
nice if you have a lot of components
going that way you have a lot of
reusability things are broken up
separation of concerns that sort of
thing so it's often a pain to jump
between your components right like if I
wanted to go to this next page component
I could you know hit command T next page
or look forward and you'll actually
notice that this next page component
isn't located in a file next page it's
located as a sub of this so just by
searching for next page it's not even
going to find it and that's not a total
common occurrence for instance this
artist card you know if I searched for
artists card it would find it so what's
a good way that you can navigate through
your components well i'm using Adam
although I know for a fact that this
plugin is in fact available for sublime
text and i would have to imagine it's
available for most IDEs although i
cannot be a hundred percent positive but
what you want to look is for something
that is called hyper click if we go to
packages we can type in hyper and you'll
see hyper click now i also have jas
hyper click but all we really need to
know is that hyper click here is a
really sweet package but basically what
it does is you can see we have trigger
keys for linux mac and windows and mac
it's just command and click so what does
this allow us to do actually well if we
come back to that page that we are on it
was this a select artist page if I were
hold down my command key and highlight
over
ponent lets for instance this next page
you'll notice there's an underlying on
it now so when I hope command click next
page it takes me to wear that's loaded
from you'll notice this is loaded from a
whole nother uh you'll notice that this
page loads essentially a whole bunch of
stuff so that I could then hold command
again and then click next page from here
and that's going to take me to the
correct file now in any sort of instance
where you just have a component / file
if I just hold command click this it's
going to take me right there and it's
typically faster than this i think
screen recordings slowing my computer
down right now but this hyper click is
is what i found to be the absolute best
way to navigate through components
especially if you're using a lightweight
editor like adam or sublime instead of
doing command T and then having to type
whatever you have your component right
here you can just come and click on it
takes you right there to it cool so plus
one for a hyper click it is one of the
most necessary packages I found myself
using all the time in react so just a
little react tip there use a hyper click
to easily navigate through your
components really helps when you have a
large project thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one as always this is Scott would level
up to Torrez if you have any questions
or comments leave a comment the video
hit me up at twitter or facebook also
let me know what you think of these
short little react tips that sort of
stuff i'm recording as i go that i just
find to be useful sort of scattered not
necessarily totally planned so let me
know if that's useful to you or not
either way a lot more content coming
very soon there's an intermediate
reactant meteor series on the way a lot
of new sketch content and just a whole
bunch of new stuff so thanks very much
for watching and I'll see the next one
