Tut's and today we're going to be doing
more work with our custom content type
so first off I wanted to add an image
field to our custom content type so to
get back to there we're going to go to
content types
if you remember last time I added it to
my shortcuts if you didn't add it to
your shortcuts it's under structure
click content types and you'll see
projects we're going to click manage
fields in here we're just going to
actually there's only an image field
being used for the articles so we're
going to use an existing field so image
field image you'll notice the widget is
selected to image and we're going to
call this project image cool and this is
actually going to be the very first
thing displayed on the page it doesn't
really matter this doesn't have to do
with the display but I kind of want
actually let's say I'm changing my mind
right now I'm gonna put a below project
type I'm going to save this okay and
this is the the settings for the field
so the allowed field extensions we're
going to allow pings gifs jpegs whatever
maximum I don't really care about this
I'm going to be the one uploading all
the content so it doesn't really matter
um you know you could put maximum
minimums whatever just to you know
adjust who's who's uploading what and
what they can upload you can also say
okay I want the preview to be a thumb uh
a thumbnail medium or large we're going
to keep this thumbnail because we don't
want a huge giant picture in our preview
of course well for this we're going to
add actually say unlimited this allows
us to upload as many photos as we want
in my project if I want to have a whole
string of photos and talk about them I
want to be able to do that so we'll just
we'll have this set as unlimited and the
upload destination is our public files
folder okay and we do not want a default
image for now because I plan on
uploading an image every time however if
you don't you might want to to create
some sort of a default image so we'll
click save settings ok and now our
project image is a part of our
content-type let's go back to our
previous piece of content that we
created I'm clicking find content up
here and I'll take you okay you can see
my first project will click Edit okay so
I'm just going to use a screen shot that
I uploaded or that I took before to use
as an image because you know I don't
really have the images saved right now
so we'll click this upload you can see
it's right here some reason our
thumbnail is going to turn up I'll have
to investigate that later but otherwise
it's looking pretty good so let's click
Save and it's been saved
let's click the title to take us to that
and you can see here is our giant image
okay and here's label project type body
text okay well let's say we want to
change the order of this and we don't
want this image to be so gigantic let's
go back to content types and then let's
go to our project and then manage
display okay here is going to give you
all sorts of options this is the order
in which they display we want the image
to be first of course the title is going
to be very first but we want the image
to be first then we want the body text
and then we want the tags also for the
tags I don't want a label I want that to
be hidden as well for the image I don't
want that to be displayed so if you see
there is this label column you can
select in line above hidden on selecting
those two hidden and then format image
default link but also if you notice to
your to the right there's a gear here
with the image and it says original
image so that's the what it's displaying
as so if we go to image style there's
going to be several options we're going
to use medium for now in a later video
I'll show you how to edit these videos
through these image styles so that you
can make your own that are perfectly
tailored to what you need them to do and
then you can select if you want the link
the image to anything you know I don't
want this image to be linked to anything
right now so we'll click update okay as
you can see and their style is now set
to medium well let's say what if you
didn't actually want the project type to
be shown at all you can actually drag
this down here to say hidden and now the
format is set to hidden you could as
well you could have also select
that here to say hidden and it would
have taken it down here for you okay
well we're just going to go save this
out okay now if we click back to our our
note here are our content type you can
see our our first project piece of
content has its title then the image and
then the body text and no tags okay well
that's it for this lesson in the next
one we're going to be going over some
more display things we're going to be
going over menus we're going to be going
over things like blocks all sorts of
stuff so if you have any questions as
always feel free to leave a comment or
