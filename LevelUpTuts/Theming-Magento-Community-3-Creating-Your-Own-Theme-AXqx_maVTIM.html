up tux and today we're going to do our
third video on theming and Magento and
we're going to create our own theme and
it's going to be the first time we've
ever done that so it's really exciting
and it's something that once you learn
how to create your own theme you know
you could pretty much do anything you
want Magento you can have it look all
sorts of ways in fact and actually
before we get started I just want to
share a site that I found this past week
I was shared through Twitter and skinny
ties calm I actually was just really
blown away about how awesome this site
is it's really nicely responsive too so
when you adjust the menu here this menu
always sort of adjust to this thing
turns into a slideshow is too beautiful
site and really well done
and I was pleasantly surprised to see it
was built with Magento so just just goes
to show you just how amazing you can
make your site look with great CSS and
changing the layouts and everything so
check this site out in skinny ties calm
I got no affiliation with them just
thought the other day I thought it was
cool so that said that's something to
aspire to and let's get into building a
theme so the thing that we need to build
a theme is we really just need to have a
few files and directories first so let's
get started with this and let's check
out see what some of these other ones
have they have you'll notice a CSS
folder maybe a favicon and images folder
these images are only pertaining to the
theme by the way they're not going to be
product images or anything so these sort
of all have some different things but
most of them have images and CSS and
probably a JavaScript let's go in here
and by the way the folder structure I
met is this is the root of our product
our project we have skin and then we're
going to go to front-end and then right
in here
we're going to create a new folder and
this is going to be the name of your
theme so ours is going to be a level up
to keep it consistent with everything
I'm going to click into level up here
and the first thing if you remember this
is our theme package okay the name of
our theme package is level up now we
need to create
our themed instance right this is this
base theme and if you remember we said
we wanted to have a theme that was
called default within our theme package
so let's make our theme named default
now
okay so default is next and inside of
default you're going to want a couple of
folders you're going to want a CSS
folder you're also probably gonna want a
JavaScript folder and an images folder
okay so we don't need anything in those
those are just folders are going to have
once we create our CSS file we can throw
it in here and it's this is where it's
going to read it from and also we need
to create our theme in app design front
end and then here we're also going to
create a new folder name it the same
thing so you want your theme package to
be the exact same and then inside of
here we need another default so this
file structure so far to mix the other
one however instead of default we need
two different things
we need a layout folder and we need a
template folder now these will all make
sense a little bit more once we get into
what you're going to be doing inside of
these folders but this is really all you
need to get a theme going so we now have
our theme file structure created let's
go actually go back over here let's go
to level up okay so we now have a theme
so at this point we're going to want to
disable the system cache for our website
if we're going to be changing a lot of
these files we don't have to be clearing
the cache all the time first site so
let's go to the admin panel and then
let's go to system and then we're going
to do cache management which is right
down here okay we're going to go here
and we're going to select all of these
and we're going to tell it to disable
we're just going to disable all of these
caches because this set is an in
production right now nobody's visiting
it caching the site is really just going
to make it run faster so we might as
well disable all this stuff right now
we're develop
then we don't have to worry about
flushing the cash or anything so now
let's go and apply our new theme so
let's go to system have been
configuration like we went to before and
if you remember we went to design inside
of design here we had our blue skin
applied and if you remember we made our
package our theme package we named it
level up so whatever you named yours
name it here
ours is level up and that's really all
you need to do I'm going to get rid of
this blue because we don't have a theme
variant or anything that has named blue
we're not using any different templates
the default everything's going to be the
same so really we just want our current
package name in here and run a click
Save so now let's check out what our
site looks like I'm going to go refresh
it so I this is not it refresh it and
there's nothing it's not using anything
well it is using basically the base
layout files which without those you
wouldn't see anything so the base layout
PHP files and XML files
we're still getting however it's
completely unstyled which is great if
you are a CSS person you really like CSS
and things the from here you can take it
from here if you don't need to change
the layout too much and you can get your
site looking like whatever you need it
to however if you need to get into
changing a little bit more we're going
to go into all of that stuff but here we
have a nice blank Magento theme and real
quick
let's actually show you in fact that
this is really working and we're going
to create a CSS file so I'm going to
open up sublime text here I'm going to
actually throw this whole this whole
theme right here default whatever I'm
going to throw this into sublime text
you're using a different app whatever
this is just how I'm doing it in sublime
text here so we have our project and CSS
I'm going to click here and create a new
file and I'm going to save this and the
name of this file is going to be Styles
dots
the SS this is the file name that
Magento is going to be looking for so if
we're using something like sass like you
may have seen some of the other sass
tutorials that we've done you could do
Styles s CSS and have it compiled to
styles.css but for this just going to
keep it simple I'm going to name it
style.css and when I click Save here I'm
just going to do body and then we're
going to do background color and we'll
have this be the level of Tut's purple
so that color is right here okay
this and of course you can have yours be
whatever you'd like so let's go back to
our page let's refresh it and we now see
that our site is the level up tuts
purple and we're well on our way to
having our own theme so in the next
lesson we're going to be going over even
more controlling layouts controlling
skins we're going to start building more
of our skin out what I do all sorts of
cool stuff and you're going to really
get the hang of what what theming and
magenta is all about okay so as always
if you have any questions or comments
please leave a comment the video hit us
up at Twitter LevelUp Tut's this is
enough to get you working and starting
your base theme CSS the crap out of it
if you don't know CSS level up head
level up tux has CSS tutorials and css3
tutorials you can get some good looking
stuff going from the very basics to
advanced stuff you'll really know how to
you know build out a whole site and
since you already have the HTML output
here through the PHP you're all good and
you really have to start styling okay so
if you have any questions hit us up at
Twitter as always thanks for watching
