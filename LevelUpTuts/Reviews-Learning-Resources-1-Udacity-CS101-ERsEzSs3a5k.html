tuts and today I thought we'd try
something a little bit new this is a
series that we've been sort of
brainstorming for a little bit about how
we can review different things that we
found and so this is a a new playlist
that we're going to call level up
reviews and we're going to review
various things from websites not based
on there we're not like reviewing their
design or whatever going to review some
learning tools really so uh and also
different books of course that have come
out and we've read that we really enjoy
want to sort of spread the word about so
the first thing I have the pleasure of
reviewing is Udacity and Udacity is a
great learning website where you can
take college-level courses for free on
their site and various topics and you
can have incredible teachers you know
professors at Stanford or people that
work at Google that you know the
creators of Reddit there's all sorts of
really great teachers and there's a ton
to learn here so if we go to udacity.com
you can scroll down and you can see they
have an intro to computer science intro
to physics intro to statistics and those
are sort of their 101 courses and then
after that they web development
programming languages software to
bugging differential equations it goes
all the way into applied cryptography
and programming a robotic car so these
aren't really tutorials but these are
college level classes and jumping into
the more difficult ones would not be
recommended without first completing you
know a college-level computer science
course of something of that nature to
get you into you know the skill set to
be able to even think about finishing
this programming a robotic higher class
but either right let's check out their
full catalog basically they have them in
the order of beginning classes
intermediate courses and advanced
courses I'm personally enrolled in three
of these courses I've been taking the
intro to computer science intro to
statistics and this new one that they
just launched last month this is how to
build a start up the lean launchpad
and so far I've had nothing but great
results with Udacity as long as you're
have the drive to stick with it I'm
going to switch over to my page where I
have an account here they they're even
posting even today which is october
eight this course has been over i think
for about a year now from when it
originally lodged actually i wish i had
i wish i had the announcement for 10 / i
honestly maybe i'm just guessing by
saying a year but uh they're still
adding new content here they've added
two additional units for chapters 2 and
3 some extra problem sets so you can you
know test out your skills even more so
just to give a brief introduction I'm
going to be talking about the intro to
computer science course i'll be
reviewing these other courses separately
as i complete them and i'll let you know
my thoughts on them so this intro to
computer science if you click on the
course here this is sort of what you're
this is what your course looks like so
I'm going to pause this and as you can
see I haven't even finished this course
yet i'm on unit 6 here which is nearing
the end but there's all sorts of problem
sets for six unit seven and then here's
the exam exam part two and an optional
unit eight if you'd like but there are a
lot of courses here each one of these
little chapters you would call them or
maybe is is a sort of a lesson it
teaches you a little bit and a lot of
times there's questions so for this
course the questions rage from anything
that's just asking you a question that
you can type in an answer or like choose
you know from a select list or something
but many of them are coding questions
that are very difficult and the thing I
really applaud about this this class is
that some of the problems will take you
hours to do I've had a couple so maybe
some of the harder ones that aren't
totally obvious that I you know I had
trouble with it I would stick with for
like an hour before finding the right
solution other people who have taken a
college-level computer science course
might be able to breeze through these
because but I personally have never
taken any college level computer science
so I found this this course so far to be
just really really exciting because one
of how challenging it is and to just the
wealth of information here and it's free
you have a great teacher for you know
you don't have to pay anything for it
also it teaches Python which is a
language I'm very fond of after doing
this course in fact this was my first
experience with Python was this course
when I started it I think a couple of
months ago and then I've just grown to
love Python so much for in this course
because it really enables you to do so
much so I'd recommend at this Udacity
cs101 course if you have any interest in
a learning computer science it starts at
the basics but it gets pretty pretty
tough and a lot of the problems are a
little bit more conceptual than just
here's here's the output do this it's
really requiring you to think of new
ways of solving problems and so on so i
would highly recommend you decidi cs101
if you're interested in learning any
sort of computer science stuff or if you
need sort of an intro to python it's
going to be well worth your time so the
courses are structured very differently
with however the instructor is teaching
but as you can see it's almost like a
virtual classroom there's like sort of a
Wacom tablet that's being used to sort
of a dry erase board to teach the
material and I find that works really
well especially with the quizzes and
questions to sort of backup what they're
teaching so to make sure you understand
it every step of the way and you can't
move on until you understand it so
because this is the first one of these
reviews that we're doing if you you know
leave us a little bit message let us
know how we're doing with it if there's
anything in particular you want to see
out of those reviews we're going to go
through all these other classes i'm
going to go through the other Udacity
classes that I'm interested in taking
and you know all sorts of other things
were going to go through books other
other learning websites and we're going
to see what they have to offer at the
end of the day you know getting
improving your skills is really
something that you should dedicate the
time to and if you can use better tools
to get you there
streatham you know that's the secret so
like I said let us know what you think
let us know what you want to see in the
future and this is the first level of
Tut's review on Udacity cs101 as always
