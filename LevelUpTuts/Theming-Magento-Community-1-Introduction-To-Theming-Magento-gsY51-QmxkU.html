of Tut's and today I'm going to start
our theming course for Magento and we're
going to get into everything from the
very basics to the advanced stuff we're
going to be doing not only custom
layouts we're going to be doing custom
CSS we're going to be doing custom
JavaScript jQuery stuff pretty much
anything you want to know about theming
a site with Magento so the first thing
we have to do is take it to the very
basics and the very basics is really the
model that Magento follows for websites
and stores
so basically a website is a one or more
store of the same customer information
the same order information the same
shopping cart you see here we have
website name main website main website
and main website ok the next level for
that is the store the store is a
collection of store views and that can
be set up in all sorts of ways basically
the store is a container to group all
your related things right so it's just
like a store in a strip mall or
something the store is going to have all
the related products or all the products
of that that particular store ok but
let's say you run multiple different
stores you don't have to have different
backends to run all those stores you can
just create a new website or a new store
depending on what your level of
flexibility needed is and the last is a
store view and a store view is actually
it's going to be the same the same
products the same everything except for
it's just different so these are mostly
used for different languages we have an
English French and German store here
they're all part of the main store store
and the main website website and you
don't have to have more than one of
these in fact I'm sure most cases will
really just be one website one store 1
store view so really since this is a you
know we're just going to keep this real
basic I'm actually going to go ahead and
delete these other ones out of here just
so we don't have to worry about them so
let me delete the store view
these are just the ones that I click no
I don't need a backup because we're not
doing anything with the German store
typically if I had done something with
any of these stores yeah I've probably
taken it back up long before I went to
this stage but I'm going to delete this
one as well
these are just the ones that the gentle
creates itself oh I select it back up up
let's see if I can get this before it
goes through okay so it looks like now
we just have our main website our main
store and it's in English so let's
imagine we ran a t store the website
name would be the T website alright the
store name would be you know so and so's
T's and the store view would also be so
and so's T's but it's going to be the
you know the English or whatever so in
an instance we had two different T
stores one for the US and one for
China's store name u.s. T store China T
store or let's say we had a T store and
we had a coffee store both owned by the
same companies it's simple the same
company so you'd have the main website
you could have T store English main
website coffee store English and they're
going to look like different stores
different front ends okay so this is how
magenta likes to break this up you can
run all sorts of multiple websites or
stores off of one Magento installation
if that's something you need to be able
to do let's say for instance you had two
totally different companies running two
totally different stores but you wanted
to keep it on one Magento back-end you
could make a second website and then
have a new store name and a new store
view name so the next piece to this is
design packages so let's actually go to
system and let's go to configuration and
then in here we're going to go to design
and you can see some things here so
design package and themes so what what
you can do is you can create themes to
give your site
the exact look it's going to have and a
design package is a group of related
themes so in each design package you're
going to need a default theme so let's
say your design package is the design of
your store the first theme inside of
your design package needs to be default
theme and then you can have other
variants of that let's say you have a
holiday variant of your default theme
that way you can just override certain
things of your default theme with the
holiday elements that you need but for
the most part if you just have a site
theme on that site what you need is just
a design package and a theme a default
theme so the themes in Magento are
broken down into two totally different
components in fact we can see here this
is the the structure here you go under
skin in front-end we have what's our
skin theme and this includes our CSS our
images our JavaScript any of that stuff
the stuff that's going to change the
visual output the styles of the site and
how it's looking also if you go back to
the main root structure of your document
you can go up to app and then an amp
slash design and then we can go to
front-end you'll also see the same
themes however inside what a theme does
is it controls the layout of your pages
and the template of your pages that kind
of stuff so if you need to move a block
around or if you want to change how
products are being output these are
going to be in these files here however
you're going to want to change the
background of background color of your
site it's going to be in the skin part
of your site so a default theme is going
to have to contain all of the of the
layout the required layouts and skins
required to render your store right but
because of Magento uses this fallback
model if it doesn't find one of those
files in your theme it's going to go to
the base default theme and this is going
to work for the skin and
the layout part of your D the skin and
the app designed part of your store here
so if you don't have those files it's
going to go to the base theme and grab
those files so this is a good thing if
you're trying to do a seasonal design
because if you you know want to just
override some parts it's going to fall
back to your default theme and then you
don't have to you know duplicate all
those files and you can only you you
would only have the files you need to
change in your theme and then it's going
to go to the base default theme and pull
the rest of the theme files from there
so really you only have to edit what you
need to have to edit you know you own
you're only editing what you have to and
the rest can just stay as a default
theme okay so this is a little insight
into the basics of what we're going to
be doing in the next couple lessons I'm
going to go over some more black stuff
and I'm going to go over some layout
stuff and we're going to have to get
into some XML which is a little bit
weird I think coming from other content
management systems Magento likes to do
things a little differently than you
might expect
but it's written that you know it's
really powerful if you take the time to
learn exactly what's going down here
okay as always this is Scott with love
love Tut's if you have any questions
please leave a comment the video hit us
up a LevelUp ton so let us know what
you're thinking there's going to be a
lot more tutorials coming in the near
future for Magento theming thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
