of touch and today I'm going to be
showing you how to use columns with css3
now we can take paragraph context and
have it be split up into multiple
columns based on parameters we specify
that way creating sort of more of like a
newspaper style layout that we can use
with our CSS columns now the cool part
is is the fallback is just going to be
in one big column so it's really if you
approach this from a progressive
enhancement point of view the browsers
that support multiple columns are going
to be getting these nice columns that
people who aren't just going to be
getting a little bit wider text now you
could also target this with something
like moderniser but we're not going to
get into that in this video we're just
going to show you how to use columns
with css3 so let's get started right now
so what we have here is just two
paragraphs basically we just have a one
paragraph tag with some text another
paragraph tag with some text and it
looks like standard paragraphs now what
we want to do is turn both of these
paragraphs into columns so we could just
say P and now in our CSS what we want to
do is define how many columns we want
and how big the gap between those
columns should be now we could also
define the width of the column but to be
honest if you're calculating the
distance they are part and if you're
calculating how many there are it seems
like you don't really need to ever say
they need to be this many pixels wide
they'll just fill to the width of your
parent container which is something that
would be useful in a situation where
your container is growing or shrinking
so let's go ahead and add some columns
what we can do is the property is column
- count and this is going to be let's
just start off with two and you almost
instantly we have both of these
paragraphs are split into two columns
and now they're it's nice because
they're of equal height what's really
cool about this is know better how big
the viewport is we're going to maintain
those two columns and it's just going to
flow the content into the next column
over
which is just great which is something
that a couple years ago just wizard a
dream in CSS okay so now how can we
determine the gap between them or the
gutter space well we could always say
column - gap for the column gap we're
going to use a pixel value just say
we're going to want our columns to be 40
pixels apart and you can see they
instantly get pushed apart a bit now
what happens if we just mess around we
can say we want this to be four columns
maybe with a 10 pixel gap like that so
you can see you can create some really
nice almost like newspaper like layouts
and in fact if you were to just have one
paragraph at two columns it would be
really great and in fact the fallback is
almost as if we didn't have any columns
at all so if we didn't have the proper
browser that could actually read these
tags which you'll find out in a moment
isn't a ton of browsers but there is
hope
if we comment this out this is what
those users are going to see which isn't
maybe different than what they were
already seeing before so here we have
our four columns with a ten column gap
now what else can we actually define
well we can say that there's actually a
border in between each of these columns
let's give this some more space let's do
40 pixels add two columns again and
let's add a column rule so we can say
column - rule and the rule is sort of
just like a border in between the
columns now this is defined the same way
that you would with a border so you can
say we wanted to be one pixel we want it
to be solid and we want it to be let's
say 0 0 FF 0 0 which is going to be an
ugly green color actually let's do a
different one we can do a little bit
more bold this dark blue the super ugly
blue okay so now we have this line in
between and you'll notice that it's
halfway in between our columns if we
make this smaller it's obviously going
to maintain
distance and this is really great
because we have the same options that
you would if you were doing a border so
we could say like - add four pixels and
then we have a - troll in between here
you can even specify these parameters
individually so you could say column -
rule - color and then just say run and
you see that's overriding of course so
there's it's just like border we have
color style and width for those two
column - roll - style and column - roll
- width now let's get into the important
stuff how and when can you use CSS
columns well what you don't see in this
example here is that I am using a CSS
autoprefixer with a code pen here
autoprefixer make sure you have all of
your browser prefixes so because of that
I don't have these browser prefixes but
for this to work in modern browsers even
Chrome and Firefox you are going to need
the Moz and the web kit browser prefixes
for this to work so let's take a look at
can I use if you're not using can I use
com you should level up tux has no
affiliation with can I use but it's a
great website for knowing what browser
support what in a nice visual way as you
can see here even the latest version of
Firefox along with Chrome and Safari and
opera all only supports CSS column with
their prefixes along with iOS Android
and Chrome for Android
now Opera Mini supports CSS columns
along with Internet Explorer 11 and 10
however you'll notice that with 9 and 8
it's not supported at all so that means
that no matter what browser prefix you
have you're not going to get it to work
in IE 8 or IE 9 however there is a Java
Script a fallback that you can use
however I personally would just let them
have the one column
version of whatever you're doing unless
that multiple columns is really
essential to your design the the 2.4
percent and the 3.7 percent of these
users just might have to suffer with
their content being in one column it
just doesn't make a ton of sense to have
that much overhead just so that small
group of users has the same visual
experience when really it's probably not
affecting your content at all so this is
CSS columns in the next video we're
going to show you how to use CSS columns
with unordered lists and ordered lists
and some things that you might not have
thought about with what that means so
check it out
let us know what you're thinking go to
code pen mess around with this yourself
or just use this in your projects CSS
columns is awesome so as always this is
Scott with level of Tut's if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment of the video or hit us up at
twitter or facebook at level up Tut's we
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
