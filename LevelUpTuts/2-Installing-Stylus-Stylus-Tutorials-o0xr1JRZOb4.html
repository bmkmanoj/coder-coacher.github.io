up tutorials and today I'm gonna show
you how to use a stylus now what we're
gonna do is go through the process of
installing stylus and then we're going
to write some very basic boilerplate
code then you can then see how stylus
compiles up to CSS just like we've been
doing with other things like sass so
let's get into that right now so to
start we're at the stylus website which
is at learn boost github do slash stylus
I'll put a link to this into the
description of the video so you can get
here easily now this site gives you a
basic overview about everything you can
do with stylus and it even gives you
just a nice introduction where it says
CSS needs a hero and gives you an
example of standard CSS tells you what
if we could omit the braces well we get
rid of the braces what if we can omit
the semicolons and then what if we can
omit the colons keeping things dry by
editing nixon's and then they even go
further to make this mixin transparent
so it just looks like a normal CSS
property then it allows you to import
other stylist documents along with
plugins and things like that and it even
gives you some language functions like a
sum of all of these numbers and then it
makes all of these things optional so
this which looks just like normal CSS is
valid as stylist and it's going to
output just like it would if you were
typing stylist without the brackets so
that makes stylus very attractive you
can write this code any way you want so
if you prefer just to omit just the the
braces that's cool if you want to have
the semicolons and colons that's cool
too so it's really all about how you
want to write your CSS okay so now to
get started we need to install node J s
so you can do that by clicking on this
node.js link which is gonna take you to
node J s org and as you can see we can
just install it with this big old
install button which is gonna give you
the correct installer for whatever
system you're running so you can install
node.js as you need to and then continue
after it's finished installing now that
node is installed we now have access to
something called NPM which is the node
package manager it's going to allow us
to install packages
like stylist now to use the node package
manager in terminal we just have to
simply type NPM now if we want to
install a specific package the command
is NPM install and then the package name
now this - G is means it's installing it
globally on your system so that you
could use it as an executable outside of
a project right so this isn't just
installing this into a particular
project it's installing it onto your
system so let's go ahead and you open up
our terminal and we can type NPM install
and then stylus and then - G now you
might get some errors saying that you
don't have permissions if you're trying
to install this as a root administrator
installing it globally in your system
now if you get these errors you can just
simply type sudo and then the the same
command which was NPM install stylus and
then - G now it's just going to ask you
for your password what you can enter and
now it should install globally no
problem ok after that's complete you now
have access to you stylus now I am in a
directory named stylus here I haven't
really said anything up
so if you see inside I'll just have this
NPM debug log file there's really
nothing in here so let me actually go
ahead and create a new file and I'm
gonna open up sublime text to do this so
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
gonna create a stylus document now to do
that I'm just gonna click new file and
you can do this any way you feel
comfortable and any text editor you wish
and the name of this file is just going
to be style dot s Tyl now sty l is the
extension for stylus files I mean if
you're used to something like SAS used
to having SPSS or SAS s files this is
just the equivalent of that so if we hit
enter we now have a stylus file so let's
go ahead and try something out and get
it to compile so we can just type body
you can hit enter tap over to the next
line and now we want to give the
background a color so I'm just going to
say background red now if you're using
something like sublime text you'll
notice that this reads it as a plain
text file because it's not used to the
st yl extension we can head over to
package control really quickly package
control install package and then add in
this stylist package now this is going
to give us access to the stylist
document style here that we can just say
package control we just head to stylist
now said syntax - stylist if you're not
using sublime text whatever system you
are using may already have a stylist
extension and if it doesn't you can go
ahead and browse the internet for that
okay so now we have this really basic
stylist document that's saying alright
my body I want the background to be red
now if you're familiar with writing a
lot of CSS this would typically look
like something like bracket bracket
semicolon or colon and then semicolon
just like this and with stylists just
think that you can keep your CSS the
same way and just delete all that stuff
just less typing okay now let's watch
this get compiled to do that we want to
use the watch command which you may be
familiar with from using sass if you've
used that or any other of these things
where you're watching files now with the
watch command is going to do is it's
going to watch for any time this file
has made a change it's been saved and
it's gonna recompile this and turn this
into CSS so let's go ahead and come back
to our terminal now to turn our stylist
into CSS we need to compile it using the
stylist command and our terminal from
the directory where our project is now
I'm in the root level of our project now
for this particular example I just have
these style dot sty elf file in the main
directory of this project so now to do
that
we just need to type stylus and then
space hyphen W for watch we're just
gonna watch the file and check for
updates every time it's been saved and
then it's going to recompile and then we
just need to tell it what file to watch
now we're gonna point this to the direct
path since this files in the root
directory of the director I'm in right
now I can just type in style st yl and
it's going to automatically compile this
into the same directory just as a dot
CSS file so if I click enter you can see
that it's watching and then it's
compiled into SC SS and now it's
watching this particular file if we come
to our sublime text now you can see we
can save this head back to our terminal
and you get a little message saying it
was compiled again now we have this file
style dot CSS that we didn't create
ourselves and if you click it you'll see
that we have this compile to body
background color of red so this is our
stylist completely compiled if we change
this to something like blue save it move
over to our CSS you'll notice that this
has been changed as well it's really
fast and it just updates while you're
working now of course you'd point your
HTML to the CSS file just like you would
any other CSS document this just helps
you create CSS faster easier cleaner
whatever
just like sass does just a little bit
different now like we showed before you
could add a semicolon here if you really
wanted and that's not gonna break
anything you could add a colon here if
you really wanted it's not gonna break
anything and no matter what you get the
same output I personally really like
styluses clean style without all of
these brackets and colons and semicolons
so I prefer to write my stylist like
this but if you like your CSS to look
like CSS then by all means leave the
brackets colons and semicolons in great
so we've now got stylus up and running
we're watching and this isn't the only
way you can compile your stylus you can
also use things like pre-process or code
kit or even build processes like gulp or
grunt all
which have stylist options available so
in the next video we're going to show
you everything you need to know about
variables in stylist as always this is
Scott with LevelUp tutorials thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
