up huts and today we're going to be
going over the basics of creating your
own theme and we're gonna be doing this
with Omega as our base theme we're gonna
be creating a sub theme which can be
named anything we'd like okay so what
you're gonna want to do first is head
over to drupal.org slash project slash
Omega and you're gonna go ahead and go
ahead and grab the latest version of
omega and get that going on your site
and then also you're gonna want to grab
this module called omega tools and this
module is just going to give you an
interface to create a sub theme because
there's a lot of files you have to
change the names of and stuff and this
just makes it easier to just automate
that process for you because you could
do an Omega sub thing with that Omega
tools but remain really its it you know
just saves you a step or two so might as
well use it so go ahead and grab this
Omega tools enable it as a module and
grab Omega as a theme once you have that
go into your appearance in your Drupal
administrative section click appearance
and then we'll scroll down here and
you'll see some stuff okay this st right
here at theme for scott site this is
what I have already made so you can just
ignore this one but you should be seeing
this alpha and you should be seeing
Omega and what alpha does is it provides
sort of the the templating for creating
your sub theme you could if if you were
making the theme without Omega tools
you'd probably be using from the Alpha
folder and you can find information on
how to do that on the Omega there page
right here they have an official
handbook and everything so you can go
ahead and read that if there's something
you're interested in doing but you might
as well just use omega tools like i said
so we're going to enable this omega core
one and it's just as oh yeah omega okay
and up at the top here you're gonna see
something here install new theme and if
you've installed this omega tools module
you're gonna see this create a new omega
sub theme you're gonna want to go ahead
and click that because we're going to be
creating this something now what you
don't want to do is you don't want
- you don't want to edit a base theme
directly so if you downloaded Omega you
could potentially go into the CSS change
it and have a look at how it should but
that's not really the spirit of theming
in Drupal if you have a base theme the
base theme stays itself so that way when
updates get pushed out for the base
theme you can just keep updating that
it's not going to affect anything you
don't have to worry about overwriting
your own theme or anything but really
you want to create a sub theme if you're
using a base theme and that goes for any
of them's and or you know adapt a theme
or any of them the reason I use omega
over any of those is mostly because this
is the one I'm most familiar with I've
used adaptive theme I've used Zen
however Omega gets used most often for
reasons unknown and I'm the most
comfortable with it so whatever you may
find you can check out some the other
ones but I would probably recommend
checking out Omega because it's been
it's been really great to use okay so we
clicked add a new sub theme now we want
to give this a name we're just going to
say this is going to be level up theme
and install automatically this is select
whether you want to install this theme
automatically placed in the selected
destination yes so we want to install
automatically destination is going to be
all because we want installed in the
site's all themes okay and here is where
you get to just choose what your base
theme is you can see Alpha Omega or St
we're going to use omega st was the one
I had created before and no starter kit
here so but the starter kit is is it
basically gives you some files and and
if you're using the omega html5 starter
kit it's going to basically make sure
your site is completely html5 or you can
use the older XHTML starter kit
personally I would just recommend using
the html5 starter kit I don't I don't
know it's okay exactly why you wouldn't
use that at this point
if you need to support older browsers
you can always use the html5 shim or
shiv or whatever people are calling it
we can go over that if that's something
that is of interest so let's click Save
and continue
and it's gonna create this theme for us
okay so I've successfully created a
theme level up theme and now I can give
a description the theme or level okay
cool and this is just going to be
version 1x you can change that later if
you'd like now I'm gonna click continue
and okay this is the final step two for
configuring yourself theme okay well
let's click some of this advanced
configuration to see what's here and I'm
gonna check enabled because I want this
to be enabled and I want it to be my
default theme because this is what we're
gonna be working with so here it gives
you the option to manipulate the theme
info the dot info file and we'll go over
that info files a little bit more in
fact Omegas is going to be looking a
little bit different than any other
themes really because it's a little bit
more complex but when we're gonna be
wanting to add JavaScript or CSS files
to our our page
this is where we're going to be telling
to do that I'm gonna go over that in the
next lesson I'm going to show you how to
add a CSS and everything we're gonna go
over more project setting up stuff but
for all you need to know right now is
that you can change this info file
before you even you know get going but
I'm not going to need to change it we'll
close this and we'll just save this
click finish and we should have it all
as well a new default theme let's click
out of this admin here and this is what
it looks like when you get it it's
completely Stark it is completely blank
slate but what it does have by default
is these two grid and blocks turned on
of course you can turn them off but when
you're just starting to debug you're
just starting to theme your site it's
nice to have these on to sort of know
see exactly what's going on or the
where things are located and what
exactly everything is okay so this is
how you create a sub theme with Omega
huge every new theme and we're gonna get
ready to go in the next lesson I'm gonna
get show you how to get setup with sass
CoffeeScript everything ok as always
this is Scott with level up Tut's and
