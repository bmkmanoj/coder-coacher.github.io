Tut's and today we're going to be
showing you a tour of the backend of
WordPress now this is what the
administrative section of the site looks
like when you login now here we are
we've just installed WordPress and we
have a welcome to WordPress and notice
how it has some buttons to let you get
started you know your next steps are to
write your first post or and about page
or more actions turn on some widgets
turn comments on or off change your
theme all that stuff is great and this
is what WordPress does really well it
sort of lets you use their software in a
way that's really intuitive and we could
get rid of this by just clicking this
dismiss if you like or you could go
ahead and explore this notice up below
here we also have some quick draft and
at a glance there's a WordPress news now
you can click and drag these around and
it'll change the order of them it looks
like it just changes the vertical order
because we're zoomed in here a hos oom
doubt it might make a little bit more
sense so we have activity here is also
showing you the most recent comments and
recently published stuff you can also
click on these triangles to collapse
them if there is one in particular you
don't really need to see and we can move
them around like that great so now this
is your dashboard you can always return
here by clicking on the dashboard in the
left-hand column here now if you click
on home it's the same thing
so dashboard is the heading home as the
page updates is going to be the page
that we went to in the last tutorial
however you're going to see that we have
no updates available if you would like
to check to see if you have updates
although the software does for you you
can always click this check again of
course it tells you when it was last
checked so next we have posts and post
is where you control all of your posts
right so this is not only where you see
all of your posts where you add new ones
manage your categories and manage your
tags so what's the difference between a
post and a page well a post is an
article comment sort of like a blog post
right I mean if you're your most all
familiar with a blog it basically has a
title a body and can typically allow for
comments and you can tag them and
there'll be a listing of all of the Pope
right where pages are more like you know
there's an about page contact page it's
not quite the listing of content like an
article or something like that it's more
just a normal web page so let's go ahead
and click posts here and you'll notice
it takes us to the first item which is
all posts and opens up this menu here
now we have the hello world post that we
can quick get into by clicking edit
quick edit we could also destroy it by
clicking trash or we could just view it
on the front end by clicking view we can
also filter and we can do bulk actions
such as editing multiple ones or
deleting multiple items we can change
the view from a list to a more of a
larger list like a fatter list with more
information we can also search for posts
you can also had a new post right up
here another way to add a new post is
this add new in the Left column here we
can also go to here for categories and a
category is a way to distinguish your
posts from other posts you can add
various categories such as maybe you
know like news or events or something
like that and then you could then sort
your content your your posts by news or
events or you could have a menu that
displays all the categories so here we
can add new categories or we could
modify the ones we do have right now the
only category that comes with WordPress
is uncatted Erised now if we go to tags
tags are similar however it's a little
less rigid you typically tag multiple
things on to one post and it's a little
less formal so you could say this is a
post about you know this is a post about
food so maybe you tag it food recipes
whatever that way when people are
looking for your site in there in the
search they're going to find this post
more easily next we have media and media
is a way that you can upload images or
other types of media like we have the
photograph or the camera or the audio
the musical note here basically we can
enter media here to have it used within
other posts and pages within the page
editor
you can also upload and use media
through the page editor so you don't
necessarily have to manage your media
through the media library but what's
nice is that WordPress gives you the
option of coming in here and seeing your
library even all of the media and
everything that you've uploaded through
posts and everything like that so
anytime you upload an image through the
WYSIWYG which is a what you see is what
you get is the text editor on the site
it's going to come into here and you'll
be able to see it here you can perform
both bulk actions like deleting
permanently or filtering them we can
also add new media here by just dropping
files in and then using them later in
blog posts next we have pages which as
we described before is like a just a web
page right so we have a sample page you
could click here to add new ones and
this is very similar to the posts where
you can have your bulk actions deleting
and editing you can quick edit edit or
destroy or view them you could search
through them
and what's nice about pages is that you
can add them to the menu of your site in
the main navigation that way you could
have content that people want to access
quickly like I said before about pages
or things like that that they could get
to that much easier now next we have
comments and by default WordPress has
comments turned on if you're running a
blog which is what WordPress is you know
essentially built for I mean you can
build all sorts of sites with WordPress
but the core of WordPress is really
built for blogs then you have the
ability to moderate and edit and approve
and disapprove Markus spam comments here
and so every single time somebody makes
a comment at any of your articles it's
going to show up in this comment listing
right now we haven't filtered by all of
the comments if we wanted to see just
the pending comments we could click this
notice how all of the comments are
approved and that has to do with
settings that we have we could have all
comments immediately be approved on
posts or all comments immediately be
needed to be pending upon post therefore
you have to review each comment before
it goes live on the site
that way you can you know have spam
control or you can make sure that people
aren't posting things on your site that
you would not like them to here we have
the approved spam and trash just like
that clicking through them and we can
click all here and just like this we
could unapprove this comment if I you
know I didn't want Scott at level of
huts to make this post I can just say
how to prove now it's going to be in the
pending column right here where I could
then approve it again okay well that is
the first half of the administrative
section menu here and you'll notice
there's a nice little divider between
this top half in this bottom half now
these things in the bottom here are all
sort of settings for your site where the
things in the top here are all sort of
content editing content adding and more
for the front end of your site so in the
next video we're going to talk about
what's in all of these menus here and
then we're going to move on to actually
creating posts and pages so as always
this is Scott with level of Tut's if you
have any questions or comments please
leave a comment on the video below or
just up a Twitter level of Tut's we're
also on Facebook or there's the new
level of Tubbs forum where you can come
and ask questions thanks for watching
