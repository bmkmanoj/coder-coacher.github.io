of which may be that it's not complete
and although it's not complete one of
the great things about css3 and its
implication is that the spec itself is
being implemented in sort of modules of
CSS so while it is incomplete and things
aren't finalized yet there's plenty of
things that you can use that are
supported fairly widely and we'll be
going over those things and how well
they're supported and what you can see
and this is going to be going over sort
of a type of design that you might like
to look a little more into called
progressive enhancement where the newer
browsers and might be giving some newer
features to make it look a little bit
more modern however the design still
holds up on the older browsers so the
idea would be let's say we needed like a
drop shadow on this box I mean this site
works fine without it so on the older
sites that don't support the box shadow
you won't see it and are they really
losing that much by not seeing that box
shadow well as long as the design works
and it's not really that much worse than
those people with a older browser aren't
really getting that much worse of an
experience just a different experience
and if you do want it to be the same in
terms of all all browsers or whatever I
mean you can always use images for
things but of course you know why use an
image when you don't have to and like I
said it's it's going to work fine and
function fine and pretty much for the
most part look fine so over the next few
lessons we're going to be going over all
sorts of cool stuff you may have a text
shadows box shadows you'll be able to
rotate you're going to be able to
animate elements bunch of really cool
stuff with css3 and what's really great
about css3 is that if you're using if
you're following along with the sass
tutorial list let's say you've done the
CSS ones and you want to learn some sass
go do the sass tutorials and then once
you know follow these css3 tutorials you
can do the compass tutorials and you can
see exactly why compass is so great okay
so feel free to keep watching
let me know if there's anything in
particular you want to learn about css3
but we're going to get this series going
in just a second here and get you on to
some cool stuff and what we can do with
css3 as always - scott with level up
touch if you have any questions let me
know in the comments hit me up a twitter
level up tuts and thanks for watching
we're gonna get started in the next
lesson alright bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
