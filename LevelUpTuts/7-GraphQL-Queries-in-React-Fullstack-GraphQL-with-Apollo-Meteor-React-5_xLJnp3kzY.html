tutorials and in this video we're
actually going to be hitting our Apollo
server with a graph QL query to actually
display data on the front end so even
though this isn't hitting a database
it's not doing anything fancy we're
actually going to be hitting the server
and returning data and then displaying
it in react so let's get going on that
right now okay so in this video we're
finally going to get output our actual
query okay and this is most of the hard
stuff after this comes on we're going to
connect to some database stuff we're
going to be adding some actual you know
inserts and calls and mutations and sort
of stuff like that
and you're gonna just totally get it
right right now we're simply just well
we've created our server we've created
our client we've connected the two and
this one we're gonna connect an actual
component to everything keep it full
circle and get this outputting data
directly from Apollo client ok so check
it out let's go ahead and head to our vs
code here and you remember we had our
Apollo app we're rendering that and we
had our app component let's jump into
our app component considering this is
where we're actually going to be
connecting this okay right now this app
component is so incredibly stupid it's
just an h1 you'll be able to see exactly
how easy it is to connect any sort of
anything using Apollo and whether you're
doing more than one query or mutations
it's all very similar to what we're
doing here what we need to do is import
some stuff okay so let's talk about what
we're importing and why we're gonna be
first we're going to import and keep in
mind this is not within brackets this is
gql okay from graph QL tag no GQ L is
going to allow us to write a graph QL
query just inside of JavaScript here and
then use that query to actually pull
data in okay now next we're going to
import actually inside of brackets graph
QL okay now graph QL is what we're going
to use to connect our query to our
component
okay so this is from graph QL is from
react
Apolo okay so this graph QL comes from
Apollo okay so we have our app so this
hello
okay now let's go ahead down here below
our app or below our component and let's
go ahead and make a new query we're
going to say a constant and this is just
going to be high query it's going to be
equal to a G QL and we're gonna use
backticks and just like we did when we
define the query itself we're going to
actually define a graph QL query now one
of the easiest ways to test to see if a
query is going to work is to try it in
graph QL and you can see we have hi or
is to try it in graphical sorry not
graph QL you can see that we have this
basic query again this isn't JavaScript
so we don't need comas and any of that
stuff we just have two brackets the word
hi and then another bracket okay we can
copy this query directly since we know
it works I mean we were seeing it
working right here we can copy this
directly from here you can even click
prettify if you want to make sure that
your indentation is all correct first
it's actually them and this is what it's
made for it right that's what graphical
is made for we can paste it in here just
like this and what this is going to do
is to find a query for us we want to run
the high query and the high query is
going to return a data object that has
the string of hello level up okay so
check it out next thing we want to do is
actually connect this query to our app
and we're going to do so using graph QL
and we're going to do so using the
higher-order component the sort of
pattern here you can see we have two
parentheses like we're running a
function and then we have parentheses
around app now inside of graph QL let's
actually put this on another line here
inside of graph QL we need to pass in
the high query okay so we can do that
just simply by saying high query now
this what's it called prettified just
put this on one line for me which is
fine and
this actually should give us everything
that we need so let's actually save this
and check out our application okay none
so far nothing right but if we head to
our react dev tools we open up a Paolo
app you could search for this if you
wanted to but if we look at app you
could see what was once a total blank
empty object now has a data property
inside of that data we have a whole
bunch of stuff including our high
property which has a value of hello
level up so that tells us that we have a
prop in app now called data and that
prop has a property called high so let's
go ahead and grab data from our props
and then output data dot high okay so
let's save this so what's cool about
this is yeah it's hitting the database
well not the database I'm sorry it's
hitting the server it's running this
query to say hey give me the value of
high okay well on the server the value
of high is defined as a query and that
query exists right here and it's simply
just returning the string hello level up
now what we should see in our app is
hello level up and every time you
refresh it we get hello level up this is
coming directly from our server it's not
coming from any sort of client-side code
it's brilliant right so you can imagine
that if we had a database here in this
return hello level up instead of being
well a string here was a database call
you can see how this is starts to work
so we are now have our first react
connected components to Apollo and graph
QL and were able to query this and say
hey give me exactly what I want now
again this seems like a lot of work to
get a little level up output from the
server but a lot of the hard stuff is
done we've connected the server to the
client and now all we need to do is
start building well more and more
complex resolvers more and more complex
schemas we need to start doing something
called mutations but you can see we
II got the basics done so cool I'll I
hope this is really super helpful again
you can just throw this into your
already existing app if you have a
meteor and react app and it will replace
everything that you have in there
whether it's Redux or tracker or any of
that stuff but you can do it
incrementally if you'd like so good I
hope this was a good introduction to
Apollo and graph QL using meteor and
react now by no means are done with this
series by the end of this we're gonna
have a real life of resolution app with
sort of sub resolutions right if you
make a resolution to read more books
maybe you're gonna want to say I did I
read you know 10 pages today check it
off do their a 20 pages today check it
off that sort of stuff you know so
basically by the end of this we're gonna
have a fully functional available app
and we're gonna get into things like
user accounts and stuff like that we're
gonna get into a little bit of security
stuff it's gonna be really really
excellent but I hope this has been a
good introduction so far and I'm gonna
keep it coming this entire series will
be free so if you want to support level
of tutorials
head on over to level up tutorials calm
and you can become a pro subscribe get
access to all of the premium tutorial
series I have available and all of the
new series that are coming this year
including a lot of stuff on graph QL so
you want to learn graph QL outside of
meteor you want to learn some of the
finer points of it and get really really
in-depth I'm gonna go there this year so
check it out as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
