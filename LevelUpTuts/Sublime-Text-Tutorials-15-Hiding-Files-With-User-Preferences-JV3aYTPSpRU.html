up Tut's and today we're gonna take our
folder and file hiding one step further
with sublime text and we're going to
take this out of the project and put it
in to our user settings now this is
great because you notice in here we had
some drupal specific things right
we wanted to hide the txt files we learn
to hide cron dot PHP and we wanted to
hide profiles miscellaneous however
there's some more global files that we
want to hide in fact we never want to
see these get files we never want to see
the sass cache or these underscore files
or D Esther we pretty much I can't think
of a project where I'd want to see any
of those files in this column so you
might be thinking do I have to have
these to every single project every time
and you don't you can actually add these
to your user settings so it's really
easy of course and I'm first going to
just copy these because I'm gonna be
editing it later
and before I copy this I'm going to
delete some of this stuff out of here
pretty much the stuff that's not ripple
specific so just like that I'm just
going to leave the Drupal specific
folders we want to hide and okay so now
we have that stuff back and it doesn't
look like we had like a dot git folder
here or anything like that so now to
illustrate this I'm really going to just
create a new folder and this is just
going to be a folder named test and you
can see this folder shows up here and
we're gonna add this test folder to our
users settings so that we can see this
disappear as well because I don't have
to get enabled on this project and
they're not using sass so we can't
obviously use those as examples so to
get to our user settings we can come to
sublime text preferences and then
settings for user notice if you edit
settings for default when you update
sublime text or anything like that
they're going to get overridden so
you're going to want to put your
settings into this settings file
okay so now we see basically an object
right and object basically just has the
base font size of 32 and now in here we
just want to add the same things that we
added to our project file so I'm going
to add a comma here and the things we're
adding our folder exclude patterns if
you didn't watch the last video and file
underscore exclude underscore patterns
when then we have a colon and then
within brackets we're putting in the
types of files we want to exclude notice
how I have a comma after each line
except for the last one because this is
a JavaScript object so again I'm gonna
delete the Drupal related stuff and just
leave the non zero related stuff this
time and say we want on every single
project we do we don't want to see get
folders we don't want to see sass cache
folders DS store files or anything like
that and then here just to prove I'm
gonna add this test folder as well now
I'm gonna save this file and you'll
notice again instantly we see that file
that test folder is removed again I can
delete this and now the test folder is
back so adding these folder exclude and
file exclude patterns to your user
settings can really enhance things it
can clean up this sublime project so now
these files are only specifically
excluded to this project itself and
these files are it just excluded
application why because you're not going
to need to edit them so I found this is
another workflow boost and it's been a
really nice experience to use so check
it out it's quick and easy to add
literally takes a couple of seconds
folder exclude patterns file exclude
patterns in your user preferences as
always this is Scott if you have any
questions or you know anything just hit
us up at Twitter or Facebook or the
level up touch forum ask away we'd love
to hear from you we do get a ton of
email so I can't really help with
technical questions over
email we do offer like private
consulting and training and things like
that however there's just such a volume
of technical questions being asked via
email I can't possibly get to them all
especially because this is not a
full-time project of mine this is just
something I like to produce for the
community so if you again if you have
any questions you know let us know and
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
