up huts and today I'm going to show you
to put Google Analytics on your site
using the Google Analytics module so
using Google Analytics is a really great
way to track who's coming to your
website and really Google just updates
this tool all the time and I feel like
it just keeps getting better and better
with more and more features so we're
going to use the Google Analytics module
of course you could just use the embed
code that Google gives you and just put
it in your you know your template files
or something but I like using the
modules especially because it's sort of
like the Drupal way to do things is to
use the modules so I'm going to grab the
latest version and I'm going to throw it
in my modules folder which if you
remember is in your sites all folder
oops
and then modules so let's grab this
throw it in here and let's enable this
module
here it is and they were just going to
save this and then we'll have access to
the configuration options where we can
put our information in so I'm actually
going to scroll back down here to where
we were before because this is where
you'll find a little configure gear
we'll click on this and it's going to
ask for your web property ID it's going
to ask if your single domain which
you're tracking if you have multiple
subdomains or multiple top-level domains
built into your site you know you can do
that however we're just going to be
tracking this single domain and I'm just
going to grab my web property ID and you
can grab yours and just paste it in
there in case you need help finding this
web property ID just log into your
Google Analytics account and set up a
new domain it should give you this looks
like the sorts of the UA it should be
pretty easy to find so if we click under
pages it's going to say you know are
there any pages you want to not track of
course it's not going to track our admin
or any sort of page inside of our admin
badge no dad or a user pages so this is
fine with me
if there's other pages you want to add
you can just edit on a new line and if
you want any sort of like sub pages of
that you can do slash and then the
asterisks and that will count for all
pages within so this is all pages
underneath admin this is all pages ad
then if you don't want to track
everybody if you want to track only
anonymous users authenticated that's
definitely possible as you can see this
module is really configurable it doesn't
require a lot of just code though how I
mean you can probably do everything with
this if you wanted to with the Google
Analytics code but this puts it on one
nice spot and sometimes an easy to
configure so here you can actually give
users the option if they want to
customize tracking on their account I
don't have users so I'm going to click
no customization allowed links and
downloads yes we want to track downloads
we want to click mail to links or we
want to track clicks to mail to links
outbound links we want to track all this
stuff search an adsense do we want to
track heads
as we don't have Adsense on this site
however I do have other sites with
Adsense ads and then of course you would
want to track that because that's very
valuable information and internal search
again I don't have internal search
however you can you can track internal
search queries with that you could
enable some privacy options here this is
uh makes users ip's anonymous this
universal web tracking opt-out is a
default if enabled your server receives
the do-not-track header from the climate
client browser Google Analytics module
will not bed tracking code into the site
so basically saying if you know it says
do not track from the browser then don't
track it of course we're going to leave
that checked custom variables we don't
need them Advanced Settings now a whole
lot here locally cache the tracking code
file what this is going to do is cache
the the tracking code file and locally
it says do not check this until after
Google Analytics is confirmed to be
working so of course we're going to
leave this unchecked for now and the
JavaScript scope this is going to say
Google recommends adding the external
JavaScript files to the header although
it gives you the option to add them to
your footer if you would like however
since google recommends it i'm going to
leave it in the header no big deal ok
we're going to click Save and now let's
check out the source of our site and as
you can see it has put this Google
Analytics code in the site for us and
it's all nice and easy so now what you
can do is go to your Google Analytics
account and verify that it's all
connected and everything should be all
set
so now you have Google Analytics working
on your new Drupal site and you should
be good to go if you have any questions
or it's not working for some reason you
know please leave a comment let us know
hit us up on Twitter level up tuts and
let us know what you're thinking once
again this is Scott and thanks for
watching
