Tut's and today we're going to be
talking about the breakpoint extension
to SAS and how you can use its basic
functions to build a responsive site
within Omega 4 so now in the last video
we had this layout that we made and it
was really just these two columns and we
said this one is going to be you know
like four columns wide or whatever and
this one is going to be 9 I forget the
exact numbers i'll have to check but
basically it's it's only responding to
its container right we gave its
container amex width of 960 or we gave
it a width of 960 course if we get rid
of this width as you saw before the page
is now responding but what what's more
if you want the classic type of
responsive design we're able to change
things at breakpoints right and of
course you could just write your own
media queries and do it that way but as
we've shown and talked about before SAS
actually has an extension called break
point that we're bringing in with this
import statement and Omega 4 makes good
use of that and let's show how you can
set your own breakpoints and and then
use this module to build a responsive
site so in this first video all we're
simply going to do is show you how to
use breakpoints so now to set up
breakpoints I'm actually going to put
this in my grid variables you can create
your own breakpoints a partial or
something like that if you want at this
point this thing only has two lines in
it it's not too complex right so what
you need to do is to basically assign a
pixel values or M values to variables
and then you're going to be using those
variables with a mixin and that mixin is
going to basically wrap everything in a
media query now what's nice about this
approach is that you can actually you
use your media queries where your
content is right so if I'm building out
my navigation in my navigation partial
and I have my mobile first CSS here and
I want to put my desktop or my tablet
CSS I can actually put it directly below
it and then you don't have to write out
your media queries every time you can
use use this breakpoint mixin and that
makes things really easy and then when
you compile it all it basically writes
it into your CSS like normal with media
queries what another great thing that
break point allows you to do is it also
allows for a no query style of CSS and
you see this no query file right and
this is something really cool about
break point that I really enjoy because
older browsers that don't support media
queries you have a couple of options you
can use something like respond j/s which
tries to make them responsive using
javascript or I really like this
philosophy it maybe even a little bit
better because I mean if you're on ie
you don't really need the site to be
responsive because most likely if you're
using ie7 you're on a desktop or
something like that so what this does is
it renders your style sheets with all of
the code without the media queries so it
still does your mobile first then your
tablet next in your desktop next right
but your desktop because it's defined
last is overriding everything therefore
IE is only going to be getting the
desktop styles so well it's going to be
giving the complete styles but it'll
still be getting the desktop styles and
it's not going to be responsive but it
makes things really easy now i'll be
going over exactly how to do all this
later on in a couple of videos because
it does require an additional step or
two but nothing crazy so let's get back
to our grid scss and let's define some
wits right so let's say our tablet with
is going to be 44 ms and let's say our
desktop with is going to be 70 ms now
I've pulled these two widths 44 m s and
70 ms for the
Evelyn desktop directly from the own
theme in case you're wondering where
exactly I got these widths but we can
now use these widths in our break points
mix in here so to illustrate this I'm
actually just going to do a quick
demonstration so we can say the body
background is going to be just yellow
right and now we want to define this at
a tablet and a desktop we want the color
to be different right so how would we go
about doing that well this is where the
mixin comes in handy for our break
points so what we can do now is I can
use add include which is of course how
we've been doing mix ends and we can say
break point so you're basically just
saying I want a break point and i'm
going to use tablet break point and then
now inside of this just like we would
our media query you can wrap it and say
like that also let's do a desktop and
let's say no
okay so now if i come to our site you'll
notice it's already green and if i
resize once i hit these breakpoints it's
going to of course change based on how
we have the site so what's great about
this is that you can use this mixin
anywhere right let's say you had just
one tiny little thing inside of your
page change on a single break point
let's say on page this might be a bad
example but let's just say for the
desktop inside it all paragraphs inside
of page you want to have them increase
their font size so we could say
paragraphs font size and we can just say
1.8 ms right so we've actually included
this mix in with in some of our CSS here
and since this is SAS it's basically
going to get to this and it's going to
pull this out and wrap it in a media
query so now if we save this you'll see
our font size is much bigger of course
our paragraph font size and once we get
down to desk or tablet it gets much
smaller same with phone so not only can
you wrap large sections of your code in
these mix-ins like media queries you can
also use them within a nested sess
selectors so this is excellent right it
offers a ton of flexibility but really
this is just gracing the surface of what
breakpoint is really capable of
especially what once you're using
singularity but what happens if you
wanted to have a media query that was
saying a min width of something in the
max width of something right you want it
to be directly between two well we can
do that pretty easily in fact we can do
that super easily and all you have to do
is when we define our our variable that
we're going to be using in our break
point we can just say i'm just going to
name this between because this is just
going to be temporary let's say we want
this once the
with is between let's just say some very
specific sizes here if we say between 20
ms and 35 ms and just like that so all
you have to do is declare two widths and
then a space in between them and now
when we give our break point let's come
here and do another and include break
point would say between just like that
and you notice I mean look at how easy
that is you don't have to do anything
specific you don't say min with max with
anything like that you just say use this
variable and break points going to know
what to do so we can say body no not
okay body BG in the color we'll just
have this be red because we haven't used
droid yet and we've used all the other
ugly colors so let's come back to our
site here I'm gonna refresh for good
measure cuz I don't always know if it
out of reloaded and you'll notice we
have our green we have our blue and
leave our yellow but once it gets to
that spot it's going to be red and if we
go narrower than that well it's not
going to let us go narrower than that
unless we're using inspect on the side
so let's do that if we go narrower
you'll see it goes back to yellow so we
go yellow red yellow blue green so
that's how you can use variables to make
pairs or basically your normal widths
for break points and if we check out the
CSS in this you'll see it's nothing
crazy or nothing that you haven't seen
before just ignore this debug info we
can get rid of that later but you'll see
it's really just outputting this at
media min with 20 m/s and mex with 35 mm
which is what you should used to be
singing with break points or with media
queries right so in the next couple of
videos we're going to talk more about
breakpoints we're going to talk more
about using them together with
singularity and we're going
create some cool stuff we're going to
create our grid we're going to have a
responsive a total responsive grid by
the end of the next video and then I'm
going to try to use things like no query
and we're going to keep going from there
so as always this is scott with level up

comments leave a comment the video or
