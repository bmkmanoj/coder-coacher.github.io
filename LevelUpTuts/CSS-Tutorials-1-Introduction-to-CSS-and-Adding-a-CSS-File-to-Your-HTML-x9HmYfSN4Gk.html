LevelUp Tut's and today I'm going to be
starting a new course on us CSS opinion
a lot of questions and all sorts of
stuff in the the drupal the Magento and
all sorts of the other tutorial series
we're running answers that could easily
be a problems that could easily solved
with just a knowledge of CSS okay
so what we wanted to do is give a very
basics to advanced course on CSS going
over pretty much everything so this
first lesson is really just going to be
an introduction I'm going to tell you a
little bit about CSS and why it's
important and then we're how to add a
CSS document to your HTML document what
I have right here is really just a
stripped out version of an html5
boilerplate site just download from
html5 boilerplate com if you don't know
about it you should power check it out
html5 boilerplate com I'll have the link
there basically it's a great boilerplate
to get started has all sorts of great
stuff again you can read more about it
on their site so this is just a stripped
out version I pretty much get rid of
almost everything but what we have here
is just an HTML document with an h1 and
a paragraph tag so if we go to our
browser here sorry let me okay
if we go to our browser this is what it
looks like it's completely stark right
we go to our HTML looks like this and
typically in the past I don't know if
anyone has used inline Styles to style
your code but that's not what we're
interested in doing here inline Styles
would be if you were to write style
equals and then you could do color blue
okay so what this is going to do is it's
going to assign this paragraph to blue
but inline styles are just a huge No
basically if you want anybody to edit
this code later I mean I'm just going to
say right now just don't don't even
bother with inline styles ever okay so
what we're going to do is we're going to
keep all of our styles in an external
stylesheet we're going to keep our style
and our content completely separated so
first off I mean see
as it stands for cascading style sheets
it's what we use to make our HTML
documents look good so everything that's
done for style from color to background
image and now even with css3 there's a
border radius and drop shadows all of
these things you can do with CSS to
style your websites so you don't have to
rely on images and just sort of maybe
table techniques to sort of lay out your
code you're going to want to do it all
with CSS so the first thing I want to do
is I want to create a CSS document and
I'm going to put it in a folder called
CSS right here it's good practice to put
it in another folder maybe something
like style sheets CSS if you're using
something like sass I usually have my
sass or my CSS files in different
folders just to keep things organized
but here's the CSS folder it's got
nothing in it but this hidden deist or
file and then here's our index file the
one that we're working off of here so
what we need to do first is create a
file that's going to go in here so I'm
just using sublime text I'm going to add
a new file and I'm going to save it into
this folder and it's just going to be
styles dot CSS and of course you can
make this name whatever but sort of
common things or styles dot CSS style
dot CSS of course like I said you can
make this whatever you want so I'm going
to click this and click Save so you
remember if you know anything about HTML
you always have to have like a doctype
this is html5 there's a doctype of an
HTML with CSS you don't have to do
anything to get started a blank document
is a blank document this is a CSS file
and it's totally valid okay
so what we want to do now is we want to
attach this to our site ok and what I'm
going to actually do is I'm actually
going to put a comment here just so we
can make it you know make sure that this
effect worked once we added here
okay so kale LCSs comment and then right
here you want to make sure you do this
in your head tag and the order that you
add your style sheets is the order that
they're going to be rendered so let's
say if you have two style sheets and you
have one above another one this one's
going to get the rules that it goes
through for the CSS is going to
determine how it looks with this first
one and then if you have a second one
that second one's going to override
anything that it would override so you
want to just be you know cognizant of
that you know what's going on so let's
say you have something wacky happening
and this the style sheet that you're
working off of isn't the last one or you
know whatever something may be getting
overwritten but we'll go all over that
later okay so the first thing we need to
do is add a link tag and the only things
we need in this link tag is a rel
arielle for the relationship and this is
going to be style sheet okay and next we
need to say physically where is this
document so just like an image if you
have an href you're going to link your
CSS file with an a track so href and
it's going to be equal to in this case
it's just in my CSS folder in the file
as style.css okay if I save that and add
this sorry close close bracket here okay
save that now let's go back to our
browser and I'm going to refresh this
okay so this is a page let's actually
check out the source on a Mac you can do
that with a command option you or you
can just do view source a developer view
source I don't know what it is on
Windows but you can just right click and
say view source so here it is our code
here's this link to our style sheet and
if we click on this and open this file
in a new tab your style stats CSS you
can see our comment that we had written
here it worked and just really quick I
didn't actually mention this but a
comment is a forward slash asterisk and
then your your letters then an asterisk
forward
that's how you do a comment okay so
check it out it's linked so now if we
were to do any sort of styles in our
stylesheet it's going to know and it's
going to update them in your HTML all
right so this is the introduction to CSS
from level up Tut's in the next tons of
lessons we're going to be going over all
sorts of stuff all of the basics all of
the intermediate stuff follow the
advanced stuff css3 and just anything
cool new that's coming out on the
horizon whatever so as always feel free
to let us know if there's anything you
want to learn or any questions you might
have
okay once again this is Scott with level
tuts and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
