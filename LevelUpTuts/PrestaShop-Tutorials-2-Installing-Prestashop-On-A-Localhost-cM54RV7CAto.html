of Tut's and today we're going to be
downloading and installing PrestaShop on
our localhost this video is going to
cover the installation process using map
Pro if you're familiar with something
like zamp or map or ramp on Windows then
go ahead and use whatever you're most
comfortable with
however for this example we're going to
be using map pro so if you have that or
don't you can follow along with that
either way as long as you can get a site
up and running in PHP perhaps you've
used another CMS like Drupal or
WordPress then this should be a breeze
for you if you haven't please check out
map
Pro if you're on Mac or wimp if you're
on Windows and look through some basic
guides on how to use those first so
let's get into it now
now as we win over in the last video
PrestaShop is a free e-commerce
full-featured online platform with tons
of free themes and as you can see it's
been downloaded over three million nine
hundred thousand times so it's almost
hit that 4 million download and maybe by
the time you're seeing this video it has
already reached that 4 million download
so we can go ahead and grab PrestaShop
from PrestaShop com just by clicking the
green download button here or if you'd
like beforehand you can always take a
tour by clicking on this blue live demo
and checking out PrestaShop for yourself
so let's go ahead and click download now
I'm going to be installing this with
MAMP
Pro if you're used to something like
MAMP or zamp or any of the other
solutions perhaps you're on Windows then
go ahead and use that I just find that
man Pro even though it's a paid solution
is the easiest way to get sites quickly
up and running on an OSX machine ok so
to download this we just need to enter
our email I'm going to enter my email
it's just scott at level up tuts and you
need to select from the drop-down who
you are I am not really any of these so
I'm gonna select other however if I was
doing this for a project I would select
freelance ok so let's go ahead and click
download now ok and as you can see we're
here there's also we've recommended
hosting a solution
if you have interest in wanting just a
quick way to get your set up and running
with a host that already has free
PrestaShop installation then in motion
hosting is the way to go and you can
obviously sign up for that here okay so
we have PrestaShop downloaded and it's
just in our zip here so now let's check
out what's inside of this PrestaShop
folder as you can see we have a HTML
page that you could visit that's going
to redirect you to the getting started
guide and we have a PrestaShop folder
and inside of our PrestaShop folder is
the CMS the site content here so what we
can go ahead and do is grab this whole
PrestaShop folder and just drag it into
wherever you keep your sites now you
could move this into your documents I
mean wherever you just normally keep
your websites as fine and now I'm going
to point a virtual host in map pro to
that location so in man pro I'm just
going to add a virtual host here we're
going to name this PrestaShop just like
that and we're going to go ahead and
point our folder to that location okay
now I'm going to click apply and I'm
going to start my servers so now that
our servers started we can visit that
new virtual host we created for me it's
PrestaShop and then a colon with the
port after eight eight eight eight
depending on what you're using that
might be different now if you notice if
we browse to that it's going to
automatically redirect you to the
install page now before we actually
install we'll need to create a database
but let's go ahead and just get started
with this first so welcome to the
PrestaShop installer we can make sure
that our language is set in English
because that's what we are setting the
site up for if your language is
something else obviously you would want
to change that now now let's go ahead
and select next let's agree to the terms
here and select next okay so now let's
go ahead and set up our shop name this
is going to be the level up
tuts store and your store name is going
to be whatever your store name is going
to be please choose a main activity
we're going to search maybe
not mobile and tell
come but you can see they have all sorts
of different animals and pets arts and
culture babies downloads fashion I'm
just gonna keep scrolling down okay so
I'm just going to select other because
uh I don't really know what we're
selling on the site quite yet so let's
select countries United States for us
and timezone is us Eastern first name
Scott last name to Lensky and we'll fill
out our email address and you're going
to want to put in a password now this
password must be eight characters you're
going to want it to be secure because
this is what you use to log into the
administrative section of your site so
go ahead and type in your eight
character password here okay and you can
choose whether you want to sign up for
the newsletter nut I'm going to select
yes because I want to get the regular
updates from PrestaShop so let's click
Next
if everything is either should be you
should be taken to the next screen now
here's where we set up our database
configuration what's nice about this
install is you have a test your database
configuration button so some other CMS
sites when you enter your database
information you click Next maybe you
mistyped something and it comes back
with an error about your database well
in this case you don't have to do that
you can actually test your connection
and obviously if we click test right now
it's going to come back with a failure
because we haven't set up any databases
for this so let's go ahead and create a
database for this right now now from our
mam Start screen we can go to PHP
myadmin
and let's go ahead and create a new
database this database is just going to
be PrestaShop obviously if you have your
own database naming scheme you're going
to want to go ahead and do that to
whatever is relevant for yourself let's
click create okay so now let's go ahead
and fill it in our installer information
we have a database named PrestaShop the
root login is root and the password
should be rude as well we can leave the
table prefix as PS underscore and let's
click test your database connection
so as you can see we've gotten this
databases connected success message
which means we're all clear to go to the
next step so let's click Next and now
what's happening is it's installing
PrestaShop for our site ok as you can
see our installation is now finished and
it gives you an option to print your
login information if you'd like now it
tells you for security purposes you must
delete your install folder so let's go
ahead and do that I'm going to come back
to finder we're going to go into our
PrestaShop folder and now I'm just going
to go ahead and grab this whole folder
the install and toss it in the trash and
empty my trash so what do we do next we
have these two options to see the back
office or the front office the front
office is the front of the store the
back office is where you're going to be
managing your content so I'm going to
open each of these in the new tab so
here's the front end of our site it
looks great you can go ahead and explore
that all you want now let's go ahead and
log into the backend
I'm going to log in with my email
address that you entered during
installation and your password just like
keep me logged in and sign in to the
site there we go here's the PrestaShop
backend full of sales information and
everything you'll need to get your shop
up and running so in the next videos
we're going to explain how you can build
your site with PrestaShop from scratch
and we're going to take a look at themes
and plugins and all sorts of things you
can do to build a fully featured web
store online nice and easy
so as always this is covered level up
