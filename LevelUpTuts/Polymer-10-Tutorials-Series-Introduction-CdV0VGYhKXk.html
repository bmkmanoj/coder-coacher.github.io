tutorials and today we're gonna be
starting a new series covering polymer
1.0 if you're unfamiliar with polymer
it's a library that allows you to use
web components in your projects now this
is amazing because we have components
are really the future in your everyday
HTML you have elements like the
paragraph the anchor tag or something
like that
well now you can write your own elements
and you can use elements that other
people have written for instance you
want to throw a Google map in there no
more going to Google grabbing some embed
code and then copying and pasting your
actually be able to write a Google Maps
element or even drop one in that
somebody else is used and perhaps you
add an attributes for longitude and
latitude and then you just have a Google
map on your site so now that is really
just touching the absolute tip of the
iceberg here so we're gonna get in depth
and build some really cool stuff using
your own custom components in polymer
now polymer has just hit version 1 it's
completely stable and this happened just
a few months ago at Google i/o so ever
since that announcement I've been really
excited to start the new polymer series
here because the last one was when
polymer was still in development things
were changing all the time and maybe you
watched some of those videos and then
when you went to write your code the
examples weren't the exact same so now
I'm really excited that things are
stable now for a little while once you
watch these videos there shouldn't be
any sort of change in how you write your
code I'm gonna take a little bit
different approach for this series for
the first couple of videos we're just
gonna show you how to get started with
polymer we're gonna show you some of the
built-in elements and the stuff you can
do with it and then we're gonna take a
bye project approach and we're gonna
take a project where we have like a
contact list you have photos you have
phone numbers you have names you have
some information for your people and
we're gonna build that out using custom
elements with polymer so check it out
let me know if there's anything you want
to see in this series let's get started
learning polymer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
