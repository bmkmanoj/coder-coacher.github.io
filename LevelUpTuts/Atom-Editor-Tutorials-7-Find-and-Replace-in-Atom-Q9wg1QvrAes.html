up tutorial sin' in this video we're
going to be talking about find in
replace now fun and replace is a great
feature to have in any text editor and
definitely a feature that you're going
to be using often so let's get going on
this right now
so obviously Find and Replace is a big
part of any text editor I've some
projects open here and basically let's
say we wanted to find the instances of
hello world and change this word hello
world to something else well I'm just
gonna copy it if you do command F now
notice we get this find and we also get
replaced so an atom command F or ctrl F
is not just find but it's also find in
replace now we can click find here and
it's going to find them or we can click
replace and it's going to replace them
so of course I can change this from
hello world to hello Scott here and now
when I click replace
you'll see it changed the first incense
but it didn't change the second that's
because there's also a replace all
button down here in the top right you
can see replace all can also be
activated by hitting command enter and
we can hit replace all to see hello
Scott
shown here so we now have hello Scott in
both places now in addition to finding
and replacing we also have some
additional options such as the ability
to use a regex pattern we have the
ability to match or not match case so
for instance if we were to be looking
for let's say the word person
and if match cases on we can see that it
finds person person person
and if we turn off match case
let's actually look for the word let's
look for the word prop and without match
case on with it out selected we can find
and it's going to find the upper case
word prop as well as the lower case word
prop power for a match case it's only
going to be finding the lower case
in addition we could actually say only
find props by selecting this next one
only in selection we can select an area
and say find only in this area and it's
only going to find these two out of our
entire document now we can also have an
option for the entire word which means
that it's only going to find things
where prop is the entire word as we're
looking in the selection it's not
finding anything let's turn off some of
these other modifiers and you can see
that the word prop itself never exists
as a just plain word it's always a part
of something like props or prop types
foundation is just simple find and
replace we can also access find in
project by command shift F or control
shift F F here on windows we can do
command shift F if you'll notice here we
actually have another line here to our
interface now if we want to find the
word prop in every single JSX file here
we could just say asterisk dot JSX and
click find now what you'll see is that
instead of getting a highlighted text
we're actually getting the line number
and what file this is being found on so
the it looks like it's only found a
couple of props and all of them were in
index.html here so as you can see it's
found on these lines and simply
selecting that line will take you to
line 16 of index.html which of what is
course this is referencing here like
this one it's highlighted line of 45
which is the thing that I'd found for us
so you can use Find and Replace to find
and replace text across lots of
documents across few documents or just
in the document you're working on so as
you can see finding and replacing an
atom is really super easy and works very
similar to what you'd expect with
something else like sublime text or most
text editors that have these features
either way what you're looking for is
probably here and it's probably easy to
access so as always this is Scott will
