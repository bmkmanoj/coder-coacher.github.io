today we're going to be learning more
about break point using break point and
singularity to put together our grid
system now this is something you can do
choose to do on a per layout basis or on
a project basis now you could when we
create layouts you could write all of
the layout grid CSS in your layout CSS
file or you can write in here it really
just depends on how much you plan on
extending your code or maybe this is a
one-off thing basically like I've said
many many times already I'll make it
gives do a lot of options to structure
your code how you want so I'm going to
get rid of this stuff where we're
changing the background color and all
sorts of you know crazy stuff just get
back down to our basics so in the first
couple of videos on singularity or the
first video we made these regions and
this one spanned expand three columns
and it started at position number 10 and
then the main content span nine columns
inserted at position number one thus
creating the website that's totally
broken here okay the website that's
working correctly right here so we have
this and this this is our nine columns
and this is our three columns now it's
important to state that if we were to
assign something inside of this section
here to a column it's going to be a sort
of restarting right so let's come back
here and inside of our region content I
want to put a the field Layton body and
in here I want to assign this to let's
say if you were thinking I want this
take up half the space right or maybe
let's say taking up a little bit more
than half the space so we would say all
right it's going to be five and it's
starting at the first space so you might
think if you're using other grid systems
that there is a universal grid right
well this is not sort of the case this
story starts over essentially this grid
spam is according to the width of its
and you saw that in here where the the
sidebar in the main content area are
determining its grid size by the width
of its parent likewise even though we
said this to be five columns wide it's
not five of the total columns which
would put it somewhere around here it's
actually five of 12 columns inside of
this content area so that's just one
thing to be thinking about when you're
adding your things to your grid in this
case if we wanted to take up half of the
space or more than half of the space
let's say if we wanted to take up half
the space we would use 66 is half of 12
and come back and now it's taking up
half the space of course if we wanted to
say almost almost all of the space we
could say 10 and now it's almost all of
this space here of course I'm not going
to do that here but I just wanted to
give that a heads up if you were using
singularity and notice that now I want
to talk about building a responsive grid
so right now let's define some page
widths and we're going to define them at
certain break points so if you recall
our page width on mobile should be
nothing right it should be just fitting
to the width of the parent so we're not
going to assign any sort of width for
page what we can do however is a senator
with at certain break points so if we
want to say that the page is going to be
a width of you know whatever our break
points are we could actually do that
right in here and we could say include
and weights a breakpoint tab so we want
the tablet width and we want that to
have a width of tab because this
variable as we remember was 44 m so it's
using the variable as a break point and
then it's also assigning the width of
the content area
here but only at tablet so of course
because we're doing this mobile first
you'll notice that the width is going to
be set to our 44 ms once we get down
past 44 ms there we go and now it's
fully fitting to the parent now likewise
we want to do the same with desktop we
could also say include breakpoint desk
with desk and now we have our break
points giving the total width of our
page a change and you'll see that the
columns are automatically adjusting to
fill the parent like they were before
but now it's just doing at the specific
breakpoints cool well that's really nice
and easy but now we have this sidebar
here right and actually I'm going to do
something really quick i'm going to turn
off these helper areas because right now
they might be getting in the way right I
mean we sort of see them here but I
think they might be getting in the way
so if we go to appearance and then find
our theme settings and then we can now
say under development region demo mode
get that off as you turn that off pretty
much right away once you sort of
understand the layouts you don't really
need to see the the region mode too much
okay so you can see this looks a little
bit cleaner okay so now we should have
things a little bit better but if you
remember we have this powered by drupal
here if we were to inspect this page
we'd be seeing that that's actually like
the footer and we have some clear fix
issues going on specifically because
we're moving elements out of the
document flow so the footer content is
floating right up here will you be
thinking well we could throw a clear fix
on the wrapper and that's all good well
what's nice about a the singularity
framework is that it actually comes with
a clear fix mixin and for me I think
it's a little bit nicer to throw it into
my CSS than having to
at a clearfix class whenever I want to
use it so we can say in our CSS here I'm
going to put this right above here and
this is going to be for our main our
ldap main which is a rapper we could say
@include clear fix save this and now
you'll notice that this powered by
Drupal is now coming down where it's
supposed to be if we were to inspect
would be saying that the normal page
layout is what we'd be expecting so we
sort of have it go in here but typically
you'd want to build mobile first right
and we totally didn't do that we said
all right this grid is 310 and this grid
is 91 but we wouldn't necessarily want
to do that in the real world we probably
want to wrap all of this in a breakpoint
right so we could say at tablet is when
we want to start showing this column
like that so just in one line of code
here I'm wrapping this in at break point
and this is going to know be totally
responsive so we have our desktop we
have our tablet which is just a narrower
version and then once it hits to be
mobile you'll see it's all in one day
column and you can see it's put this
navigation down below it now you might
be wondering well how do I get this
navigation the search above here well
that's going to be getting into
modifying our template files right so
right now in our template files it's
being output that the main content area
is above the sidebar but as you can see
in no time here we've gone from having
just a grid site to a grid that not only
responds but completely changes now you
can even do more crazy things right what
happens if you wanted to completely
change the grid at a different
breakpoint what you could do that so if
we said oh right now a desktop we want
the region sidebar
to again we want it to be starting at
the first position and we want this one
to be starting at the fourth position
and now let's come back to the page and
so now this is going to be getting crazy
oh and i forgot i need to make this a
desk my desktop all right now you'll
notice that they've completely changed
size sides and we could say all right
there we go and so you can see this grid
is totally flexible and our desktop we
can really do whatever we want and we
don't have to worry about changing the
HTML to change the grid and change our
content on the grid this makes us more
flexible than most good frameworks I've
ever worked with cool well in the next
video I'm going to show you know query
and we're going to get that set up so
that we can have our no query CSS
working exactly like how we want it to
support older browsers so as always this
is got a level of Tut's if you have any
questions or comments leave it come in
the video a hit a set that Twitter I
level up tuts of course we're going to
be going way moreover this once we start
building out layouts right because our
layouts are going to be sort of like
defined layouts that we can move from
site to site so keep watching lots more
videos on the way but this is a
responsive site with breakpoints and
singularity so as always to subscribe
level up Tut's and thanks for watching
but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
