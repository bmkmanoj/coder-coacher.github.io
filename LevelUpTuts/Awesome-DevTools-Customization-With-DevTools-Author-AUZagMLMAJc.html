author was released and I have to say
it's an awesome awesome extension for
chrome now I've seen extensions that add
a dark color scheme to your dev tools
before however this one really takes the
cake allowing for 25 different themes
along with font size changes it's
awesome so let's check out devtools off
there i'm going to show you how to get
up and running with it you can see that
you can have them something like mo no
chi or any of these sort of standard
color schemes a little bummed out there
was no material dark but maybe that's to
come so we have getting set up first you
need to install devtools author from
chrome so go ahead and click this link
I'm gonna include this web page or you
can just type in the devtools author in
your search bar or you can just click on
this link from the description as you
can see you can come to this page and
add it to your chrome now after devtools
author has been installed you have this
google experiment now this is pretty
cool they actually include the full link
to get to your flags along with an
anchor to the actual flag you want to
check just copy and paste this whole
link where it says chrome colon for
double forward slash and it'll even
highlight the flag that you need to
check so we have a naval have developer
tools experiments we're going to want to
go ahead and click Enable okay so now
that that's been enabled we have to
relaunch chrome to take advantage of
these developer tools okay so chrome has
been relaunched we now have our flag
check or developer tools experiments and
now we just need to come to inspect i
right clicking or you can do the
keyboard command way command option hi
and let's head to to this three little
dots here and then settings now from
here we need to come to experiments and
we want to check allow
custom UI themes now there's a whole
bunch of other stuff in here since we
now have experiments checked on you
could check out yourself good you
uncheck that I'm going to close now if
we come and inspect you'll notice that
there's a brief change but we get this
new color scheme right here as you can
see this is sort of the default one
which is 30-24 if we want to use
something dark like mon okay we can
always click this double arrow and come
into author settings now from author
settings you'll have a host of 25
different color schemes here you can see
we can use the classic mo no Chi which
is something that I really liked
actually and you can even change the
font size to be whatever you'd like now
it says that devtools needs to be rude
loaded to see your changes so let's just
close out of that and click inspect now
that inspect you'll see it take a second
and then it's going to go ahead and give
you your new color scheme now or
somebody who personally uses mostly dark
color schemes this is just a really nice
feature and it's going to more mirror
image what you're looking at when you're
actually looking at your code now I hope
that material dark and material theme
that gets added in general however and I
even may contribute that myself if I
have an opportunity but as you can see
this package is awesome if you're the
type of person who likes tweaking color
schemes and looking at stuff like that I
just personally really really like this
package it's brand new it's super cool
and I'm sure it's going to be improving
a lot over time so check it out dev
tools out there it's a great new chrome
extension is to sort of give you that
extra tweak and your developer tools to
make them even cooler those always this
is Scott would level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments I could
come by the video by me a bit order our
Facebook I level up tutorials I love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see in the next one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
