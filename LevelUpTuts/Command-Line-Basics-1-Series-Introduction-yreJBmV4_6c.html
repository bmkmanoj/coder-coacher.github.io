up Tut's and today we're going to be
starting something new and it's going to
be another mini series here and this is
going to be on command line essentials
and basics right so in web development
you end up using the command line a lot
whether you like it or not it's really
worth it to have a firm grasp on the
basics now you don't have to be a
complete command line master but to be
able to get around your file system SSH
and things great directories used you
know the vim editor and things like that
it's really going to come in handy over
the course of your development time so
what we were planning on doing with this
course is we plan on taking it very slow
and showing you how basically the
commands that you'll need to get around
with command line and it's like I said
it's not going to be too advanced or too
crazy so if you've never used command
line or you've used just a little bit or
you're looking to you know firm up your
knowledge of command line then feel free
to tune into all or as many of these
videos as you would like so fire up your
favorite text editor I use I turn to for
mech however Apple comes with a built-in
text editor under a called terminal or
there is also of course obviously a
Linux system has a command line editor
and if you're on Windows you're gonna
want to use something like this uh I
actually don't know how to pronounce
this but sigh Gwynn maybe side when I
don't know if you know the pronunciation
feel free to enlighten me I'd be happy
to know because this is going to be the
closest thing to using bash on a Linux
or UNIX system so check it out I'll post
the link to this in the comments and we
can get started so keep watching in the
next couple videos we're going to show
you everything you need to know to get
started with command line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
