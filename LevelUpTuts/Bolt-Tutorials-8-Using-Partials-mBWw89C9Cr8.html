of Tut's and today we're going to take
our three
buying some of these template files that
we have here so one thing I want to do
real quick is get rid of this hideous
blue color and replace it with the level
of Tut's purple that were so fond of and
now if we refresh this okay it's a
little bit more viewable so let's come
in through here and first thing I want
to do is get rid of this image this
headline text you know I don't really
want this either so we're just gonna get
rid of this whole area right here well
where might you look for that since
we're on the home page you might be
thinking it could be in the indexed wig
well let's click one of these posts here
and you'll notice the image is still
there so is it in the index page well
probably not let's go look at our file
structure and let's come to our theme
level up and we'll go to the indexed wig
and it looks like this is already
getting into we have an h1 with the home
title we have this article we have this
eight columns and row let's come back to
our page here and let's look at the
source a little bit and let's see if we
can find out where this is so we have
our eight columns we have our row and we
have an article with a title let's go
back to our home page so we're looking
at the right template but either way
this is it and above the row is this and
above that is the header photo and if we
come back to our our Twigg file we'll
say the only thing above row is this
include so what this is is this file
right here is a partial anytime you have
some content that you want to appear on
more than one page then you would put in
a partial and the reason for that is is
that you only have to edit it once and
it goes throughout your entire site just
like any other PHP system or any other
sort of dynamic web site so here we have
our header
and you'll notice that the partials are
defined by an underscore so the file is
going to be underscore header dot twig
and this is going to contain all the
stuff you normally find in a header we
have our script tags and all that stuff
and if we scroll down we should find our
header photo so I'm going to go ahead
and delete this entire block of code and
now if we save it and come back to our
site you'll see that we no longer have
that area at all on any page it no
longer exists
cool well that's that's good that's one
thing I sort of wanted to know there it
wasn't doing a whole lot of good for us
we just didn't need it so what else do
we want to do well we want to create our
own partial and this is going to be a
block that we're going to throw in this
red column here that we're gonna want to
show up on all sorts of pages including
the index and including other blog post
pages but it's just going to be a maybe
like a Facebook block or something
so let's come back to our site I'm gonna
right click on my themes folder I'm
gonna click new file and I'm gonna save
this as underscore social dot twig there
it is and here's our file and notice how
we don't have to do anything can a
partial here at the actual file to let
this file know that it is a partial if
we just put the words I'm gonna be a
little h3 here we're gonna put a social
social block there we go
I'm just gonna save this yeah I know I
I've purchased a license for sublime
text and I swear I just need to put it
in okay so let's come back to our index
and let's scroll down till we find our
other row and you'll notice that's
actually in a partial as well so we here
for this aside twig let's come into a
side twig and you'll notice it as the
class of four columns perfect so this is
exactly what we're looking for and now
to call our partial we just need to say
curly brackets percentage and then
include space and then inside of quotes
we're going to say underscore social not
twig and then finish the left with a
percentage and then another curly
bracket so if we save this our index is
going to be looking for this side and
the side is going to be looking for
social that's going to get rendered and
if we come to our site you should
refresh and we have our social block
showing up on our page we can fill that
with whatever information we want and we
have our first partial on our first part
of the site and we can reuse it anywhere
we want in fact just to illustrate that
process I'm going to copy this include
right here and I'm gonna go straight to
the index and as the very first thing in
this index I'm going to post this social
twig and we'll see social block showing
up here and here so perhaps you have a
social block of your social networking
links or something and you want to have
it in the sidebar easy to find and you
also wanted to appear in the Twitter or
I mean in the footer section of your
site that's very possible and you could
just style it differently with CSS and I
get to reuse that code so it's very
repeatable it's something that you
always want to strive to not repeat
yourself when you don't have to so I'm
going to go ahead and delete this leave
it in the other one and that's going to
be it for this here we've made a partial
we put it to use and
you can see exactly how this code can
make your life a lot easier so as always
this is Scott with level up Tubbs and
thanks for watching
if you have any questions or comments
leave it come in the video or hit us up
at Twitter or level up tuts alright
