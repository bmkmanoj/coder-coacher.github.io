up tutorials and in this video I'm going
to show you how we can have easy page
transitions using the similar animations
technique as the last video so let's get
going on that right now
so in the last video we added the
animation to each one of these
resolutions right let's actually say
that what we want to do is animate each
of these pages let's try something it
should be really interesting what we
want to do is let's head to first our
about page because the about page is
nice and simple I'm gonna take with me
I'm gonna take with me this import
statement so let's copy this whole
import statement and head to about JSX
paste this in at the top and if you
remember we had a div wrapping around
this stuff let's go ahead and actually
head back to the resolution wrapper and
let's copy the transition group let's
copy this whole thing right here and we
can paste it in on top of this div so
say goodbye to the div paste this in
here and let's change this component to
a div again let's actually take this
react CSS transition group and paste it
in here so we can close this out
property properly and now let's change
some things let's get rid of this class
name and let's change this transition
name to be route if you'll notice I
already have some classes set up under
styles we scroll down we can see we have
a route enter and route leave okay let's
go ahead and head to our page and let's
now click on the about page and as you
can see we're not having anything happen
right what's going on here
so why isn't this working well you'll
notice in the CSS we do have this route
appear class that I have just sort of
placed in here and that might have been
a little bit of a spoiler what we want
to do is head to about and let's add
some things first I'm going to copy this
transition enter timeout and have this
be a transition appear timeout now I'm
going to add a new property which is
transition appear and it's just going to
be equal to inside of brackets true so
we're going to say transition when this
appears
we're going to run this transition
timeout for six seconds it's going to
run and add the class of up here which
is going to do this sliding up so let's
go back to our page here let's refresh
and as you can see when we come to the
route and the page loads we get this
about us sliding up we head to
resolutions head back to about that's
pretty slick right I mean it's it's it's
not totally distracting it's happening
really quickly I would recommend your
animations happen pretty quickly maybe
even a little bit faster than this I
kind of have these at six seconds here
just to show them existing right now if
we were to take this same code we could
apply this directly to this page as well
and have this transition actually
working so if we head to about copy this
whole thing we can reuse this same
transition and the same transition name
let's head to our resolution wrapper and
let's throw this in here as the wrapping
element on this whole page and again
let's grab this and paste it on top of
this div and you remember we don't need
to import it because we already have it
imported onto this page exactly already
cool so now we can be in Chrome now
let's head back about resolutions about
resolutions about resolutions man that's
great I just like this to be honest some
people might not like this you might
think this is a little bit overboard and
I totally get that
some sites it works really well some
sites it doesn't if we head to level up
tutorials calm this site is built with
reacted meteor if we head to tutorials
you'll notice that these tutorials do
have loading animations when I'm
changing them like this here we go
you can see these animations these are
all being done with this react
transition group you can see I'll select
a series and we have this nice
transition in I can click one of these
and all of this stuff including that
slide down is done with react transition
group it's
pretty sweet so this is just goes to
show you that these react CSS
transitions are very powerful and once
you get into it maybe write your own CSS
or use the library you can do some
really cool stuff so as you can see page
transitions and animations simple dead
simple so Rex CSS transition group is a
great thing and as long as you're not
like making bells and whistles fly all
over the place and your animations
taking two seconds I don't see a problem
with it personally I prefer some sort of
interaction or action to happen when you
click or load things rather than stuff
just popping up on the screen so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you would like to continue
your meteor and react learning past the
next video where we deployed to meteors
testing server then head to start our
level up tutorials calm and purchase
this series for digital download there's
extra content code examples all sorts of
cool stuff so as always thanks for
watching I'll see you in the next one
