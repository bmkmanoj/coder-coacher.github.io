of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to create an attribute that we can
now add to our attribute set that we
created in the last tutorial so to get
started we're going to click on catalog
and we're going to go to attributes and
then manage attributes so here's a list
of every attribute that's ever been
created it spans four pages or one if
you choose to display 200 on one page
and it gives you a little bit of
information with the require the system
visible scope searchable yeah cool okay
well let's add a new one up top here is
the add attribute we'll click that and
our attribute code this is a unique code
with no spaces it's just for internal
use and so we're just going to call this
to be let's say format because these
tutorials are going to have a like a
type of format whether it's an MOV or an
mp4 I mean I'm sort of reaching here but
I mean this product it's a tutorial so
format is our attribute code and then
the scope we're going to leave it store
view it's going to be what the type of
input you can have a be a text field a
test text area date yes or no we're
going to have this be a drop-down
because we want you to just pick from a
couple of options
is it a unique value is it not shared
with other products no it's not unique
values required yes we're going to have
that and you need to fill this out all
products need to have a format that our
tutorials so input validation from store
owner we don't need to worry about that
applied to selected product types if we
click this is going to say you know
maybe virtual products only um or maybe
configurable grouped or simple we're
going to let this go to all product
types we don't necessarily want to limit
if we want digital download tutorials or
let's say somebody is buying a pack of
DVDs if people buy DVDs anymore
and and then they could you know that
would be a physical product so is it
allowed to be used in quick search yes
it's allowed to be used in advance shirt
search yes we want that can you compare
this on the front-end yeah we wanted to
be a comparable field so that people can
check out different formats and compare
them can it be used in the layered
navigation sure we'll filter with
results using search results layer
navigation yes so these are going to
allow you to filter by different types
of the format's that we're going to have
in our select list this position I'm not
going to worry about it it's going to
put it wherever it wants however if you
want to give it a weight value you can
give it a number that's a weight value
let's see
allow HTML tags on the front end yes
visible and product view page on the
front end and yeah we wanted to be
visible on the front end and used in
product listing depends on the theme no
because our theme doesn't really support
this use for sorting in the product
listing no it's cool
we're good so next here is manage label
options feel notice when you click over
here there's still this little disc that
pops up right here and this just means
that you have changed things in here and
they need to be saved so now these are
our options since this is a drop-down
list we're going to add an option and
for all of them we're going to say let's
say mov and we're going to add another
option it's going to be mp4 and we're
going to add another option and it will
be MKV ok cool so we're just going to
have MOV be the default and if as you
can see here it says if you do not
specify the option value for the
specific store view then admin will be
used and since we just want admin D we
want these to be the same all the way
around I'm just going to leave admin
selected so these are going to be titles
so
so this is just going to be format again
and now we're going to save we'll just
click Save because that's everything
okay so it's bumped us out here and now
it's a let's see let's scroll down here
actually it's view more of them we'll
click this to view 200 on the page and
look for format format here it is
attributable format is it required yes
system no visible yes store view yes
okay cool so let's add this to our
attribute set so if we go back to
catalog and attribute sets let's go down
to tutorials click this and now it's
going to be in our unassigned attributes
right here and we're going to drag it
into general because that's where we
want it I'll show you exactly how that
comes into play once we create a product
both looking format it puts it at the
bottom because it's the newest one I'm
just going to click and drag and we'll
put this somewhere let's see under the
SKU number VI okay so now if we say this
attribute set any product that we create
with the tutorials attribute set we're
going to be allowed to select the format
so in the next lesson I'm going to show
you how to create a product and it's
just going to be a really simple product
but we can select our format and it'll
be a tutorial and they'll be up and
going and it'll be great because at that
point you can add it to your cart and
you'd almost have a total working store
without you know product stuff setup or
payment process setup so I have to
recruit a couple products we go through
a little bit that will go through the
payment process the shipping stuff and
you'll have a working store in no time
so as always if you have any questions
add it up on the comments or at LevelUp
touch on twitter once again this is
scott with level up Tubbs and thanks for
watching right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
