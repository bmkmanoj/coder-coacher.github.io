of touch and today we're going to show
you another new CSS experiment now for
this experiment what we're going to do
is create a really cool pulsating button
now what this button is going to be is
it's just going to be a normal square
rectangular looking button however when
you hover your mouse over it it's going
to have an outline around it that sort
of grows and shrinks almost breathing
and pulsating so check it out we're
going to show you that right now and
you're going to learn some new cool CSS
tricks and properties so in this example
we have a basic link which is just this
learn more button what we actually have
though is we have a container div that's
not really doing a whole lot in this
example it's just being used to house it
and we also have a div class wrapping it
of BTN which is a class I often use for
buttons so we have a div wrapping the
link with a button and we have a div
with a class of BG that is underneath it
and that is immediately closed now yes
this div is extraneous but to get some
CSS techniques working you sometimes
need to have some extraneous elements in
your HTML which is sort of bad but
because this is just an experiment and
we're making something really cool here
it's alright so let's go ahead and get
this going if you have this HTML totally
structured as is you can follow along
with this CSS so now let's go over what
we already have for our CSS so for the
CSS we just have a body with a
background color which is this purple
then we have a text-align:center
next for the BTN class which is the
wrapping div around the link and the
other background if we have just a
margin 30 pixels and it's
display:inline-block and it's
position:relative we're going to go over
why we need this position:relative in a
second after we start working on the BG
class next we have the actual anchor
which is a display:block
we gave it an explicit width of 400
pixels text-decoration:none color white
we gave an expo
at height of 100 pixels align height of
100 pixels to make sure that text is
Center aligned and we give it a font
size of 40 and a text transform have
proper case which is purely just display
it's for no reason in particular okay so
now where the magic comes in in this
example is this BG div we're going to be
using some really interesting CSS
properties first let's get started by
giving this BG div a position:absolute
remember we said that the
position:relative would come in handy
this background div is going to be
filling up the entire content area of
the button and so we haven't
position:absolute its width is going to
be 100% of its container its height is
going to be 100% of its container and
we're going to say it starts at the top
left by giving it a top and left of 0
and next we want to give this an outline
because an outline is what we're going
to be animating here so we can say
outline and for the outline we're going
to say this is a white outline it's
going to be solid and it's going to be
two pixels now once we save that you can
see we have this outline here it's white
and it's a nice and bold now I'm also
going to give this an opacity of point
zero two because for this sort of action
I think a strong white you know border
here is just going to be too strong so
we want this we want this to be sort of
calming it's going to be pulsating now
we're going to get into the interesting
stuff so what we're going to want to do
is create an animation and then trigger
that animation on hover and we're simply
in the animation going to be scaling
this dot BG div so let's go ahead and
create the animation now and we can give
this we can just say at key frames and
then give our animation the name of
pulse
instead of brackets here at the
beginning of the animation so at 0%
instead of brackets we're going to say
transform and we're going to scale this
1 comma 1 now what this means is that at
the beginning of the animation this all
background div this border that we have
here is going to be scaled at 100% it's
going to be exactly what it normally is
1 to 1 okay now we're going to give this
an opacity of 0.2 because that's also
its initial opacity now let's come in
here and say at the end of our animation
it's going to be trans transform and
we're going to scale this and now the
numbers we use here are going to be 1
point 1 and then comma 1 point 3 5 now
this is just to give it sort of an even
look it's going to be scaling the x and
y axis and because this is a rectangle
we want some sort of even space on all
sides so we can play with these numbers
in a little bit and see exactly what
happens now let's give this an opacity
of something like two point zero five
because this pulse saying besides just
being a scale thing we want it to sort
of be an opacity thing too now for fun
let's just go ahead and add this
animation to our div here so we can say
animation the animation we're going to
be using is pulse it's going to be
taking three seconds it's going to
repeat in the knits Lee ok infinite and
we're going to say alternate so it's
going to say alter Nate there we go
click Save and I need to send me : to
finish it up and you'll now notice that
without doing anything we have this
button outline that is growing and it's
almost like it's it's not you know it's
just saying hey I'm pulsing it's almost
like a breeze
sort of thing right so you can see that
these numbers come in handy if we were
to change this to something like two for
the hundred percent scale you can see
it's going to get much wider almost
ridiculously wider so because we had
this at one point one and one three five
the even the animation is going to be
nice and even and and if you're
wondering where I got those numbers from
is really just a trial and error
I kept tweaking it until I thought they
looked perfect okay so we now have this
pulsing let's go ahead and remove this
animation from our BG div and add it
once it's hovered so let's say BTN and
then colon hover dot BG so now once we
hover over the button we're going to
have this animation happen and just like
that we have this nice pulsing animation
now we can also add a transition on the
background of this BTN div so we could
say that the background is normally the
same purple color and we're going to
give this a transition of background
over 0.3 seconds and E's okay and now
what we're going to do is say on hover
of the BTN element we're just going to
change this to a different color and now
this is really not necessarily anything
important but it's just going to improve
the look a little bit or change it so
what we want to do now is give this a
background of another color of which I'm
going to pick this teal color the level
of Tut's teal now we can hover over this
and you can see the outline of where the
button normally is and now we have this
nice pulsating effect around our button
so this was pretty cool this is one my
favorite effects I saw this on a website
and just had to figure out how they did
it so this is how you create this
pulsing hover effect on a button really
cool effect I love a lot so as always
this is Scott with LevelUp Tut's if you

level up Tut's so with level up Pro you
can download the videos you can have
code examples for the CSS experiments
and we're even going through and doing
the back catalogue to make sure those
have code examples there's a private
form you get an ad free experience on
level up Tut's comm
there's even a two hour sass mastery
course which is similar to the saz
videos that I have on level up Tut's but
it was made special for the touch plus
