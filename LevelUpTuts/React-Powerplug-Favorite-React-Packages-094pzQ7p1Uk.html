up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be talking about react power
pluck which is one of my favorite
components that I use in every single
one of my react projects that's of a
decent-enough side but before we get
into that I want to take a quick minute
to talk about this video sponsor which
is dev Mountain so what deaf Mountain is
is well it's a coding bootcamp where you
can go and you totally immerse yourself
and what I mean by that is well it's
full time so you show up to one of their
locations and you stay and live there
and you obviously get free housing while
you do this and there's in several
different locations from Provo Salt Lake
Dallas and Phoenix and you show up and
basically you have access to full time
mentors tons of courses and the ability
to just grow as a web developer designer
app developer in a place that really
encourages personal growth so dev
Mountain is super cool because you show
up and get absolutely real-world
training you can see it's very
career-focused
they have a huge network companies like
Nike and reddit eBay LinkedIn Apple HP
the list goes on and on and on so if
you're looking to really step up your
career head to dev Mountain come check
out some other locations check out their
courses request to syllabus take a tour
of the campus and just contact them and
step up your game by taking the leap
into becoming a full time programmer
designer any of that stuff with dev
Mountain all right now back to the
tutorial okay so now in to react power
plug which is our first react package in
this react series so what you can see
here is we have three kilobytes of
gzipped render list pluggable state
containers which I don't know isn't
necessarily the most exciting
description of something if you don't
know what any of that means
but if we scroll down here the basics of
react power plug that it handles a whole
bunch of stuff for you that you may have
done over and over and over again
countless times in your own code for
instance there's a toggle component
where you have an
on an off state and a toggle function
and a set on function so it's like how
many times have you done a toggle right
I can think of just a hundred times
where I've done a toggle and how many
times you had to write the event for
that you've had to write the state for
that and what's nice about these is that
well you could just wrap your component
in a toggle and then have access to on
and toggle and you can see from this
example here let me bump up the font
size yeah we just have a checkbox here
and checked is well the on state right
whether it's on or off and then we have
the change which is just simply a toggle
function I'm telling you these things
are just SuperDuper handy to have around
we also have a loading component value
index works great for making tabs all of
these have really nice docks too if you
if you click on the see docks here it
gives you quite a bit more information
about each of these components we have
set we have lists and we have some
feedback containers they say it's like
pseudo selectors but in jas so for
instance you get access to JavaScript is
hover is active you get access to focus
is focus buying focus and this stuff is
just really great because like I said
it's very low weight and low cost you
just sort of wrap your components in
something like this and get instant
access to something that before you
might have to write your state you might
have to write the toggle all of that
stuff yourself and there's some nice
little form inputs here one of the
really really cool ones is this
composing components where you can see
we simply use a compose function we pass
in two components and now you've merged
two components functionality so that way
you can really have these micro
components such as a toggle and a
counter to create a toggle counter so
just stuff to make your code a lot more
dry right composing components is
definitely something that seems really
super handy to me although I'm not
currently using it I can think of a lot
of places where I'd like to rewrite some
code to use it you can see you can even
pass in and
props and stuff like that so it's it's
more than just saying hey merge these
two you can merge two components that
are very specifically configured okay
one of the cool things I like about
Ryoga plug-in addition all of this is
that well we have code sandbox examples
so if we check out this use in toggle in
a check box you can see it opens it up
and codes and boxed at i/o and allows us
to see this thing in action Wow a basic
toggle it's working but what's cool
about that is that you get access to the
code right here and you can see exactly
what's going on you can manipulate it
and potentially see exactly maybe a
little bit more hands on what's going on
here and on top of all of that like I
said it's three kilobytes gzip so it's
not that much stuff and there's a lot of
people using it really really really
cool package if you want to see how I'm
using it in level up tutorials let me go
to my header okay and so here is a
component which is my user menu you can
see I'm importing toggle from react
power plug let me bump up this font size
temporarily here and you can see I'm
wrapping the menu in a simple toggle no
this is how I handle my mobile menu just
wrapping everything in the toggle I'm
giving it an initial state of fall so
it's initially not open and then I am
just having this function here and
passing in on and toggle now when you
click on the user menu icon we're just
simply running this toggle when I click
on the nav link I'm simply running this
toggle when I'm having a user log out
I'm clicking this toggle and all of this
is being transferred by this on property
right the menu only shows if you have
DEET on now you might be thinking this
is cool and all but like do I need this
like I could write a toggle myself yeah
you can write a toggle to yourself but
how easy is this to simply just import a
component drop in some stuff like this
and instantly have access to the
function so components in react power
plug by no means are doing things that
you could never do without it but
they're going to make your life easy and
that's one of the reasons why I really
like this package so check it out react
power plug definitely something I am
super into really like this package a
lot of cool stuff
and a lot of possibilities for
time-saving if you liked this video and
want to learn more about react you can
