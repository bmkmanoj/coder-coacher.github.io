up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna get started with some of the basic
building blocks of any design or vector
design application we're gonna be
talking about shapes so I'm going to
show you basically everything there is
to know about working with shapes in
figma so that you can have a nice
foundation for continuing and furthering
your design capabilities in this app so
let's get started now okay so in this
video I'm going to be taking you through
some of the basic creation in figma and
the first thing i want to do is to
essentially just create a new file if
you already have a file up and it
doesn't really matter what you're
working in because we're really just
gonna be going over shapes basic tools
that sort of stuff right we're still in
the introduction phase of things here so
nothing too crazy so if you already can
figure out shapes and stuff on your own
please you know skip ahead however if
you'd like to see how you know maybe
some of the nuances or basically the
creation of this sort of stuff works in
figma continue watching and we're going
to get into it so first things first
here is we have our blank canvas now i
mentioned in the previous video that we
have these things called frames which
are pretty much artboards but we don't
need them especially we don't need them
right now typically you're gonna want to
work inside of a frame but when we're
just doing these sort of shapes we don't
need to lay one out first so if you're
wondering what i'm not immediately going
straight for the artboard that's why
okay so we have our shape tools which
you can see you get a couple of
different tool tips if you hover over
the down arrow you get this thing that
says shape tools which is basically just
a hint to say hey click on this if you
want to get more shape tools and we
already went over the basic shortcuts of
these so let's go ahead and just get
started we have a rectangle which we can
make by hitting the r key or selecting
rectangle here and then we're gonna want
to just click and drag and just like
illustrator photoshop or anything like
that if you hold the shift key it's
going to make this into a regular shape
so as you can see i'm dragging this the
height and width are the exact same and
we're creating a square instead of a
rectangle
now also like those are there
applications if we were to hold the
option key you'll notice it grows from
the center rather than from the edge now
this is going to be super useful if
you're creating a shape within a shape
or maybe even you're adjusting a shape
right so let's create the shape now
let's duplicate it the second one I'm
gonna change the color on so I'm gonna
go to fill and we're just going to
select this color
I'll have it be blue for some reason
just so we can see the difference now
with the new shape selected I'm going to
grab the bottom corner I'm going to hold
shift and option and I'm going to drag
it and you'll notice you can see it's
maintaining that same width and height
now another way we could have done this
would be to simply hold shift do this
select both of them and then say hey
distribute them I'm using the distribute
tools right over here I will be going
over these so the fact that I just
clicked through these really quickly if
you aren't familiar with the distribute
tools that don't worry we're gonna be
talking about those as well but the main
point here is that if you want to hold
option and click and drag like this you
can see that we do in fact have this
nice feature that's pretty much exists
in all of this stuff okay so that's
basically how we want to layout our
shape you'll notice that when we have
our shape selected it gives us its
dimensions below it it's super duper
helpful for us we also can get its
dimensions in the right-hand column over
here you can see it's 314 by 314 if
you'd like to maintain these locked all
the time you can select this constrain
proportions right here and now when we
adjust these numbers let's say we say
400 it's gonna go up to 400 keep in mind
if this constraint proportions is
checked you still need to hold the shift
key if you're dragging this if you let
go the shift key it's not going to
constrain the proportions
okay now this x and y value up top here
is its position on the canvas if we were
to have a frame it would be its position
in that frame if we were to have a
component which we'll get into more it
will be that position within its
component and these values are going to
get really super useful in a way that I
do
think they're necessarily as useful in
other applications because the position
can be relative to so many different
things okay so here we have our square
let's go ahead and make an oval so I'm
gonna select our shape here you know I
could just hit the O key or hit the
ellipse tool right here click and drag
you can see it's the same business here
I hold I hold shift pops up hold the
shift and option and it keeps it from
the center I just hold option it keeps
it from the center and it's not regular
all the same goodies that you'd normally
expect from basic shape of creation so
we have our square we have our circle
let's go ahead and create another shape
here I'm gonna get into the arrow tool
and the arrow tool is interesting
because I've never found the arrow tool
to be useful at all and sketch because
it looks so ugly so you can see here we
have a line and what does this line
actually look like when we increase the
weight now what's cool about this line
is that first off it looks much nicer
than the sketch arrow I'm not writing on
sketcher the sketch I was just totally
useless this one at least just looks
nice so when we increase the weight on
this one what happens the sketch one
completely blows up and you'll notice
this one does not completely blow up in
a way that's really nice actually it
actually is becoming a useful arrow that
we can use and scale and add fill to and
maybe you're doing some design with this
thing and you know pointing this one to
this one so we have our arrow okay so
now let's get into a line tool which is
when you'll be using a lot lines are
used quite a bit in design and you can
see if we're not holding down the shift
key you get full access to all of the
angles for holding down the shift key
you can see it snaps to 45 degree
increments and again if we hold the
option key it's going to grow from the
center rather than from one end and if
we hold the shift key again that's going
to snap to this 45 degree angles now we
have some options for the line tool we
can give it some weight we can give it a
stroke color which is basically the
of the line here and we can make this
literally anything you can add different
things to the stroke we'll be getting
into the more this I keep saying that
but I mean it's really true there's so
much here and there's going to be a lot
to cover so there's no point in covering
absolutely everything right now so as
you can see we have something special
though with this shape we have some dot
dot dots right here on our stroke and
you can see we can change our cap so our
cap is going to be if this is a
basically a a stroke where it's bent at
any given point you can choose whether
it's going to be a captive that's gonna
be rounded whether it's going to be
basic miter which is just like a pointy
end as you can see we can give this a
cap where we have the select where we
can say hey ends of this line should be
round and so this line should be square
should be a arrow which is actually
really super good right because this
just made an arrow without having to
make an arrow but not only that we get
an arrow on both sides it could be very
useful we also have a triangle arrow
which you'll notice is a little bit
different really cool we can also do
dashes and gaps and we can do those by
simply having a comma-separated number
so we can say with the dash being the
length of the - and the gap being the
space between them so let's say we want
our spaces to be two pixels and our
dashes to be five pixels we can have
five comma two and when we click off of
here you'll see we have our space in
here and if we grow this it's just going
to increase that space and leave this as
a straight line here alright I should
say flat line here instead of on an
angle and we can just adjust this as we
see fit as you can see all this stuff is
sort of what you'd expect to have where
it is is underneath stroke dot you'll
see this dot dot anytime that you have
sort of advanced or different features
on a given tool or on a given property
some shapes have different advanced
property
than others and now that we've talked
about this now that we've talked about
this dot dot dot let's see how it
actually applies to the arrow that we
already created you'll see that we also
have these dot dot dots where we
basically are saying hey this is an
advanced stroke and our cap is mixed if
we were to change it to anything it
would actually not become the same arrow
it once was however there is actually a
way to do that because these are all
just vector points right and we're gonna
be able to update this line as well like
this we actually have access to the
vector you'll notice when I hover over
this we have two squares on either end
here if I double click onto this object
you'll see those squares become circles
these circles can be selected
individually as individual points and
this is something that is very common in
any sort of vector based tooling you
could see if I select the tip of the
arrow with the circle and then select
our ellipses we have access to change
this line arrow to a triangle arrow so
as you can see we can modify this and we
can change each individual vector point
to do what we want it to do I'm going to
bring it back to a line arrow because I
personally think it looks better but as
you can see here we can modify any of
our stroke individual points with these
advanced settings
okay let's click out of that so we have
an arrow we've created a new arrow I'm
just gonna turn this back to a line we
don't need two arrows let's go there
okay we have our dotted line we have our
arrow we have our circle now let's go
ahead and check out our polygon tool
where we can click and drag we have a
basic triangle now again if we double
click this you can see we have access to
all of the individual points we can make
this any kind of triangular shape we
want we could do more than that we could
modify it in all sorts of different ways
with the pen tool would love which we're
going to be getting in when we go over
the pen tool you also notice that when I
have this double click we have some new
tools up here including a pen a bend
tool and a paint bucket tool if we were
to click done it would
deselect this for us now you'll notice
it when we have this selected it's this
count three right here and it's pretty
small you might not be able to see it
correctly on my screen here but you'll
see it on yours and this is basically
the number of points because this is a
polygon not necessarily a triangle tool
we can bump this up and say hey four
points okay we've got a diamond door
square five points we have a Pentagon
hexagon and so on a gun oh that was bad
joke okay so like as you can see here
all the way to I do dodecagon deck good
dodeca gun I don't know I'm not I don't
remember my geometry that well but you
can keep adding points as pretty much as
much as you want to as much as it makes
sense and we have a whole bunch of
different polygons here basically
anything you'd want to do from three
upwards notice how we don't have those
dot dot dots here on our fill and we
don't even have a stroke now I should
point out too this is something I keep
going back to sketch features and stuff
like that this is something that is
actually very different in sketch in a
very positive way when you create a
shape and sketch it gives you a fill and
a stroke on every single shape and how
many times in your work and sketch have
you immediately removed that stroke or
immediately removed that fill or
whatever I mean it's just an extra clip
to get it started in thick my it doesn't
assume that you want a stroke for
anything so if you want an outline on
any of your shapes you want to want to
go ahead and select this plus now you
have a stroke you can change the weight
of it we have our dot dots once again we
can change the cap and all sorts of
stuff like that so as you can see here
we have our triangle and this can become
any sort of polygon we'd like it to be
okay next up we have our star tool which
doesn't have a shortcut just like the
polygon doesn't have a shortcut I'm
assuming that's because you probably
won't use these a ton and we can click
and drag
once again shift for a regular shape now
with any of these things like star tools
and in these programs you're probably
used to having a count for how many star
points you have
you notice it's right here one of the
things I really like about figma is how
adaptive these menus and toolbars are so
our toolbar over here has all of this
information but for each different type
of shape it changes and modifies so that
basically the relevant information is
there and not always hidden behind a
menu sometimes of course it is in behind
the dot but that's usually for extra
things like stroke and whatever if it's
sort of essential for the shape it's
gonna be right here you can see we can
make this six point seven point eight
point nine point whatever star and the
radius is going to be is going to be the
percentage of space inside of the star
you can see is this gross the points get
shallower and shallower up until we're
at a hundred percent and that's pretty
much a circle right so if we keep going
down it's going to be very very pointy
and that should be nice now in addition
we also have at this rounded edge which
is at zero and if we were to around the
edge you'll notice all of our points get
softer and softer by whatever radius so
this is a 10 pixel radius and no we know
I'm sort of like a cog of shape this is
like a sort of like and it's sort of a
soft cog right like a real cog wouldn't
be so soft but as you can see here we
can adjust this radius and completely
change the softness of this star you
might be wondering does this radius
exist for all of these other shapes well
of course it does because we want to use
a radius very frequently we now have a
rounded triangle which looks sort of
like a yield sign we have a square which
can become a rounded edge square you see
this a ton in web design if you're
building like a card style layout or
something like that you're gonna want to
change this border radius which is a
right up top here so this icon with the
rounded edges your rounded edges and
lastly we have this icon to the left of
that which is simply just the angle at
which it's living currently you probably
saw this manipulating if you were
rotating your shape or anything like
that or when we had our line creation I
want this to be at zero since we're now
150 at zero just since we're showing off
the shape itself now the last thing we
have is the place image tool now the
place image tool can be accessed by
shift command kaor shift control k npc
and what we want to do is actually cover
the place image tool in more depth
because working with images and figma is
really super cool it actually affords
you a lot of different freedoms that
other vector applications don't because
typically working in vector applications
you're straight vectors right so like
having really good image tools and
something like figma is definitely a
plus so in the next video we're gonna be
covering place image and more
specifically working with images overall
inside of shapes outside of shapes
whatever it's gonna be really cool and
we're gonna learn some really good
time-saving tools okay so thanks so much
