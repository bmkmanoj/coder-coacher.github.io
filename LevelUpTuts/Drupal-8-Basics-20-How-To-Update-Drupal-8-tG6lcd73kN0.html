up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be installing an update to
Drupal now this isn't the easiest
process in the world
Drupal still has not necessarily solved
the easy updating the process it's not
one-click so follow along as we show you
how to install the next version of
Drupal on top of your previous version
ok so in the last video we installed a
new theme I'm not totally committed to
that particular themes so I'm actually
going to set bootstrap itself as the
default and sort of see what's going on
here after that I'm going to head to the
home of our website give this a refresh
and as you can see it's not bad it's
certainly nice let's actually refresh
the incognito not logged in version and
as you can see it's very very bare-bones
but it looks pretty nice and if you are
doing a starter theme and you wanted to
modify this or something like this it
would be a good starting point okay so
either way we have this bootstrap theme
let's head to extend from here let's go
to update now what you can see here is
that we do have a new version of Drupal
it says we have checked 49 seconds ago
for module updates however manual
updates are requires well you're not
able to do is you're not able to update
Drupal core through this interface
updates to Drupal core not support it at
this time so what we can't do is can't
click a button and have just the new
version of Drupal installed that's a
total bummer that's something that I
really wish existed in Drupal you'll see
we have the installed version but the
recommended version is at 8.0 3 and we
want to make sure we stay on these
recommended versions so do we do well we
can actually open this Drupal core link
in a new tab
it's going to take us to the Drupal
project page where we can then click on
this zero eight point zero three
recommended release here and again we
have the option of downloading it now
you can see under update and yeah we
can't just paste in and the URL
somewhere so we have to physically
download this tar.gz
now the thing about this is is that when
we have this tar.gz
we're gonna have to open this up but
this contains all of the files that our
whole Drupal site has already I mean
this is a total fresh copy of Drupal
here so what we don't want to do is just
drop this into our project so what's the
strategy here well first I recommend
before doing any major updates that you
take date that you take a backup of
everything backup your files backup your
database take backups that way in case
something goes wrong you're not stuck
right you're not stuck with the site
that doesn't work and you can't go back
so always take backups that's a big
thing so here I have my Drupal folder
inside of my htdocs since I'm using MAMP
and this example basically you're one of
browse to wherever your Drupal site is
now if you're on I know if you're on an
actual host this is going to be a harder
process you're probably gonna have to do
this through FTP instead of dragging and
dropping it through your finder or
something like that okay so we have our
tar.gz let's open this up unzip it and
we're going to have a Drupal folder now
let's open this Drupal folder up now I
can see these hidden files you might not
be able to see these that's alright
because these are unlikely to change
Shaul wouldn't worry too much about
these and so now I'm gonna select
everything that's not a hidden file here
and I'm going to unselect by holding
command and just pick the modules sites
and themes so we want everything that's
not module sites and themes drag drop
and it's gonna ask you if you want to
replace whatever I'm going to click
replace okay so we now have the new
Drupal 8.03 installed we have our module
still we have our themes so we have
everything in here but what we need to
do is we need to come to localhost and
then slash update dot PHP this is going
to run a database update
let's go ahead and click continue you
can see we have one pending update which
is a pending update to the image module
itself which is part of core we can
apply depending update and this is going
to update our database so that
everything is working correctly
sometimes you might see errors after
updating and this usually takes care of
it okay so let's head back to the
administrative pages and let's do
something really quickly let's head to
configuration and let's scroll all the
way down to performance so let's click
on performance analysis take this
opportunity to clear all caches now
somebody once made a thing that was
something like the ten commandments of
Drupal and the number one is always
clear the cache seriously if you are
having some issues or some errors or
some weirdness things not showing up in
the right space come here
clear all cache and you might see a nice
little improvement okay so we've now
cleared the cache we've updated to the
latest version if we head to extend we
had to update and you can see all of
your projects are up to date if we check
manually it's going to check really
quick and again it's checked all six of
our projects which include the themes
and the modules and everything is up to
date this is a nice little system it's
not as nice as some other content
management systems like I said but it is
a huge improvement for Drupal so we've
now updated the core version of Drupal
and we're ready to go once again as
always this is Scott with level of
tutorials and that concludes the Drupal
basics tutorial series now there's gonna
be a lot more Drupal 8 videos on the way
if this isn't enough configuration and
customization for you I'm going to be
doing a customizing Drupal series very
soon we're gonna have a lot more
beginner to intermediate Drupal content
so keep watching level up tutorials a
lot more drupal videos coming very soon
thanks for watching and if you want to
help support the creation of these free
tutorials by purchasing this series or
sign up to be a level of pro head to
store that level of tutorials dot-com I
would love if you could help out thanks
so much and I'll see you in the next one
