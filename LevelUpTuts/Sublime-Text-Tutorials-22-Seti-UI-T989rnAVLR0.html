up tutorials and today I'm sure you one
of my favorite packages for sublime text
3 that I've been using called SETI UI
now SETI includes a color scheme
includes a theme and even some nice
things like file icons which makes
browsing your project structure really
nice and easy so let's get going with
steady UI right now now study UI is
really easily available through our
package control so if we do command
shift P or ctrl shift P on a PC and then
type in package control install just
like we have for pretty much any package
we've wanted to install we can go ahead
and search for study which is SETI and
you'll see there's an sei sette UI and a
setting UX so if we install this let's
go ahead and grab the SETI UX as well so
we can say command shift P okay install
package and then set E and now city UX
you can say improved uh scheming syntax
idling for sublime text okay great so we
now have that it now wants you to select
the theme to be studied on sublime theme
and you can do that by simply going into
by copying this line here and coming
into your preferences settings user
inside here you could just put it inside
of here where we have a theme you could
paste this instead I use a package
called themer so if I do command shift P
and then the themer
list themes this is the easiest way for
me to change the themes that way you
don't have to be editing files and stuff
like that okay so now we have the study
UI theme applied now let's apply the
color scheme by simply going to
preferences color schemes and then let's
find city UI selected okay so you now
see some initial changes right off the
bat we have this nice little v next door
HTML we have this folder icon that turns
into an open folder and let's actually
see what I'll let other things we have
here it says and here are some extra
settings that you could paste into your
sublime dot settings and these can be
some nice things like having
and extra width on your carrot extra
bottom on your carrot extra top on your
carrot overlay scrollbars is enable the
highlight line is true these things are
gonna see the moment that we put these
in here so if we do comma on our sublime
top settings paste these in here just
like that make sure this last one
doesn't have a comma because this is a
JavaScript object okay you can now see a
little bit of a difference our carrot
goes above the line and below the line
by extra three pixels on both both
accounts there it's now too wide instead
of a single line you can see I really
like the color scheme it has a really
nice look to it and you get this nice
line selection now that we've pasted
these settings in here and we have these
nice icons and you'll see in the
instructions here it also says it for
better recognition of file types install
this apply syntax so if we do command
shift P package install package let's
look for apply some text okay
and it's just going to be better syntax
detection so what's really nice about
setting UI in addition to having these
nice little features like these icons
for your file type is a nice color
scheme it gives you some helpful
settings that just make your experience
in sublime text better overall and it
gives you some recommendations for
things to use
so let's actually see this in another
project I'm gonna open up a recent
project here you can see this has a very
bit more varied file icons so for stylus
there's a little stylus icon and p.m.
for our package.json gulp file has the
gulp logos CSS has the css3 logo so as
you can see instantly these local icons
help out a ton so check out semi UI I've
been using it for a couple weeks now and
I'm pretty much not interested in using
anything else for a little while so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment this video or

next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
