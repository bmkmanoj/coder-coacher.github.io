up tutorials and today we're gonna be
covering one of the most useful sketch
plugins if you work in a team
perhaps you're sending off your design
to a developer or maybe you just want to
have things that labeled in a way that
you can see them nice and easy when
you're having either yourself or
somebody else code up your design this
is called sketch measure and so it
actually measures all of your objects on
your page based on what you want it to
do and it gives them little labels on
your document therefore you can export
your document maybe as a PDF maybe as an
image or something sent to your designer
your developer whoever's building the
site and then that person will have all
of the values just like they need them
for margins for colors for font sizes
and things like that
I'll output directly annotated on your
design so it's super useful check out
sketch measure so here we have this
totally fictional layout this isn't any
sort of complete design or anything so
don't worry about too much about that
however it's gonna be nice to have a
useful example that we can see to mock
up using sketch measure so the first
thing we need to do is install sketch
measure we can do that with our toolbox
I'm gonna just go ahead and go do sketch
toolbox here I open that using Alfred if
you if you don't use that app you should
check it out it's really great so now we
can just search for measure and you'll
notice that the first one is sketch
measure let's go ahead and select that
and it's going to download and install
okay so we now have sketch measure
installed on our computer let's see how
we can use this to make our work flow a
little bit better let's say we're
passing this off now if you've already
had sketch open when you installed this
plug-in you're gonna have to close
sketch and then you can go ahead and
reopen it
it's up in my recent file that we just
had going on okay here we go
now let's get to measuring let's say we
wanted to annotate this header we wanted
to let the designers know that this
header is going to be 62 pixels tall so
what we could do is select this layer
select this rectangle from here we can
do ctrl shift - and you'll notice it
wants you to choose your resolution so
you can use standard one x equals one
pixel so basically that's going to make
62 equal to 62 pixels you can also use
points in retina points where
everything's doubled retina HD which is
times 3 and then you have all these
other options times 4 times 3 times 2
whatever since I'm just going to be
using this in pixels we can go ahead and
help with this that way that way if the
designer or the developer needs to do
some sort of math to figure out
percentages it's nice and simple so we
can just click Save and you'll notice
that we have some information here so
let's zoom in and check this out so now
what you'll see is that we've had some
things created for us we have this box
that shows how tall it is and we have
this box with a line that shows how wide
this is in fact if we click over and
let's say we just drag this over you can
now see that there's little ticks on the
bottom ticks on the top to let you sort
of know that this is signifying the
height now what's interesting here is
that since this design is going to be
layout it's gonna be responsive and
things like that
the developers did in this case don't
really need to know how wide this
document is because it's going to be
changing and things are going to be
fluid and in whatever so what's great
about this is that if we don't want any
of this information it's created these
as two completely separate groups we can
just go ahead and select this width and
just click delete now you can really
measure anything let's say we wanted to
measure the
mentions of this logo here we could do
the same thing ctrl shift - and now we
have these annotations right here so
it's 130 wide 46 tall perfect so as you
can see we're mocking up our document
now let's get to measuring some space
okay so we measured now the sides of
things which is control shift - now
let's measure the spacing of an item now
these shortcuts where you do control
shift and then a number you'll see this
repeating throughout this plugin if you
need a cheat sheet you can always go to
the github page for the sketch measure
I'll put that in the video description
and so let's go ahead and measure the
distance between something now you'll
notice here that we have these play
buttons and we want to measure the
distance between the play button and the
tutorial name so I've had these both
selected here I did that just by holding
shift and clicking or you can just sort
of click and drag and select those two
now we can do ctrl shift 3 this time to
measure the space in between you notice
it steel its measuring the space in
between and it's is 17 pixels we can
further see this by it let's say we move
this one over 3 and let's select these
two and do control shift 3 you should
see it nicest funny I guess it maybe
wasn't perfect before it's 19 now so I'm
gonna go ahead and undo that and just
move this back to where it was as you
can see we've measured the distance
between two items but let's say we
wanted to measure the distance between
these two lines so for this to work you
always need to select two elements so if
we select this play button in this top
line we could do again control shift 3
now once again select D play button in
the bottom line control shift 3 now
you'll notice that some of these are
overlapping so what we could really do
is find this one just by clicking it you
see it here and we can bump it over or
if that's not what you'd like to do you
can actually take this and go ahead and
further modify it by moving some of the
important information such as the text
and the box here and we
just drag this over here move it like so
and now let's take the triangle and we
have that selected as this the diamond
up here and I'm just moving it over like
that so you can see because these are
just building sketch layers for us we
can take them and modify them as needed
cool so let's say this isn't really
clear what the bounding box for this
play button is let's say we want to have
this be some sort of a square overlay
since that's really what it's taking up
in the dumb anyways we can go ahead and
create an overlay with control shift 1
and now you can see it has this red box
around it if we were to move this red
box to the bottom of the chain here now
all of our other things are gonna
overlay on top of it and you can see
this illustrates quite nicely the
spacing here okay
let's get some text information now some
typography information let's go ahead
and select this text field here this is
going to be the series name and now I
just have to do ctrl shift 4 and
amazingly we get this box that says 36
pixels open sans condensed it says the
color and RGB as well as a hex value
let's select this tutorial name we can
go and do the same and we can just do
ctrl shift 4 and as you can see we have
another 36 pixel open sans this one's
condensed light and these same color and
as you can see as i zoom out this is
turning into a really nicely annotated
file and in fact crates like this would
take you quite a bit of time so these
annotations are really to help other
people or to help you understand the
patterns that you're coming up with when
creating your design ok now we have two
more items to go over within sketch
measure let's say we wanted to grab some
properties for instance we wanted to
grab some properties of this circle so
let's go ahead and hand zoom back in
here and the circle play button I have
the layer selected I'm going to actually
open this folder up select the oval
itself and then from here with
do control shift five it's gonna ask you
what you want since I only really want
the fill value I'm going to unselect
border color because there's no border
and there's no shadow or anything like
that these are the properties that
allows you to select let's click Save
and we now have the fill for the Oval in
fact we can set that right there and
then now let's selected the triangle
do the same thing control shift five
we're gonna select the fill and as you
can see this is a a and hex and 170 all
out in RGB cool so we now have both of
those annotated as well so the developer
doesn't have to come in here and click
this double click this open up the
triangle select the triangle and then
click fill and then find out that it's
ace okay so that makes it really nice
and easy to work with the less
annotation is going to just be to draw a
standard label so these labels as you
can see are all just square boxes white
text with a bit of color to stand out
let's say you want to label this fill so
let's say we wanted to let them know
that this annotation is in fact this
triangle so we can make a text link and
we can just say triangle now with this
triangle text selected we could do ctrl
shift 6 and it turns that text into a
label so now we have triangle in fact if
you wanted to just duplicate this you
could duplicate this then edit this text
to say circle but you'll notice that the
label isn't going to fit the text itself
so or you could just type circle again
and then do ctrl shift 6 okay so we now
have a document that's looking really
nicely annotated here but let's say we
want to go back to designing this how
are we gonna have to get by all of these
annotations well we can actually show
and hide the annotations themselves so
let's toggle all of them hidden by doing
control shift H and they're all hidden
you can do it again ctrl shift H in
there back and likewise let's see we
don't want any of these touched let's
say once
you've done your annotations typically
you're not going to want to move them
around you can do ctrl shift
L and it locks all of them so now we
can't accidentally select or grab one we
can modify our document as needed and
then perhaps change our annotations
later let's say we hate all of our
annotations we want to see them gone
they were just a bad idea let's say you
wanted to get rid of them you could
always come to plugin sketch measure and
then click clear reset artboard measure
and now they're all gone and we have to
choose our resolution setup again I'm
gonna click cancel and then do command C
I'm gonna save this and you can download
the sketch file from a link in the video
description I'll have it available after
this video has been published so you can
play around with that check it out as
always thus escape a level up tutorials
if you have any questions or comments so
you could come in the video Airness
about Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
