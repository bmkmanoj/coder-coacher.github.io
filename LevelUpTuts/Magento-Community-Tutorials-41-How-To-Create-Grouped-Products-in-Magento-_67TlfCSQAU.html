love Tut's and today I'm going to show
you the crates and product types that we
didn't go over in the past videos on
creating different product types and
we're going to go over creating group
products bundle products
virtual products and and I'm going to
show you how to update Magento of course
all these are going to be in one video
there's going to be separate videos but
I am coming back with the Magento videos
there's going to be many more I did get
burnt out on them for a while just by
doing so many of them but now I'm back
I'm ready to do some more Magento videos
so keep on the lookout for even more
videos coming also we have launched a
new level of Tut's calm it's nice and
responsive so it adjusts your mobile
phone looks good everywhere so check
that out so you can see all of our
videos on here check out what our latest
video is or suggest videos or just
contact us if you need to keep in mind
the site is launching and sort of like a
beta situation so there's things like
these images are missing and I just
needed to get a new setup the current
one wasn't doing it for me
we now actually finally have working
breadcrumbs which is apparently a big
deal so check it out to check out the
new level of Tut's calm and let us know
what you think okay so let's get into
this Magento and the first thing we're
going to do in this video is we're going
to create a grouped product and so one
is group product well in your demo store
if you have the demo content or even if
you don't you may have seen products
that say like starting at this is
starting at $15 if we click it you can
see there's this box here where instead
of being a drop-down and we only get to
pick a specific type like a size or
something like that this gives our
customers the option of buying multiple
different products all in one go we add
these to our cart and then you'll be
able to see it's now added six different
hats to our cart cool so I've may
actually made a new attribute set and
it's T's so the example I'm going to be
using is a blue
coming T which if you haven't seen it is
this flowering tea this is blooming tea
calm and basically it's these little tea
blooms these little balls of tea that
bloom into flowers so I have an image
here and I'm going to create a product
and the product is going to have three
different sizes in each size is going to
contain a certain amount of blooms which
are these tea balls so we can say let's
go to manage products and then we're
going to add a product and we want it to
be the a tree instead of tea I know this
doesn't really fit the theme of our
store but it works so we're going to say
grouped product is the one we want and
we're going to click continue so this is
just going to be box of blooms and
doesn't have a skew like anything so we
can just give it a fake skew of course
we want these status to be enabled and
visibility we want it all over and it's
not a new product we don't have to worry
about it I suppose the country
manufacturer is China so we can select
China head now prices so the thing about
this is the price in these group
products is not determined at this base
product so we don't have to worry about
anything here however the meta
information and I'm just going to grab
some content from the site now keep in
mind I know a the owners of this site
and they are ok with me using this
information for this video now we're
going to go to images and let's upload
an image image of the tea here and we're
going to go to upload this yeah so don't
don't rip off images and content from
someone else's site if you don't have
their approval first so now we're going
to put in the description again okay
and this is just like normally filling
out a normal product keep in mind this
description is what's going to be on the
actual product page so this is the stuff
you wanted to have the grouped product
that information is not going to show up
on the page each individual product
it's just this overall group products
information so the description the
images the design that sort of stuff so
we don't need to change the design we
don't need to end a gift options
inventory of course we want to select in
stock because you know we have this
product and it's going to be in our main
store and for our categories well it
doesn't really fit in any of these
categories and I don't really feel like
creating a new category at the moment so
I'm actually just going to throw this in
two hats and apparel I know that sounds
weird but forgive me for this is another
real store and now we don't have any
related products up cells or cross cells
and we actually don't have any
associated products yet so let's click
Save and continue so now if we come down
here to associated products it says
there is none well what do we do here
well in a configurable product you can
create individual products from this
associated product screen however for
the group product you're not going to be
able to do that so what we need to do is
now go to manage products add a new
product and create our tees so we're
going to have them be a simple product
and it's going to be tea of course and
uh we can have this a ten blooms and of
course the SKU should be something that
makes sense here and it's going to be
enabled it's going to be taxable goods
it's posed and then we want it to be
visible in the catalog and search I mean
you could have this be a visible all
over the store or you could have it be
not visible individually since we're
going to have them be able to select
this as a group product we can say not
visible individually and your customers
will only see this as the grouping so
that way your product listing won't get
with ten blooms 20 blooms 30 blooms 40
blooms or whatever and we just have them
individually as our group individually
into this group product so now the price
will just say keep it simple 10 bucks
for 10 blooms ok and meta-information we
don't need this information right now
and even though we're selecting an image
here it's not going to matter it's
really just going to show the the group
products image so maybe I should just
skip it for the next ones description
I'm just going to throw this in here but
of course it's going to show the grouped
products description like I mentioned
before now we want to select this to be
in stock and we do not want to manage
stock on this so we're in stock whatever
we're good
so let's go to websites it's on the main
store categories we can say it's in
these categories but since this isn't
showing up individually we don't have to
put it in anything so let's not worry
about that and there's no custom options
so let's click Save and now here's what
I'm going to save a little bit of time
here I'm going to go ahead and find all
of my products here and I'm going to
click on this one and notice how there's
this duplicate button right here you can
just duplicate this product and what
it's going to do is it's going to fill
in a lot of these fields like the name
for you but the ones that you know it's
going to change like the SKU it's not
going to fill in so everything is good
here we can change this to $20 ok and
all this stuff is good and let's also go
to inventory really quick
notice how this one also says it's out
of stock we're going to select this two
in stock but then we also wanted to say
manor stock no I actually don't know
there there's some weird stuff with
managing stock here so I always make
sure I check that too yes before I say
manage stock no I don't know if that's
overly cautious or something but now
click Save and now I'm going to do this
once more and we're going to create 30
blooms duplicate here and then
we're going to be ready to finish off
our kit our grouped product you think
the way it would go up a little bit so I
can have that prices be $30 not much of
a savings break on this and then we're
going to want to not manage stock again
no save it cool up we forget SKU or I
forgot to see you and now we have our
three blooms they're all simple products
and we have our group product that's a
box of blooms so now we can click into
this box of blooms we can click
associated products and in here we can
type the name blooms or just whatever
our products are and then hit enter and
what's going to do is it's going to
search for them the reason it didn't
find anything is because this is checked
to yes and this means is it already
associated with this product since we
have nothing associated it's not going
to find a thing instead I'm going to
select any which is going to look for
any product on our site that has the
word blooms in it I'm going to check
these three boxes and now let's click
Save great so let's come to a front-end
of our site and if you remember we put
these under heads we scroll down you'll
see our box of blooms here and now it
says starting at $10 so it doesn't just
say $10 because there's more than one
product associated I click this and we
now have this and it looks like it just
has these ten blooms so what's going on
here well if I had to guess I would say
it was a problem with the duplication
process and if you had a quick eye you
might have seen that these two
additional duplications were not
selected to be enabled so if we click
these back and we change their status to
be enabled save and then enabled saved
great
now if we check our page we have our
official grouped product working and if
you'll notice they have these quantities
in here you can actually set default
quantities if you come into your group
product and go down to associated
products over here you can say this is
one they automatically all have one so
you can force your customers to
automatically have one of each which
might be a dark pattern or something you
don't want to do so we can just say one
for the smallest one and also if you
wanted this one to be on the top and it
wasn't for some reason you could give
them weights so one would be lower and
then two would be even lower even though
they're in the correct order right now
this of course would guarantee that so
now if we save refresh now ten blooms is
always going to be at the top and it
automatically has a quantity of one
notice how we can add here at the cart
and just like we saw before it's adding
the ten blooms and the 30 blooms
individually as separate products not as
one product so that's the difference
between configurable products and
grouped products because a configurable
product is a product itself where group
product is letting you buy more than one
single product at a time this is Scott
