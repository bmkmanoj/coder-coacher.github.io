love hugs and today we're going to be
going over how to add multiple
background images and some of the cool
stuff you can do with multiple
background images and it's a really cool
thing and something I feel like you
don't see used a whole ton in a bunch of
cool ways but it could it has a lot of
potential to be used in really
interesting ways and it's really great
that css3 allows for this capability
what's even better is that it's really
easy it could be any easier actually to
declare multiple background so let's see
how something like this would work and
first thing we're going to do is I grab
this triangular pattern from a subtle
patterns and I'm going to throw it onto
the back here and it's just going to be
the main background of this this whole
page so let's go ahead and let's declare
the body having a background of actually
this purple is a fallback for this
so we'll say URL and this is in dot IMG
and I believe this is just triangular
dot PNG cool and we're going to say this
is going to repeat so I'm just going to
not declare anything else here then
let's come back to our page cool we now
see this this triangular pattern right
and so what happens if I want a level of
Hutt's logo also as a background image
on this same thing right so we want to
have a second background image well just
for start we're going to say no-repeat
here and then we're going to have a
comma I'm actually just going to get rid
of this hex value with just getting in
the way around and we're going to clear
another URL here and then in quotes dot
mg Lord slash and I'm actually going to
use the same logo dot PNG just for
because I want to UM right here and
again we're going to say no-repeat
that and we're going to see what happens
okay so check this out so what's
happened is that both of them have
stacked on top of each other and what's
really interesting about this is that
the level of Tut's logo is underneath
this triangular so why is it underneath
well you may want to think about it like
this where in HTML things are you know
that if they're lower down they stack on
top with this it's more like this right
so we see and I wish I had more space in
here basically the URL that gets the
declared first the image here is the
first one that's going to be on top it's
essentially like it's the highest in
order and then lowest and then if we
keep on adding images it's just going to
keep on being loader lower and lower in
order so this is really cool but you
have to know how to use it right so now
if we swap these I'm actually just going
to take this put it here comma enter
cool get rid of this bring this up here
we're not going to see our logo on top
of the pattern so if we tell our pattern
to not no-repeat we now have this logo
up here it's a background image it's a
background image on the body and so is
this pattern so it's really cool this is
the first time you've ever been able to
do anything like this I have a
background image on the body that's
super cold and what else can we do we
can actually declare position and stuff
on it as well and you could do that in
several ways we could have our
background position be something like
top I'm sorry right top and the other
one is not going to be declared so now
it's on the right top pretty cool so we
have all sorts of ways to control this
but you can actually even specify
background position using the background
position still like
this we would just have to specify each
one individually by a comma so if we
said right top we could do comma and
left top and now the second one is
referring to the second background image
that's being loaded this triangular dot
PNG Oh background position oops there we
go perfect cool so we're now using two
images as a background on the body
they're being layered on top of one
another and that's pretty cool we have
lots of potential here for great things
so let's talk about browser support like
who's supporting this basically you can
use it on a movie I don't know any
version of Chrome really because it's
version 10 and later and they're up to
like 20 G's twenty-something now and
then uh there's also Internet Explorer 9
and up so ie 8 and lower you're sort of
not able but maybe you can use some
progressive enhancement or something and
design your site so it looks ok without
multiple background images if you have
to support ie8 and then it's also
supported in Safari since version 1.3
and Firefox it's version 3.6 so it's
it's pretty widely supported so try to
use multiple backgrounds on your
projects and see what kind of cool stuff
you can do so as always this is a Skype
with level of cuts if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the venue area does have been Twitter
level up Hut's let us know what you're
thinking
we're on Facebook we're all over the
place so let's know thanks for watching
