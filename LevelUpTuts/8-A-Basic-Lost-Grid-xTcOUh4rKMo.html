up tutorials in this video we're gonna
peel to our first real grid with lost
now this is gonna be some basics but
it's gonna show you just how cool lost
is to get started really super quickly
and just throw a basic lost column
property on your element and just how
much that actually takes care of for you
so let's get going on that right now
okay so in the last video we got all set
up with post CSS now what I've done is
I've gone ahead and made a section with
five divs inside of it and as you can
see by looking at our CSS we really just
have a height and the background color
assigned to each of the grid items now
grid one is the section container for
this grid that we're going to be using
now let's go ahead and use a lost
utility so we can say lost - utility and
then colon and then clear fix now this
is going to make sure our container has
a clear fix on it now what we want to do
is come here and we can say something
like dot grid 1 and then div to look for
any divs inside of grid 1 and now we can
go ahead and say that the lost
- column like what we saw in the last
video is going to be equal to 1/2 or 1/2
so looking at this we should see
essentially since we have 5 we should
see 3 rows each with two of these grid
items in the last with one grid item and
they're gonna be this background color
height of 100 so let's refresh in our
browser here and it looks like this
section isn't going getting the full
width so on our grid 1 we want to say
100% so now our container width is 100%
and actually I'm not throw a margin
bottom on each of these 2 while we're at
it of just 20 pixels
okay now let's come and refresh our
browser and as you can see this is what
we would have expected it has three rows
each with two items in there you can see
that the first one has the gutter and
the second one does not so this is
really super nice you'll see some extra
padding and stuff on here like on the
body and HTML we don't have a normalized
CSS normalized in here right now so it's
getting some default browser styles but
other than that the grid system is
looking mighty fantastic now let's
actually come back here and let's change
this like we did in the last video from
1/2 to 1/3
you can refresh and you can see
instantly without having really to tell
it a whole lot it gets this cycle and
the grids correct again we can just keep
changing this and refreshing and as you
can see it's just so easy we didn't have
to really tell it a whole lot we didn't
have to tell it the cycle we didn't have
to tell really
it just knew what to do now let's go
ahead and add some divs to this div grid
item so we can come here I'm just going
to say that's did grid item actually I'm
gonna make two of these like so
okay now nested grid items going to get
a different color here I'm just gonna
make this C nested grid item and this is
just going to be a BG red because I
don't want to look up of color for this
right now and we can come here and give
this a height of let's just say 50
pixels and a margin bottom of 10 pixels
okay so what's interesting here is that
this grid is now saying any child of
grid 1 that's a div apply this 1/4 lost
column to it so let's actually see what
happens when we open this up now
so as you can see this is really super
cool it's using actually the same
gutters because we haven't told it
otherwise yet but it's taking the two
divs inside that are nested inside of
this div and it's making them take up
what is in total half of this parent so
it's 1/4 and 1/4 just like if we were to
modify this and say one-third let's
refresh you can see that the children
are getting that rule as well and taking
up 1/3 but this was so little CSS to do
this I mean we really had one line here
and it's taking care of the grid it's
taking care of the nested grid the only
thing it's not doing is giving us a ton
of control yet but that doesn't mean
that loss doesn't give you that control
because certainly you can control
everything with lost in fact lost gives
you access to a lot of properties we can
use lost - cycle to modify the cycle or
you can simply add the cycle in here so
let's say this is 3 it's going to now
manually set the cycle to 3 that really
just controls this nth child right here
for instance if you wanted your let's
say for some reason you wanted your grid
to be like 3/6 right when we use this
cycle of 3 here it still uses 3 n
instead of the denominator here so if we
were to get rid of this save this like
so you can see it's gonna say every six
children get rid of the margin right
since this is essentially 1/2 3 6 we
actually want this to be 8 - and now
that's going to make sure that when we
come back to our page and refresh that
it is in fact getting the correct margin
right like I said if we were to just
simply remove this cycle now let's see
it in action you can see that the margin
right is being applied to the sixth item
and that's totally incorrect now we
could also come here and let's say we
want each of these to be 1/3 but we want
the cycle to be something like 2 so
every to get rid of the margin right
now in addition to removing just the
margin right it's also clearing left on
the every third item so this one we're
also getting a clear left which is
adding this to the next row and if we
wanted to modify the gutters we can do
that with just another property here
let's say we want to do something like
15 pixels instead of 30 refresh and that
trims our gutters to 15 pixels now there
is a ton more in this lost grid in fact
just to give you a little bit of a
glimpse you can see all of the features
that come in here they even do a nice
comparison against all the other major
grid systems like Susy jeet Foundation
and bootstrap and you can see you can
use it with Silas a stylist less sass
and it has all of these different types
of grids vertical grids waffle grids
flexbox grids fixed gutters it has
options for all sorts of stuff so in the
next few videos we're gonna be really
diving into lost and we're gonna create
some really awesome grids we're gonna
create some asymmetrical grids we're
gonna create some vertical some waffle
grids we're just gonna create a lot of
cool stuff so as always this is Scott
with LevelUp tutorials if you have any
questions or comments have you coming to
the video or hit us up at twitter or
facebook at LevelUp tutorials we love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
