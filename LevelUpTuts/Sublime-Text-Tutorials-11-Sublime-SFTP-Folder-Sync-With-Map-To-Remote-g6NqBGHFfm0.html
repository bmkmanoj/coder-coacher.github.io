level of HUD's and today I'm going to
show you
how to map a folder to a remote folder
on a server and maintain sync with them
so this is a really cool feature of
sublime SFTP it's probably my favorite
feature so what you first need to do is
make a a folder on your local machine
see I'm going to be making mine in my
sites folder and we're just going to
call this Scott and this is going to be
my own personal site you're going to
name this something distinct something
that you're going to be able to remember
and I'm going to drag this whole folder
into my projects window in sublime text
okay notice how this folder contains
absolutely nothing that's going to
change with this awesome feature so
we're going to right click on our folder
and under sublime SFTP there's this map
to remote and so we're going to want to
do that so let's click that button and
you'll notice the first thing it does is
it creates this F - SFTP config JSON
file and right now it's populated with
just the defaults if I save this it
saves it directly into our folder so now
that folder that we had that had no
files has just this this is just like
the other FTP application
um this is just like the other FTP
config file that we filled out in the
last video so I'm going to fill this out
with my information keep in mind you
want this remote path to be the path to
the folder that you're going to do so I
actually want this to be um on my Drupal
site like I was showing you before and
that was an HTTP Doc's
and then it was slash and then I might
not remember well its sites slash all
slash themes' slash and then let's check
it out so if I do shift command or shift
command P and I go to SFTP I browse my
server I can go to my server that I have
here and I can let's go up a folder
actually this is the exact folder I want
I want just my theme folder if you're
familiar with Drupal you'll know that
this is just a theme I don't want to
include all the rest of Drupal stuff but
I do want my theme which includes my CSS
my JavaScript all that
so um that's HTTP ducks slash sites
slash all slash themes' and then slash
as T so I want that to be my remote path
so this remote path this a folder st
this is what it's going to grab and it's
what it's going to sing so if that
doesn't make any sense
I just a hang tight I'm going to fill
all this information out just like we
had it before and when I come back I'm
going to do some magic okay so hang
tight I'm gonna head to my password here
save this file so you can't see it and
one quick thing I'm going to change this
upload on save from false to true cuz I
want whenever I save a file to
automatically upload you can check out
some of these other options there in
English so you can you know sort of
popular than at your own but for most
part I just use the defaults here and
save this and let's close out of it okay
when I come back it I'm going to map
this folder so now that I have that step
T P config file all loaded up with my
password if I correct FTP information
what we're going to do is we're going to
right click on our folder here and
you'll notice we have a whole lot more
options we can sync remote with local
which we don't want to do because what
that's going to do is it's going to make
our server look just like our local and
since our local has nothing in it it's
going to delete a whole bunch of stuff
so we're going to ignore that one and
the sync remote to local is going to do
the exact opposite and since we have
nothing in our local and we want the
latest updates from everything I have on
my server right now I'm just going to
pull down from my local or from my from
my server for my remote server and if
you sink both directions it sort of
checks which files are newer in both
locations and it just gives you the
newest version of each file in every
location so if we click sync remote with
local right now it's going to come up
here and say it's checking this and it's
determining this path and then what it's
going to do it's going to tell us all
these files this is what it's going to
do download download download create
great great if this already had files
here it would say delete this one delete
that one but
we have nothing it's just going to
download everything so it gives you this
prompt I'm going to click yes and it's
going to go to town it's going to
download everything so this is going to
do this for a second and once comes back
I'll show you exactly what happened okay
so now without even going to my file
structure you'll see that this folder is
completely populated with my CSS files
everything that I had in my sites folder
and looks pretty awesome I can go ahead
and edit some scripts that I have in
here and it's perfect
so one thing it you can do really
awesomely is is that since in this SFTP
JSON file I have it set to automatically
upload on save so anytime I edit any of
these files
this dialog is going to pop up and say
that it has uploaded it and if that's
like way too big for you you can drag it
down and now you'll notice it's just
this little window down here but every
time you save it's going to tell you
that that file got uploaded that's sweet
that's awesome
that's really great that's exactly what
we wanted to do so it's really great
about this is all these files are now on
my computer locally and let's say if I
wanted to edit this s CSS file and I had
code kit watch this folder or SAS watch
this folder I made a save to this file
it's going to upload the s CSS it's
going to compile I could then go over to
the CSS file click save and upload that
one and now I can edit a SAS file on my
server locally in a way that is not too
intrusive and also if this is sync let's
say you've modified these files from
somewhere else you can always right
click on this and sync both directions
and it's going to come up here and tell
you which files are the newest in which
places and it's going to give you that
yes/no notice how it's saying it's going
to upload these ones to these places and
it looks like it's going to upload a
whole bunch of stuff because when you
downloaded from before it didn't say
that
you know it doesn't give those files a
modified date it just pulls them down so
of course it's going to think these ones
that have just downloaded are the latest
so I'm going to click no because I don't
need to but that's just some of the
options you have so check out sublime
SFTP this map to remote feature is
really great so as always this is gobble
up Tut's if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment the
video or hit us if it to it our level of
Tut's let us know what you're thinking
