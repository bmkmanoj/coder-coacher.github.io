tutorials and in this video we're gonna
be covering the why slow extension to
your browser this as its name suggests
it lets you know why your website is
running slow so let's get into it right
now so in this first video I'm going to
start by introducing a tool that's going
to really just help you on your journey
to optimizing your websites now we have
a couple of tools in the next video
we're going to talk about Google
PageSpeed in this video we're gonna be
talking about why slow why slow is a
browser extension as you can see from
why slow org you can see it's available
for pretty much any sort of browser here
you plan on using so we have it
available in Firefox Chrome Opera Safari
and you even have it available on things
like your command line a node server if
an Phantom j/s so there's really no
excuse not to at least check out why
slow run it and see what's causing your
website to be slow and so these are just
tweaks that you can make to how your
website is served or the actual
components on your website itself and
find out where the pain points are so
let's head to level up tutorials and I'm
gonna go ahead and just click the yslow
button as you can see it allows us to
just run a test so after running this
test it's gonna gather some information
here so actually let's take this and I'm
going to just boost the size up so you
can see everything a little bit better
and as you can see it's giving me a
grade of B so overall performance is an
87 on level up let's calm now the
reasons are see I'm getting a C for HTTP
requests now I'm getting seven external
javascript requests and for external
stylesheet requests I get a B for using
a content delivery network because I am
using a content delivery network however
there are two aesthetic components that
are not and as you can see it rates you
on these various categories and as you
select them you can really see where the
pain points are you can actually click
this read more right here and it's going
to give you some
our information about these particular
techniques that you could be using to
increase your score now what's great
about this is I mean personally I don't
like seeing things that are red and say
F so for me seeing a D or an F and not
just seeing straight greens is giving me
reason to want to go ahead and just go
down the list and fix this stuff right
and every single time you fix one of
these items or make it better you're
gonna get a boost in your score and your
overall grades going to go up and what's
cool is you can filter and say okay but
show me all the problems with my CSS
okay okay it looks like I'm doing pretty
good there and really if you're getting
a grade of B and an 87 it's really not
so bad right I mean the site loads
pretty quickly and it's not really
causing a ton of problems but let's say
you're on a site and it is dragging and
you have no idea why why slow is going
to really open your eyes to all sorts of
things that could be done better to
increase this score now if this score is
going up your page is gonna be loading
faster
so let's actually check out the new
level up store I'm going to click yslow
on this I'm gonna run the tests and
although there isn't much to this site
you can see that it's doing pretty well
I'm getting a B overall in 84 but mostly
because I'm not using a CDN and I don't
have expires headers other than that I
have mostly straight A's here but there
are some things I can fix and using a
CDN or expires headers aren't
modifications that are too difficult to
make so thanks to yslow you can see
what's going to make your site load
faster okay so this is just the first
tool in our toolbox we're gonna be going
over Google PageSpeed tools in the next
video and then we're gonna dive deep
into the chrome dev tools so that you
can actually understand what's going on
in your site every single second and
then we're gonna talk about some
techniques to make your animations
smoother your page load faster and just
all sorts of great stuff so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
you have any questions or comments to
come in the video or hit me up at
Twitter or Facebook a level of tutorials
I'd love to hear from you thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
