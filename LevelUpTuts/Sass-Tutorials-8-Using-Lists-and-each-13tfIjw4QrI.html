up Tut's
and today I'm going to get started in
our SAS advanced series and this I'm
pretty much picking up right where we
left off with the basics however we're
going to get into some really
interesting features of SAS in this
series all sorts of really cool things
some stuff that you might not think of
some stuff that you probably already
thought of but today we're going to be
talking about a really cool use of lists
so what SAS allows you to do is SAS
allows for the use of lists and a
declared list it's sort of just like
declaring a variable you know you do
your dollar sign and then your list name
so we're going to what we're going to do
today the end result is we're going to
take these social links here and we are
going to with only a couple lines assess
output all of their background images
generated from a list so the only thing
we really have different is we have in
our HTML document we just have an
unordered list of social links it's
clearing and each of our anchor tags has
a class of whatever that icon is going
to be in our images folder we just have
four icons they're both they're all 65
by 65 pixels you know pretty basic so to
get going
first we're going to declare our list
and what our list I guess is going to be
is going to be icons so we're going to
call it icons and it's going to be colon
and then in parentheses you're going to
add the items to your list so our list
is going to have the four different
social outputs so we're going to do
Twitter Facebook YouTube and RSS so as
we can see as saving net Sassa said
that's alright so no problem
all right so what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be basically
doing a we're going to be using a
command called each and we're going to
go through each item in the list and
output that item as the class name and
use that list item for the background
image as well
so to get it started actually I'm going
to add in our anchor tag right up here
I'm going to add a width of 65 pixels
and a height 65 pixels okay so that gets
it already for the icons okay so to do
the each statement we're going to do at
each and we're going to say for each of
this and this is a new variable you're
making here so show so we're just going
to call this for each social in the list
icons and then we're going to do a
bracket so to call each class we're
going to do dot for the class and next
we do pound bracket and then inside of
the brackets you do your variable so
dollar signs social so this is basically
going through the list of icons and
every single one it's assigning it to
social and then here it's outputting as
a class social and then inside of social
just like CSS we're going to declare the
properties of this class so here we're
going to do just background and this is
going to be the same as normal just like
you would normally do quotes and then in
here again to call your list item we do
pound bracket dollar sign social bracket
and then because this is just pulling in
the name Facebook our icon is Facebook
or Twitter or whatever dot PNG and then
outside of here we're going to do just a
no-repeat Pete alright so this should be
good
and so you can see SAS gave us no errors
I'm going to go and refresh our page and
as you can see our icons all showed up
let's do a text indent all right with
the refresh you can see all of our icons
showed up this is really great because
um it's going through this list if you
ever had more more icons you know still
having to write a bunch of more lines of
CSS you could just edit you know comma
whatever your other one is here in in
your CSS or in your SAS and it takes no
time let's actually take a look at the
CSS to see what it's outputting because
it is pretty cool scroll down here and
so yeah it's pretty much doing this work
for us
Twitter background is Twitter PNG
Facebook PNG whatever perfect just how
you would write it quote so that's it
for a the first lesson in the SAS
advanced working with lists to do this
each statement as always if you have any
questions feel free to let us know leave
a comment send us an email just hit us
up anyway you can feel free to subscribe
we're going to be doing lots more videos
with some really cool stuff coming up
