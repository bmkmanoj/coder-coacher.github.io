up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be building out our shopping
list now the best part about the
shopping list is that we can reuse some
code from our in menu and we can grab
the same items now after that we just
have to iterate over the ingredients add
some each team house some new templates
and we should be all set so let's get
started right now so in the last video
we cleaned up our recipe book and we
cleaned up our menu quite a bit and
things are looking really nice
but we're still lacking a shopping list
now the shopping list is essentially
going to take the recipes from the
recipe book that have been selected to
the menu so they're going to be these
recipes and then it's going to go
through and grab their ingredients and
then list them in a list so that we
don't want ingredients that we need to
buy when going shopping now this is
going to be really super easy let's head
to our sublime text and let's go ahead
and just create a new file here what we
can essentially do is we have this we
can just go ahead I'm gonna put it in
client right now we can always put this
into its own folder later we can say new
file and this new file is going to be
shopping list dot HTML now this is going
to be a template with a name of you
guessed it shopping list okay and if we
come back to our routing code which
you'll remember we had in the lib routes
folder you can see that we don't yet
have a route for this page so we have
our recipe book we have our individual
recipe and then we have our menu so
let's go ahead and just copy the menu
because this is going to be very similar
and it's actually looking already in our
navigation for shopping - lists so we
can just say shopping - lists and same
with the name for the route now we want
to be using the main layout and in the
main area we want to be
using not that shopping list want to be
using a shopping list and this first
letter capitalised version of camelcase
so we can say main shopping list okay so
know what should happen is let's just go
ahead and throw an h1 with our class of
page title we can just say h1 page title
my shopping list like so and now when we
head to the page we should see that it
renders my shopping list perfect cool so
that's exactly what we were wanting that
means the route itself is working we can
now see that when you click back and
forth everything's all good so now let's
actually get started building the actual
list itself now what we need is
essentially a list of all of the
ingredients now these we do they would
essentially be to get all of the items
in our menu first right so we've done
that once before we can head to our
sublime text let's make a new file it
can be shopping list J s and we're just
going to have a helper here in fact this
is going to be really the exact same
helper from the menu so we can actually
grab from menu J s and we can just copy
all of this stuff now let's head to the
shopping list paste this in here we can
now change these words from menu to
shopping list like so okay so now we're
subscribing to the recipes and we're
going to find our recipes that are in
menu now I kind of want to make this
variable right here something a bit more
obvious to what we're using so I'm just
going to say that the items in this list
are our shopping list okay so our
shopping list is essentially the same as
our items in the menu this is just
recipes that find and menu equal to true
okay
so now when our shopping list at HTML we
can do something that's very familiar oh
I didn't have an unordered list and this
is just going to be a class of shopping
list
we're going to essentially say each
shopping list and where she gonna have
an else for this as well and then close
this off within each here okay and and
what we want to do here is we can
essentially say each shopping list and
inside of the shopping list we now have
access to an object on our individual
list item which is going to be
ingredient weight to this page we hit
ctrl M you can see in your Mongol meteor
toys we can select this if we pan over
here you can see that ingredients is
just an array of objects here so we can
actually access ingredients just by
essentially doing and each ingredients
because that's just going to iterate
over that array so we can simply say
pound each and greedy ents like so
finish this each off here and now we can
have a list item and this list item is
going to contain the name now if this
name field was out here it would be
giving the name of the recipe but if
you'll notice we have a name property
inside of here and that's going to give
us the name of the ingredient now we
have name now we can just have let's say
a - we have a span with a class of
amount now inside of this span it can be
amount
now it would be important if you now if
you weren't requiring amounts here you
obviously would want to wrap this -
along with some of this stuff in like an
if there is an amount that exists
otherwise this is going to show a - and
then have nothing so there are some
considerations there but for this
example you can just assume that
everything has an amount and that's an
improvement that you can make on your
own time with this example so we have
name - span class of amount outputting
at the amount variable okay let's head
to our list and you can see we have
bread two slices and cheese lots well we
need that because the ahi tuna one we
have we made this before this item had
ingredients so this doesn't actually
have ingredients if we come down here
and we see fish tacos with ingredients
and we add this one as well our shopping
list is immediately updated - bread -
slices cheese lots to note one pound
mango one fruit so what we've now
generated here is a really nice shopping
list so that who's ever going shopping
whether it's you or a friend or
something like that they can now have
this list updated in real time as you
make your menu and of course it looks
pretty good in mobile there's there's
some stuff that could be fixed here
definitely so that's also something that
you could fix on your own time when
improving this example so we now have my
shopping list but what happens if we
remove everything from the menu like so
you can see we have this blank sort of
list here so let's head back to our
shopping list and let's fill out this
else since this is is inside of a
unordered list we can just say hell I
and we can throw like an h3 in here if
you would like or you can just have text
and we could actually just copy in the
text from this recipe from the menu this
please add right here so we can come
back here please add
recipes to your menu okay you can make
those instructions more clear if you'd
like but for now that is a giant h3
let's tone that down a little bit by
getting rid of that h3 there we go and
watch this auto-update here perfect
please add recipes to your menu okay we
can go ahead and do that shopping list
there we go
okay so what's left in this example
basically we need some way to update our
items for example this item it really
has no ingredients even though we would
really like ingredients in this item and
we need some way to delete it if we no
longer want it right I mean that should
be easy and that should be something
that we should just have here in
addition the new item format I don't
know if this should necessarily be
visible by default so we can build an a
method from toggling this on and off we
can edit and delete our individual
recipes but other than that this thing
is looking really good and we're a large
amount of the way to a really nicely
functioning web application so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials
more new intermediate videos coming next
week if you want to help support you can
purchase the meteor for everyone series
now for 9.99 with the code examples and
22 HD videos or you can purchase the
next level CSS animations and
transitions which is not going to be
available on YouTube ever and this is a
premium package that gives project files
along with some really nice practical
examples for interface animations so as
always this is scouted level up
tutorials thanks for watching and I'll
see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
