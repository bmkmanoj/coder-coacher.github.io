of Tut's and today I'm sure you have to
turn off some of these annoying blocks
that come on Magento by default built in
to their default theme so smooth these
blocks you may have noticed uh so this
may look different than yours because I
have our theme installed on it but if
you were seeing this typically you'd be
seeing this PayPal logo right here in
the right sidebar and there's a whole
bunch of these other blocks like the the
card in the sidebar the back to school
logo the dog picture these are sort of
things that pop up throughout magenta
that they've put in here by default and
let's say you just want to turn them off
okay so we're going to be doing that by
using a file called local XML and what
this is is this file is going to be the
last file that magenta looks to when
determining these layouts and because of
that you're able to put anything that
you want to override in this one
particular file and everything is going
to get overwritten that you tell it to
so this isn't easier let's say if you
want to remove a whole bunch of these
blocks it's going to be easier to create
this local XML file then it would be to
copy and paste and all the XML files you
need and modify them there so let's go
ahead and create a new file I'm going to
do that within sublime text under app
and design and in front-end and then our
theme default and then side of layout
I'm going to click new file and I'm
going to say this as local dot XML okay
so here is local dot XML and in here we
want to have a normal XML tag you can
copy this from one of your other ones in
fact we can just go ahead and do that if
you're familiar with XML you know
exactly how they should look you have
opening and closing tags and everything
like that but all we need inside of this
local dot XML file is a XML tag the
header tag
we want to layout and then we're going
to need defaults so just like we had
before with default this is going to be
default and inside of this default is
going to be everything that we want to
override so let's go in here and let's
save this file and let's think about
what we want to have overridden let's go
back to our page here and check out that
PayPal logo so we're seeing this in its
mage PayPal block logo and you can see
this is being generated in the template
PayPal Partner logo PhD ml so let's go
ahead and find this XML file and let's
check this out we scroll down here we
can find it under PayPal XML if you
remember you can find it indirectly past
the directory that's directly after the
template so default template PayPal
therefore we know this is going to be
PayPal XML and let's open this up in
sublime text here okay let's scroll down
here and the one we want in particular
let's go back to our home page here is
this block logo let's scroll down here
and we can see exactly which one this is
so if we know that this this right here
is being generated by template PayPal
Partner logo let's actually search for
logo pH TM o in here and we can see some
of these things are using it and because
of that we know that the block with the
name of PayPal partner right logo is
using this template we know that this is
the block that we want so let's go ahead
and copy the name directly out of this
block here and put it into our local
file to do that we just make a new tag
and this tag is going to be a removed
tag so this remove tag is going to
remove a certain block and since this is
the last file that gets rendered this is
going to remove this block from every
since so let's do name is equal to that
and let's close out our XML tag let's
save this file and let's refresh our
page to see what happen okay we can
scroll down looks like our PayPal logo
is no longer there let's go further with
this let's see this popular tags we
remember this one because we have
already copied over this tagged XML file
and we have this local tag file in our
own theme by now so let's see how this
happens if we even put a remove for this
inside of our local dot XML file and
then do the same thing is less time I
grab the name of the block and now I'm
going to save it let's refresh this and
it doesn't show up because like I said
this is the last thing that gets
rendered so it doesn't matter what else
you're doing on your page to say hey
show up it's not going to show up okay
so let's check out this image right here
and this is the back-to-school call-out
thing I don't know why it's having such
a hard time finding this image for some
reason that's not finding it but
regardless I don't want this
back-to-school block to show up okay and
I'm sure you probably don't either
because you you know you didn't make it
yourself and it's some generic image so
let's come back to our our page here and
we know that this is going to be in
template call-outs and then right column
PhD HTML so but I know you might be
getting the hang of this you'll see this
template call-outs and you'll know to
look for call-outs dot xml angel good
here and you'll be super upset when you
don't see it because you'll feel like
you just started to understand this well
these cutouts are something that are
actually a little bit more particular
these call-outs are actually hard-coded
into the Magento default layout XML file
so let's actually check this out and
this is going to be in catalog XML
so just by looking at this file I don't
have any code completion on but you can
see that we have this block here and
it's right permanent call-out and the
temp template is using just like we
would assume here it's using call-outs
right column it's exactly the one we're
looking for but what we want to do here
is we don't want to import this XML file
whatever we're just going to do the same
thing we did before and now that we have
the name of it we can check write
permanent call-out and we can use that
I'm actually just going to throw this in
sublime text now so I can just copy copy
that right out so I don't have to type
it and possibly get something wrong so
let's scroll down here
I'm gonna look for write dot okay write
permanent call-out this is the block we
want and these are sort of a pain I
don't know why they're different let's
go to here remove name and then our name
our right call-out save it
come back here my page crash for some
reason okay cool we're back I've
refreshed and our right column call-out
is nowhere to be found
okay let's do one more let's check out
this my cart let's say we want to remove
this my cart you know you might want to
be putting this somewhere else by
default you just want to shut it off in
this particular spot well let's uh do
exactly what you think we're going to go
check template and then check out so
this one's going to be happening like
we'd expect we're going to look at
checkout XML will turn row this in here
and let's go back to our page we're
going to be looking for something with
sidebar P HTML let's find this sidebar
P HTML ok and we see that the name of
this particular block is right here we
can copy the name as we have done so so
many times already name equals okay
save this refresh the page and we're out
going to see our cart there anymore as
you'd expect because we've done all
these examples and it turned out the
same every time so now we know how to
shut off these blocks like the dog and
well I should keep in mind that the dog
is actually call out just like the back
to school is a call out those are the
weird ones but uh anything else like the
PayPal logo any of these things you can
turn them off just by overwriting them
and your local Dex mo then you don't
have to edit any of these XML files that
come with Magento and it's nice and easy
to maintain let me know if you have any
questions let me up in the comments in
the next lesson I'm going to show you
how to use a grid framework we're going
to be using skeleton grid framework to
start getting our CSS a little bit more
organized and get this site looking like
an actual site and it's going to be
responsive so that means it's going to
work well on mobile browsers as well
it's going to look good on everything
okay as always this is Scott with level
of touch if you have any questions let
me know you can hit me up at Twitter at
level of tuts and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
