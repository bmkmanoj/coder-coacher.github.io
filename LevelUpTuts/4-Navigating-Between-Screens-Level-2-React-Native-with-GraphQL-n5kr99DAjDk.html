level of tutorials and in this video
we're actually gonna be talking about
navigating between pages which sounds
super trivial if you come from the web
however with react native the process of
navigation especially all the different
library options that makes it quite a
bit more interesting to say the least so
let's get going on that right now okay
so and what we're gonna be doing in this
video is actually routing which is
something that again is not the most
simpler well straightforward thing in
react native so the first thing we want
to do is just create a new file now I'm
going to simply just name this file post
that J s and you might be wondering
about why I made me a post well really
once we get started making our
application this is going to end up
being the page that will be the post
that you make in your journal right I
don't know if you would you maybe want
to call it a page or any that sort of
stuff I feel like it's a post like a
blog post or a journal post that makes
kind of sense to me
so I have a react snippet package that
allowed me to just do our CC enter but
basically all we need in here is a
standard component okay now next we want
to import a view from react - native now
in addition to view we're also going to
import a text okay and it's kind of
annoying that react native needs views
and texts just to simply output some
text but that's how it is right and this
isn't web development here this is
native development and inside of here
we'll have a view and then a text and
then inside will just say new page much
as my es lint cleans it up just a little
bit so you can see here we are exporting
a default well component name should be
post doesn't really matter post export
default class post extends component and
all we're simply doing is returning a
text that says new page now let's head
back to our app dodge is where the magic
for most of this tutorial is going to
happen the first thing we need to do is
import our post page so we're going to
import post from dot forward slash post
right now we don't have any sort of
folder structure everything's just sort
of living in the route here that will
change don't worry about that so we have
our post that we're importing and let's
scroll all the way down to our navigator
so if you want to check out our
navigator before we had a home screen
app now let's go ahead and copy this
entire line if you're using vs code SiC
tip here you could hold shift and option
and hit down and it's gonna copy that
entire selected part so we're going to
have a home screen again this name right
here for this property doesn't much
matter for you overall right now what
matters is that the screen is going to
be equal to the component that we just
imported so the post page is going to
have a screen that is the post component
okay
so this right here is letting our
navigator know hey we got another page
now you might be wondering what's up
with the order of the pages well any
time we were refreshes it's going to
load the first one first unless we
otherwise specify so because a home is
loaded first in this list it's going to
load home and not worry about post just
yet so now that the Navigator is aware
of post let's go ahead and get
navigating and we could simply add a
button cuz why not we can just say
button now this button is just temporary
allowing us to actually just get this
navigating here now button is a self
closing element unlike in HTML and we
have two properties we have an on press
ok on press is going to well take a
function and then we're going to also
have the title property which is going
to be go to post page okay now let's
actually head up top here in our
component and define a function like we
typically would and this can just be go
to post and this will be equal to a
function like this now we can call this
function on our unpress by just simply
saying this go to post okay so we've
done some changes
it's always nice especially in react
native to head to your app and give this
thing a refresh to make sure that
everything is still working you can see
we have a go to post page button and
it's not doing anything yet because we
haven't told it to but like I said react
native can be temperamental so if you
run into a lot of read sometimes it's
difficult to figure out what's going on
without maybe undoing some stuff so you
could see here we have a button on press
go to post now go to post is where we
get to do the fun stuff where we
actually get to navigate and we could
say this dot props dot navigation now
navigation comes from the fact that this
is a root level page in the stack
navigator so you might be wondering well
what gets access to the dista props that
navigation the compartments listed here
if we were to have any sort of sub
component of app which we will be will
have to pass in the props such as the
stat props that navigation to be able to
use this dot props navigation now we're
going to use the method that navigate
and now navigate accepts a string which
is the name of the page we're going to
be going to get to that name from this
property right here so we want to be
heading to the post we can navigate to
post like this now when we head back to
our app we can click the go to posts as
long as our bundle is done and you can
see it's actually navigated us now our
new page doesn't have a title we'll fix
that in a second but you can see our new
page text with an exclamation point now
it's great about this is not only do we
get the sort of standard iOS back button
and you will on the Android side of
things too but we also get a gesture
that allows us to pull back and this
stuff comes free with the navigator and
this is one of the reasons why you're
gonna use something like this because
now we
get all this fancy native apps stuff
that well is like super super easy to do
because of things like Expo okay so
we've added our go to post we've added
this let's go ahead and actually copy
and paste the navigation options from
our component into our new post
component paste these in and we can
change the title to post and we'll leave
the header style and background color
and all this stuff as white and purple
we can check this out here we can go to
a page and we now have our new header
okay of which we can pull back and
everything it's functioning very nice
because well we don't have this weird
second color of header up here anymore
and all sort of flows together okay so I
mentioned before that there might be a
way that we could simplify this stuff
right here let's think about how we
could do that I'm gonna make a new
folder and this can just be styles okay
and then the set of styles I'm gonna
make a new file which will simply just
be a navigation and we can say
navigation Styles j/s and inside of here
I'm going to export a default and then
object this is going to basically allow
us to cut this stuff out of here and
they actually cut it out instead of just
typing the letter X paste it in here and
what we're gonna have is an object with
our header style and all that sort of
stuff in it now like you might be
expecting we can import that here we can
import you know a navigation Styles is
like way too long this is the default
export we can say nav styles and I'll
change the name in a second nav styles
from nav styles just like this let me
actually do that change the name right
now in our Styles navigation Styles it's
just too long if I'm going to be
importing this a lot nav style says it
all anyways so we're gonna be importing
nav styles from dot forward slash Styles
forward slash nav
styles and now we can use this object in
here with the spread operator just by
doing dot dot dot nav styles let's check
this out and see if this worked inside
of our app we can come in here and we
can refresh and we get hit go to post
and see that it did in fact get our
header color which means that we can
come into our app now and do the same
thing let's copy this import line and
paste add up top here important Ave
Styles now on skin we can delete all
this stuff and say dot dot dot nav
styles now one of the cool things about
this too is it gives us the option of
overriding some stuff let's say we
wanted for some reason we wanted one of
these pages to not be purple anymore but
we wanted this default style to be on
here
well we can head into our post and again
we could change the header background
I'm going to copy this header style I'm
delete this in a second so don't worry
about doing this yourself but if we were
to do something like this we could do a
header background and let's just set
this to zero zero three three zero zero
this super ugly get first green and this
is our post page keep in mind if we go
to post you could see we now get that
ugly green so by doing this a spread
operator here we allow ourselves the
ability to override when needed but we
can give ourselves some default styles
without having to do too much work or
worse yet having to re-type the same
code and having the code be wet
instead of dry okay so we've gotten some
decent progress on this and already in a
few videos in here and we have legit
navigation going on in our application
something we did not accomplish in the
entire react native for everyone series
so as you can see here the possibilities
start to open up as you can see that we
can change pages fairly quickly and
you've now opened yourself up to
multiple page applications of which
we're going to be using to the fullest
extent to save to grab posts and add it
and edit new posts so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
would like to complete this series learn
a lot more about react native a lot more
about graph QL and
over to level up tutorials calm and you
can subscribe and become a pro get
access to this along with the Arachne de
for everyone series or if your
subscriptions aren't your thing and then
that's cool too you can purchase these
series outright and purchase the react
native for everyone in a bundle package
