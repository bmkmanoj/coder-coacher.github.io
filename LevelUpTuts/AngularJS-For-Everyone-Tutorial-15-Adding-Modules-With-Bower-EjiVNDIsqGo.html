love tutorials and this video we're
going to show you how you can start
adding new modules and new functionality
to your angular site using Bauer now
something like Bauer is a good idea to
have in your project because it allows
you to use dependencies and allows you
to bring those dependencies in based on
particular file that lets you know which
modules and which versions you're
interested in using your project that
way anybody who's downloading your code
doesn't have to download all those
dependencies with your code and then
they can go and grab them off of
something like Bauer's database it also
makes it really nice and easy to keep
all of your dependencies in one spot so
let's check it out by adding UI router
using Bauer so the reason we're going to
be continuing from this point out with
Bauer's because we're going to be
needing to add a lot of different
modules here and there to add different
functionality into our project and you
seem like something Bauer just makes it
a lot easier to go and grab everything
however if you're not interested in
using Bauer it should be no problem you
can always go to those github repos
download the javascript file and Link it
to just the same as if you weren't using
bower bower really doesn't add anything
other than a convenient so if you're not
interested in Bauer go ahead and just
don't use it and you can download these
scripts and add them it should be the
exact same now to use Bower we first
need to have no Jo so if you don't have
knowed installed please head to nodejs
or can download the installer for your
specific system there and that will give
you access to the NPM command now what
we want to do is make sure we have Bauer
installed if you don't have Bauer
installed you can run NPM install hyphen
G and then Bauer now this is going to
install it globally if you see a bunch
of errors like this it's because your
local node modules folder doesn't have
the permissions that you need to access
this folder correctly so what you can do
is type sudo and then the NPM install
hyphen G power it's going to ask you for
your password you can put that in at
another video I'll show you how to get
around this to change the permissions
there it should be no problem however
just typing in sudo
pm install shouldn't also be a problem
either so after we go ahead and have
Bauer installed what we can do is type
Bauer in it now Bauer in it is going to
ask the name of your project and a whole
bunch of questions here now these are
questions you don't necessarily have to
answer if you don't want to if you're
just checking this out and trying this
out it's not a project you're going to
continue with you can just breeze
through these by hitting Enter like I'm
doing here it's going to just be okay we
just keep an enter okay and wouldn't ask
you if it looks good you can just hit Y
for yes okay so now what that gives us
access to is basically in our code base
we now have a bow JSON file and then
here we can add some new versions of
different libraries who are interested
in using and it's going to make sure
that these libraries are automatically
downloaded when you run the bower
command so to grab a specific library
like we're interested in doing we can
head back to our command line and in
here we can type Bower install and we're
going to be grabbing the UI router now
ui-router adds client-side routing to
your project the reason why we're using
UI router / angular's routers because
the current angular router it just isn't
nearly as full-featured as you I routers
and the new angular built router which
is supposed to be excellent is not in
the code base yet and since I'm keeping
these videos sort of release quality
only until version 1.5 is released that
router is not part of the current
version of angular so UI router is the
best that has to offer and it's the
pretty much been the standard for what
people have been using for a long time
now so we're going to type bower install
angular hyphen u I hyphen router now if
you don't know why you need routing
routing basically allows it so when you
change the URL in your application then
the front end a flick of the application
is able to respond give you different
templates and things like that without
full page reload it's essentially
treating the page changes in your site
as a completely front-end experience
okay so we've now had this installed
into our bower components folder so if
we head to our project you'll see we now
have this bower components and we have
angular UI router let's come to our
index HTML here and let's go ahead and
link up our UI router file so did you so
we want to add this after angular is
already loaded but before our controller
is so we can say script okay we can get
rid of this type JavaScript I mean
obviously you can leave it however html5
does not require that and we can say SRC
for the source and then open quote and
now we're going to want to browse to
this directory now this directory is in
the base of our dirt is in the base of
our project we can say forward slash and
then Bauer underscore components forward
slash and then we're going to look at
angular hyphen U I hyphen router now we
have forward slash and what we're going
to be going into is the release folder
as you can see you open that up and we
have this file here type in release
forward slash and then angular hyphen U
I hyphen router dot min jas so we're
going to be using the minified version
now let's hit back to our terminal I'm
going to start a simple Python server
just so we can have a web server running
python space a hyphen m space simple
HTTP server and hit enter it's going to
start up a local server on port 8000 so
let's head to our browser and we have a
familiar sight here we have our project
with our images let's go ahead and look
at the source here and we can check out
to make sure that our bower components
UI router is of course getting loaded so
I've clicked on the script here and you
see code which is good because that
means our script is being added to the
project so we've now added a
script to our project but keep in mind
when you're adding any sort of new
directives or modules or anything like
that to your project you need to also
have it be added in the code here so to
do that we just need to come to our
director ejs which is where we're
defining our app here and we're going to
go ahead and where we added ng animate
here in camel case we're going to be
adding ui-router now we can do that in
this array simply by typing comma quotes
and then you I period router okay so
with that little effect here let's come
to our project let's refresh I'm going
to go inspect this element check to make
sure we have no errors in our JavaScript
Council and we're all good so we're now
loading ui-router enter our project and
we've installed it using Bauer now if we
wanted to go ahead and grab any other
project for instance if you'll notice
when we downloaded ui-router also
grabbed angular because angular is a
dependency of UI router so you can see
its angular version 1.4 point 3 if we
come to our document here you can see
we're actually using one point four
point oh anime j/s and stuff like that
we want to keep everything sort of the
same version number but for now I'm just
going to leave it as is as you can see
we could just be referencing this path
here and then we can go ahead and grab
and get our animate as well so I'll let
you do that on your own time you can
always head to the angular animate page
to find out what the bower command for
that is and then it'll just give you a
little bit more practice adding some
scripts with Bauer so as always this is
Scott would level of tutorials if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video hurt us about Twitter
or Facebook and level up tutorials we
love to hear from you in the next video
we're going to show you how you can
start to add some simple writing to your
website before getting into some more
complex routing and really building out
a site then that allows you to change
pages just like a standard website and
even changes the URL and the history
state of your application so as always
this is Scott thanks for watching and
I'll see you next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
