up Tut's and today we're gonna continue
the creating products and product
displays in this video by using inline
entity form to actually have a nicer
sort of system for product displays so
this module is actually sponsored by the
commerce guys and you can see that the
creator of Drupal commerce himself has
nine commits in it so it's involved
project and it's certainly something
that makes Drupal commerce nicer so you
can go ahead and download inline entity
form and install it and I'm going to go
ahead and enable it I already have it
downloaded and in my modules folder okay
so now that we have that created I
should note that this website might look
a little different from the last video I
accidentally completely ruined my
databases that I was using for this and
I didn't have a backup so this is a
fresh Drupal install and I did recreate
the first product from the last video
but not the product display so let's go
ahead and that's actually fine because
we're going to be redoing how we're
doing it anyways so let's go to
structure and content types and let's
create a content type like we had before
that was product display and let's
disable preview let's disable off there
let's turn off comments and let's save
and add fields so now in the last video
we added a product reference to be able
to use our product right and we want to
do the same thing however the option for
a widget this time is last time I think
we just did the autocomplete text field
what we're gonna want to do is have an
inline entity form now we have a couple
of options here the inline entity form
multiple values or inline entity formed
single value now we can select multiple
values and then it will allow us to add
more than one product to a product
display so let's go ahead and do that
and
this field is going to be just product
that spelling was terrible
okay let's hit save and it's asking me
if we want and options list limit I
don't want a limit we're gonna have
unlimited here and now we could even
select what type of product that we want
this to even work with we're gonna say
product so these checkboxes add give us
different functionality we can allow
users to add existing products and it
could be starts with or contains I think
contains is a little bit more
performance heavy so I just want to do
starts with it allows you to also delete
referenced products when the product
entity is deleted and override labels so
we can override those here or you can
choose not to it's actually nice to keep
this stuff maybe in the product display
so you don't have to look elsewhere for
it and auto generate product title which
I'm not going to select this time now
for the field settings we're going to
want to go ahead and say this can be
unlimited we want to be able to
reference multiple products in one view
or not do that if we don't want to so we
can go ahead and say unlimited and let's
save this now let's go ahead and create
a product display so we're gonna click
add content then product display and
this is going to be the product name and
then the body is just like you'd
normally see it however this time
instead of a reference field we have
this product and we have a couple of
options there's add existing product or
add new product since where do you have
one product to created let's go ahead
and just add it and you can see how this
works we can just search for it like we
did before autocompletes
and then we can click add product cool
so that's here you'll notice we have two
options under operations we have edit
and remove now this is glorious or
excellent or whatever because if we
click Edit here not only
can we edit the details of this product
but it opens it up directly in this page
so it does this all very nicely let's
say the product name is product name one
is actually stupid we don't want that
name anymore we want this to be a level
up t-shirt right and let's click update
product you'll notice that the the title
has been changed let's check out our if
we go to store and then products you'll
notice something the actual product
title did not change the app product
title is still product number one
however the variation title is now level
up t-shirt so this can be helpful if you
have sort of generic products that you
want to maybe slightly modify their
names or you have one product that has
several different names then you don't
have to create several different
products if it's one product and it has
a bunch of different names and maybe is
even the same SKU then you can do that
okay so now let's add a new product from
this screen directly now we can just
give this a SKU since this isn't a real
store I don't have any SKUs however I
would assume that your store would
already have SKUs keep in mind they just
have to be unique and this product title
is gonna be level up long t-shirt so
it's gonna be like a long sleeve shirt
or something and the price is just gonna
be slightly higher now you could have of
course these products on different
product displays keep in mind your
product display is the view of your
product on the front end so like we said
in the last video products don't show up
on the front end unless you have a
display for them okay so let's go ahead
and click create product and we now have
both of these notice how you can change
their order let's go ahead and save this
page and check it out
and
we see here is a page with both of our
products listed out but they're just
links here and if we click one of these
links it's actually taking us to the
back end which isn't going to work
however that's something that we can
easily change by changing the display
settings and our content type so if we
go to structure and then content types
and then for product display manage
display we can see here that the product
line says that it's just for a link now
we can have this being Add to Cart form
or you can have it render the product if
we have the Add to Cart form you can see
we have some more options here we have a
default quantity show attributes attempt
to combine like products on the same
line item in the cart and display a text
field quantity widget we - we can have
this text field quantity widget let's
just click update and save and see what
this gives us if we refresh you'll see
now what we have is a select list where
you can choose which products you want
and you'll notice the price even updates
based on what products you want and we
can have a quantity in here let's say we
put 3 and click Add to Cart we have now
put 3 long t-shirts in the cart at 1099
and giving us a total of 30 to 97 so as
you can see here we have now taken this
this editing this product display like
we did in the last lesson and we made it
way more visual and way more easy to add
and edit products for your product
display so now obviously this interface
is an awesome right here it's gonna
require some some love right but that's
pretty much how Drupal is anyways you're
going to have to do CSS styling to get
everything looking exactly like how you
want it anyways well that's great in the
next video we're going to talk about
creating more complex product types so
check it out we're going to keep
building on the
and we're gonna keep on making more
complex products and then we're going to
take you through the whole ordering
setup shipping all that stuff so as
always it's ask our level up Hut's if
you have any questions or comments leave
a comment on the video hit us up at
Twitter level of tuts on Facebook or
pretty much whatever we'd love to hear
from you subscribe to the YouTube
channel we have new videos every week
