up tuts and today I'm going to show you
how to install a WYSIWYG on your Drupal
installation and as you may have noticed
when you are editing your content that
there is no text editing tools in here
so sure we have a text area but let's
say you're content editor wants to you
know add bold or create a list or add a
link in their text they might have to do
it in HTML and now all of your content
editors are going to know HTML and
besides I think most other content
management systems even have a WYSIWYG
built right in
I mean I know WordPress does so if you
want to add a WYSIWYG to this site
luckily it's fairly easy we're just
going to do so with the module so if you
go to drupal.org project and then the
module is WYSIWYG or what you see is
what you get you can come here at this
page and you can download this module so
what this module does is that it allows
you to use a third-party WYSIWYG editor
what's good about that is that allows
you to use any third-party WYSIWYG
editor that it supports so you're not
just tied down to one particular one so
actually let's go to our site here and
sites all modules we're going to install
this WYSIWYG I'll drop it in here okay
come back to our site I'll go to modules
scroll all the way down till we get to
WYSIWYG we'll select this and we'll save
it okay that's it let's go to our piece
of content that we were just add let's
click Edit okay if you notice no WYSIWYG
well it's not that easy what we have to
do next is we actually have to go grab a
WYSIWYG from somewhere so if you go back
to your modules scroll down and we go to
configure that's next the little gear
that's next to WYSIWYG here click that
it's going to say installation
instructions which WYSIWYG do you want
to use and there are a whole bunch of
different options I personally like
ckeditor it's
one right at the top here so I'm just
going to click download and it's going
to take me to CK editors page where you
can click download see there is the CK
editor module for Drupal I personally
will you know you might want to use that
however there is some cost associated
with it it's not free so I'm just going
to go ahead and use this CK editor the
open source editor because you can just
add this using the WYSIWYG module so
this is the one that you want this CK
editor okay so if we go back to our site
it's going to tell you exactly where to
put these folders it's going to say
extract the in archive the copy in the
following location which is in sites all
libraries and then you'll put CK editor
in there so let's go to our finder okay
so they wanted to go to sites all and
then if you notice there is no libraries
folder so this is where we're going to
just create one so you just make a
folder and name it libraries okay and
now we're going to draw the bowl first
let's decompress this seek editor and
it's all looking good we'll just drag
and drop this right into libraries okay
so now let's refresh this page okay
awesome
so because it no longer says that we
have a need to install this installation
instructions has been minimized as you
can see CK editor is green of course you
can download and install others if you
would like so this is going to say our
input formats which editors are going to
use since filtered HTML is the first one
I'm just going to say filtered HTML use
the CK editor and click Save okay so
we're not quite there yet the next thing
we need to do is edit this so let's
click Edit and what this is going to do
is allow you to customize your CK editor
basic setup we're just going to leave
all these checked here you can of course
go through these and select which ones
you want but we want the users having
the options to bold italicize
is underline strikethrough line left
mind center let them do a bullet list
undo/redo
i like to have them be able to look at
this or paste and source where is that
source paste don't look at the source
paste from word okay you can go through
these and selector tools you feel like
your content editors are going to need
the most editor appearance you can say
okay i wanted to be at the top by the
alignment left i mean nothing really
crazy here
apply source formatting if you want it
to do that i'm just going to leave that
unchecked and okay it looks like
everything else is good we'll save this
and now if we edit our home you'll
notice we have our WYSIWYG editor here
we can type this is bold select this
click bold and it's bold we'll save it
out and you can see that changed cool
okay so that's how to install a WYSIWYG
on your site with CK edit if you want to
check out other WYSIWYG always feel free
to go to that modules configuration and
then check out which other ones you want
you can install and just see the
benefits of using different ones like I
said I prefer CK editor you may not so
that's how you install a WYSIWYG on your
Drupal installation once again this is
