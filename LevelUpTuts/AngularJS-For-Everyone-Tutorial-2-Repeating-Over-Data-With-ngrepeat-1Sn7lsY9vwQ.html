today we're gonna continue our angular
for everyone series by covering a new
directive well at least a couple of new
directives and one of them is going to
be mg in it where we initialize some
data however we're not yet jumping into
new JavaScript yet we're going to be
doing this all in the template still so
we're gonna be initializing some data in
the template and then we're going to
iterate over that data using ng-repeat
which allows us to create loops and
output HTML based on that data so let's
check this out right now okay so in the
last video we just had this quick sort
of variable being output into a
background color for a style I'm gonna
delete that as well as this input here
because we're not gonna need it right
now
okay I'm also going to delete this your
name and what I'm going to do is let's
actually put an NG in it on the body
now ng in it - ng - in it is essentially
a directive that allows you to
initialize some data when the template
is loaded here now most normal
situations are gonna be using a
controller for this so don't get this in
your head as and this is how you
initialize data usually most of the
times your data is either coming from
services or from a factory or something
like that those of which we'll go over
in future videos so don't worry about
that if if those words are totally
foreign but for now we're just gonna
sort of show up what you can do with
ng-repeat here and so to do that we need
some data now instead of our quotes here
we just want to give a variable name so
we can just say this is going to be a
list right and our list is going to be
equal to and then we can have flat
brackets here like because what we're
gonna initiate here is an array of data
so we're just gonna have an a list of
strings where we just have 1 comma 2 you
notice how these are all on strings here
okay okay and as you can see I'm using
single quotes inside of our double
quotes here and not to cancel anything
out and we just have this a list
initialized as 1 2 3 okay so now we're
going to go ahead
use a another new directive which is
going to be ng-repeat
now this ng-repeat is gonna go on the
actual item that's going to be repeating
so in the case of a list where we'd have
an unordered list and we have list items
let's say we want to output each of
these list items as one two three in an
unordered list here the thing that we're
gonna be Wanna being repeating is this
list item so we can say ng - repeat ok
so now that we have ng repeat we can say
ng repeat is equal to and then set of
double quotes here we're going to want
to say what it's repeating to do that we
can say item which is going to be a new
variable and it's going to be item in
list which of course is our list that we
initialized up here so we're saying give
me each item in the list and repeat it
as a list item now we can use our
template tag that we saw before which
was the double curly brackets and we can
just say give me the item like so now
what you'll see is when we head back to
our HTML and I refresh you can see we
have one two three in fact if we just
comma here for refresh okay we have more
items okay so we have this running over
an array of just items here but let's
say we wanted to have over an array of
objects so instead of being one two
three four like this we'd have key value
pairs here so we could say something
like let's make an object and that
object is going to have a name property
: the name is going to be Scott as a
quote in quotes like that comma it's
going to have an age property and it's
going to have an age which is also just
going to be a number here so we don't
have to put that in quotes okay so let's
go ahead and make a couple more objects
here I'm going to just do that inside
this ng in it and you can see quickly
why this ng in it is not a good strategy
for working with data okay we have Scott
and Courtney right so we have two names
here
now if we come back to our HTML and
refresh you'll notice said simply just
by outputting the item in list
outputting that item right here it's
giving us the entire object well how can
we access each individual property well
easily enough we can say item that name
now if we save this we can see that we
get both of the names so item that names
Scott
item name Courtney and if we want to do
let's say a - another curly brackets
item dot age save this okay you're now
giving the Scott's 29 Courtney's 29 and
we're have a nice little list here now
what's cool about this is that this is
really just HTML if you want to do
styling in these things differently you
can always wrap something in a span or
maybe you're just gonna wrap this like
let's say in an end tag right for
emphasis here and refresh you have
access to all of this data so you have
complete control over everything and
that's working with the tools that
you're used to working with you just
augment it by these directives such as
ng repeat ng in it and many more which
we're going to show you okay so this is
an introduction to ng repeat there's
lots of stuff you can do with ng repeat
and once we get working into actual data
and controllers and stuff like that
you'll see it all in action so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
you have any questions or comments leave
a comma in the video we're gonna step n
toward our Facebook ad level up tux
we'd love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
