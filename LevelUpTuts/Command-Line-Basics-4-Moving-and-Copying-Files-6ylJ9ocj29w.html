of huts and today we're gonna continue
our command-line basics series by
teaching you how to move and copy files
now this becomes particularly useful if
you don't have access to any sort of
interface where you're used to dragging
and dropping or maybe command C and
command V to copy and paste things but
it comes in definite handy if you are SS
aging into your server and need to move
some files around or change your file
structure or anything like that
basically it's a command you use fairly
often so to start off we're going to use
our basic commands that we had learned
in the last video and we're just gonna
move into my site's folder you can move
pretty much anywhere but in this
particular example I'm just gonna move
into my sites folder so I'm gonna CD and
then the folder is sites and then level
up so I use the LS command - that we
learned a couple videos ago to see
what's in here and I have all these
folders now you remember in the second
video we learned the mkdir command to
make a new directory we're gonna make a
new directory test LS to confirm that we
do see tests in there now I'm going to
touch a file and we're just going to
touch index.html and that creates
index.html so here's a here's an issue
right we made index.html and it's
outside of our test folder how can we
move index.html into our text folder
well luckily the command is just mV and
it's really easy to remember you move
and the move you know makes sense so the
way the MV command works is that we say
the MV is the source and then the second
parameter it receives if you're not
using any arguments is the target so
this is where it's what file you're
trying to move or what you're trying to
move not necessarily what file
but what you're trying to move and where
you're trying to move into so we want to
move index dot HTML and we want to move
it to test now if I hit enter now run
command LS again you'll see index is
gone if we change directories into test
and then LS you'll see that we now have
our index file is within the test folder
so this is great we've moved the file
and it was easy it was super easy right
because we just ran one command but
let's say we have let's actually touch a
couple more files let's say touch yo dot
HTML touch and then hello dot txt now we
want to move all of these files into a
new directory I'm going to create we're
gonna do mkdir and it's just going to be
called public LS you can see we now have
a public and now let's move all three of
these files into public now what we
don't have to do is we don't have to say
MV hello to public enter MV index public
enter we can say hello that txt remember
that I'm using tab to complete
index.html and yo HTML to public I had
enter hit LS to confirm that everything
is now within public and there they are
now what's something useful that you can
do with the Move command that you might
not realize well you can actually rename
files by passing it to file names if we
want to change yo HTML in into HTML all
we can say is MV MV space yo hTML is the
source and the target is going to be hey
dot HTML all this does is it renames the
file now if we do l
yo HTML doesn't exist anymore it's just
hate HTML now what happens if we just
wanted to move all of these files that
were in this directory and there was
like a hundred files right we wanted to
move all of them you won't have to type
MV and then each file individually you
can use what's called a wild-card
so if we say MV and then estrous that's
going to select every file in the
current directory that we're in or
whatever directory are specifying and
then we can say move into the file
behind us or the folder behind us so
this is going to take all these files
and move them out of public put them
back in to our test folder so we went
over in a couple videos ago we said CD
dot dot means you going that directory
back so to go and move things in
directory back we do dot dot and then
forward slash I can hit enter LS shows
that there's nothing in public anymore
CD dot dot to go back LS and here are
all of our files now likewise if we
wanted to move only the HTML files we
could also use the wild-card so let's
say now that the text file actually
should be in the test folder but the two
HTML files need to be in public so this
is actually really easy too we can say
MV and then asterisk dot HTML so what
this is saying is every single file that
has the ending of dot HTML move in to
public
with the ls confirms that hello.txt is
the only file in here and changing
directory into public confirms that we
now have hey dot HTML and index.html now
let's say that we have a file let's
actually get a couple directories back
you can do that by saying CD dot ford
slash dot dot forward slash that takes
us back to directories now we're into
the level up folder let's touch a file
that's called hello dot HTML so this
file now exists right but we want to
move this file into our project where
our other HTML files are but we want to
also keep it where it as in fact we want
to copy this file so we're gonna copy it
and make a duplicate of this file and in
that process put it into our new folder
so we can do this with the CP command or
the copy command for CP it works very
similar to the MV command we can specify
multiple files you can use wildcards and
it is in the pattern of the name of the
file you want and then the name in the
file or the location of the file where
it needs to be so again the source in
the destination so we can say we want to
move hello dot HTML into our test and
then public folder but we want to make a
copy of it so we can do CP hello dot
HTML as the source and then the end
result we're going to say it goes into
test and then I'm gonna hit tab and then
public and the end result is the file is
also going to be named hello dot HTML
keep in mind if I were to type in a new
file name here it would copy the file
but give it a new file name similarly to
what we did with the move command when
we wanted to give it a new file name
so I had enter.now sure enough when we
go into test public and look around
we're gonna see hello dot html' hey dot
html' and index dot HTML now these
commands have arguments that could be
passed into it you can tell them not to
overwrite files and stuff like that
however we haven't really gotten too
much into arguments and it's important
just to know the basics of using these
commands to do their absolute most basic
now you have the power to not only
navigate through your file structure
crane delete files but you can now copy
and move files as well so you should
start to feel like you have a bit more
control over what you're doing within
your command-line interface so as always
this is called level of Tut's if you
have any questions or comments of a
comment the video hits up a Twitter or
Facebook or I level up Tut's forum
pretty much anywhere we'd love to hear
from you thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
