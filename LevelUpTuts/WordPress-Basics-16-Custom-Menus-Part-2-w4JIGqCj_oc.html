up Tut's and today I'm going to take you
further into custom menus and we're
going to have some more options with the
menu recreated before and we're going to
create a menu and place it somewhere
that we actually don't have an option to
place it using widgets so let's come
into the backend of our site here and we
have our main nav that we created before
and now we have some options here right
some options that we didn't reveal in
the last video if you select one of
these downward arrows on one of the
items in your navigation it gives you a
whole lot of options right besides
giving you the path that it's already
chosen for us you can give it a title
attribute or you can move it down
further now now you'll see if we click
one of these you can do the same for
that you can change the text from about
us to maybe about or something and still
have it take you to the about Us page
great well we have just those options
here but let's say you wanted to add a
link that wasn't in your site right
you wanted to link off to another site
well let's actually create a new menu
for our footer and we can put things
like that including our donations page
in there so let's create a new menu here
we'll just click leave this page because
we don't actually change anything and
now we can select the name footer menu
here I'll just type it up and then we
can click create menu and we now have a
second menu on this I want donations
I'll click Add to menu now if we click
down here where it says links I can
actually link to some page so let's say
I wanted to link to level up Tut's com
and I want to say level up Tut's is the
address right I can add to the menu now
I have a site linking off page right
here and that is a four level up Tut's
com
now you'll notice I don't want this in
the secondary menu and I don't want this
in the primary menu what can I do with
this let's click Save menu and we're
going to go back to widgets and we're
going to add it to the footer using a
widget so so we have our page
right we want it to be down here
so let's come to widgets under
appearance and we're going to find the
menu widget it's custom menu right here
and we're going to well we could drag
this into the footer area like we did
before
or if you don't feel like clicking and
dragging you can click it and then say
hey I want you to show up in the footer
area and then add widget now it's asking
us uh it's going to ask us right here
which menu we want to use and if we want
to have it give it a title right so we
could actually give it our main
navigation if you wanted to for some
reason but you can select any custom
menu that you've made and it's going to
show up here of course we wanted the
footer navigation and if you want to
give this a title you can uh we can just
maybe call this like extra links or
something of course I wouldn't have a
menu that had off page and on page links
in the in the same menu but that's
besides the point here just doing some
examples so if we click Save now we come
to our page and we refresh we now have
our extra links is showing up in this
footer area and likewise we could have
thrown this extra links menu into this
content sidebar widget area or this
primary sidebar which area it doesn't
matter it's still going to be using this
footer menu that we created because we
selected it in this drop down here so we
are now able to add custom menus not
only to the main or normal navigation
spots but anywhere that you can add
widgets so you now have complete control
over the links you're adding to your
site in the next video we're going to
start to get into plugins and all of the
awesome expandable things you can do
with plugins now once we've gone over
plugins
we'll have set ourselves up to really
reach the limit of the WordPress basics
and after that we're going to be getting
into some more intermediary and advanced
stuff and the intermediate steps going
to be you know working with themes
creating your own theme
modifying themes adding things like
widget areas and and all sorts of cool
stuff we're going to get into more and
more of editing the files but we're not
going to do it in a way that's difficult
to approach right we're going to do in a
way that makes sense and even if you
don't have any experience coding you
don't have to worry about it because I'm
going to explain everything in basic
terms exactly how you do it so as always
this is Scott with level up tuts
if you have any questions or comments
please reach out to us on twitter
facebook youtube uh you know our website
we have a level up hubs form that you
can post in and that's all awesome
so thanks for watching and I'll see you
in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
