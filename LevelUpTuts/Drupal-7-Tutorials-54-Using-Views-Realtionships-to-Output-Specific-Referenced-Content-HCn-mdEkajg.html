love-love tubs and today we're going to
take those note references we had in the
previous video and we're going to
display them using a a relationship in
views okay so what we need to do is go
to views and we're gonna create a view
block because I'm gonna throw this view
block somewhere eventually and that's
not really important for this tutorial
but just so you can see in action we're
gonna add a new view and we're going to
have this be
I guess the view will just be named
courses and I'm gonna uncheck this even
though these would just be for the views
course itself when a block titles
courses and sure we can use five that's
fine whatever so the first thing I'm
going to do is when I add our fields the
first one is already in there for us and
its title as you can see it's given us a
whole bunch of stuff and there's our
titles let's add another one and we're
gonna have this just be the poster image
which is the image of our tutorial okay
and we're adding it to all of him sure
we don't need any formatters on it or
anything you would probably ought to
link this to the content but for this
example it's not really necessary okay
so here's our content here but now we
want to add a relationship under
advanced here we're going to add and
then once this loads we're going to go
to course videos content course videos
and so this is going to make sure that
the content we're having is going to be
items that are in the course videos okay
we're gonna have this set to all so
we're gonna pretty much leave everything
these are except for we're going to
click this require this relationship we
want to hide items that do not contain
this relationship okay so we're gonna
select that and if you'll notice here
now we have four items in our view which
is views poster image views poster
matriz poster image so this is
representing all four items that we've
referenced in the course videos field
for this for this course but as we in
field
it wants to grab the title of the piece
of content itself and it won't grab
anything for poster image because
there's no field and course for a poster
image so what we want to do is add a
relationship to each of these fields and
we'll see some magic happen so I'm going
to click on title right here and I'm
gonna select relationship up top here
and then field course videos will apply
to this display and then same thing with
content poster image we're going to say
use this relationship and it's filled
course videos I'm going to click apply
to all displays and now if we scroll
down here magically we have our
tutorials in order
we have Drupal 23 introduction to views
creating a block view using filters in a
view views fields so here's our videos
in order and that we referenced them as
related to by this course videos so now
if we wanted this to just be views we
could filter this even more and probably
what I'm going to want to do eventually
as maybe have a contextual filter that
pulls that from the URL or something so
this is pretty amazing we can add some
other filters here let's say if you're
referencing course video somewhere else
you could filter it and say you only
want courses or let's say you only want
a specific item that are related to
views
so let's actually a bet and we'll say we
want the note ID so we only want this
one that's associated with views so we
have to have a value for this node ID
let's actually check out what our value
is for this that you hover over the edit
button minds see s test over here and
you can see that this node is if you
look at the very bottom of your screen
it'll say the URL mine says level up
tugs.com / node / 581 / edit so this
notice number 581 if we come back here
and say 581 will apply to this and now
no matter what even if we have other
course videos we have another course or
something
this view is only going
give us videos that are referenced on
note 581 and these are our views this is
how to use a relationship to view a
reference to content on a node as always
if you have any questions please leave a
comment the video hit us up a Twitter
level up tuts let us know what you think
and we always like to hear from anybody
and as always this is Scott with level
of tuts and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
