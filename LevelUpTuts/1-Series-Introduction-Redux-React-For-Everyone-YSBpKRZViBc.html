of tutorials and in this series we're
going to be covering redux with react
now many times Redux series are very
complex and it really makes redux feel
like a difficult thing to learn so what
I'm hoping for in this series is that
you find these videos to be very easy to
digest and easy to understand the
concepts of Redux as if it were just
anything in JavaScript we're gonna be
learning a lot about how a Redux sort of
works with react and we're gonna be
building some practical things as well
so the first few videos are definitely
going to be a little bit more getting to
know Redux and how it works together
with react where the later videos are
all going to be about expanding upon a
react 16 for every one series and
turning it into a very practical
application of Redux using all sorts of
modern techniques so let's check out
some of the code we're going to be
developing okay so now let's take a look
at some of the work we're gonna be doing
over the course of this series in
addition to knowing and understanding
the redux core concepts we're gonna be
building out the react 16 for everyone
video level up movie database here using
redux and now this thing is super cool
because not only are we going to be
getting all of our data for instance
this get movie action is returning all
of our data but we're also going to be
storing it in local storage and
invalidating it at a certain time so
you'll notice here if I were to refresh
none of our actions are run because all
of the stuff is coming in from local
storage likewise if we click a movie
it's going to run everything it needs to
run we move off of a movie and we even
create some basic redux actions like a
simple toggle now the simple toggle is
really just to illustrate very basic
stuff but for the most part we're going
to be going into all sorts of redux and
react techniques showing you how to get
your data in and out of redux showing
you how to use and dispatch actions
easily we're gonna be talking about all
of the jargony stuff that comes along
with redux cuz there's so many words
from thunks and action creators and
actions and reducers and man it's too
much jargon and we're gonna cut through
all of that and show you exactly what
you're doing
and why so if you want to learn Redux
with react in this sort of way head on
over to level up tutorials dot-com
forward slash store and purchased this
series or you can become a subscriber
and get access to every new series as
well as vote on the next series for next
month so maybe you aren't a fan of
something that I'm doing a series on
well I have topics up there for you to
vote for if you become a level of pro
and you get access to directly influence
what's going to be coming up on level up
tutorials so thanks so much for watching
let's get into the code and start
learning redux and react</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
