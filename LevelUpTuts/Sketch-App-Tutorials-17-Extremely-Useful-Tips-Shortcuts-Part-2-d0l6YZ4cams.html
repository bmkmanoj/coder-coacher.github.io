love tuts and today I'm going to show
you a few more excellent time-saving
sketch three tips now these are just in
addition to the other tips we showed and
some of these are extremely useful so
keep on watching and we're going to make
your sketch three workflow even better
so to get started I'm going to talk
about four more of my time saving sketch
three tips now the first one is going to
be about measuring distance now let's
create two rectangles there we go let's
make one more okay now let's say we
wanted to know exactly how far apart
these two rectangles are well one thing
we can do is select one of our
rectangles here now while holding down
the Alt key we want to hover over an
object we want to measure its distance
to so if we hover over this other square
we can see that there eighty-one pixels
apart that way if we want to make sure
there are eighty pixels apart we can
just bump it over one pixel now select
it again and while holding the Alt key
hover over the other shape to measure
the distance now this can also be really
useful to measure distance all around
something so let's make another
rectangle and I'm just going to make
this background white so we can see this
here and let's say we want to measure
the distance that this is from all sides
of this rectangle so we can once again
select our square hold alt and we can
get this distance from every single
point from this rectangle that it's
inside of so you can see it's 85 from
the top 171 216 and uh 441 so holding
alt to measure distance is something
that I use all the time and sketch now
the next thing is going to be an easy
access to the color picker so I'm going
to move this over here since I have this
background with a nice amount of colors
here and what we can do is at any point
when we have anything selected or even
when we don't have something selected
what we can do is hit
control-c now hitting control see you
don't have to hold the keys or anything
you just hit control-c once like that
and then it brings up the color picker
to which you can pick anything not only
in sketch 3 but you can pick colors
outside of sketch 3 and you'll notice
when I select whatever I had selected
has gotten that color great so we now
have pulled some colors directly from
this image and there we go so ctrl C for
the color picker now the next tip is
going to be making sure that your
objects are rounded to the nearest pixel
so let's say we have a group here all of
a sudden we want it to change size and
we can do that by selecting everything
and then just manually shift dragging it
to the point where it's the size we want
it however now if you zoom in let's zoom
way in you'll notice some problems are
nice a one pixel everything is now gone
we sort of have a fuzzy line here and a
fuzzy line here it's not the perfect
solid shape that we had before so what
we can do is we can actually select
everything so I've selected all three of
my rectangles we can come to layer and
then round to nearest pixel edge you can
see by selecting that we now have nice
crisp lines again and everything is the
one pixel size that it should be so that
eliminates any sort of sub pixel you
know just funniness that we have going
on okay so that again is round to the
nearest pixel edge and that brings us to
our last tip which might actually be
kind of obvious however it might not be
we can actually create custom shortcuts
for sketch using your system preferences
so let's come into system preferences
and from here we can go to keyboard now
shortcuts and then down to app shortcuts
for which we can click a plus right here
and let's go ahead and select sketch so
now that I've selected sketch we want
this to be
the name of the command that you want to
add so what we want to add is we want to
add a shortcut for round two nearest
pixel edge so we can type round to the
nearest pixel edge and then I'm just
going to make sure that I spell that
correctly so come back here have both of
these open round to nearest pixel edge
quote and now we want the shortcut to be
something that will remember so we can
do command shift r4 - perhaps for round
so let's click Add okay so we now have
an eight custom shortcut
let's click out of this let's come back
to sketch three let's resize all these
things again so that they get nice and
blurry here perfect
so now selecting everything let's do
command shift our and you can see our
shortcut worked the edges cleared up and
it's nice and easy so things that you do
all the time like perhaps if you're
frequently rounding to the nearest edge
then you're going to want to make this
into a custom shortcut so that's it
these are four more extremely
time-saving sketch 3 workflow tips if
