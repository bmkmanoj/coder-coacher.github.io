up Hut's and today we're going to start
a new series on gulp now you maybe have
never heard of gulp or maybe you've
heard of gulp and seem to get tossed
around on blogs and stuff and maybe not
know known as about and maybe you know
exactly what gulp is about and just
haven't taken the time to learn it yet
well this series is going to have all of
you covered because I'm going to start
the absolute very basics I'm going to
explain exactly what gulps doing and how
we're doing it and why you want to use
it and we're going to take that and
we're going to build it into some really
advanced functionality so really quick
what gulp is is it's a build system that
allows you to do all sorts of things
gulp with one command can do things like
searching your project for any images
and compressing them it can compress and
concatenate javascript files it can
compile your sass code it can do way
more than that it can even trigger a
live reload in your browser so at the
heart of gulp is what you're writing our
various tasks and then you can tell gulp
to run a task to go complete a task and
maybe that task runs several other tasks
maybe it just runs one task and it's
done so maybe you say go p-- compress my
images and go p-- goes and compresses
all of your images and maybe you just
say gulp and what it does is it compiles
your sass on save at triggers live
reload and automatically compiles any
new images you put into that folder no
matter what you're using gulp for
there's one thing a shirred is that
there's tons of flexibility and there's
tons of great things you can do with it
so keep watching and we're going to
write our very first gulp file today ok
so here we have just a basic HTML app
and I'm going to use gulp directly in
this but you don't need anything fancy
you can just go ahead and use gulp
within the directory of the project
you're working on currently now the
first thing we need to do is install
gulp globally now to do that we can just
do NPM install - JEE and then
gulp now you need node installed on your
computer for this to work so if you have
not installed node go ahead and grab
nodejs
from nodejs org and install it there and
then the npm command will work for you
now we just need npm install - g gulp
and that's going to install gulp on our
entire system so if you get errors like
these then you actually have to run this
as a Rooter administrator so you can run
sudo npm install - g gulp
another way to do that is if you just
typed npm install gulp and you got these
errors you can just simply type sudo
space and then - exclamation points and
that's going to fill in your previous
command and now it enter it will ask for
your password and now it's going to
install gulp on my system after gulp is
installed on your system
you then have to install it into your
project ok so now that I'm in the root
directory for this project keep in mind
you're going to want to be in the root
directory of your project you're going
to type NPM install save dev gulp now if
you had issues before with permissions
then you most likely will have them
again no worries you can always just
type sudo npm install save - dev gulp i
would also try to just do npm install -
- save dev gulp first and if that
doesn't work then use sudo so we can go
ahead and hit enter here and that's
going to install gulp directly into our
local project
okay so after that you see this message
here it looks like everything installed
correctly if we come back to our project
you'll now see that we have a node
modules folder and inside of it is a
gulp folder and a dot bin folder quote
well we won't have to go into those but
they should exist if you ran that
command successfully okay so now let's
actually create a gulp file and what a
gulp file is is it's basically a set of
instructions that tells gulp what you
want it to do so once we get into more
complex things you can write several
tasks such as compile which might
compile your sass code in this version
we're going to be writing a default task
and the default task is the task that
runs when you just simply type gulp so
by right-clicking on our folder and
sublime text I'm just going to create a
new file at the root level of our
project and this is just simply needs to
be named gulp file j/s now gulp file dot
j s is just a JavaScript file and gulp
is going to look into this file to know
what to do so let's get started writing
our gulp file from scratch I mean you
could always copy a gulp file from
another project but gulp isn't one of
those things that's too complex to know
exactly how it's working in fact once
you really dive into the code it makes a
ton of sense so don't skip out and copy
and paste so actually go along and write
your tasks yourself when you're starting
that way you can know exactly what you
can do and right really customize gulp
scripts so let's go ahead and type bar
gulp and then gulp is going to be equal
to and then we're going to require go so
this is where we're importing the gulp
note package by requiring gulp here any
time we call gulp it's going to go to
the gulp note package
okay so next all we need is to use the
task method so we're going to say go dot
task now in parentheses we're just going
to type default now typically this is
going to be your task name such as if
you were going to minify javascript or
something you could maybe have this task
say minify right so that way you could
at some point command gulp minify and it
would run that task however if you have
default here you don't need to type
default when you run your gulp command
you can just type gulp we'll see that in
action in a second okay so now we just
need a callback here and we're just
going to be a function just like this
and inside of our function is the code
that's going to be run when you run this
gulp task now since this is just a demo
and we're just getting started by
installing gulp we're just going to do a
Council dot log and then we're going to
Council log hello world with the classic
example and make sure you finish it off
with a semicolon there so your code
should look just like this perfect check
that out if there's something weird go
ahead and adjust it now we're going to
run our gulp command now from in the
root level of our project you can see
that by typing LS or you can see that we
have the gulp file is right here so now
all I need to do is type gulp that's it
now let's it enter and we have our
output it's saying that it's using this
gulp file that's located here it started
at the default task the default task
output hello world and it finished after
that with a time how long it took to
finish all right now this is quite
simply the easiest most bare-bones
example you can give for a gulp file and
it doesn't really do
anything useful I can assure you that
gulp does many things very usefully so
check out the next video where we set up
our first gulp plugin and get going with
some actual functionality building out
our gulp file as always this is Scott
would love love tuts if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video or hit us up at Twitter or
Facebook or anywhere we love to hear
from you thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
