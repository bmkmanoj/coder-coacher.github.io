up tuts and today I'm gonna be showing
you a technique for replacing text with
images and using CSS and what this is
going to do is it's going to allow us to
do some features like you'd normally see
on a site maybe the title of the site is
not text right right now we have our
main h1 as saying level up Tut's right
here and it's text but what if you have
a logo like we have a logo and you want
it to be like an anchor that leads to
the home page and you want this to be
your logo here well you could do it
several ways and you could do it with an
image you know an image wrapped at an
anchor but that's certainly not the way
you would want to do it
semantically you're going to want this
to be an h1 on your home page and you're
gonna want to be an h2 on any of your
interior pages for not only SEO purposes
but just so screen readers and things
they know what your pages so they know
what it's about so you're all you're not
gonna want to have this be an image
necessarily um if you don't have an h1
with the page or your site title or
anything in it so I'm gonna show you how
to do that real quick and this is
actually going to start bringing this
page that we have that looks sort of
funky right now it's gonna start
bringing their round into what looks
like a more useable website so we're
gonna do some different things and first
of which I'm going to be pulling this h1
I'm gonna put it above this main
container here and I'm gonna be removing
this l+ from our background because I'm
gonna be using an image for this so
let's get to it here in our HTML I'm
going to just take this h1 and I'm going
to grab it right out of this main call
and let's see I'm gonna put it right
here and I'm gonna wrap it in a header
tag this is an HTML tag html5 tag oh it
suggests checking out something like
html5 doctor to learn more about html5
rules and what semantically correct to
use in what sort of situations but for
the header here
I'm gonna say the h1 goes in here so an
inside of our h1 here we're going to add
an anchor and you know right now it
doesn't really have anywhere to lead but
I'll just have it lead to index.html and
it doesn't really matter because we only
have one page but I'm gonna want this to
be leading in to my my home page no
matter what cuz this is gonna be the the
title link and okay so we have our
header here with our h1 in it now let's
go back to our HTML page we can see what
it looks like okay pops it up right here
now in our CSS I'm gonna take out this
image right here so I'm gonna get rid of
this image I'm gonna leave the color
here just like this so our background
still gonna be purple now I'm gonna add
some styles to our header I'm gonna do a
header and inside of the header I'm
gonna have the width be the same 55% and
I'm gonna have the margin the 20 pixels
top and bottom in Auto okay save it
check it out here we go so now we want
this to be our logo right okay so we
want this to be our logo but we don't
want this text to be here so there's an
image replacement technique that's
pretty common and it's not them it's not
the most uh you know it's that the the
latest and greatest there is actually a
couple of new image replacement
techniques that are pretty cool too but
we're gonna go over at this one because
it's really easy to understand exactly
what's going on okay and then later
future tutorials I'm gonna show you a
different image replacement technique or
you can experiment and check them out on
your own even CSS tricks has a post with
a whole ton of different image
replacement techniques okay so this one
is very common and what we're going to
do here is for each one and actually let
me give this because let me give this a
class because on like I said on home
pages we're gonna want this h1 the home
page we're gonna want this age 1 to be
our page or our website title
but on inside pages we want our page
title to be the h1 and we want this to
be an h2 so we really want this image
replacement to be on the class itself
instead of the h1 or the h2 and inside
of here I'm going to have the image
width which is 200 887 pixels the image
height which is a hundred pixels and a
background with a link to our logo with
a no-repeat because we don't want this
repeating okay so let's save this and
let's check out the page here we refresh
and we can see that the background is
here but our text is still here of
course we just want this image to be
here and it's not really clickable so
what we want to do is we want to put
this on the anchor itself and so we're
gonna do it like this this is going to
give our our anchor we also want this to
display block by the way this is going
to give our anchor a width of 87 and a
height of 100 and display block the
background is going to be this and now
if we refresh our page you'll see you
can click on this whole thing so right
here you click on any part of the image
okay it's getting closer now we just
need this text to be gone well there's a
great thing in CSS you can do a text
indent and it indents your text just the
way it would work in Word but you give
it like a pixel value well in CSS you
can also give a text indent a negative
value since we already saying this logo
is only 287 pixels by a hundred pixels
and it's just play block we're going to
say text indent and we're going to give
this a negative 9999 pixels it's just
gonna move it off the screen okay so
let's save this let's go to our page
let's refresh and the text is gone but
you can still click anywhere here and
it's gonna take you to your home page
also if we check the source it still has
our text in here h1 level of Tut's as
is gonna read this angle that's the logo
okay it's linking to home perfect we now
have a linking home image up at the top
and this site looks a little bit better
okay well this is image replacement in
CSS in the next lesson I'm going to show
you a technique you can now use now that
you know image replacement something
called CSS sprites and that's something
that's extremely useful just see it used
in all the major sites and it's just a
really great you know tool to have in
your tool set okay so this is a image
replacement with CSS and like I said
this is just one technique gears lots of
other ones you can go research them
yourself or we'll probably go over some
others in the future as always if you
have any questions leave a comment on
