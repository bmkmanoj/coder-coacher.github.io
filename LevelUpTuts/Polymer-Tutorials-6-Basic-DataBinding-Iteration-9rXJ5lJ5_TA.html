love tuts and today we're going to be
getting into some more data binding with
polymer what we're going to be doing is
using an array of objects we're going to
be iterating over those objects all with
inside of our custom element so check it
out we're going to get started right now
so in the last video we started with
some very basic data binding where we
just had the name attribute get passed
in and then output into our h1 with this
hello name so now we're going to
experiment a little bit more with data
binding maybe with some more complex
things not too complex though we're just
going to be getting into iterating over
objects and things like that so to get
started we actually want to modify this
script in fact right now we're just sort
of saying the name variable is equal to
world by default but we want to do is
say when polymer is ready as when when
polymer is loaded we want to load in
some data so do that we actually need to
make some modifications first thing is
we want to pass in the name of our new
element into our polymer function here
so we can do that in the string just
after the first parenthesis or the curly
bracket so we can say hello - world with
the name of our attribute and then comma
and then our first curly bracket now
inside of here we can actually have a
ready function so we can type ready :
and then function and then inside of
this function is where we're going to be
setting some of our variables up now we
want name to be this dot name and we
want to change this colon to in equals
so now this dot name is going to be
equal to world just like that so if we
refresh our page we'll see that I'd now
says hello world just as it did before
okay well this is nothing
earth-shattering it's just pretty much
of the same however it is getting our
element ready for some more complex
things and let's make names into an
array of objects so we can say let's
make this into an array here and now
we're going to have objects with a name
and then a specific name
close it out and let's add a couple more
of these so we now have just an array of
objects even though there's only one
thing in this object here I did it this
way that we could open it up in case we
wanted to add more things so now our
hello name is not going to work because
we have this array of names and now we
need to iterate over this list of names
so we can do that inside of our template
using a template tag so to illustrate
this I'm actually going to turn this h1
into a list item because this is going
to be a list of names now and I'll start
off with an open and closing ul here
okay so now we need to iterate over
these list items to do that we're going
to use a template tag so we can say
template and this template tag is going
to wrap around the item we want iterated
over and now to actually have that
function like how we would expect we're
going to be using repeat so it's going
to say repeat equals and then inside of
quotes here and inside of brackets
double brackets like we've been using we
can now say name in names so this is
taking the name array and then spitting
out a name for each one so now our hello
name is still not going to work because
we're going to say name dot name to
access the name item within this object
so let's save this and let's check out
our code let's refresh we now have hello
world hello Scott and hello Ben so as
you can see we're now doing a little bit
here more with JavaScript we're using
the ready function to load up our data
on ready and then iterate it with our
template and if you want to check out
what the Dom looks like because we have
this template repeat let's go ahead and
do that while we're here I'm going to
inspect this and as you can see it's not
actually wrapping this template this
template tag sort of sits on
top of things so we have the UL then
this template tag which is set to
display:none it's not going to show up
anything and then we have each of our
list items below that so we don't have
anything weird with the the Dom
structure where we have a template tag
wrapping these list items in anyway that
just sort of sits on top there okay so
that's a really basic data binding like
I said we're moving kind of slow and
we're just sort of adding little things
here and there in the next video we're
going to show you how to have dynamic
two-way data-binding
in a way that's really super easy and
we're going to introduce to you some
basic declarative binding of events so
we can handle a click event in the next
video and after that we're going to
start exploring the custom core polymer
elements once we get into those it's
going to be a lot of fun to see how
those are built in the capabilities of
what they're all doing so that we can
build more complex elements ourselves as
always this is Scott with level up tuts
if you have any questions or comments
leave a comment the video hit us up at
Facebook or Twitter I level up tuts we'd
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
