up tutorials and today we're going to
show you how you can get started working
with your views and templates within
meteor so essentially what we're going
to be doing is creating an array of
objects in our view that we can display
in our template using a separate
template tag so we're gonna go over how
to do all that and it's really nice and
easy and I'll lay the foundation for
what's to come
as in taking data from your application
itself and then displaying it and
perhaps modifying it in some way so
let's get going on that right now so
let's first take a look at this
resolutions HTML and here what we'd saw
before is this welcome to meteor h1 then
we have this double bracket with a
greater than and then hello now we
mentioned briefly that this hello is
referencing this template and whatever
you put in this template is going to be
output by this hello in fact this can be
immediately apparent just by duplicating
this hello tag here let's come to our
page and you'll see without even
refreshing this is actually one of the
best parts about meteor I know there's a
lot of other auto-refresh
frameworks and stuff like that that you
can use maybe with a preprocessor
however this is just really fast I made
the change in the HTML and it was here
in an instant before I could even see
the change happen okay so as we saw that
this hello is referencing this name
hello and then displaying the content
inside of here what we want to do is we
want to actually create a template here
that is going to be outputting our
resolutions so I think a good start
would be to simply deliberate of
everything within the body tag and let's
get rid of everything within this
template tag now let's change the name
from hello to resolution okay so this is
now going to be our resolution a
template and to check to make sure it's
working we can just type hello in here
and now let's
put our resolution template by doing
double brackets greater than and then
the name of our template which is
resolution okay now if we head back you
can see that hello is now being
displayed okay so we have a meteor is
recognizing that we have this template
simply by outputting it here and giving
it a name now what we want to do is give
our template tags some things to output
now first what we want to do is we want
to make a unordered list of our
resolutions and what we're gonna be
doing is iterating over a list of these
resolutions and then outputting each one
so you can think about it like this we
have this template that's resolution
this template is going to be a list item
every single time its output so what we
want to do is have the list item inside
this template like this and we would
want to have our resolution name here
for now I'm just gonna type the word
name or let's just actually say the word
title that might be more appropriate
it's a title of the piece of content and
you'll notice is your list items so
let's go ahead and wrap this resolution
in an unordered list okay so now when we
head back to our document you can see we
have an unordered list with one list
item and its name is title okay well
this is nothing crazy it's using
everything we already know just this
template tag in basic HTML so that's
great however let's actually get this
outputting some sort of dynamic content
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
define an array of objects in our
JavaScript file and then this template
is going to be able to access those so
what we're gonna do is come to our
resolution CAS and I'm just going to
start deleting everything that's in
between these brackets here that says
meteor is client and I'll leave this is
server here because we're
not gonna be using it the stuff that
we're getting into in this video is all
going to be within this meteor is client
so this is essentially your front-end
code but in meteor it's really cool
because a lot of the times the front-end
code in the backend code end up sort of
being the same thing and there might be
a little weird concept if you're not
used to working with meteor but you'll
see how it all works out and how you can
get around it when you need to okay so
we have inside of this meteor is client
we want to go ahead and create what's
called a template helper and a template
helper essentially just allows you to
use that information on this page so
because we want to use that helper in
between our body tags here and not
within our template we're gonna be using
the helper in this part of the code what
we can actually do is use a meteor
function and that's accessed by saying
template dot body dot helpers and then
you have your parentheses and then
brackets so let's hit enter here and
finish this off with a semicolon
and let's save this so what this is
basically saying is pretty much anything
that's in the the body of our
application that's not in a specific
template is going to be given the
ability to have a helper that's used in
your HTML with this template body
helpers you'll see this pattern a lot in
meteor using this blaze view system
essentially what we're defining is
different parts of functionality so for
instance if we have events like a click
event or of submitting of a form and
it's on the body it would be under
template dot body dot events and there's
several different more of these template
things that you're going to run into as
we go over the course these videos and
it's gonna make a lot more sense also if
this
template helper needed to be used within
this template tag it would actually be
defined as template resolution helpers
okay it might seem a little abstract
until we get into some code so let's
type an object in here within our helper
so this object is going to be the helper
itself so let's go ahead and save
resolutions so resolutions is our key
and our value is going to be an array so
we have and we have brackets here and
then followed by curly brackets we're
going to have several options in our
array and what we wanted to use was
title so the title key is going to be
hello resolution number one airless save
yeah
resolution number one okay so now we'll
we have an array with a single object in
here that just says title resolutions
number one so by defining this
resolution object within our helpers
here we're now able to output
resolutions in our HTML so if we were to
come here and simply say resolutions
like this with no notice how there's no
care here no greater than if we come
back to our page we're getting this
object object essentially what's
happening is that this is an object it
has a lot of items in it so what we do
with items to get out of them is we can
iterate over them so the way you would
do that using this templating system is
just by saying pound each resolutions
and actually we want to move this inside
of our UL okay so let's come in here
okay and now we're going to add one more
of these which is just double and then
what we have is a forward slash and then
the word each this is essentially
closing this loop so now what's gonna
happen is for every single item in
resolutions it's going to out
put this template resolution since we
just have the words title in here right
now if we come to our page we're not
gonna be seeing anything other than
title however what we now have access to
is each individual item so to output
that let's do it inside of our loop
first and we can simply say this Auto
completing out of here we can simply say
with two brackets title that's it it's
gonna look at our JavaScript and say
okay this is the first item here's the
title here's the text we come to our
page you'll see hello resolution and
it's outside of our list now we can
modify our list code by simply just
saying title right here instead of the
text title if we save this you'll notice
that inside of our loop we now have
hello resolution number one okay so what
it's doing is it ER ating over
resolutions coming to this template
seeing this template and they're now
putting the value of title so let's go
ahead and add another object to this
list so I'm going to put a comma here
copy this line and add another one so by
resolution number two okay and let's
just add one more and it's just gonna
say Kanye West so when we save this
you'll notice that each item is getting
added to the list and if we come out to
inspect this element and our inspect
you'll see that each one like we'd
expect as being output within this UL so
like I said before it's giving this
object of resolutions saying for each
one do something and that do something
is hitting this template and then
outputting the title here okay so this
was a lot of information cuz it's the
first time we've worked with a lot of
things like helpers it's the first time
we've been displaying something it's the
first time we've iterated over anything
so what you should take away from this
is that to iterate over and
of things we just have these simple
pound signs each and you end this loop
with the forward slash each this caret
denotes that you're going into a
template and what you're outputting is
just simply as bracket bracket the key
bracket bracket okay so like I said this
might seem abstract at this point but in
the next video what we're gonna do is
we're actually going to be pulling these
resolutions from the database rather
than from an array that's sitting in our
template body helpers and you'll get to
see exactly how that works and then
after that we're gonna build a form that
allows you to add new objects new
resolutions and we're gonna get into
editing deleting in all that stuff then
you're gonna have complete control over
adding and removing things to the
database visually and it's gonna be
really awesome so keep watching we're
gonna get into all that very soon as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave it calm in the video or
hit us up at twitter or facebook at
level up tuts we'd love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
