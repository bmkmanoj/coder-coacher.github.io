of Tut's and today I'm gonna show you
how to start modifying your Android
application with Java itself so in the
last lesson we learned a little bit
about strings and then before that we
learned about this activity main.xml
file and how that's generating this file
here that we made that say hello level
up Tut's we ran this in our emulator and
it looked just like this and had a
button you could press so make sure you
have your emulator open you can see I
have mine otherwise it might take a
little while to boot up so make sure
that's up and running just so you can
get through this nice and fast and we're
going to start looking at our code here
so first thing I want you to check out
is we're going to be going into your
project folder and inside of the SRC
folder which stands for your source
you'll see this package and this is the
package name that we gave our project I
gave my comm level up dot level up tuts
and if we open this up you're gonna see
this main activity dot Java you're gonna
want to click on this file because this
is the Java file that pertains to the
XML file we were just in so this is the
main activity of our app and as you can
see this is exactly one there's one
class in here called main activity and
the way Java works is is that it's
organized into classes so you're gonna
see that each file has a class so for
the most part you can ignore a lot of
things in here because we're only going
to go over what's important to us at the
time and then because there's no reason
to address some of these things if you
know you're not using them right now
it's just gonna be confusing because as
you can see if you open this up it may
be a little bit scary and you may not
know exactly what's going on but don't
worry about it we'll go over everything
and you'll be totally understanding it
by the end so main thing you're gonna
notice is up here we have our package
name here we have an import line that
opens up into several other import lines
we'll go over this more in a second and
here's our class so inside of our class
we have a method and a method is a
function that you can call so in this
instance we have a
method here that's named oncreate and
what this void means is that it's not
returning anything so if you're used to
programming typically you'd have a
function that returns something let's
say you have a function that is to you
you know your function is just adding
two numbers it'll take two arguments you
add them together and it returns the sum
of the numbers in this case we're not
returning anything so it has this void
here like I said this methods to name is
on create and it accepts one argument
the argument is of the bundle datatype
and it's a save instance state like I
said don't worry about this stuff right
now we're gonna ignore these lines right
here
so this setcontentview what it's doing
here is it's setting the content view
and you notice this are and you'll see
this are a lot through android basically
this R stands for your resources and
this is a file that's generated by
Android or by the and this is a file
that's generated when you edit other
things in your project so if we open up
this gen folder you'll see your package
and then there's this our file if we
open this up you'll see at the top in a
code comment auto-generated file do not
modify this is something that gets
created and you'll never have to touch
this so just go ahead and close out of
it because you don't I mean the only
time you might have to look into it is
to see if something was not generated
for some reason either way what this is
doing is saying the resource that we
have that the layout and his activity
main is going to be the layout well
activity main that XML is the layout
here that we were using before so I'm
create the main activity who's going to
be sitting our content view to this
activity main.xml file so let's say we
wanted to when the app is created we
want this text right here to change
whenever the app is created as in when
an app is first launched this text will
change and you won't see a change but
when you load up the app it will just
say something other than hello level up
to us so this is our very first step
into anything
interactive here so what we're gonna do
here is I'm gonna make some space and
first thing we want to do is define a
new variable and this variable is going
to be what you use to access the item on
our XML file in this case we want to
access this box right here which if you
recall is text view 1 it's a text view
and so we want to access that within our
Java to do that we need to create a new
variable and it's of the data type text
view if your common last video when
we're talking about variables when we
want to declare a string we started off
with the word string here textview is up
there data type just like string however
it's this one's a little bit different
it's not universal of Java this is
particular to Android itself so we're
gonna say textview and then we're going
to name our text you just like we named
our variable in the last video and this
is going to be called text one it can be
called whatever you'd like it's better
off if this is a descriptive word
something that means something to what
this text is but this isn't really a
descriptive label so we don't have to
worry about that yet and we're gonna set
this equal to and this needs to be equal
to the text box in our layout so to
access that in particular we need to use
a method called find view by deed and
we're going to pass it argument that is
the resource and so the resource if you
remember from this set content view up
here as our and if we type our you can
see eclipse is going to give us some
help well we want to find it by a D so
you can highlight ID and hit enter and
period again and you're gonna see all of
the resources available
we named ours textview one so we're
gonna hit enter on textview one and so
no if we finish this off with semicolon
you can see that the textview text 1 is
now equal to this view that we found ok
well one thing you may have noticed is
is this textview is underlined in red if
you hover your mouse over here you're
going to get this little helper window
and it's gonna say cannot be dissolved
to a type that's because this textview
is not a java type it is a an android
data type in specifically so to use this
data type we need two important so hover
over your textview here and go down
where it says import textview give that
a click and this under line is going to
go away let's open up our import that we
have up here and you'll now see there's
an import Andrew Android widget that
textview cool and you'll also notice now
that this is underlined as well so this
is a little something that's we're not
going to go over right now it just says
do you want to add a cast to textview
we're going to click add the cast to
textview I'll explain that more however
you can see what it does here it just
adds this right here and like I said
we'll explain this more depth later
however we now have our our variable
text 1 and it is our textview and
there's nothing that's underlined in red
so we're good now we want to set our
text 1 to just some dummy text so what
we can do is call our variable text 1
and then we're gonna run a method on
text 1 and it's going to be we're going
to type dot and then we're going to say
set text and then inside of here we're
going to give it some text to set we're
gonna say changed so this way we know if
this is changed and we finish it off
with semicolon now I'm gonna save the
file and I'm gonna click this play
button right here to run it in our
emulator
so once this loads up here you're gonna
see that our main text view is now going
to say changed and this says that
instead of the hello level up Tut's that
we had there before so you can see we
are setting a new text view and we're
setting that to be the resource from our
XML file so we have our text view here
named text 1 and we're setting its text
dude change once the app is then started
and it's running this oncreate method
great so there's a lot of mystery still
and we're gonna go over a ton more and
as we go through these things and go
through different exercises all this
mystery will be lifted and you'll start
to have a great understanding as to what
all of this stuff means exactly so keep
on holding on and we're gonna get over
some stuff to use our button in the next
video as always this is Scott with level
up tuts if you have any questions please
