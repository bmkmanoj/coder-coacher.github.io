up huts and today I'm gonna show you how
to set up your PayPal account with
Magento and really I haven't done a
video on this however it's really simple
so all you have to do is go to system
configuration and this is if you want
your PayPal account to accept payments
as a PayPal account is and your
customers will see PayPal on your site
they will be linked to either PayPal
site or they'll be asked to log in if
they have their own PayPal account
already but if not they can just use as
a credit card processor just say no this
is not PayPal payments Pro or any of
those things because I you have to pay
for those accounts and I don't have one
so it's really hard for me to show that
however I have set it up before for
clients I just wouldn't be comfortable
using their websites for these videos
however it's not too difficult most
these payment systems are really easy to
set up and in fact to set up PayPal they
really make it as easy as possible so
I'm gonna get started here by entering
my email and the email I have hooked up
with my PayPal account
okay and if you'll notice now that I
have my email in here it's allowing me
to check this Express Checkout which of
course is the one that I want because
it's the free one so I'm gonna click
Express Checkout and now you could see
it to open this Express Checkout
settings already for me and so we could
just remove this title just save paypal
you know they don't need to know it's
PayPal Express or whatever and because
this is the only payment I'm gonna
accept it's gonna be zero it's gonna be
first on the list even though I might
have some other payment methods set up
for the site currently now when it
launches I probably I'm only gonna
accept paypal well when it launches if
it launches it's never gonna launch but
fictionally if this were to launch I
would want PayPal so debug mode allows
you to just test the site we might as
well send it to debug mode because I
personally do not want anything charged
to my PayPal account
uh-huh or anything in this demo setup so
I'm going to set it to demo mode so most
of these other settings you're not going
to need to touch this transfer shipping
options and even explains what it is
saying that PayPal can handle up to ten
shipping options as well and gentle only
transfer the first ten cheapest options
yeah and I don't even have ten shipping
options it's it's fine
so let's say keep seeing what we have
shortcut on shopping cart sure shortcut
on product view sure actually we don't
want the shortcut I'm proud of you
because this is gonna put an ugly PayPal
button on our on our products which I'd
rather not have and they bought PayPal
guests check out this is if your users
want to just pay without a PayPal
account I think that's perfectly
perfectly acceptable I don't see why you
make them use a PayPal account
I personally don't even like PayPal is a
company that much so I will probably
check that it's no so they won't be
committed to be using PayPal for
everything or so it's saying this
required customer billing address is
saying this actually needs to be enabled
through PayPal technical support so I'm
not gonna worry about that I don't even
need that anyways billing your agreement
sign up no I don't need a billing
agreement and authorization on their
period three days sure these these
defaults are all probably going to be
fine okay so as you can see these are
the PayPal settings simply by putting my
email in here this is where it's going
to send the payments so as you can see
it's not really that that complicated
doing like this PayPal a group billing
agreement I'm gonna say no and let's
click through this and let's go to these
front-end experience settings and so
it's gonna say do you want this PayPal
logo somewhere on your site and honestly
I don't I mean some people are gonna
want this big old we prefer we accept
paypal logo to let your client customers
know but really yeah I don't I don't
want to go gotta get my site with a
bunch of PayPal logos and stuff like
that so I'm just gonna go ahead and
select no logo and we should be good to
go here and this is gonna show you
exactly how easy it is to set up PayPal
with Magento okay configuration has been
saved now let's go to the front end of
our site
and let's put something in our cart if
we don't already let's give it okay and
I'm gonna add just this phone in my cart
this one is on sale and it's gonna my
car so you'll know services checkout
with PayPal button here now we can click
this and it's gonna redirect us to
PayPal with the amount that we're gonna
purchase this for now of course I'm not
going to go through with this
transaction but you can see if I were to
this amount would be getting paid to the
account that you have set up with this
and that's really cool because it took
us no time to set up what happens if you
proceed to checkout instead of go if
they pay with PayPal I'm gonna check out
as a guest and I'm gonna enter my
information so one second all right I'm
selecting my shipping and we'll see what
our options are here we'll check it out
there's also PayPal right here so in the
in the configuration we told the PayPal
buttons to show up on the shopping cart
and if you don't want those there this
shortcut on shopping cart you can select
no and it might make it a little less
confusing for your customers because
that you can see if we click this it's
still gonna redirect them to the PayPal
site just like it would if they went
into the checkout it was just uh well
it's it's actually mad at me right now
because I threw in some bogus
information for my shipping address so
PayPal is going to be privy to that it's
gonna notice so I thought I could get
away with it but clearly it is knowing
that my information is completely false
so this is how you set up PayPal it's
really simple and you'll notice now that
I uncheck that box that our pay with
PayPal is gone here and the proceed with
checkout is just like normal again so if
you have any questions or comments
Blizzard come in the video hit the
Twitter level up that's let us knew what
you're thinking as always this is Scott
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
