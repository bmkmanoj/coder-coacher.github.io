of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how you can extend sketch 3 with all
sorts of custom UI kits downloadable
sketch project templates and all sorts
of things like that from a really great
sketch resource so keep watching we're
to show you that now so now that you
become a master of sketch 3 you using
the sketch toolbox your polling and
plugins you're utilizing all sorts of
custom artboard symbols and all sorts of
great stuff what's the next step to
becoming a better sketch user well
there's all sorts of things but one of
my favorite resources for sketch
anything is sketch app sources calm now
you can come on here and not only get
access to tutorials and articles and
things like that what's great about here
is that they have all of these great UI
kits now some of these things like the
Apple iOS 7 uh UI kit you can download a
sample or you can purchase it and this
is going to take you to another website
in this case it's ui8 net and here you
can purchase this entire kit or you can
come and look at the free only resources
so like the Android upcoming L release
UI kit has a free download where you can
download this entire UI kit and it's
awesome so actually let's go ahead and
download that just to check it out so
I'm going to open up this sketch file I
don't have Rockwell but that's ok let's
open this anyways we shouldn't really
need Rockwell anyways because that's not
an Android font so let's go ahead and
get rid of that and here we have this
fantastic Android L UI kit so not only
is this I mean the Android L is just
absolutely the beautiful interface
anyways but we have this just totally
excellent UI kit that we can use to
start off our own material design
projects and you'll even notice they
have if we insert they do have custom
symbols so it might not be completed we
just have switch ON switch off we have
status bar navigation bar but if you
need anything else you can always create
your own custom symbols out of
in this uikit but it should give you a
nice jumping-off point to know exactly
what to do for Android L style material
design mock-ups so I should note that
we're not actually affiliated in any way
with sketch app sources it's just a
really great resource in fact our videos
aren't even yet featured on the
tutorials and tips maybe they will be at
some point but not right now
so just check it out there's just tons
and tons of stuff to go through and you
can look and evaluate their technique
and see what other people are doing to
make really great things so for instance
this heart-shaped box you want to see
and know how they make this you can
simply download it and tear apart the
sketch file and figure out exactly what
they did cool so check it out that
sketch app sources I'm gonna put the
link in the description of the video and
you can go to that whenever you want if
there's a sketch resource that you
really like maybe even it's just a
particular resource on sketch app
sources or maybe it's on another website

everybody we would love to see what you
