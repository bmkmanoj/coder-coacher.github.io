up Tut's and today we're going to be
starting our command-line basics out
with the most basic commands you need to
know and that's really how to get around
your file system so when you load up
your I term your terminal whatever it's
probably going to look something like
this
if you're on OSX it's going to start you
within your users home directory but if
you want to look around to see what else
is in this folder the command you'll be
using is LS now if no options are passed
here it's just going to list out our
files that are within this current
folder alphabetically so you can see
when I hit enter we have applications
and we got desktops documents downloads
Dropbox Google Drive if I were to open
up my finder and look into my own user
directory you would see these exact
folders and/or files so LS is not only
just showing you your folders but it's
showing you your files it's listing
everything in the data in the directory
that you're currently in so LS list now
you can pass options or arguments to
some commands to modify their output for
instance if we type LS space and then -
L a it's going to list not only all of
our files and folders but it's going to
list the hidden folders the ones that is
that's prefaced with a period and it's
going to list their permissions who owns
them when they were last updated and
their file size so LS - space - la is a
great way to get way more information
about those current files now if you
ever just sort of want to see where
you're at in what's going on you can
always just type LS really quick and
sort of get a good picture of what the
file system looks like around you in
fact I frequently just type LS just to
sort of get a grasp on where I am and
what's going on now let's say we want to
move
move into a folder because typically
you're not going to want to do
everything from one uh you know not
everything you need is going to be in
the director you're at so you're going
to have to move now
the way to move is with the change
directory command or CD so CD stands for
change directory so you do the command
then space and now we can type in the
folder that we want to go into now I
want to go into my site's folder and
what's useful is that I can hit s and
then I can hit tab and you'll notice
since I have nothing else that begins
with an S is gone ahead and Auto
completed this for me now let's try that
with something with a Dee I'm gone back
and deleted this and let's up because I
have Dropbox documents in Google Drive
if I have capital D and then hit tab
you'll notice it doesn't want to
autocomplete it for me you'll up you'll
notice that if I double tap it it's
going to show me all of the things with
the D that I can possibly go to so now
if I hit do double tap it again you can
see it's now limiting it to just the do
I fill it out to see hit tab and it will
autocomplete so typically you're going
to be typing things like CD s tab and
then enter now you'll notice that it now
says that I am in the site's directory
instead of the tilde so the tilde was my
home directory and now I'm in the site's
directory now if i type LS you can see I
have the folders backups clients LevelUp
personal and projects so what happens if
I made a mistake I wanted to go back to
where I was well you can type CD space
dot dot now the dot dot is going to take
you back one directory
now after I hit enter you can see by the
tilde that I'm back in my home directory
now what happens if I know that I want
to arrive in my level of HUD's directory
and then I want to see what's there
well you don't have to actually change
directory into sites and then change
directory again and to level up well you
can simply do is type CD sites I typed s
and hit tab and then I can just type L
and hit tab once more and it's going to
autocomplete level up and you can see by
having the slashes here just like you're
used to and maybe like a URL or
something like that
it's a folder structure so we're saying
change directory into sites into level
up
now once I hit enter I'm now within the
level up folder you can see by the
declaration right here if i type LS you
can see i have a whole bunch of poorly
named folders inside of here like
dr-drop drupal level gerbil level up
sometimes i make these in a hurry
so that's why they exist like that but
these are my folders within the level up
cool so now you have a basic
understanding of command line using CD
and LS you can effectively know where
you are in move forward and backwards
through your file structure so as always
this is Scott with level up tuts if you
