of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to make a CSS drop down menu and
we're going to start from scratch so
over the course of the next couple
videos I'm going to make everything from
a simple one level CSS drop down menu to
a two level CSS drop down menu and then
we're going to make some sort of large
mega menu something that has content in
it that's not just links so maybe images
or all sorts of stuff who knows so first
off I wanted to start off I've just made
this document here and it's just a index
file from html5 boilerplate even says
hello this is html5 boilerplate didn't
really even bother to remove that but as
you can see I have a nav tag and then I
have a ul and inside of the unordered
list I have a list item an anchor tag
and then inside of that list item I have
another unordered list some list items
with an anchor in it and then I close
that close that and then I do it again
and then come down here close everything
off so if we go to our our document here
you'll see it looks just like a basic we
have a list item and then a list item
within a list item and so on and so
forth
so these link level ones are going to be
our main links and that's great and here
these links below them are going to be
the hover over these are going to be the
drop down portion of our drop down menu
so notice how there's absolutely no
styling or anything done whatsoever so
we're going to be starting fresh with
this so let me pull up our CSS and
notice how there's just some things to
it this is all the stuff that just comes
with html5 boilerplate so authors custom
styles my Styles are going to go right
here okay and normally you know we'd
want to give this a class or something
but since this is the only navigation on
our page we don't have to worry about
too much let's say that this nav has a
background of
let's just say 999 mmm you know just a
nice gray color actually let's take it a
little bit darker than that will do 666
and we'll make all of the link colors
white maybe even three three three
whatever I wasn't planning on going dark
with this but it's cool I'm just going
to make all my anchors on the site color
white there we go and I'm also going to
have a no underline on these to begin
with I'll do like a hover State that'll
be a little bit more obvious on the link
itself so okay here we go we have our
links and they're looking a little bit
better what is the first step here well
the first step is is that we need to
make these list items in a line and so
you could use something like
display:inline to get these all in line
here however we're going to want to make
these block items right now they're list
they're display list item is their
display property but we're going to want
it to be display:block
and we're going to want them to
float:left so let's come down here and
let's go back to our CSS so we're going
to say nav ql I'll make this here just
so we can add some stuff there later
then they have UL li and we're going to
say display:block float:left so let's go
to our page here and refresh and you'll
notice you don't see anything well it's
really because we're floating these
items here and taking them out of the
flow of the document if you watch the
video on floating you'll know that when
you float something it takes it out of
the flow and since our nav here has the
background on it it essentially
collapses because everything in it is
now out of the flow of the document so
if we come to our nav
html5 boilerplate actually has a clear
fix class they built into it so I'm just
going to give this nav a class of clear
fix actually better yet I'm going to put
it on the unordered list here just like
that and let's come back to our page
refresh and we now have our links 1 2 3
4 5 and you'll notice that these links
are also being assigned display:block
and float:left we don't want that we
want those straight up and down
so let's come back to our CSS and we can
now say nav UL li and then we can now
say inside of the list item we have
another list item in another or another
order of us in another list item and
inside of here all we have to say is
float:none so this is going to remove
the float keep them display block and
let's come back to our page refresh we
now have something that's resembling a
little bit more of a navigation now i'm
going to add some things to these links
here and we're going to give each of
these a width and and we give it some
padding and a hover State and so I want
to style these links I'm just going to
say nav ul and then a so the first
anchor or the anchors in nav ul I'm
going to be set it to display block and
we're also going to have these
float:left and we're going to give these
width of let's say 150 pixels and let's
see how that looks like right now under
this page okay a little bit better
we'll give them padding of maybe 20
pixels left and right 10 pixels 10
pixels top bottom 20 pixels left and
right and so I'm used to typing in sass
so I keep on wanting to do some nested
nested classes here and stuff type nav
UL a:hover
and on the hover state we're just going
to change the background to be
little bit darker okay so now every
single link we hover over is going to be
darker just like that alright so the
menu isn't quite finished yet however we
like to eat these videos nice and short
that way you can watch them in small
chunks and keep track of it so we're
going to pick up this in the next video
exactly where we left off and we're
going to make this into a working drop
down menu in the very next video and
keep in mind we're going slow with these
because we want to make sure you you
know we illustrate every single point so
you understand how they're working so as
always if you have any questions please
hit us up on Twitter or Facebook you
know just let us know what you're
thinking
as always this is Scott with level of
Tut's and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
