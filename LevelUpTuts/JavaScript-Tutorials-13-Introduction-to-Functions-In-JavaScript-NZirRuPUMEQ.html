level of Tut's and today we're gonna be
introducing functions and functions are
an important part of programming in
general and they're important part of
JavaScript so what we're gonna do is
just give a real basic understanding of
what a function is and how you can use
it and like I've been saying this course
is really for people who have not a ton
of experience or no experience with this
type of thing so if you've heard of a
function or if you know how they work
then this might be a little bit basic
but what we're going to do is basically
declare a function and then we're going
to run it and what is a function well a
function is really just like a block of
code that's contained inside of a name
essentially which would be the functions
name and that that black of code can run
anytime you call that function so you
can execute this just by calling the
name of the function maybe you have a
like a link that you click on and then
that runs the function or something so
what we're going to be doing in this
first example is having a function that
just alerts something so let's start
this off by typing function and you'll
notice it's color-coordinating because
we have our hinting on and everything
and then we have a space and then the
name of your function now keep in mind
that these are normally in camel case so
the first letter is going to be
lowercase and our the first letter of
the first word is going to be lowercase
and the first letter of the second word
would be uppercase so we can just call
this first func and then what you do is
parentheses right here and then after
your parentheses we will have two
brackets and in between these two
brackets is where our codes going to go
now in this function we're just gonna a
council log something console.log do you
remember we've been doing council logs
and it takes a string so we can just say
yo yo
and then we'll end that off with a
semicolon here so now let's check out
our site and if we refresh the page but
one thing you should notice is that
nothing's been logged to our council we
don't see yo-yo here and and why is that
well that's because in a function
nothing that's every all the code that's
in the function itself is not actually
executed until you tell this function to
run so now how do we tell this function
to run well to do that you just simply
have to call it by its name so we can
say first func and then parenthesis and
then a semicolon and we say that I'm
gonna leave a comment here runs first
func function okay and then this code up
here this is what defines our function
so defines first func function cool so
nice and easy no you should expect that
when we refresh
ed council logs yo-yo now what happens
if we run first a function again if we
paste this first func code a second time
it's now going to run it twice so what
functions do is it allows to have a code
that needs to be executed multiple times
it allows that code to be defined once
right
and then the Dakotan li defined once but
here we have a printing yo-yo and we
could keep on having that print yo-yo if
we keep calling this function so that's
awesome because now we don't have to
write this Council log every single time
of course this is just a really basic
example typically when you're writing
functions they're gonna do something
useful and output some information for
you so what's something to be aware of
with functions well we have been
defining variables if
remember and so let's do this we can say
far name is equal to Scott just like
that now if we count the log I'm gonna
get rid of this first function well
we'll leave it here actually if we count
the log name as you'd expect it's gonna
count to log Scott well check this out
if we come into our function and we say
name is equal to bill and we're still
running our function so keep in mind
this code is getting executed if we save
this refresh here this is going to
change the name to Bill
so that's because we're referencing this
variable inside of our function but in
JavaScript because you have access to
these variables anywhere this variable
is actually being updated within the
function even though we defined it
outside we ran this console logging and
it updated it but what happens if we put
the word var in front of name now what
happens if we refresh this now this has
it with Scott so what is this doing
exactly this is making this name here a
private variable so this variable name
is only accessible within this function
this variable is no longer modifying the
same variable up here but it's modifying
one within the function
so we counts a log we could do name in
function and we can have a space now in
JavaScript you can do a plus here and
that's going to add in this
this variable so we can say name and
function and it's going to output bill
so the name in function is Bill but then
we're outputting name outside of the
function and it's still Scot
so that's something to keep in mind when
you're writing these functions that if
you define the variable again within the
function it becomes a private variable
if you don't it's going to modify the
original variable itself okay so in the
next video we're going to talk about
accepting arguments within functions and
what an argument is and then we're going
to talk about returning and things like
that so keep watching in the next video
we're gonna go over more stuff with
functions
they're extremely useful and you'll be
using them pretty much all the time so
as always this is Scott with the level
of Tut's if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment the
video hits up at Twitter I level up
Tut's let us know what you're thinking
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
