up tutorials and in the last video we
created our menu and in this video we're
gonna show you how you can add it to our
page as a block and it's gonna function
the same way as any other block but
there's a lot of extra little options
that come with the menu block
so let's look going on that right now so
we now have our new menu created let's
head to structure analyst head to block
layout now that we're in block layouts
what we want to be looking for is our
sidebar navigation chances are you'll
find it under none and what we want to
be looking for is our sidebar navigation
now you'll see main navigation
breadcrumbs primary admin actions but
what we're not going to be seeing
necessarily is that menu that we just
created so we could come here to our
blocks and you might look for our side
navigation and we could look all over
but you're not going to find it that's
because we need to place the block first
so to place the block let's come to
secondary menu here so to figure out
where we want to place this you'll see
all these different block regions we
have the content the breadcrumb feature
top and once we have sidebar first this
is most likely where we'll want to place
this however if we scroll to the top
where you could say demonstrate block
regions it's going to show us our page
and it's going to show us where exactly
all of the regions are so for instance
we want sidebar first so let's go ahead
and put this in sidebar first let's head
back here and let's scroll down to
sidebar first and let's click place
block now let's go ahead here and let's
come down and well we could look for it
and here it is or you could type in side
nav here and have it filter for you so
now that we have this filter we can
click place block this is going to give
us our block screen which we may have
seen before now the menu levels is
interesting because in this drop-down we
have access to start at an initial menu
level for instance if you wanted to
start at the child level
you could set this to be 2 and then we
won't ever see that initial link and we
would only see the child link if we set
this to 1 it's only going to be showing
it's going to be showing the parent and
child likewise we have this drop down
this is how many levels do you want to
display you could have a menu that is
maybe 6 levels deep of just a different
nesting of different levels of content
right and you don't necessarily want all
6 of those to show up in your menu that
would look outrageous and and you really
maybe once you get into that page you
have another menu that shows the next
couple of layers deep well this is where
you change that setting right now it's
set to unlimited but for this example
since even though we only have 2 layers
I'm going to set it to 2 because that's
all I wanted to display now we want this
to be able to be seen on non restricted
content types and unrestricted pages and
by non restricted rolls basically we
want this to be seen by everyone on
every page if you want to restrict what
types of content it is or what pages in
particular or even what roles you can
head back to the conditionally display
blocks video to have a more
understanding about the visibility for
blocks you can see we can even have it
to display the title or not display the
title I'm going to have this side nav
title actually be something different so
the back end name of this is going to be
side nav but let's actually have this
displayed as related posts ok and let's
click save block now we have our related
posts let's head it back to the front
end of our site and you can see we have
related posts and we have this little
caret to let us know that first post is
a child of recent post if we click this
it's gonna take you to that individual
post you'll notice that the current link
that we're on is actually changed to
black now this is going to depend
greatly on what theme you're using this
is the built-in Bartik theme I'm going
to show you how you can install other
themes on your Drupal 8 site in future
videos here and in advance tutorials I'm
going to show you how you can even
create your own theme however that's for
another time
so we've now created a menu we've added
it to our blocks but maybe I'm not happy
with its placement I want this to be at
the top so let's head back to our block
layout
let's grab related posts and let's drag
it all the way to the top here so now
it's going to be above tools and above
search we can click save blocks head
back to our page and when we refresh
you'll see related posts is at the top
of the page perfect this is just how we
want it and if we ever need to get back
in here we can click the edit button
here configure block configure menu item
so we now have a new menu we have a new
menu block and we have it in our sidebar
