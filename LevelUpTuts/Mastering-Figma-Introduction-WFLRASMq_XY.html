love-love tutorials and in this series
I'm going to be talking about figma now
figma is my new favorite design
application it has a ton of amazing
features going for it like one it's
cross-platform so it works on Windows
Mac and Linux 2 it offers really amazing
a Google Doc like collaboration features
and three it's constantly updating and
it has an extremely modern interface so
it's a really really cool tool and
something that I've been using every
single day since I picked it up so over
the course of this series I'm going to
be teaching you the general interface
where to find things and then I'm going
to be getting into some more practical
tools things you can use within figma to
just help your designs along and we're
going to be talking about a lot of
figmas core functionality such as the
collaboration tools and then we're gonna
be getting into a lot of the team
features like sharing collaboration
commenting team library shared
components that sort of stuff
so keep watching as we learn one of the
newest most exciting design platforms
out there if you want to continue the
series after exploring figma through
these first few videos here you want to
head to level up tutorials comm and
become a pro where you get access to all
of the content as well as a new series
every single month or if you hate
subscriptions you can just buy the
