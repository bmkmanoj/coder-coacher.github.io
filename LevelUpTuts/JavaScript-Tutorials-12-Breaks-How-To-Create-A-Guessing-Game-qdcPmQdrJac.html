up tuts and today we're going to write a
short guessing game and it's going to be
using some new stuff but it's mostly to
illustrate breaks and breaking out of a
loop and in the last video we talked
about while loops and you can stuck
infinitely in a loop or something like
that but what if you want to exit the
loop when you want to exit the loop and
that is it you can do that using a this
break a break is really just a statement
that exits the given loop that you're in
so let's see this in action and the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to write I'm gonna have a council
log that says actually we're going to
make this an alert and an alert pops up
on the screen and it's going to say you
have ten guesses guess one through ten
so it's going to ask you to guess a
number one through ten and now if we
just run this in the browser this little
window pops up that says you have ten
guesses guess 1 1 to 10 ok cool now what
we need to do is we need to ask somebody
for guess but we also want to have a
loop going right so we're going to start
our for loop and because they have 10
guesses we're going to say I is equal to
0 just like that and then while I is
less than 10 there we go and then I plus
plus now to confirm that this is looping
ten times we can say Council log we can
just have it log I and let's run this
and then it goes 1 through 9 of course
if we wanted to see 1 through 10 we
could add 1 to I and now it's giving us
1 through 10 cool
so we're not going to introduce any
random numbers in here or anything like
that so I'm actually just going to set
the number the answer of our answer is
equal to three okay and our users don't
know this because it's in the code of
course if they looked in the code they
could see this and of course this game
becomes invalid after you play once
because it's always three
but that's something we'll fix in the
future right now we just want to get in
asking for input checking and then
breaking out of this loop if that number
is equal to three so what we want to do
in the loop is we want to ask for their
number what number they're going to
guess so
we can say let's actually declare a
variable up top here and we can declare
a variable without setting it to
anything just by simply say their guess
and then semicolon now with 3 s's though
just like that now we can say guess is
equal to and then we're going to use
this function prompt and we haven't seen
this function before but it's sort of
like alert where it's going to basically
open up a dialog box and it's going to
have a statement in it and it's going to
say what's quote what issue in here
what's your guess and if you notice when
I use this single quote it got mad
because I was using single quotes to
wrap this string so if you change your
outside single quotes double quotes you
can then use a single quote within your
text and it's no problem so what's your
guess and right now if we were to just
run this app it's going to ask me my
guess ten times and uh and it's not
going to do anything right but now we
can write an if statement that says if
answer is equal to guess then do
something
so if answer is equal to guess then we
can say break but only after we alert
you guessed correctly okay cool so now
we are going to check right we're going
to check to see if the guess is equal to
the answer so if you're guessing three
it's going to be equal then it's going
to alert you guys correctly and then
it's going to hit this break and then
what's this break going to do it's going
to exit immediately out of this loop if
we didn't have this break here even if
you guessed correctly it would still ask
you for your guess again uh you know
however many more times until you get to
ten now of course we want to let them
know if they guessed incorrectly so we
can go ahead in here and we can say else
and we can say alert this is going to be
annoying program with all these pop-up
boxes but like I said we can always make
it better so alert and it's going to
alert sorry try again now we can even
have this prompt this to try again so
let's go ahead and move this guess this
initial guess we can move that directly
right here so now when our program first
runs it's going to ask us what's our
guest even be our guests even before
starting the loop now it's going to
start the loop it's going to check to
see if our initial guess was guessed
correctly and if it was it's going to
exit the program otherwise we're going
to want it to prompt us again and say
sorry try again so we can say guess is
Oh equal to prompt and then in quotes
please try again okay
and so this application should be
working correctly and if all else fails
it's going to go through ten times and
we're going to somehow guess a number
one through ten wrong ten times so let's
try it out in our browser now and now if
we refresh our page you have ten guesses
guess one through ten so what's your
guess I mean I guess four please try
again seven please try again one please
try again eight please try again it's
going to keep doing this until we guess
the correct number you guessed correctly
okay and notice how it stops asking me
now if we were doing this in a while
loop this could run forever until they
guess the right until they guess the
right number however this is only going
to run ten times so so we now have our
first bit of luck functional programming
right so this is small bit of code here
well as you create a little miniature
guessing game and you can probably start
thinking of ways in your brain to try to
make it better so my challenge to you is
to take this code and using stuff that
we know and just try to make it better
in subtle ways and just see what you can
come up with it might completely fail
and blow up but that's okay because
that's the best part about learning
programming is you can just keep trying
things um I think it was um I think it
was Remy sharp but somebody was having a
they had a quote that said he was
watching his son try to jam shaped
blocks into the shape holes and he just
jammed them in until they fit and that's
sort of how it was approach to
programming is and I thought that was
excellent because you really just you
try things until they work and then you
learn from that experience and get
better so try it out see what you can
come up with
as always loop questions or comments in
the video below hit us up at Twitter or
Facebook or anything if you have any
questions or comments we'd love to hear
from you once again this is Scott to
Lenski with level up tons
