up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be starting to really create
the folder and file structure of our
project now we're not going to be
writing any code yes yet but I'm going
to be sort of talking about the
importance of file structure and
different ways that you can lay out your
project to find what best suits you so
let's get into that right now now one of
my favorite things about meteor has
always been just its extreme flexibility
and things like file structure and
things like that it just really lets you
do everything the way you want to do it
and the best part is you don't even
necessarily have to define things and
define paths and things like that and
meteor will just sort of handle it in
its build process allowing you to really
be flexible and change your approach
when needed so to get started in our
project structure I'm going to first
create some folders inside of our main
folder here I'm just going to go ahead
and select a new folder and the folder
I'm going to add is client now it's cool
about the client folder if you recall in
any meteor J's file that's initially
created we have the if meteor is client
and then we have the if meteor is server
well you can just sort of forget about
those for right now I mean don't
necessarily forget about them but
anything that you have inside of your
client folder with the name client for
instance let's create a file let's just
name this index jeaious we're going to
change all this stuff around a bunch um
and let's copy everything out of here if
our media is client and just straight up
delete that head over to our index paste
it in here I'm going to tab it back a
little bit there we go okay so here we
have this file we never actually said if
meteor is client but it's inside of our
client folder now if we head back to our
website you'll notice hey this thing
still works it's not broken if we
inspect our page there's no anything
except for maybe a routing error just
because
don't have any routes set up yet but
other than that it's totally fine with
that meteor sees that it's in the client
folder and it knows that this is part of
the client-side code now in addition we
can also have a new folder and we can
name this one server and just likewise
we could put all of our server events
inside of the server folder as well now
I'm going to get started with some sort
of just basic groundworks files even if
we don't have any code that we're going
to be using for instance inside of our
server I'm going to make a file that I
like to have called emit the J s now an
it J s is going to contain some code
that I just pasted in here and now this
is meteor dot start up and then it's
just simply a function this allows you
to run any code on your server when
meteor starts up I like to have this
file and pretty much any project I'm
starting just in case I need it for
whenever I need it
it exists now in addition I want to
create a publish file in here if you
recall at the end of the basic series we
wanted to publish the collections that
we actually use so to do that I'm just
going to have publish
J s now this will be populated with our
published code once we need that but for
now it's just nice to have it and
normally I would also have a methods J s
in here but for this example I'm
actually going to put our collections
methods inside of a collection folder
now you don't have to do this you can
keep all that stuff in your server
folder but this is just a way that I
like to set up my project especially if
I'm using simple schema and collections
too now let's make a new folder and it's
going to be named collections okay
now once we make our collections we'll
be putting that in its own file here and
I like to name those files the same name
as whatever the collection is for
instance we're going to have a
collection named recipes so I would have
a file recipes J s now I'm not going to
do that in this video when we start to
outline how we can create our
collections with simple schema in the
next video we'll get into that then okay
next we have inside of our client folder
we just made this index J s and that's
okay I mean you can also one thing I
also like to do is frequently have an
init that is in here with the same sort
of on startup code now this is where
people's ideas about how to lay your
project may differ for one I like to
sort of have several different folders
in here one of which is going to be a
layouts folder now layouts will contain
not only the HTML that have to do with
our layouts but also the JavaScript
files will be going in here as well and
the files will be named obviously the
same as what the layout is since we're
going to be using a router we're also
going to be using blaze layouts which
allows you to define a specific layout
file per your routes and it allows you
to even have some additional yield
options too of which we may or may not
get into now right now we're going to
add another folder and this is just
going to be partials now in partials I
like to typically have things like my
header and my footer items that are
essentially going to be used throughout
the site that way you can easily drop
them into your layouts now in addition
I'm going to have folders per feature
this is sort of a feature folder
organization technique has become
popular really where you keep each
feature or component together for
instance since we're doing a recipe up I
want to keep all recipe related
templates and all JavaScript
referencing those templates inside of a
folder called recipes so this is just
the way I like to layout my client
folder you might find yourself at fine
doing something complete
different but what I recommend doing is
checking out some large meteor projects
and github seeing how their projects are
structured seeing how that what that
means for you personally and how you
like to structure your projects and
really just what makes the most sense as
long as you have your client folder in
here all of this code is going to work
without the if is client part of your
code now in addition I also like to
rename this intermediate HTML file I
like to rename this file at the very
base just to be index.html it lets me
know that this is sort of the root file
for the whole project in addition I like
to rename this to Styles and in this
case it's dot sty L because we're using
a stylus but these are just sort of
conventions that I've grown used to from
building websites for a long time and
really I'm just you sorta used to
looking for those things well so this is
the basic project structure for our
project in the next lesson we're going
to start going over collections to and
how you can build a schema using a
simple schema and that schema is going
to be used to generate a form using Auto
form now it all works very nicely
together
in a way that just takes a lot of the
guesswork out of it so I can't wait to
go over all that stuff in the next few
videos as always this is Scoville level
of tutorials if you have any questions
or comments leave a comment the video or
hit me up at Twitter or Facebook i level
of tutorials I'd love to hear from you
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
