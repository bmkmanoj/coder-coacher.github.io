our interface cleaned up just a little
bit by hiding the important stuff and
showing you when we need to show it in
this video I'm going to show you how we
can extend our queries because right now
we are storing all of our query schema
definitions inside of a single type
query that existence out of our register
api's so one thing I want to do is first
well let's copy this entire type query
and let's paste it into user dot graph
QL and then we can go ahead and delete
these first two and just leave our user
type user I can go ahead and save this
and then I can come in here to our test
schema and delete the user from this now
at this point we should be getting an
error now you'll see that our site
should be down yep and this error is
going to let us know that type query was
defined more than once so if you try to
do one of the challenges that I gave you
in one of the other videos you would
have run across into this issue already
now this brings up an important point
types such as type query or even type
user or even a type mutation all have to
be unique and right now we've pretty
much kept them all unique even though we
were planning on having more mutations
and we're planning on having more
queries we only have one type definition
so far for each of those so how do we
actually make it so we can have more
than one well we simply need to extend a
defined query so I have my extended type
query and now let's go ahead I need to
make a modification for this file for
meteors bundle to understand and we
should have that air go right away so
check back refresh hey everything's all
good and likewise we can do the same
thing with our resolutions graph QL now
the only difference here is that well we
have this high query we have it defined
in
this resolver that sort of just taking
up space at this point we're not using
it in fact I think I removed any
anything left over from that high query
at all if I didn't we're gonna know in a
second here but let's go ahead and clean
this up significantly so I'm gonna just
one delete test resolvers because we
flat out we don't need tests resolvers
I'm gonna delete it from the merge I'm
going to delete the constant variable
name to test resolvers and I'm also
going to delete to test schema but not
before copying and copying this entire
type query okay so let's delete this and
I'm gonna hold off on saving this file
I'm gonna delete to test schema from
here as well I'm gonna hold off on
saving this file just so it marks the
change in these files as well now you'll
notice that I'm going to leave type
query as type query instead of extend
save it this resolutions file then let's
save our register API file and let's
head to our app which we should see no
errors nothing about it being defined
more than once that's because we now
only have to query schema definitions
one and resolutions type query and one
in users extend type query you'll notice
a little bit something if you had a
quick eyes you would notice that
resolution schema comes before user
schema and our type deaths let's see
what happens if we change that order and
we can paste this in here and just
reverse that order let's check our
terminal because I think we should be
seeing an error but I might not be
correct on that one and it looks like it
actually doesn't matter if you know
otherwise than this let me know I was
under the impression that if you
extended something before it was defined
graphic you'll throw an error doesn't
look like it's throwing an error though
because we're loading up user schema
which extends it first I'm gonna move
these back to with the way they were
just so we can have the back to the way
they were so if you can tell me
otherwise I was expecting the extend to
have to be defined after the original
type query but it looks like it works
either way
again if I'm totally wrong on that
statement please let me know in the
description of this video but as you can
see here we are now extending our types
and if we needed to ever have a user
mutation we would want to extend type
mutation the extend keyword is most
common in stuff like queries and
mutations I can't think of a use case
for extending your actual schema but you
can let me know if there was one I know
there's a use case for defining a new
schema that's an extended version of a
another one but just simply extending
type user I'm not quite sure what the
use case is there but again if you have
anything let me know
okay so this video basically we cleaned
up our register api's file we now only
have our to type deaths we only have our
two resolvers we have none of our actual
queries schemas or resolvers defined in
this file anymore we're importing them
all so that cleans things up enough for
us to move on and what we're gonna do
when we move on is start to have a
custom resolver for a field in our user
schema here this is gonna be one of the
cooler things in graph QL and definitely
something you're going to use all the
time so as always this is Scott with
