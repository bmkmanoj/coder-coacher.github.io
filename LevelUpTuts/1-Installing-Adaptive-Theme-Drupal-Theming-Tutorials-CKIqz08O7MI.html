up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna go ahead and download adaptive
theme and keep going by installing the
adaptive base theme into our project
this is gonna be a quick one so let's
get going right now so to get started
we're going to want to go ahead and
download adaptive theme from drupal.org
so I'm not going to include this link in
the description of the video you can
grab it from there or you can head to
drupal.org slash project slash adaptive
theme so from here I'm going to scroll
down and I'm just gonna grab the latest
in this tar.gz and I'm gonna unzip it
here now to install this theme all you
simply have to do is head over to your
sites and then all and then themes
folder now we can just go ahead and drop
this adaptive theme into our site okay
now let's head to our Drupal site and
with the default navigation let's go to
appearance and then from appearance we
can go ahead and select one of these
disabled themes here now as you can see
there's three themes we're going to go
over the admin theme another video the
at core theme the adaptive core theme
you can see is the framework that drives
the responsive layout system so
basically it says you don't need to
enable this theme to use it because
you're going to be developing on a sub
theme now it's great about adaptive
theme is that it comes with a sub theme
ready to go for you so it says to copy
this sub theme to get started so if you
have you for you something like Omega
where you had some sort of a tool that
was generating a sub theme this is
really nice because you can just go
ahead and copy this theme to get started
so just like that we have this theme
installed if you want to take a look at
what comes with just the blank something
what we can do is go ahead and enable
and let's go ahead and click set the
default on the 80 sub theme now let's
head over to the front end of our
project I'm just going to open this up
in a new tab and as you can see it's
completely blank so that really allows
for total customization and it doesn't
necessarily want to get in the way with
anything
cool so we now have adaptive theme
installed and we're ready to get going
in the next video we're gonna show you
how you can create your sub theme and
then we're going to make some style
tweaks and then we're gonna start
exploring a little bit of what comes
with adaptive theme and why you would be
interested in using it as always this is
Scott with level of tutorials if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment a video where to submit to order
or Facebook at level up tutorials
we'd love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
