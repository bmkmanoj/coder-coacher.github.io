today we're gonna level up our
expression engine two skills
this is gonna be expression engine to
tutorial number one and what we're gonna
do today is go to go through the
download and installation process for
expression engine what I will assume
that you have already done is purchase
expression engine you have FTP client
and have created a database and tied a
user to that if you have not done that
stuff go ahead and pause and come back
and if you have questions about that go
ahead and leave questions in the
comments and we'll answer those all
right so to start off what we're going
to do is jump over to expression engines
website and download expression engine
too so I am already logged in if you're
not go ahead and put in your login
credentials if you have not already
purchased expression engine or this is
your first time using it or you're about
to use it you can go ahead and click the
Buy Now button and walk through the
purchase process you just say purchase
new license you have three options here
between the commercial non-commercial
and freelancer if this is your first go
at expression engine you're you're
definitely gonna want to look at the $99
option but just note that you can only
have one of these per account there's no
limitation on other accounts for you
know many other different type of
license that you have but again I am
already logged in and I already have my
version of expression engine purchase so
I'm just gonna go ahead and download it
by going to my downloads and here is one
something's go ahead and download that
scroll down I will accept the Terms and
I'm gonna also be sure to I'm gonna be
sure to select 2x as opposed to 1x if
you for some reason are stuck with
having to use 1x if you have a client
that is already on that you do have the
option to still download one but we're
not going to do that we're going to go
ahead and go use 2 and the latest
version of 2 as of this recording is the
expression engine 2 point 4.0 so I'd now
have it downloaded
I'm gonna go ahead and unzip that and
now that it's unzipped let's go ahead
and look at the contents of that
directory I'm go ahead and hide that
window back there so inside of this
window or side of that directory we have
just a couple files really and there's
the admin dot PHP images index.php
system and themes it's the system in
themes directories that have lots and
lots of stuff in there so let's go ahead
and start this upload because it's going
to take a little while so I'm going to
go into my file transfer program and the
one that I'm using today is transmitted
but obviously there's other ones out
there as well and I'm just going to
upload this to my server where I want my
site to live so I'm gonna go ahead and
just drag all of them over and that's
going to start the upload process once
the files have completed uploading there
are a couple files that we're gonna have
to change the file permissions on and so
I'm gonna go ahead and let these upload
I'm gonna pause the video and when
they're done we'll come back and I'll
show you which ones we need to change
file permissions and then we'll complete
the upload properly installation process
ok the files are finally uploaded so now
let's go ahead and do the next step here
and as I was alluding to earlier the
next step is changing the file
permissions and a couple select items so
the first two that we're gonna change
are the config dot PHP and the database
dot PHP file and those live within the
system expression engine config
directory and we should see database
sitting here and we should see config so
I'm gonna go ahead and hit command-i and
change these two both of those to 666
read and write for everybody okay and
then there's a couple other directories
that
should have seven seven seven and one of
those still lives within that system
expression engine directory and it's the
cache folder so I'm gonna go ahead and
put that one on seven seven seven
read/write/execute for everyone and then
there are a couple more and there's
backup at the root inside of the images
directory and these are mostly for for
the system if you know for example
there's this one here the member photos
if you allow members to your site to
upload pictures by default I think they
want to go into that directory and in
order for the for-expression engine to
be able to do that it needs to have 777
so we're gonna go ahead and do this on
these here that's one two three four
five six or so and they also need seven
seven seven alright those are the
recommended file permissions for
expression engine all right so now we're
gonna do we're gonna go back over to my
server here and hopefully refresh this
page this is you know the Apache page
that you get if you don't have anything
loaded up here we go so right now it
says there config file does not appear
to be and that's totally correct so we
haven't actually set it up yet
during the installation process
expression engine or write to that file
so what we need to do to go ahead and
install is go to admin dot PHP and now
we're gonna be walked through the
expression engine installation wizard it
does a check we passed all that we're
gonna just go ahead and agree the
license and Terms and move on and start
filling out these fields now earlier in
the bridge at the very beginning of this
video I talked about on the fact that
you're gonna need to have a database and
and a user for that database set up
already so hopefully you've done that
it's going to go ahead and enter in some
my information here
all right so hopefully I got that all
right I don't know why I set those
passwords so tricky and I'm gonna go
ahead now and create the admin account
for this once you if you have multiple
admins that's okay you're just sort of
setting up the first user so that you
can get in there and lock it in so I
want my username to be admin password
twice it auto-filled this from above
like it says screening the difference
between a username and the screen name
is the screen name what's gonna peer
when you actually post a title post an
entry if you if you choose to display
that so I'm gonna put my name here and
the name of our sites gonna be level up
suppression engine oops
for now anyway we'll go through how to
change it later
choosing your theme by default
expression engine comes with one theme
that's sort of a record label of sorts
we're gonna go ahead and leave it empty
for now we're gonna develop our own
theme optional modules expression gin
comes with the set core of modules and
then they throw in some that by default
aren't turned on we're gonna leave them
leave it as is for now but just note
that later what we'll probably do is
come back and check later install the
pages module but we'll just leave it off
for now
you can set your own time zone and
install all right so we have installed
successfully before expression engine
lets you move on what you need to do is
delete the installer directory and
that's sitting inside of system
installer we just go ahead and command
delete that
all right and so now on one tab I'm
gonna go ahead and open up our website
which should be totally blank yep
that's the success believe it or not and
now we're gonna also go into the control
panel and login so we're logging in with
those credentials that you just created
and there we go
I'll go ahead and save that this is
where we're ending today we have now
successfully installed expression engine
and we have now landed on the control
panel
in the next tutorial we're gonna can we
are going to review the control panel in
detail please subscribe to our level up
tuts we're covering a wide variety of
sort of web technologies for front-end
developers and and more so please
subscribe if you have any questions feel
free to leave them in the comments
thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
