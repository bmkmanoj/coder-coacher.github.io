tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
show you how to install packages into
atom to extend its functionality outside
of what's just included right out of the
box so say going on that right now so if
you're used to many other modern text
editors you'll know that one of the best
parts about using a modern text editor
is the ability to extend it with
whatever sort of plugins the community
has created now atom is no different in
that regard and atoms package management
system that comes built in is very nice
what we can do is come to atom and then
preferences
now within preferences we just need to
head to packages
what we can do here is we can filter
through our our installed packages and
you can see just how many packages come
with Adam out of the box now most of
these are Adam core packages you can see
they all have this Adam logo you can see
about useful information about your Adam
installation archive view auto complete
Adam API auto complete CSS now these are
great and what's awesome about Adam is
that it actually gives you the ability
to disable any of these plugins think
about we have about Adam right here
gives us information about our Adam
installation if we were to disable this
plugin
we were to come to about Adam you teach
a totally blank page I mean this feature
just flat-out doesn't exist now so you
really have the ability to customize
your Adam install even down through the
core packages themselves now I wouldn't
necessarily go crazy turning off a lot
of these packages but if there's
something specifically like that you
weren't using ever and you don't really
think that you'll ever need to use them
then go ahead and turn them off I mean
they there's no reason for them to be on
however if you want to extend Adam and
install some new plugins now we have
this install button right down here
which we've used before for our themes
and color schemes now let's go ahead and
grab a nice new package for our
installation now this package is going
to be we're just going to search for a
file icon and I'll hit enter to start
searching and you can see that there's a
lot of packages now but what I'm looking
for actually isn't showing up here let's
try researching this time for file -
icons that's a little knowing that when
I search for file icon it didn't show up
however if you do search for file -
icons you can see that there is an
extension right here now we can click
install
and this is going to install us a brand
new file icon package
now you can see upon immediately
finishing the install we now have some
icons over here in the left-hand side of
our screen which is where our project is
now the reason I chose this package is
because honestly it's one I feel like
you can't live without now that may be a
little extreme but just how much nicer
is it to have an html5 logo over here by
your html5 files and a css3 logo by your
CSS files in addition of their support
for a ton of different file icons if you
wanted to go ahead and click on this you
can see that there are icons for all
sorts of files anything from gulp to
sass stylus JavaScript just an absolute
ton of icons here and now it's great as
you could totally customize them
yourself with CSS if you'd like even as
you can see it even gives you the
classes that you can use to customize
your file icon with the overrides in CSS
now one feature I really really like
about Adam is this this package added
416 milliseconds to startup time so it
really allows you to see the full weight
of what you're adding for instance if
you add a ton of different packages and
your add-on this feeling sluggish it
might be time to add into your packages
and see which ones are your heaviest and
which ones you really need the most most
applications that are extended through
plugins will never really tell you what
that weight of those plugins are but
luckily for us Adam lets us know just
how much time each of these things is
adding to our startup
cool so we've now added a package we've
disabled a package and I won't go as far
as uninstalling this because I want to
keep this package but when you do you
can just click uninstall and it's gone
from your machine from whenever this is
package management and Adam it's awesome
it's easy it has a great interface and
it's really easy to find new packages as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments of a comment this video hit me
up at Twitter or Facebook if you want to
help support level up tutorials consider
signing up for level up pro and gain
