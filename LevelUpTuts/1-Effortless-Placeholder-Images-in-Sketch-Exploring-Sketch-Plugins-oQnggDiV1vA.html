love tutorials and today we're gonna be
talking about a pretty cool sketch
plugin called day player now day player
allows you to create as it says
placeholder images and the best part
about day player how entirely simple it
is to eat these placeholder images into
your sketch document and then you can
even have a little bit of customization
based on which exactly which service you
want to be using for your placeholder
images and if you scroll down you'll see
we have some options
it could be using place hold dot it it
could be using so as you can see what
these are just standard photos with the
dimensions of the photo on them Laurin
pixel just sort of just automatically
generated content that can give you all
sorts of stuff from sports and any sort
of thing that you want it to have then
we have something like Phil Murray place
cage place cages images of Nicolas Cage
based on the dimensions that you want
play skin which is the pictures of cats
and then unsplash it which is just
placeholder images from unsplash okay so
we have all these options and as you can
see this is the interface it looks
pretty simple let's go ahead and install
this plug-in and check it out now I'm
gonna install the same way that we
install most of our plugins using sketch
toolbox in with you just type day and as
you can see it's one of the first ones
well the only one to come up so we can
click install now it's gonna download
and install day player into our site
okay so we now have day player installed
in the sketch now I can open up sketch
and I open up a recent file this is
nothing crazy or anything here but
basically if we're having a site in
let's say it was a profile page and you
had their name and you wanted to have a
photo of them and this particular
example I just have nick cage here
because I'm gonna use the place cage but
and in general you just have a photo and
in this case we're just using this gray
box
well this gray box isn't helping the
design right it's not really really
helping the design at all it's just sort
of there it doesn't really give you the
feeling of having a
photo in there so this box is 103 by 103
X let's make it 100 by 100 that way it's
nice and even here so now let's say I
want to have an image of Nick Cage well
let's say I want it to be in this canvas
so I can go ahead and select this canvas
in particular then I can come over to
plugins then day player and now let's
select place cage it's gonna ask you
what type of Nicolas Cage e-1 crazy calm
or grey I think the obvious choice here
is crazy and put a hundred for width and
hunted for height and let's say okay so
it's grabbing us place cage it's a
hundred by hundred and so this
particular example this has a 72 by 72
size to it I'm not sure if that's the
thing place cage specific but either way
we can simply just boost this up by
saying 100 by 100 and it doesn't really
look like it's getting digitally
distorted at all so let's go ahead and
delete this rectangle and we now have
this photo that's clearly been a cropped
because as this red border
so let's say we're not happy with this
image right this came back it's Nick
Cage he's looking crazy but these red
lines are just sort of distracting let's
try a different image service come in
here and say plugins add a player and
let's try it lorem pixel because Lauren
pixel gives you a bunch of options so as
you can see here we have a drop-down and
you can really choose your category from
sports to nature to people fashion food
go ahead and pick sports here and then
select 100 by 100 click OK and now let's
get to the rid of this Nick Cage photo
and now we have this new photo of this
sort of sports image and it's looking
nice it's a hundred by hundred and that
one came in at just fine we can try out
so many others I was having some issues
with place kitten crashing sketch so let
me know if you see anything like that as
you can see I just tried to import
something without selecting the art
board which of course you need to do
first so you select your art board
plug-ins day player
let's try Phil Murray which is some Bill
Murray images where we can get calm or
gray let's continue to get calm here
sooo 105 100k and now get this nice Bill
Murray image that again we can drop into
our profile like so now let's say we
wanted to make some sort of like
circular mask or something what we can
do is we can simply just create a new
oval and I'm gonna have it placed up at
the top of this like so and now we're
going to say use s mask and now if I'm
using this is mask I'm just gonna drag
it below and let's sort of adjust this
down a little bit I guess at the top of
the sides right there so do the best we
can do there we go
group these all together comanche and we
now have this certain nice profile image
to go along with application that we're
making and we didn't have to go grab
that content from anywhere it was just
like we wanted it it was super easy to
get with just a one plugin we never even
had to leave sketch and so we just only
saw this with 100 by 100 for a fun I'm
just gonna go ahead and throw one from
unsplash it and the color mode let's go
normal unless asked for 500 by 500 just
to get something a little bit bigger as
you can see we have this large image now
we could throw it back here change up
the opacity or something and then let's
grab a white rectangle here throw it
behind all this
- Rashaad Oh on there and we have to
start - a nice little profile here so
like we've shown you a player is really
great for bringing in stuff really
quickly so there's a lot of other really
great sketch plugins that we're going to
cover in the next few videos showing you
all sorts of things from content
generation to creating very useful UI
elements so keep watching we're gonna
dive into a lot of new sketch plugins as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video here
does have a twitter at level up to
torrents we love to hear from you thanks
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
