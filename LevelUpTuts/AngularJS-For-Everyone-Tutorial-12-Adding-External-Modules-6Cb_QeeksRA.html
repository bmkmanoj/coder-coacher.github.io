tutorials and today we're gonna be
covering how to install a module in
angular so in this case we're gonna be
installing ng animate which is a module
written by the angular team you'll
notice there's several of these modules
such as NG route for routing and Angie
touch and things like that
then her modules written by the angular
team however they're not actually
included into the core code so if we
were to just try to throw ng animate
into our project as is now it's going to
tell us that I can't find it because
simply because the files don't exist in
our project so this is something that
confuses a lot of first-time users they
see ng animate in the docs it says it's
a module but at the top it never says
anything about installing it until you
scroll down or end up googling it even
to find out that you need to add this
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna grab
the CDN version off of Google like so
it's just this version right here you
can go ahead and copy this and just add
it to your page with the script tag you
can also just grab the file from any one
of these places and download it onto
your computer and let's go ahead and
come to my HTML I'm gonna come to index
and let's find where we added our other
script so up the top here we had our our
script tag script and the source is
going to be equal to and then this file
here now here's something important to
notice we have this X Y Z so if we were
to search for this file it's going to
tell us that it can't find it it's
saying basically it's not on the server
and that's just because we have this x
y&amp;amp;z now if we were to replace this with
the version number for instance we're
using 1 3 1 5 we can go ahead and turn
now and as you can see it's going to
find this no problem so here we do have
our file that is ng animate and it's the
same version of angular that we're using
that's what you'll want to use is the
same version so now in our code let's
paste this in here
1.3 0.15 and let's reload our page
angular for everyone and let's check out
the source if we select this you can see
that it is in fact getting this script
absolutely no problem okay so let's come
back to our page we now are loading up
an additional module here right we have
the JavaScript being loaded and it's
being loaded after angular however if we
try to use this you'd notice it's still
not working that's because we need to
use this module in our application now
we just have this one J's file at the
moment where all of our we have our
controller and our angular module
directory app everything lives right now
that's because this application is very
very small it's 20 lines and it really
doesn't require any additional breaking
out of things however once we start to
break out things into controllers and
things like that you'll notice this to
be quite a bit more complex and a lot
more different files and various file
structures that we're going to get over
in future tutorials once this project
grows a little bit but for now we want
to just go ahead and add this module to
our project now let's head back to the
documentation real quick you'll notice
that they say to load the module and
your angular dot module for your app
inside of these brackets is where this
text goes ng animate which is a string
here and that's just the name of our
module if you're adding any third-party
modules maybe you're getting some extra
directives like maybe something from
angular UI which is a nice set of
additional modules and directives then
you just be adding those modules that
you're using with a comma inside of this
array since we don't have any other
modules at this point we can just use an
NG animate here as a string just like
this and our projects going to be using
ng animate grade so we now have ng
animate loaded into our project now
let's see what happens if we were to
have the module name in our JavaScript
file here however
we don't have the script I'm just gonna
comment the script what you're going to
see is that you get this error right and
luckily when it takes you to this error
page in the documentation it sort of
gives you a good idea about what
possibly went wrong but it's basically
saying for instance ng route needs its
own module make sure you have that
installed so if you're getting this
message you are not including your
script correctly and you need to make
sure that this path is in fact working
okay so if I uncomment that you can see
we refresh once again we have no errors
so we've now added our first module into
our angular application and this opens
the door to being able to add a ton of
functionality from a ton of different
modules made from a ton of different
people give you access to custom
directives and just great new
functionality that you couldn't get
through core angular itself there's a
large community of people making stuff
so feel free to poke around and see what
kind of things you can find in the next
video we're gonna get working on making
an animation work so as always this is
Scott with love tutorials if you have
any questions or comments if you come in
the video here to set up a Twitter or
Facebook at level up Tut's we love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see in the next one
