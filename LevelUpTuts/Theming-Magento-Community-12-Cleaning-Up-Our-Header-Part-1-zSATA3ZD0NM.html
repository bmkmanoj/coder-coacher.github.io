up tuts and in the last lesson we
started converting our site to html5 in
this lesson we're going to take it
further and now we're going to start at
the top of our page and we're going to
work down a little bit we're going to
get this header section we're going to
get this all nice and perfect for us
okay so let's get into it okay the first
thing we need to do is find our template
so if you go to your PHP here you'll
know that it's it's giving the child
header right here this echo get child
header well if we go into our document
structure it's going to be and right
here let's see in our template folder I
don't think we have one already yet
let's check our own in the level up
template folder it looks like we do we
have the header P dot HTML here perfect
this is the one we want it's already
we've already made a copy of it from it
before if you don't have it in here it
goes in page HTML and then the file is
headed at P HTML you can find it located
in the same spot of the default theme as
we have done before so let's drag this
I'm going to open it up in sublime text
taking a look at it and um you know some
of the if you're not used to looking at
PHP some of the stuff can look scary
when you open this up but what you have
to know is really it's just HTML with
PHP thrown in here for instance we have
a div tag we have another div tag just
like you're used to an HTML and then we
have this if and Allisyn if if these
weren't here
if these essentially didn't exist then
it wouldn't be a problem nothing would
happen it just uh basically what this
statement is saying if is this the home
page if it's the home page then show
this h1 class of logo and all this stuff
otherwise just show an anchor instead of
an h1 so let's see that in action X
let's go to our page and we'll inspect
this we're on the home page right now
you can see we have in our header an h1
logo here it is let's go to a different
page cameras for instance
and I'm going to look at the same header
up here and all we have is a div class
header and anchor and then an image so
these templates aren't too scary there
is something like if you were to let's
say delete if you're delete like a
character in here like this we save it
and you mess up the PHP I'm going to get
a blank page because this this is
totally messing everything up
so always maybe save frequently check
your site if you're not used to doing
PHP in general you don't have to know a
ton of PHP to get some good progress on
these sites because if you're just using
the content that's already here you
don't have to write your own and for
most part we're not going to have to
write our own so to actually to edit
this I actually want this to be an h2 on
pages it's not the home page so here
it's a h1 with a class of logo on pages
that are not the home page and then
nothing but I'm just going to wrap the
second one in an h2 just like this now
you know this is just a semantics thing
I like to have this as an h2 on interior
pages just to give the importance of the
logo here and also we have this quick
access stuff and then we have this top
container and then we have this top menu
so we have a bunch of stuff here well
what we actually want to do to get this
to be more html5 like we're going to
actually change this a class of header
and refresh the page well I'm here and
we're going to leave this div that's a
header container here because that's
going to be sort of a wrapper for our
header but what we want to do is have
instead of a div here for our header
we're going to have something that's a
html5 tag just just called a header and
this is good for the header of any
content in your site
and so some people think that the the
html5 header
is just for your actual header of your
page so you're not restricted to using
one header per site you know it's not
like this is just for the logo and the
navigation or whatever you can use the
header as an introduction to a specific
section of the page in this case the
header is the introduction to the
section of our entire page but let's see
if we had a blog or something you could
use header in like the article title
name and then have the article in an
article tag itself so you can use header
in more than one place you know I think
a great site for learning html5
semantics is html5 dr. calm there what
it is is sort of like a blog where they
go over different html5 topics but one
of the most useful aspects of it is is
when people write in emails and ask
questions about which tags tee is where
and then they'll go over various
situations so it's a really great place
to learn html5 html5 dr comm check it
out so now we have this header tag it's
pretty cool we want this to actually
have a class of container though so
right now it is a class of header not
super useful to us but if we change this
to container if you recall the container
class from skeleton sets this in the
middle the reason why we want this
inside of the header container is
because we're going to want the header
container to span the entire width and
be a certain color so let's save this
and let's go to our page here
we should see the all the stuff shoot to
the middle now so now it's
center-aligned cool works let's change
some stuff around here in the very first
lesson we set the body background to
being this purple color
well now that's going to change I
actually want the body background to be
white so this at this - white and I'm
going to say a header container so this
is the class that we had
in our header here header - container
and this is going to get now the purple
color as its background
so let's come back to our page here and
refresh okay so as you can see we now
have the purple color at the top we have
our header there and things are starting
to take shape okay well we're going to
pick up in the next video right where we
left off and we're going to clean this
up even further as always this is Scott
with level up Tut's please let us know
if you have any questions thanks for
