up tutorials and in this series we're
gonna be talking all about view j/s now
view is a popular JavaScript framework
that many people are starting to prefer
so we're gonna dive into all of the
basics show you routing animations we're
gonna hit an API talk all about the
foundational skills involved in view and
just dive into everything that you need
to know to get up and running with view
j/s so with that said let's get started
and let's take a look at what we'll be
building over the course of this series
so in this course we're going to be
diving into the foundations of view j/s
and to do that we are going to be
building a level up movie database now
this project search seems super familiar
if you did react 16 for everyone we're
gonna be building the same kind of thing
where we have paid routes where we're
hitting an API we're getting some
animated page transitions going on here
and we're going to be doing all of this
through the use of the latest view CLI
which gives us dot view files everything
a web pack config right out of the box
and we're gonna be doing a lot of
foundational view skills within a code
pen itself so check it out if you would
like to learn how to build a real web
app using view Jas I don't over do level
up tutorials comm forward slash store to
purchase view j/s for everyone now if
you want to see more view Jeff's content
on this channel head into the comments
and let me know and I may be adding a
few additional view series to the
schedule so as always Scott with level
up tutorials and I hope you enjoy view a
Jas for everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
