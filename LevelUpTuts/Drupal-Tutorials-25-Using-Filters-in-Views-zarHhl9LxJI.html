up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to use filters in views so if you
remember in our last tutorial we created
a very basic test view right here where
it's just bringing in the titles of all
of our pieces of content ever well let's
say we wanted more control over that
let's say we wanted to just show our
basic pages so if we click this gear
here in the top right that shows when
you're logged in we can click edit view
from this and this will take us to the
same place that if we went to views and
then click Edit onto our view so in here
you'll notice that there's a filter
criteria and right now the only filter
is saying make sure that the content is
published so you could imagine a filter
is just like what it sounds it's a
filter without it all of your content
just sort of comes right in and the more
specific your filter gets the less and
less this filter lets through so you can
add things you can remove them you can
let's say if we took this off of here it
would only show it would show all of the
content whether it was published or not
if we check this to know we click on
this and we set this to no it would show
only public content that was not
published since all of our content is
published right now you'll notice
nothing shows up down here on our auto
preview so let's set this back to needs
to be published okay and let's add
something let's let's say we want this
to just be content we want this to only
be our basic pages so no projects no
articles just basic pages so let's click
add right here and then if you'll notice
there's all sorts of things in here so
you can actually go through this and
sort of get a feel for what's in here
however we're going to be saying we want
to make sure the content type so it's
going to be under content and then type
we want to make sure this is set to a
basic page as you can see something like
content title you could say only if the
content title is this will it show up
only if the content has these tags only
if the content
said two stickier promoted to the front
page only if the content has an image
all sorts of stuff so here we're just
going to say only if content type will
click ad all displays and then here
we're going to say is one of and we're
going to say basic page so you could
also expose this filter to allow
visitors to change it however we're not
going to do that we're just going to say
if this filter is a basic earth this
piece of content is a basic page let it
through will click apply and as you
notice our content here that's displayed
has gone from five to three we now only
have home projects and about which are
our three content basic pages okay
so now we have these three well let's
let's say we want this to be articles
because that's maybe a little bit more
applicable change into articles now it's
just our articles okay cool what if we
want it to be only articles that have
been not promoted to the front page so
in this situation let's save our view
here and I'm just going to go out of it
for a second to show you so the the
let's say we have one thing where the
content the articles that have been
published to the front page are going to
show up right here and then you want
these ones to be the ones that are like
let's say latest latest ones that not
aren't necessarily the promoted ones it
could be over here with just their
titles and maybe a basic description and
then you don't want this content to be
duplicated this content so you could say
this one is published to the front page
and this one is not so let's go to edit
view and we'll say we'll add another
filter and we'll go look for promoted at
the front page this time I'm going to
use the search bar here and just type
promote and you can see it filters this
out for us we can select this one and we
could say is this promoted to the front
page no we want only items that are not
promoted to the front page and if we add
that you'll see the only one that we
have is my first Drupal article because
that's the only one that we told
not to promote the front page will save
this and now you can see that this my
first Drupal article is the only one
here if we go into our find content and
let's go to this last one that we made
and we edit this one let's set this to
not be promoted to the front page so
publishing options will uncheck this
click Save it and as you can see even on
this page but as you can see that this
view has already updated that this one
is first and this one a second and
because these both pieces of content are
not published they'll show up here well
as you can see this is very powerful
because if you set up these filters in a
way and let's say this Kresge example
this filter is saying only recent news
items so the latest news items and it's
saying so the filter set to news content
type news items and then it's going to
bring in four of them okay and then for
this feature news this is going to be
looking for one piece of content that's
a featured piece of news and that has
promoted to the front page so this one's
probably looking for ones that aren't
promoted to the front page and this is
looking for one that has been promoted
to the front page as you can see it's a
really great way to control your content
so if you just go through the filters
here you can really get an idea of what
you can accomplish for the most part I
think maybe filtering by content type is
very common it's very used promoted to
the front page is very common very used
and of course there's so many more
options you can really get in here so
think of filter as just a way to filter
your content and show exactly what you
want to show
okay well that's filters and views if
you have any questions feel free to
