up Tut's and today we are going to be
starting a new mini-series on Susie and
Susie is a grid I guess you could call
it a grid framework but it's really a
grid extension for sass that allows you
to build really awesome configurable
grids and if you watch the singularity
videos you might notice some
similarities between the two uh or if
you're new to sass grids in general and
you've only use things like the 960 grid
or something like that it could be a
totally different concept for you in
fact uh it is a very different at the
start because with those other grid
Styles you're actually putting things in
your HTML like a class that says like
you know call 1 through 3 or something
like that with Susy and other similar
frameworks you are actually writing all
of your grid stuff in your CSS or your
sass right
so through mix-ins you're telling divs
in areas and stuff to spam columns and
things like that
now if you're not used to this it could
be very foreign however I think after a
very short time you're going to see just
how awesome it is and how flexible and
configurable these grids are so we're
going to be using the latest version of
Susy which is version 2.0 and Susy has a
new website a new version and it has a
new way of doing things so I think now
is an appropriate time to start the Susy
series and kick it off so what we're
going to do in this video is set up a
basic project I've gone ahead and
downloaded just a really basic html5
boilerplate site right so html5
boilerplate I created an S CSS folder
and I made a main dot s CSS file and
that's really all I did actually I made
some additions to the HTML and this just
contains a main area and then an aside
with an unordered list so that here we
have our paid
right here and you can see its page
content and then sidebar so nothing
crazy
by all means nothing that is you know
really taking the process of starting
this so what we need to do to get
started is first we need to install Susi
then we need to use it in a config RB
file that you may or may not be familiar
with it's okay we'll go over that and
then we'll get ready using Susi
so what we need to make sure you have
done first is installed Susi and since
we want to be using the latest version
you have to have this pre tags so we
want to install this I'm going to type
sudo gem install Susi it's su sy and
then - - pre what the flag of pre does
is it makes sure that we are grid we're
getting the latest version Susi to
rather than Susi one if you were to
leave off the pre beginning Susi one and
then you wouldn't be able to follow
along with these videos so make sure it
says pre it's going to ask you for your
password and then you can go ahead and
download it now this video series does
assume that you have worked with sass
and compass so if you haven't go check
out those videos and learn a little bit
about sass and compass first and then
come back and you can get started using
Susi
now this is just going to take a second
don't worry and then once it's done
downloading I will come back okay so our
gem is installed and we're ready to go
the next step is going to be adding Suzy
to our project now you could do this
with a compass command that's compass
create your projects name and then - our
Suzy - ooh Suzy however I really think
it's important to get into these config
data our B files and really understand
what's going on and we did the list a
little bit in the singularity video so
we're going to do it here as well and
now I'm going to right click on my Suzy
folder and in the root of my project I'm
going to create a new file and that's
going to be my config config dot RB and
this is a ruby file but don't worry you
don't have to know much Ruby to get this
going and I'm going to paste in here a
config doubt our B file that I have used
in the past now this is really just
setting up our compass settings right so
that compass sort of knows what to do
and sass well when you're telling
compass watch that knows what to do
where to find everything so project type
is standalone I notice how there's a a
colon before here I can actually just
paste my config dot RB into the
description so you can have that now
HTTP path is just going to be a forward
slash now sass directory is not sass I
have our sass files located in an S CSS
folder I feel like I need to standardize
how I do that
and then CSS is in the CSS folder images
is an IMG fonts there is no fonts yet
but if they will be they'll be in a
fonts folder J s is in a J s line
comments false preferred syntax is : s
or : s CSS rather than the sass syntax
if you need to know the differences are
you can always check out sasses website
for that output style is expanded we
could change this to compressed if we
were going to
production or something like that and
relative assets is true so now this is
nothing special in fact if we were to
just you know use this as is it would be
a pretty standard config dat RB but what
we need now is we need to require an
extension right so to require something
always type is require and then space
and then in quotes Suzy that's it and
that's pretty cool now we don't really
have to do anything extra
except for import it into our sass
stylesheet so let's close out of that
and the first line on our main dot CSS
can be import and then in quotes Suzy
and then a semicolon now we simply need
to need to start our compass by telling
our current directory which is the base
directory of our site to compass watch
like I'm sure you're used to by now so
we're going to say compass watch now I'm
getting an error and I'm pretty sure
this is a compass error I found on Stack
Overflow that basically people can get
this working simply by having it's a
pseudo and then compass watch so if you
see an error like this that's telling
you the permissions denied just do
pseudo compass watch and I think it
might be an issue I'm on the latest
versions of everything also if you're
getting also if you're getting a
different error just upgrade to your
versions and hopefully that can solve it
so I'll go ahead and make an update to
this once that of course is looking like
the situation is resolved but for now
pseudo compass watch is working fine and
it looks like it's watching for changes
now we can say something like body
background and then I'll give it a
background of just slightly not white so
maybe like EEE now let's come to our
site we refresh we have a gray
background and compass is clearly
compiling check out our main dad CSS
here it is cool
so we know even though we're not doing
anything with Susy we have it up and
running so that's awesome we have
compass up and running we're importing
Susy and everything is great in the next
video we're going to talk about using
Suzie's functionality to start building
out a basic grid so as always this is
Scott with level of Tut's if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment in the video or hit us up at
Twitter I level up Tut's let us know
what you're thinking we'd love to hear
from you thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
