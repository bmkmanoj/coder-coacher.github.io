up tutorials and in this video I'm going
to be showing you how to write really
really fast HTML and CSS using the
package Emmet so let's get going on that
right now
so now that we have package management
in our toolkit it opens up the world for
adding exciting new packages to extend
the life of atom
now the first package I want to
highlight is Emmet now if you haven't
used Emmet in any sort of other
situation what you'll see here is that
Emmet essentially just makes writing
code much faster so you'll see it has
almost 400,000 installs so if that's not
a good enough reason to check it out
then I don't know what is basically if
with installing this here it's a total
time-saver with a shorthand syntax
allowing you to write HTML and CSS much
faster now one thing I do is own to head
to Emmett's official website so we can
head to Doc's that I met that I owe
and what I'm looking for here is a cheat
sheet for Emmet if we come in here and
we can actually just do slash cheat
sheet
you'll see that this is a nice little
page for getting started and learning
all of the different ins and outs of
Emmet here now let's actually just try
some of these without looking at the
sheet first I'm going to head to an HTML
file and let's say let's come down here
let's say you want to have an unordered
list with five list items and anchor
links inside of that you could then with
Emmet type ul then you would use a
greater than sign to say inside of the
UL then we say we want list item then
you use the asterisk to denote times so
we could say list items five times so
what we're going to have here is inside
of a 100 list 5 list items now when we
do the greater than sign this time what
it's going to actually say is inside of
every single one of those list items and
then we can have an anchor tag now let's
say we want the anchor tag to have a
class of let's say social we can do that
just by saying dot social now once this
is all here you can simply just hit tab
and be amazed as this entire little
snippet gets filled out for you now we
also have the ability to put things next
to things let's say we wanted a span
next to each one of these lists items we
can say span tab and you'll see now that
next to each one of these anchor tags is
a span but what if we wanted the span or
a div or something else to show up after
the unordered list itself how would you
go about doing that when we have the
plus here like so well this is where we
can add some nice parentheses here so we
can just say parentheses like so and
spin now let's say we want a footer
immediately following this on our list
we can hit tab and actually for some
reason Adams auto-completion was getting
in the way so you might want to have to
turn off Adams auto-completion however
when I backtracked and did it again
you'll notice it puts an unordered list
and then a footer okay so this is HTML
using Emmet it's really super easy and
as you can see by checking out this
cheat sheet there's a lot of stuff you
can do with it so browse through
Emmett's
to find out every little in and out here
but chances are even just using the
little bit elements of it here and there
is going to save you a lot of time let's
actually check out what it does for CSS
now we can now type things like let's
say inside of our footer we wanted an
overflow:hidden we can just do a HDC
overflow:hidden likewise if we wanted a
margin we could say m 10 tab gives us a
margin 10 pixels T will give us top top
of 10 pixels and we could type BG to
give us a background now as you can see
these abbreviations are nice however
there's all sorts of different
shorthands and different ways that you
can type these things to make them more
or less specific or even have more or
less values at the end of it in fact
let's check out if we did DB you get
display:block what you could also do is
D : B and you get display:block
now I'm personally used to using Hayaku
in sublime text which in my opinion has
a bit better of fuzzy abbreviations for
instance PSR will get you
position:relative
in sublime text where PS are in Emmet
will give you padding right so if you're
used to using something like hi yaku
you'll need to get used to POS for
position:relative and then you can
change it simply just by typing the
position that you actually want this
isn't to say that one's better or worse
it's just whatever you're used to
so again with Emmett there are a ton of
CSS abbreviations and you don't
necessarily have to memorize all of them
because chances are if you're thinking
about something being correct right if
you're thinking about bg4 background hit
tab it's most likely going to work
however in an instance where you can't
find what you're looking for it's nice
to have this cheat sheet handy when
you're still learning so this is Emmett
for quick and easy HTML and CSS
abbreviations that fill out into Auto
code completion it's super awesome I
highly recommend it I've used this
plug-in back before when it was named
Zen and now with the latest updates in
all of the Texas it's just become more
and more amazing so as always the Scott
with level up tutorials if you want to
have early access to the rest of these
Adam videos you can purchase them on the
level up tutorials website right now for
digital download as always this is Scott
thanks for watching and I'll see you the
next one bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
