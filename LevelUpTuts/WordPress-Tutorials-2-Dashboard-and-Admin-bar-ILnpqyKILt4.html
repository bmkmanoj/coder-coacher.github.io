tuts welcome back we are going to
continue with the new WordPress basics
series before we start I want to thank
the first 600 people that wear our
subscribers really appreciate it if you
haven't subscribed please do so so that
you can get updates when we upload them
to YouTube also you can follow us on
twitter at level up tots so the last
video we cover the installation of
WordPress in this video we are going to
cover the admin bar that's this bar that
shows up along the top of the page
you're not seeing this bar you're not
logged in so what you'll need to do is
log in if you are rocking the standard
theme you can log in through your meta
down here otherwise you can just add WP
admin and it will bring you to the
already logged in but it would bring you
to the login screen where you enter your
username and login from the last video
what you'll notice about the admin bar
is that it is displayed on both the
dashboard that's this area here and when
you are logged in
or when you're when you're logged in and
viewing just sort of your live site you
see it along the top here as well the
menu differs slightly when you're when
you're you know on the live site versus
the versus the dashboard what I want to
do though is start with the dashboard so
to get back to the dashboard I can
either you know click here and it's
going to take me or I could have done it
through this menu over here so what I
want to do is start with the far left
and talk my way right so what we see
here is the WordPress logo with a link
to the about page the link to
wordpress.org remember that's where we
downloaded this from last time and what
will really be bringing back to
wordpress.org is the documentation which
is that codex that wordpress.org did you
want to remember that because you just
need to remember that the link is right
here typically when I'm developing a
site i have the documentation open one
tab and my site in the other just so i
can quickly go back and you know make
sure I got the right hook or the right
syntax or whatever there's also a link
off to the support forms as well and
feedback never use these two so the next
leftmost item is this here we're seeing
our site name and because we're in the
dashboard it's just giving us a link to
visit our site and this just takes us to
the homepage now
what if I go to this length now from the
live site what I see is quick links to
you know various locations various
popular locations in the dashboard so
this one takes me to the dashboard
homepage just one two hops me over to
the themes this one site configuration
right widgets menu and all that stuff so
it's cool about this is that you know so
you hit say you have a page and like
sample page here or actually it would be
like it's another page and you want to
add it to this navigation well the cool
thing is if you're on that page you can
just really quickly say you know oh yeah
wordpress menus and then add it to the
menu so you know it's just a nice little
shortcut some hot back to the dashboard
this would tell you if you have any
comments in moderation you can collect
their to hop over to the comments edit
screen our tab which is also found in
here and then also what we can do is
start managing our content and this
that's posts you know images and video
links pages users etc these are all just
sort of the various types of content so
these are similar to clicking any one of
these but again if you are on the
homepage you can very quickly say oh I
want to add a new page where all I want
to add a new user or I want all I want
to add a new post so it's it's nice you
know time saving measure and then in the
far right there's a couple things I want
to point out these three things right
here here we're seeing you know howdy
and then your username so i called mine
admin because i'm not very creative and
I don't have a gravatar set up for that
email address that i use bennett level
up dots com if you have any questions
you can email me or again on twitter
this is where you also go to change your
password can do that type of stuff and
also you can log out now one important
thing that
I and maybe this was just me maybe not I
don't know was for a long time I just
did not see this right here screen
options what screen options does is it
shows you the options not for the whole
site but for this screen that you're on
so this little drop-down thing will
change depending on whether you're on
the dashboard homepage here or one of
these inside pages so right now in this
video we're just going to talk about
this one but in other videos coming up
soon like managing the menu this is key
that and so we'll go with that deeper
then so anyway so what we can do here
and screen on using this screen options
and again it differs but on this screen
we can control what we're seeing on the
screen it's sort of named correctly I
don't know how I missed it for I feel
like years or mom not even sure maybe it
maybe it's new i don't i don't even know
but yeah so click to open it and then
what you can do is you can start turning
off the stuff that's not so important to
you or your client or na that type of
stuff so those welcome message that's
cool if you're brand new but we're we're
we're pros so we can get scared of that
we can turn off any of these other items
another cool thing that we can do is we
can change the layout so we can say you
know what i want a three column and so I
just you know dragged a couple items
over there we could change you a four
column can drag another item over there
or in our case you know I don't really
care about my other WordPress news so
get rid of that and recent comments
that's you know what that's kind of cool
plugins that will be cool but for now
let's just get rid of it incoming links
well I'm actually not going to have very
many incoming links so I'm just going to
turn that on
so now that I have it down to just these
items that sort of looks weird so you
know what I'll just put it back to that
to our attitude number of columns to be
number 10 just to be one so now we're
getting this nice you know full screen
um let's see your the other thing that I
wanted to point out is you can drag
these around to reorder so I want this
one to be in top and instead of the
wordpress blog some of these when you
hover over them you can configure it was
like this one is configured when I hover
over this one does as well so i'm gonna
go ahead and click that and it doesn't
have to be the wordpress blog feed that
i'm pulling and i could pull in some
other feet that's what's you know sort
of cool about this so you know it it's
configurable that's that's neat um I so
you can sort of come up with your own
use cases for that but say you have a
client and you post news to your own
blog and yeah you just want to keep them
reminded that you exist and so that next
time they have a project that they're
sort of thinking about you know they're
seeing your name every day right here so
anyway there are other plugins that you
can add to WordPress that will allow you
to further customize this screen for
example if you wanted your company logo
your own customized welcome message
that's cool you can do that so yeah
that's that's it that's that's all I
wanted to cover in this video again this
was the admin bar and don't forget about
screen options and help thanks a lot for
watching stay tuned for the next set of
videos in the next couple sets we're
going to cover more WordPress basics
like going through this admin menu over
here on the left side so keep with us
thanks a lot for watching take care
