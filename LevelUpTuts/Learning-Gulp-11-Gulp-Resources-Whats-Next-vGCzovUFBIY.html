of Tut's and in this video I'm going to
show you where we're headed with the
gulp series now because this was a mini
series I was just giving you a taste of
gulp and what you can do you now have
the tools to write your own tasks to
make some really cool stuff and to
really expand gulp so in this video I'm
going to show you where you can find new
techniques and tools to expand your
knowledge of gulp in addition I'm going
to continue to add to this series just
not have regular intervals whenever
there's something that I feel needs to
be in the series another video will pop
up and be added to the playlist so keep
watching you're going to learn how you
can take your gulp knowledge even
further with some self-exploration so
the best place to start for building
your gulp knowledge base is really gulp
j/s calm now they have access to docks
you can look at the code directly or you
can just check out this great plugins
page that they have here now this allows
you to search through 737 go plugins
without getting other NPM packages in
the way and these link directly off to
the package page that way you can get
all the instructions on how to use it
there but this offers really great
filtering and you can find out exactly
what your need perhaps if you're looking
for something and if maybe something
doesn't exist that might be an
opportunity to give back to the gulp
community by creating your own package
okay so we have gulp J's calm slash
plugins which is great now if you come
to the docs page it's actually just the
go p-- readme for gulp here in fact if
you scroll down there's a whole
documentation page under the
documentation headline and this gives
you access some pretty cool stuff in
addition to how to write a plug-in
getting started some other ins and outs
of using gulp we also have an FAQ we
have recipes they have a link to where
the freenode IRC chatroom for learning
gopas and then there's all sorts of
articles about using gulp itself an
introduction to node.js streams video
introduction to node.js streams a cheat
sheet for gulp all of
these resources are nicely listed here
within this readme as you can see this
cheat sheet is pretty darn awesome so
all of these resources are available to
you from Gope j/s comm so check it out
read through this stuff and learn more
and more about what makes gulp so
awesome and such an integral part of
many web developers workflows so as
always this is Scott with LevelUp tuts
i've had a great time introducing you to
gulp if you want to learn anything else
in particular that you're having a hard
time finding good information on with
gulp please contact me leave a comment
in this video and I will add on to this
series as needed also if you've gotten a
lot out of this series consider giving
back to level up touched by setting up
for level up pro it's $8.99 for a month
or $95 a year and you get access to
downloadable videos you get access to an
ad-free level up tuts comm you keep the
videos free for everyone and you even
get access to live code examples for
some of our newer courses so as always
this is Scott with level up tuts and
thanks for watching we'll see you in the
next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
