up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you some amazing at color
highlighting using a package called
pigment now this takes the color
highlighting that you get in some other
packages and really just takes it to the
next level by even giving you a window
of your palette with all of your values
it's really cool so let's check it out
right now so in this video I'm gonna
show you one of my favorite features
from sublime text it's actually a
package in sublime text but somebody has
also made this package for Adam which is
really great because it's one that at
this point I just can't live without so
this package is going to help you define
your colors in your style sheets and
things like that so when we have a style
sheet color you're going to have the
representation of that color so let's
head to settings let's come to install
and I have this color highlighting we're
actually using a package called pigments
if you search for pigments you're going
to find this pigment project right here
so let's go ahead and install that
now it's neat about this pigments is
that there's actually a pellet component
built into this so after we install this
I'm gonna head to my intermediate that's
stylus file and we're gonna check it out
okay so we have this installed and you
can see upon saving this file we now
have the colors listed here so red is
appropriately highlighted with the
correct red color this teal is correctly
highlighted and so on and so forth so as
you can see here all of our colors even
the transparent ones that we have up
here are correctly rossette represented
in our document and more importantly
when we call those variables and stylus
or sass or any of that stuff it's going
to continue to highlight that correct
color you'll notice that when I actually
put my cursor over it that highlighting
goes away so it's not obnoxious when
you're typing now let's come back here
and let's check out one of the cooler
features of pigment now we can start our
command palette simply by doing command
shift P and we can type in pigment now
you'll see there's some options here we
have reload find colors show palette
let's go ahead and select show palette
you're on notice have some other options
in here like convert to RGB convert to
hex in RGB a those are really nice
useful tools to have as well but I want
to show this palette when we select that
what you can see is all of the colors
that we've defined in our project are
being shown as a palette now it's even
cooler here is that the variable names
themselves are actually displayed here
along with an RGB a value so we have
dark perp perp light gray gray black all
that stuff so as you can see here social
it even goes as far as looking within
objects in stylist so social dot Twitter
is going to be Twitter's color social
dot Facebook so this palette can give
you a really nice way to find all of
your colors immediately we can also sort
them by name sort them by color March
duplicates you can group them all sorts
of good stuff here now let's go and try
one of those utilities I'm gonna have
this hex value and I have this selected
here I'm gonna type in pigment and now
I'm going to say
convert to RGB upon doing that you can
see it completely converts this to an
RGB value I'm gonna undo that and you
can see the same thing in action just by
placing the cursor in the middle of it
and I'm just going to say pigment
converts to our DBA and you can see I
don't even have to have the text
highlighted I just have to have the
cursor in the text itself and you can
see we now have an official RGB a value
right here and notice if we make this
something like 0.5 here save this hover
off you can see that transparency is
definitely represented so now this is
really the best package for color
highlighting and color utilities with
Adam it basically takes something that
was in a sublime text package and really
really super charges it into a way that
makes this just really really great to
use so this is pigments for Adam I hope
