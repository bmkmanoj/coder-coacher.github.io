today I'm going to show you how to use
the child selector in CSS and this is
gonna become really important because in
the next lesson I'm gonna teach you how
to make a drop-down menu using only CSS
and the child selector so it's good to
understand these concepts before we do
this that way instead of just you know
reproducing what you're seeing you're
knowing what you're doing and why okay
so to get started the first thing I'm
going to do is add another you an
ordered list into this list item in our
navigation so let's go to our HTML and
right here let's see it's our nav and
what I'm going to do is right after the
anchor but before the El I know I have a
ul and again I'm just gonna create these
and I'm not gonna bother doing really
anything crazy with these right now
because we don't need to and we'll get
into exactly what's going on when we
build our drop-down menu okay so excuse
me well I type this out and we should be
all good I'm just actually gonna copy
this paste it a few times this should
have been a pound okay
and two three four okay so now we have
four items under our list item in an
unordered list itself and what you're
going to see here is when we refresh
this you'll see something that you may
not expect to have happen refresh this
it's going first I don't want to into
atom 3 item 4 and then second third last
if you'll notice item 4 is even bold so
what's happening here it's that because
in our CSS if we scroll down here we
said the list items in nav will be
display inline also the last child of
the list items will have a
on weight of bold well we didn't say
which list item we specifically said
list items under the class of nav well
there's list items here but these are
also technically the sytems under the
class of nav will to build a drop-down
menu let's say we want these main level
links listed horizontally on the top
we're gonna want these listed vertically
we don't want these to be displaying
mine so how can we solve this well we
can solve this with the child selector
and what that is is it's greater than
sign like this and it's really pointing
right so it's saying that the children
of the nav that are list items display
in line and you know what it's not going
to do it's not going to give this
property to list items that are children
of list items just list items that are
children of the nav directly so let's
save this and let's refresh our page and
now you'll see that underneath first is
here is all four of our items and then
the other ones are display inline as
well of course since we haven't really
styled this it's kind of funky right now
but what's really important is that you
only affected this first level list
items and again if we wanted to style
list items underneath this we could then
say dot nav and then the children this
so we're going to say under navigate
we're going to say list items under the
navigation under a UL and then another
Li we're going to give them a background
of blue let's save this and let's come
to our page and refresh this okay so now
these items that are children of the
list item which are then children of the
UL li have a background of blue and thus
if we were to add another list in one of
these items those would not be affected
by this code either so this can come in
really
if you're trying to affect certain
pieces of code it's a nice a nice way to
just affect only the children of an
element another example would say if we
want to only affect links that are
children of the paragraphs we could say
all links in paragraph all the anchors
in a paragraph are going to be
font-weight:bold
now we refresh this we can see this is
html5 is bold but none of these are in
fact this last is only bold because
we're telling you to from our last child
so that's the child selector and it's
going to come in really handy in a
second in the next tutorial when we go
over how to make an actual drop-down
menu using only CSS as always if you
