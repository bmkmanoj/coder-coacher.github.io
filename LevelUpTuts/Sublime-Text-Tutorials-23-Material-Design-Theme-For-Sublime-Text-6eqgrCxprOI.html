up tutorials and today we're going to be
showing you my new favorite sublime text
three color scheme and theme now this is
based off of Google's material design
spec and that includes things like
folder animations it includes
suggested preferences and two different
color schemes and two different themes
if you like your themes dark or light
and even the light themes not really
that light but either dark or not so
dark so let's check it out right now so
we've been using this set EUI pack is
the theme that we've been using latest
to get these icons in the style over the
theme that I've been using most often is
now the material design theme and we can
get that simply by going now to package
control and let's type in package and
install package and now you can find
this theme by searching for material
design so here we have a material theme
quote let's add this and you'll notice
it gives you some options here so these
options will look best after we've
already sort of applied some of this
stuff and this thing's really easy to
enable just by copying and pasting
things from the splash screen now we
could enable it simply by using themer
listing it and then enabling it that way
however this is really easy because it
gives us some options here it says if
you just want to use this theme go ahead
and copy and paste this put it in your
user settings let's come to my sublime
text preferences and then settings user
settings and now see I got really
nothing in here just get rid of this
current theme and paste these in here
get rid of these extra curly brackets
because it's already within an object
here and fix the tabbing a little bit
now when we save it we're now using the
new material design color scheme as you
can see which is the screen color it has
a really nice lighter greenish blue for
the text and then we have some colored
icons that fit along with the material
design color palette in addition we also
have this material design theme where
we have the top bars and the side bars
here and when we open up our folders we
get little folder animations and stuff
like that just little nice tweaks to
make this nice to use and here's some
suggested user experience settings that
I found to be really nice as well so if
we copy these move over and add these to
the object here and again I can you
don't need to fix the tabbing in here
but that's something I like to do okay
and now we can save this and you can see
it spread things out a little bit more
now this font options gray anti-alias
looks best if you were on a Retina
screen since this monitor I'm using
isn't a high resolution monitor it's a
pretty standard resolution monitor it
can look a little crisp here a little
too crisp so this fun options a grey
anti-alias is going to look really nice
on your high resolution monitors but not
so much on lower resolution so I'm going
to go ahead and delete that there we go
now we have a little bit heftier font
coming in because of the lower
resolution but we have a little bit more
line spacing we have these overlay
scroll bars with material theme always
show mini mini-map bolding the folder
labels so that the folders are bold and
we have some indent guide options as
well I can get rid of this comment
however there are more recommended
settings for this material theme so if
we do material theme sublime in Google
come to the github page you'll notice
that in addition to some screenshots of
what it looks like here some known
issues stuff theme options and
recommended UI settings well the theme
options are something that we didn't get
a message about in sublime itself if we
copy and paste these over you almost I
don't love all of these so I'm going to
go through these one by one and talk a
little bit about them
so again I'm just fixing the tabbing
here no real reason okay now when I save
this you leave it uh you'll notice some
things change the first one material
theme small tab which is this tabs up
here are quite a bit smaller that's one
thing I really actually enjoy that's a
setting that I keep now this is
disabling the file icons I happen to
really like the file icon so I'm going
to go ahead and delete that line so that
we can get our file icons back next is a
disabled the folder animation to true I
like the little folder animation there's
nothing crazy about it it's just when
you open a folder it animates open so we
can delete that now you can see we get
going from full to open here we get this
the icon itself is animating now
material themes small status bar I like
the small status bar as well we don't
need a large status bar so it gets it
out of the way the tree disable the tree
indicator I happen to like the tree
indicator as well and the last one is
material theme up bold tab it's make the
tab labels bolder I like that one as
well too it makes your a tab stick out
quite a bit and so here we have the the
theme if we close this theme and reopen
up sublime you'll notice that parts of
it that didn't get applied are now
applied so we now have the top bar we
don't have any weird black chunks in
here and it all looks really good we saw
on the github page and the settings that
first popped up that there were some
other options we have a darker and a
lighter theme you can see the
screenshots of them here the one that I
found myself using more so than any of
these whether it's the standard the
darker the light is the dark I use the
dark for the color scheme and for the
theme itself on my own personal machine
so if I copy this and just paste it in
here you can see that we now have this
dark theme and it's really just a gray
version of the theme that colors pop out
really nice the blues look a little bit
more stand they stand out a little bit
more the text is the commenting text is
gray into the blue for me this is just
easier to read if I pop up in a CSS file
you can see that the colors are really
nice they stick out your elements are
red your properties are blue and your
values are orange and yellow it's just
for me this is an ideal kind of color
scheme so this is something that I use
quite a bit so this is my new favorite
color scheme and theme this is how I
like to use it check it out let me know
how you like to have yours configured
the material color scheme material theme
package is a really nice addition to you
