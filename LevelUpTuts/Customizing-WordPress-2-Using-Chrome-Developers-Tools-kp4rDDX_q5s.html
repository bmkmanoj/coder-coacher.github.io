of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to inspect your CSS and find out
what things are so you can find out how
to change them now I would recommend
having some basic CSS knowledge we have
a basic CSS series on level up Tut's
that's 20 or so videos just to get you
up to speed about how to make
modifications in CSS and what it's
exactly doing all you need to know about
CSS other than the syntax and the coding
is that CSS is used to not only lay out
the site but also choose the styles so
the font size the color that sort of
stuff the actual data at the actual
content in the way it's laid out in the
code is going to be produced by the PHP
which outputs HTML which is read by a
browser anything interactive is
JavaScript stuff well I should say
almost anything interactive at this
point you can do a lot of great
transitions and animations with CSS so I
shouldn't leave that out because I
myself am a big fan of that so you may
have seen in the last post I quickly did
something and I was able to determine
that the reason why this background was
white and not blue like we had told the
body to be blue was because of a div
that the style or the class of page or
site I can't remember and it had a
background of white so I want to show
you how exactly you can do that I'm
using Chrome if you're using Safari you
can do this as well same with Firefox
although the tools are a little bit
different and for Safari you're going to
have to turn on developers tools you
might want to Google how to do that I
would just recommend using Chrome
because personally I find their
developers tools to be way better and so
for what we're going to do let's say we
want to change the size of all of our
post text titles right
this doesn't fit our fancy maybe we want
this to be bigger for some reason right
so what you can do is right-click on
this and then you'll have this inspect
element right here what this is going to
do is either
well it's probably gonna open up on the
bottom for you however if you hold this
little icon right here you can get it to
show up on the right side like mine what
it does here is it shows you the HTML
right here and when you sort of hover
over things it highlights on the page
what exactly you're hovering over and
you'll notice we want this it's it's
right now is showing us the anchor text
and if we come down here it's going to
show us the CSS that's actually applied
to that now we want to change the font
size and the font size is most likely
going to be on this h1 which is a header
tag so if we click on this you can see
our font size is 33 pixels now one thing
we can do is directly in the browser
click on this on the 33 pixel so it's
highlighted with blue and just tap up a
few times and we can even test it to see
what it's going to look like at a larger
size now we want this thing to be pretty
monstrous so 40 pixels is awesome for me
now we can look at here what this class
is it's saying that this property is
given by the class of entry title and
it's on line 1068 of style dot CSS if we
come to our CSS page of course we don't
have it here because we're importing
this one it's being imported from the
2014 so I've opened up the 2014 theme
and I've gone to style that CSS and now
the line I wanted to look at was 1068 so
if I scroll down you see the line
numbers on the side here and we can go
to 1068 now here is 1068 and entry title
just like we saw had 33 pixels for the
font size now at this point we have a
choice we can make we could exactly copy
this entry title directly from this
paste it into our CSS here just like
this
and modify this and say hey it's going
to be 40 pixels also keep in mind any
modifications you make in the inspect
element are non permanent if
we were to refresh the page that go away
however since I just added that to our
CSS file if we refresh you can see they
actually our 40 pixels and down here we
have two entry titles we have the one
from our stab at CSS that's the one
we're importing and we have this other
one where we just modified it so that's
one option right however you'll notice
it's doing a lot of dumb things here
it's overriding all of this stuff text
transform uppercase margin whatever even
though we're not changing anything so a
better option would be if you're just
changing the font size here of course
you could just delete everything here I
would encourage you to get used to doing
things like looking at this seeing that
it's entry title coming in here and even
writing your own CSS to get used to it
if you're not used to writing CSS or if
you are just write your own CSS and it's
just entry - title just like that and
inside of here just because we want it
to be something different let's say font
size we want it to be 42 pixels just
like that and we can save it now let's
come into our post and refresh now
you'll see that just the font size is
overriding we don't have unnecessary
code right because the best part about
CSS is you're supposed to do things dry
you don't want to repeat yourself so you
write as little code as possible and
that way it keeps things organized so
just like this let's make a modification
to the page or the site class that we
saw before up top here it's actually if
I click around it's this div right here
and the class down here that we see is a
site and it has a background color of
white now we want to change that to be
just a off shade of white so just like
we did before we use the class name that
we saw and we can say site
and we can have the background be
something just off-white we can have a B
EEE
which is just a next shade up of gray
and now I refresh and our background our
page our site div is now has a
background of this gray now I don't
really know what's going on here with
why these have a white box but let's
find out we can go ahead and right-click
just pretty much anywhere in here and
click inspect and it's going to take us
to the general region from here I can
just start clicking around and I can see
that the header has a background color
of white you know here's that and all
sorts of stuff in here as a background
color white I'm not too sure why they
did this way you know there could be a
lot of reasons but if you'll notice that
that's from site content entry content
site content entry summary it's a whole
bunch of stuff in here so we would have
to find each of these elements and
override it for instance let's click on
the header and we see it's site content
uh sorry site content entity header so
let's go and select this a class right
here and we can just copy this right
from inspect again let's put this below
our entry title or maybe above an entry
title but below site how you manage your
CSS files is something in itself and for
here we're going to say background and
we're going to write transparent now we
refresh and this header no longer has
the background color of white now to get
rid of that on these other ones we're
going to have to do that separately but
you now have the process of doing that
and you can go ahead and find what they
are in fact this is site meta here or
entry meta so I can go ahead and put a
comma here and paste that one in
now we can also find a that was entry
meta as well entry content so if I grab
this whole bit right here site content
entry content and do another comma and
put that here you notice we're now
saying alright within site content entry
header within site content entry meta
within side contra entry content now the
reason why we have to have site content
in front of the entry header class is
that's because that's how it was coded
in the style sheet that were overriding
they wouldn't override that because how
specific the parent theme is would
override our sub theme alright so let's
save this and refresh and it looks like
I must have missed something oh I had an
extra comma here for some reason
and I'll save this refresh perfect so
now we have this lighter gray background
we have no more background color on
these entries or anything like that and
we've made some modifications so this is
a process that you're going to want to
get used to because chrome web developer
tools is something that I pretty much
use all the time every day
it really helps you understand what's
going on behind the scenes and it makes
you way better at CSS and your coding
languages what you can even go to do is
go to any site you want and look at how
people are doing things simply by right
clicking and inspecting it and then
looking at the CSS it will teach you a
lot about how other people make websites
great so now we've made some real
advancements in our CSS for our website
we've now made some major modifications
and while it might not look like much
you now have the power to effectively
change anything on this site that's
pretty powerful in terms of the styling
goes well in the next couple of videos
we're going to be going over some even
more crazy stuff we're going to show you
functions dot PHP we're going to show
you some template file stuff we're going
to show you some PHP stuff so keep on
theming
and check it out and make modifications
play around with it and watch our CSS
videos if you do not know CSS because
it's an absolutely amazing skill and
tool to be able to use also if you want
more practice with CSS stuff code
Academy has great CSS series and you can
go there and get some free training
there as well so as always this is Scott
