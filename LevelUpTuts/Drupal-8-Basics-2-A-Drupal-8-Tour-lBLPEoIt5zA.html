of tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
give you a tour about what comes with
Drupal 8 out of the box I'm going to
talk a little bit about how it's
different from Drupal 7 and really just
what to expect when you've downloaded
and installed Drupal 8 let's get going
on that so now that we have Drupal
installed we'll see that we have a new
front-end to Drupal now this theme that
it comes with is not that dissimilar to
the theme that Drupal 7 came with and if
you've never used Drupal this is pretty
much what Drupal has always looked like
for the past few years when you install
it with some differences before when we
are logged in we had some annoying sort
of tabs to modify your content now
you'll notice we have these well they're
a little bit faint when you hover over
your content you'll see a little pencil
next to different things that you can
edit
for instance this welcome to level up we
could actually select this to edit or
even this navigation when we hover over
this and when we hover over the header
you'll also see this however you'll see
a dotted line letting you know it's just
the navigation bar itself and when we
hover over the logo itself this gives
you a place to edit this as well now
this is a major improvement as to how
Drupal worked before now you might be
wondering well this is great but I don't
want my users to see these things well
if you come to a non logged in version
you'll see that this is what the site
looks like for everybody else they don't
get the navigation up top here they
don't get all these pencil marks they
basically just see your site so right
out of the box you could throw your logo
up here and just start using Drupal as
is which is a big improvement for how
Drupal used to be so now here you can
see that we have this basic no front
page content has been created and we
have a link to the RSS feed in addition
we have a search bar if we were to
search anything let's just type level
you can see that it's not finding
anything because literally we have no
content really what we have is this home
page and we do have a login link that
allows you to come in to this login page
which has its default stylings username
and password we can create a new count
we can really set your password this
should all seem very familiar
because this is sort of what drupal's
login system is mostly look like before
and if you've never seen Drupal that's
what the login looks like now in
addition a nice change here is we also
have a contact link by default if we
select this contact link down here you
can see it's taking us to a really basic
contact form name email address subject
message now what's great about this is
that we didn't have to do anything and
Drupal has never really been known for
being ready to go out of the box and
maybe it's still not ready to go out of
the box but it's giving you a lot more
tools that you sort of have to do in
every website that way you're not sort
of repeating the same things you're
doing all the time over and over again
cool so there's not a whole ton to see
but this is the front end of Drupal now
that we've created our account this is
everything that you get so in the next
video we're gonna start examining the
backend of Drupal we're gonna start
showing you where the menus are where to
go to do things how to change up content
and then we're gonna dive in more and
more directly into different areas and
components of Drupal itself so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
