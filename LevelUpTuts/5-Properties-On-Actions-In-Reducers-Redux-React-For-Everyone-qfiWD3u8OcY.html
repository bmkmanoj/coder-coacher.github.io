tutorials and in this video we're going
to take our reducers and our actions
just a little bit further and we're
going to explore some of the things that
you can do beyond just sort of what
we've done already we're going to expand
our knowledge so that it makes a little
bit more sense in the context of a store
that you might be using or a state tree
on a website so check it out as we start
to expand our knowledge about reducers
and actions in this video so in the last
video what we did is we had our constant
which is our reducer even though you'll
notice this is just a function right and
we are using our create store with our
reducer now a reducer by name is like
I've mentioned before inherently kind of
a confusing thing simply because what
makes this a reducer like what is the
reason why this is called a reducer and
not just like something that sorts out
your data after an action like why and
the reason really is that it's taking
the previous state and it's merging it
with the current new state and returning
a brand new state object so again all of
the complex stuff in redux comes from
two spots it comes from the fact that an
action is simply just an object and you
have to dispatch it to actually get it
to do anything and to a reducer is not
just modifying the state it's taking the
previous state and merging it with a new
version of the state so those two things
are what creates much of the
complexities and much of the concern
about extra boilerplate code and even
more so when we get into things like
action type constants rather than
strings you'll see a little bit of
boilerplate code that you might feel is
unnecessary and and some of that is
really take what you need and leave what
you don't so let's get into a little bit
more about doing things with actions
here because these typically maybe not
typically sometimes instead of having an
action that does something like simply
just output some new string into an
object it's actually outputting the
results of some sort of data find
whether you're hitting an API or
something like that for instance may
we have an API that's hid and we can
sort of mock this up in a fake version
we can say Const result result result
not with an S is equal to something
coming back from an API okay this is
just a string it could be an array could
be like literally anything right but
what we're doing is we're hitting an API
and we're getting the result here and
now what we can do with this result is
we can actually attach this result into
our store dispatch so here what we're
now doing is we're dispatching an action
and in addition to having the type of
greet me the result will actually be
within the action as well and in that
case inside of our reducer we have
access to that action with action dot
result here
now the word result is not important
this could be anything you'll often see
where it's like payload or data for this
so let's do of our first greet me and
set the value to be action dot result
okay and now action dot result and now
once this refreshes you can see that our
welcome is now set to summing up
something coming back from an API now
this can be really interesting if we
want to change this greet me to greet
something like greet name and instead of
result we're just going to have this be
the name and we can say Scott in here
right so we have a new constant variable
Scott and we're going to dispatch a type
of greet name and the data is just going
to be the name of Scott now this syntax
right here is an equivalent to name is
equal to the name variable okay if you
haven't seen this syntax right here it's
an es6 syntax where instead of having to
say hey name is equal to name you can
just omit that one and say name like
this okay so now we're going to greet a
name and we have our name being passed
in here so we can access that with
action
dot name but we want to set the welcome
text to be with backticks in here I'm
going to use a dollar sign brackets to
do string interpolation here and we can
just say hello
so the welcome text is now going to be
hello and then whatever name we dispatch
so hello Scott you can see right here in
addition if we were to do this exact
same thing let's duplicate this code and
instead of name being equal to name here
we can say name is equal to Courtney
okay
and we can say we'll see when this
refreshes hello Courtney so you can see
here that we have our store that's going
to dispatch in action and while this
action is going to be the same as greet
name Greek name the output is actually
different because we're passing in data
so I mentioned before this is the kind
of thing that we're going to do once we
hit an API and we want to set in
different types of data whether that's a
raise of objects or just an object
itself or even just a boolean either way
you'll often see this as being something
like data or payload and this doesn't
have to be just one thing right we could
have data and a name and the payload you
can attach as much stuff to this
dispatch as you want although it is
probably more common to have only like
one or two things that said there's no
reason necessarily for that
okay so we've learned quite a bit more
about actions and reducers right these
aren't just these things that accept a
property and then have to do some stuff
you can actually have a bit of
interaction with them passing in
properties and things like that and now
we've successfully dispatched several
actions I mean we've dispatched the same
action which is greet name several times
with different properties here but we
have an object state tree over here
that's not super practical but
represents the state of our object which
right now is just a bunch of strings so
in the next video what we're gonna do is
we're actually going to be adding Redux
to a react application and we're gonna
start building a basic
toggle as and we're going to build a
reducer and an action that actually have
purpose that's not just setting a
greeting or something like that and it's
gonna actually output and we're going to
be able to use it with and react and
that's going to set the stage for us
doing more complex things like hitting
an API and working with all sorts of new
and exciting ways of using redux so as
always this is Scott with a loop
