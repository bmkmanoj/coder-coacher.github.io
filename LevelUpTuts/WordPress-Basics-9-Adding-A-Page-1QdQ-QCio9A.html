up tuts and today I'm going to show you
how to create a new page and end it to
this main navigation up top here for
your WordPress site now this is really
basic and easy so let's get into it all
you have to do is click this new and we
can go down here to page or if you're on
the back end of the site you can get
here just by clicking this up top here
your toolbar and then coming down here
to pages add new now here we can add a
new title for our page so this can be
the about Us page and this can be filled
with basically uh let's say a whole
bunch of dummy text here now if we
scroll down to page attributes we see
some things we haven't seen before
it says parent and a template here so
parent is actually where this lies in
the navigation here if it has no parent
it's just going to be a normal level
item just like our sample pages already
and if you don't specify an order it's
just going to put it next to line
because the other one is already order
number zero so if we wanted this one to
be second in line we would say number
one the lower number always rises to the
top and these sort of situations and
there's much more complex menuing
allowed in WordPress which we will get
into later but for right now this is
this basic menu set up for these pages
now we can even have a featured image
like we had before if we want it but
it's okay I don't need one now for
template we're just going to select the
default template there's several other
templates which you can test her out
here and what templates you have
available are based on the theme you're
using so you may be seeing these other
templates if you're using this 2014 the
theme or not so let's go ahead and click
publish
okay page is published let's view our
page and now here's our page it has our
about Us header and as our text and it
has an edit button so we can quickly get
back to edit it keep in mind that your
visitors will not see this button now if
we scroll down here
or we see there's comment sections right
so what happens if we want to not have
comments on our pages right so I mean
how many about us pages do you see that
have a comment section not a ton so
let's go to edit and in the last video
we went over some screen options and
this is how we're going to get rid of
these if you come down here you may have
seen comments is checked here you can
see there is no comments yet
however right next to it is discussion
right here if we check discussion we can
say don't allow comments just by
unchecking this allow comments button
and then updating our page let's come
back to our site let's come to our about
us you'll see no more comments you also
see that because we just navigated to
this from the main menu it added it to
the main menu right by sample page here
now we said about us we set the position
in the navigation to be one so let's
come to sample page and let's come in
here and let's click Edit you'll notice
this one set to zero if we sit this is
something like five or something
anything lower than one when we update
let's go to view our page about us is
now going to be in front of sample page
well this is really nice and easy
we now have a main navigation so if your
site consisted of a blog and a few pages
about you maybe like a contact page or
something like that this would be really
easy to put together you just create a
couple of pages if you go to your home
page you have your blog posts you can
get your recent posts right here so this
basic theme gets you up and running
pretty easily so that's how you create a
page in WordPress we're going to be
going over lots more advanced
configuration for things like this but
for right now it's nice and easy so as
always if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment the
video or hit us up at Twitter LevelUp
