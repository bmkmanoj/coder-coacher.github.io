up tuts and today we're going to be
going over compass so we're going to be
doing is we're going to be adding
compass to the project that we created
in the sass tutorial series thus far and
then we're going to be importing compass
and showing you how to watch the the
directory just like in sass so to get
started now that we already have compass
installed you just want to open up your
terminal and you want to direct yourself
to your folder that your project is
already saved in so we're going to get
ourselves there see here's all what
files so what we're going to do is we're
going to do compass install compass just
like that and as you can see it's
created some things it's created two
directories a sass and a stylesheets
directory as well as a screen print and
ie a CSS file and a print screen and ie
CSS file so if we go to our file
directory and here they are right now
it's telling you to import new style
sheets with the following lines of HTML
these are just these are just paths to
those files that it's created for you so
we'll just go ahead and do that we're
going to put in our HTML document right
up here okay we're not you know we're
not going to be even using them for this
tutorials here but we might as well just
do it sort of get used to what the
workflow is sort of like also we're
going to take our style dot CSS file
that's here and we're going to put this
in the same folder so this is going to
be in style sheets so let's save that
and in here in finder let's just grab
these things out of here we'll take our
2s CSS files and put them in the sass
folder and then we're going to take our
two CSS fold files and put them into our
style sheets folder that way when sass
compiles it will it will find those two
files correctly
and then compiled them into your style
sheets folder so that your HTML document
can then read them so just like in sass
when we told it to watch a file and look
forward when you do for compasses you
actually tell it to watch your whole
project so we're going to back out one
directory here we're just going to CD
Dodd and use my desktop so if we do
compass watch and then the folder that
our project is the folder I have it
saved in it's called sass so compass
watch says alright it's going to give
you some it's going to give you some
sort of things like before compasses
watching check for changes but it also
is giving me some error messages style
that a CSS invalid CSS okay so the
problem here is that it's sort of
getting confused about me using compass
syntax within sass when I made these
mix-ins or so let's go ahead and get rid
of this border-radius
delete that and we'll actually go ahead
and delete this paragraph to see if I
saved this out okay yeah this include
board radius oops okay also doesn't like
line 26 include border radius okay okay
so now no errors this time we've
successfully over in our files but now
if we refresh our index as you can see
some of the things like the border
radius that's what's gone away so to use
compass at the top of your document you
just want to do an ad import that in
quotes compass and then a semicolon and
then we hit save terminal says we're all
good we have imported compass so that is
how you add a compass to your project
that you've already created in the next
tutorial
we're going to show you how to use some
of compasses awesome css3 built-in
nixon's so as always if you have any
questions you know please leave a
comment on the video hit us up at
Twitter at level up huts or just let us
know what you think
once again this is Scott with the
LevelUp tuts and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
