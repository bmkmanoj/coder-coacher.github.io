up tuts and today I'm going to show you
how to install a theme that you've
downloaded from somewhere other than the
themes menu within your WordPress site
so maybe you bought a theme or you just
found it on a free theme site either way
you have a file you have a folder that
is your theme so here I have this goth
full theme I'm not quite sure about the
name but uh basically it's just a folder
and inside of here we have PHP files
JavaScript images and CSS this one even
includes a PSD for the logo of the site
if you want to modify it or something
like that so that's pretty nice it has
all this stuff in it but what do we do
with it so what we need to do is we need
to go to the file directory of our
website now if your sites on a server
somewhere you'll have to get your FTP
information log in and get to the root
of your WordPress site so what you're
seeing looks similar to this here I have
all these WordPress files basically
everything that installed with your site
now what we want to do is move this
Gothel folder or our themes root folder
so basically we have our theme and then
directly inside of it are all these
files we want to move this folder inside
of where our themes are to do that we
need to go into WP - content and then
themes you'll notice we have the
responsible thing that we downloaded in
the last video as well as the 2014 13
and 2012 themes that came with WordPress
when we installed it now if you would
have guessed that we drop this Gothel
folder directly in here then you were
right all we have to do is pick this up
and drop it in here if your site is on a
server of course you'll have to open up
your favorite FTP up mine is transmitted
and I know there's options like
cyberduck that are available free or
other ftp applications and then like I
said you're going to want to browse to
the same directory on your server and
then drop the theme folder directly in
this themes so now that it's there all
we have to do is refresh this appearance
themes page
and you'll see something that has just
been aven't if we have this Gothel theme
right here and we can even do a live
preview or activate it but just let's
just activate it right we downloaded it
we want to check it out let's activate
it so it's been activated now let's come
to the front of our site and reap
refresh and you'll see that we have this
theme and it has the slider already in
here for us it has you know some links
up top here it has our posts and
everything like that and this theme is
pretty intense compared to our other
theme in terms of features and stuff
like that
we come back to our site you'll see that
inside of WordPress here we now have ton
more options you'll notice under Gothel
we have this control panel and we can
access things like the slider the layout
social what sort of weird here is that
we have this second navigation here and
now there's a lot of themes that are
like this that have all their own
options so it's impossible for me to
know exactly all of the stuff in here
but it looks like it's pretty
self-explanatory if you want to be
editing the slider you can modify these
images and stuff like that and like I
said this is NSM themes a smart magazine
theme so I'm sure a lot of the other
smart magazine themes are going to be
having a similar interface regardless of
their features so check it out find
themes install a bunch of themes it's
easy you can just drop them in there you
can always just delete the ones you
don't want in fact let's go ahead and I
want to get rid of this responsive theme
because we're not using it so let's just
come back to our file structure and
let's just throw it in the trash just
like just like you're throwing away
anything or if you're on your server you
could just select and delete it all
right now so now I've deleted that I
refresh it's gone it's like it never
even existed cool so I'm going to go
ahead and activate our 2014 theme back
again and delete Gothel because we're
not going to be using it anymore but
that is how you install a theme manually
into word
press it's too easy so as always if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment a video you can always message
us on Twitter Facebook or there's the
level up Tut's forum which I'll post a
link to in the video description so as
always this is Scott with level of Tut's
and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
