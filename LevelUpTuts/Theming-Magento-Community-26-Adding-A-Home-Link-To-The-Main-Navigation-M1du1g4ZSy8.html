up tuts and today I'm going to be
showing you how to add a home link to
your navigation and this could be useful
because a lot of people like to have
home in their navigation their main nav
here specifically one that is tied to
the actual home of the website so let's
say you move this this is not like a
hard-coded link or anything it's going
to grab the default home link from the
Magento configuration and put it right
here so what we want to do first is we
want to go to a system and then
configuration and we're going to turn on
our template hints to see what template
this file is or this menus being
generated from so make sure your
configuration scope set to main website
scroll down here to developer and now
we're going to turn on a template path
hence yes save and can save this and
let's refresh this page and you'll
notice it's telling us it's in LevelUp
default template page HTML so what's
really cool is that you'll notice that
this is level up and that default
default so that means we've edited this
file before because we've edited that
file before if we come to our theme
right here you should see that this
etched in this folder page HTML top menu
we already have a file here so let's go
ahead and open this up in sublime text
too
so here we are and basically it's just
checking to see if this menu exists and
if it does output a which should just be
a nav tag here looks like I've messed up
the closing tag it's a nav that's
wrapping a UL that we gave a class of
container and then it's out of the UL
it's pimping out just menu and the menu
is just a loop of list items with each
of our links so since we want to add
this link to the very start and not
somewhere in the middle we don't have to
worry about too much of anything other
than having an anchor tag here and
inside of our anchor tag I'm going to
put a PHP tag and what we're going to do
here is we're going to echo and so what
we're going to do here is we're going to
echo
and we're going to say this and then -
greater than and we're going to say get
URL you should be pretty familiar with
this sort of syntax look we used this -
get HTML top-level this is the way that
the Gento is using these methods to get
a URL from somewhere you used to be for
when you're trying to get a attribute of
a product so this is git and then you
the capital u then lowercase RL and
we're going to say home and outside of
this we should be fine here and then
we're finishing it off with a quote
parentheses space and then closing our
PHP tag closing our quote and then in
here we can just type home if you wanted
to have like an image or something in
here you could have this image be here
however our products using I can't find
if I were you at this point because icon
fonts are much nicer so well in many
circumstance so I'm going to wrap this
on a list item keep in mind because
we're inside of a unordered list here
and I'm just going to give this a class
of first and home just in case and now
we're going to come back to our theme
here and I'm going to refresh this you
see we have a home link so let's turn
off our template hence just to see
exactly what this is once we're all done
I'm going to refresh this page now and
we have a link to our home page quote so
we can be anywhere on the site and it's
going to take us to our home page cool
so we have this all working our home
button links up and we can get back to
it from anywhere just from our main
navigation and everything looks awesome
so as always if you have any questions
or comments leave a comment of the video
or hit us up at Twitter LevelUp tuts
let us know what you're thinking we got
some really exciting developments coming
in the future lots of cool stuff we're
working on as always this is just
something we do in our spare time so
we're trying to do it as fast as
possible but we don't know
have time in resources so we're getting
everything out as soon as possible but I
hope you enjoyed this there's going to
be more Magento more everything coming
very soon as always thanks for watching
