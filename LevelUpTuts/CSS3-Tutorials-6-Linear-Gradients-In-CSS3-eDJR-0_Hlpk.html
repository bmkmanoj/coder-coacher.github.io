love-love tuts and today I'm gonna be
talking about CSS gradients and in
particular linear gradients so linear
gradients are going to be supported in
ie10
they're also supported in Firefox
version 3.6 end up using Nima's prefix
chrome for point up using the WebKit
prefix and you'll stuff to use the
WebKit prefix even on Chrome 25 4.0 and
up for Safari using the WebKit prefix
opera 11.1 and up using the o prefix and
same thing for 3.2 with the WebKit for
iOS and 2.1 so I would take this as
another progressive enhancement sort of
thing you can add a gradient it might
look nicer for your clients or your
people on your site with a newer browser
and it will still look fine for people
without it it's just not going to have a
gradient so let's get into CSS gradients
and one thing that's interesting about
CSS gradients is the is that it might
not be exactly how you expect it to be
declared let's go to our wrapper and
we're going to add this as a gradient
going from white to gray on our
background that's white so we're going
to leave this background in here and in
fact we'll just have this be a
background - color white this way if the
browser does not support CSS gradients
it's not it's just going to get a white
background we don't have to worry about
it it's gonna fall back to that so let's
start this off and we're going to do
background and then - image so you might
wonder why it's image it's just I don't
know the the specifics it's just
background - image and now we're going
to do things a little bit differently
than we've seen before and we're gonna
start off with WebKit just so you can
see how it looks and we're gonna replace
the vendor prefix with other vendor
prefixes for our other browsers so
WebKit - linear - gradient and then
we're gonna do parentheses and that's
out of our parentheses we're going to
say top because this is it's going to
start at the top and go to the bottom so
it's always going to start top left go
to bottom right
so just as a straight vertical gradient
if we wanted this to be right to left or
left to right we could do something
different will show you in a second
however we're gonna say top and we're
going to now do a comma and the color
that we want at the top so that's going
to be white comma and now we're gonna
want the color that we eat gradient two
we're gonna have this be a dark gray
three three three and now I'm gonna save
this because I'm using a newer version
of Chrome this particular line is
supported from versions chrome ten and
up I don't have to worry about anything
else and we'll save this just so you can
see what that looks like and then we'll
fill out the rest of our vendor prefixes
let's go back to Chrome here and refresh
you can now see over the course of our
div it is great in ting down to three
three three cool but what if you wanted
to be horizontal if you didn't want it
to be vertical well we could say left
save and now let's come to refresh and
now the white is starting at the left
and it's going to the right you can do
this a little bit more explicitly but
for right now we're just going to do
this in fact I'm going to do another
lesson on gradients we'll rego over a
little bit more advanced applications of
gradients because there's all sorts of
interesting things you can do with them
however that's out of the scope of one
video so now that we have our gradient
going here let's actually take it back
to top and bottom top Tom and now we're
going to add the rest of our vendor
prefixes okay I've grabbed this code
here from a site called css3 please calm
this is what the site looks like it
gives you the vendor prefixes in the
code here so you can actually come in
here and type out FFF to whatever we
want we have three three three and you
can see it the preview up in the top
right this has all sorts of vendor
prefixes and all sorts of CSS properties
it'll make your life a little bit easier
also if you get into sass encompass
there's ways of doing that in sass
encompass that are also much
then having all of these vendor prefixes
right here I would always recommend
supporting as many browsers as you can
with this and degrade gracefully
for the ones that don't support it so
let's save this and as you'll see going
back to our CSS refresh it it's still
here Chrome can go through and you'll
notice on the left here and it will are
on the right here it's going to see all
of the ones it's gonna check off the
ones it doesn't support and then the
farthest one down that it does support
it's going to use so this is how you use
gradients in CSS it's really nice and
easy there's nothing nothing to it it's
just maybe a little bit different I
would recommend checking out css3 please
calm to grab this code to copy and paste
in here and we'll be using it on many of
these other tutorials in the future I
just wanted to make sure you understood
a little about css3 before introducing
the site itself
I'll make the link available in the
description of the video below ok so as
always this is Scott with love-love
Tut's if you have any questions leave a
comment on the video below just up at
Twitter our level of Tut's we're gonna
be getting into some really cool CSS
stuff I'll show you how to do more
interesting gradients than just a
standard gradient but for right now you
have all sorts of tools that you need to
get working with css3 you you've got
background gradients text shadow box
shadow border box and bot border radius
there's a lot of it that's a lot of
stuff to get started with once again
this is Scott with level up Tut's and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
