up tutorials in this video I want to
show you a great way to take your
command line shell to the next level
using fish shell now I've shown you Z
shell and oh my z SH in the past now
fish shell is very similar but actually
has a bunch of really really awesome
features that really help me in my
day-to-day so let's check out this shell
right now so in another video we showed
you z SH and oh my z SH no fish shell
and oh my fish is just another type of
shell and oh my fish is sort of a
framework for fish shell the same way
that oh my z SH s4z show now let's go
ahead and install a fish shell really
quickly you can see that there's a lot
of really nice ways to install it in
fact on OS X there's really just this
installer here so that's super nice we
can install it just via this package
here and it gives you this line that
says copy and paste this essentially
into your terminal and run this for this
to be your default shell so if you're
looking to make fish your default shell
you can go ahead and do that now I've
been using fish as my default shell for
a little bit now and all of my
professional work and I'm really really
super liking it so let's head to I term
though and I term I'm just gonna paste
this in here this is essentially just
going to turn the fish executable into
our main shell so it's asked me to
change my password and now Wilpon
opening up a new terminal window you'll
see it's quite a bit different so what
we were using before was oh my z SH and
zs + z shell here and in this tab you
can see that it's all of a sudden using
fish so there's some really nice things
about fish but before we get going and
showing you some of those things let's
go ahead and install Oh my fish because
it's really just nice to have know my
fish allows for some great themes and
packages the same way that oh my zsh
does so let's go
ahead and install it just simply with
this curl command now as you can see
we've successfully installed on my fish
in two steps now if you type OMF help
OMF help you can see it gives you a
little bit of help commands and tells
you just you know how to change themes
and how to install packages and things
of that nature now I've found the best
way to sort of browse these is via this
Oh Oh my fish github repository where
you can grab a whole bunch of different
plugins and themes and this way you can
actually see what the themes look like
now the themes can be pretty complex and
have a whole bunch of different color
and icons and stuff like that and
there's some I found that I really
really like now if we come back to why
you want to use fish so now there's a
lot of really great things like the
scripting language web-based
configuration even just the color how
easy it is to install but really my
personal favorite thing is the auto
suggestions it's seems sort of
ridiculous but that to me is a killer
feature so so let's say I'm in my
personal directory here and I want to go
to my sites folder I can type in CD
sites and as you can see it gives me
this auto-completion that's very visual
it's like grayed out and I can simply
just hit the over to the right key and
that's going to finish this
auto-completion then I can just simply
type something like L for level up hit
over and as you can see it's not like a
command that I've even typed before this
isn't a history thing this is just
straight auto completion and it really
makes your life a little bit better if
you're working in command line a lot so
I mean that's like I said that's a very
very small feature but one I just
happened to find to be extremely useful
now they also have this web-based
configuration so I can come in and
simply say fish underscore config and
what that does is it actually opens up a
window
in your browser that allows you to
customize some things on here now
because we're using all my fish I'm not
quite sure if this theme that changing
is actually going to do anything but as
you can see it just does give you a nice
little visual interface for using your
fish it even has a visual history of
things that you've typed right and
including key bindings here you can
change those abbreviations and stuff
like that so this is a a nice visual
editor that you'd really just don't get
out of the box with anything else so we
now have a fish and oh my fish installed
it's now our default command line shell
and we're ready to start getting into
customizing a little bit with themes and
packages so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments so to come in the
video editors up at twitter our facebook
at level up tutorials we love to hear
from you thanks for watching and we'll
see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
