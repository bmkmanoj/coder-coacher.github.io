tuts and today we're here
web fonts in the next couple of videos
we're just going to go through some
various methods of adding new fonts to
your websites or web applications
whatever you're working on and so for a
long time you've only been able to use a
select few fonts right it's only been
pretty much like Arial Georgia that sort
of thing
and it could be very frustrating to get
some you know different looks and
different design so people turn to
images and things like that and then
there were some flash replacement
techniques but luckily in CSS 3 we have
font face which allows us to really do
some cool stuff and not only can we use
font services but we can actually host
our own fonts if we want so in the first
video this one right here we're going to
be using a Google web font and I'm going
to show you how easy it is to get set up
with Google web fonts and it's really a
great thing and then in the next video
we're going to talk about using your own
font from something like font squirrel
so let's go to google fonts you can go
to google.com slash fonts and they offer
a wide range of fonts and it's pretty
fantastic service here that they offer
and you know they range from like super
cheesy to really nice-looking usable
fonts I mean them they're all usable in
some context but I mean you know
everyday sort of fonts so let's try
something and we're gonna pick something
that's maybe a little bit obvious right
so we're gonna pick this geo and so you
can see you can do a couple of things
with this fun right if we click add to
collection it's just going to add it to
our collection where we can add a bunch
of fonts at once and then use them later
or we can do other things right so by
clicking on this middle button right
here it's going to take us to their page
and you can see we can just use the
normal or the normal and the italic and
400 is the weight and notice it says
here's your impact on page load time the
more you add a little bit more of a page
reload time you're gonna add because
it's gonna be loading these fonts so
there's
a couple of different ways we can add
this font in order to just be going over
the standard method however you can use
import in your CSS or you can use this
JavaScript method but really it's easy
just to use this bit of code that you
want to throw into your HTML and then
anytime you want to use the font it's as
simple as just calling this font family
geo in quotes and then sans-serif so
let's check this out so first thing I
want to do is come to my index and
inside of my head I'm just going to
paste this little bit here there we go
so what this is going to do is it's
going to link up the style sheet from
fonts google api is calm and it's
passing you know what particular font it
is and then it loads that and serves the
font directly from Google's servers so
let's actually turn something into this
geo font here so we had this hello that
was Helvetica before and now we're gonna
turn it into geo just simply by pasting
in this font family geo in quotes and
then a sans-serif as a fallback and now
if we come to our page here and refresh
you'll see we are using this super cool
new font it's totally different than
anything else that we've used and it
looks you know futuristic and cool
whatever actually and before this next
video and clean up some of the stuff I'm
gonna get rid of this spin here and I'm
gonna get rid of this main of this this
left column thing here and refresh here
just to clean some of this up maybe cool
and so now our page is just a little bit
I don't know I suppose more clean for
right now in fact actually let's change
this level up tuts to be this cool font
and I'm just gonna paste this font
family on this h1 and I think it's gonna
be for logo text extra I'll just throw
it right here and then um then I go
ahead and add a hundred padding to the
left
and say padding-left
Wow typing left and then this is gonna
be 150 pixels and turn off this text
indent so we should see little Hut's
cool and I'll get rid of this width
right here color white
text-decoration:none cool so this isn't
actually the level up that's fun but it
looks a little bit better than what we
had here before so pretty cool we're
using this new font with Google web
fonts in the next video we're going to
show you how to do a similar technique
but you're going to be hosting the font
on your own server and we're going to be
using something called font squirrel so
as always if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video hit
us up at Twitter and level up tuts
around Facebook or whatever else know
what you're thinking and thanks for
watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
