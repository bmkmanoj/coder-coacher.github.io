up Tut's and today I'm going to be
showing you how to extend
oh my Xia sage past what we did in the
last video so in the last video if you
recall we installed oh my Z SH and here
we are right we have some great features
in it things like we don't have to have
proper capitalization uh for okay for us
to a to it fer to autocomplete so let's
say we wanted to change directories into
My Documents so if we type LS you can
see documents is capital D right if you
were to type in bash CD do C lowercase
and try to hit tab it wouldn't
autocomplete but luckily we have the
ability using in fact I hit tab like a
thousand times they're using oh my zsh
we can type CD any lower any case of d
and hit tab and it you'll see it's going
to autocomplete it for us and because we
have a couple of these but there we go
and that's just the tip of the iceberg
right for instance you know that if you
hit up in command line you can see the
less commands you ran whatever but let's
say you're searching for specific
command I'm searching for the last sudo
command I ran so I can type s and then
hit up and looks like I haven't ran any
recently maybe the last time I ran LS or
I guess I was less command let's say the
last time I ran CD I could type C and
then hit up and it's going to find the
last time I change directory so the
history with oh my zsh zsh is just
excellent the code completions excellent
but what happens if we want to take it
further this is just the base theme that
we have and themes in oh my zsh can do a
whole lot
not to mention plugins so let's get
working changing some plugins or adding
some plugins and changing some themes
now it's super easy all we need to do is
edit a file now that file is in your
user directory and that file is dot zsh
our
now if we take this and we can open any
text editor or you can open it in vim or
whatever and I'm just going to make this
up here you can see this is your oh my
zsh configuration actually this is your
zsh configuration but because we're
using oh my zsh this is where that
information is going to go now you'll
see this line here we have a theme and
it's just a string and it says if you
set it to random it's going to load a
new theme every single time you load
oh my zsh so let's even try that I'm
gonna paste this in here random I'm
going to save it now I'm going to make a
new tab you could see it's a new theme
new tab another theme new tab another
theme so this is a cool way to try them
out and the best part is up top here it
says what theme it's loading so that way
if you like theme you can keep it now oh
my zsh themes are not just color schemes
if you look at the previous tab that we
had open let's go to this one there's
all sorts of crazy information here now
this is not only telling us the time we
made our our our command but the date
and that's my computer here a nest
olenski blah blah blah it's got a whole
lot of information and a lot of these
will tell you what branch you're on in
your github repository I'll tell you
like what Ruby version you're using it's
just based on the theme itself now I'm
not going to go over in this video how
to write your own themes but there's
plenty of documented occu mentation on
how to do that and specifically I would
say just find a theme you like and check
out it's a theme file and you can sort
of piece together how to make one for
yourself now what happens if you want a
theme but you don't want to just set
this to random and see what these all
look like well on the github page let's
pull that up you can see that all of the
themes that come with oh my zsh are
right here and now so if you look
through these and find one you like I
personally like this one this Milo sheds
ik and I'm going to copy this and paste
this in here save this
now let's make a new tab and you can see
this uh theme right here is pretty basic
but it's great because it will tell you
a lot of things about like your github
repo that you're currently working in
cool so that's how you change and add
the themes come to the github repo and
check out what themes look good okay so
what about plugins right
what do plugins do well plugins can help
you with auto completion and they can
just really make your time easier in in
using oh my Xia sage here if you use
these certain technologies it says which
plugins would you like to load plugins
can be found at the oh my zsh folder
slash plugins and you can make custom
plugins and put them in this custom
plugins so it tells you here that all
you need to do to add a plug-in is to
put it in between a space inside of
these parentheses right now the get
plug-in is the only one loaded we can
come in to our finder and you'll see
there's this hidden folder this oh my
CSH folder if we open this up we can
then look into plugins and see there's a
whole bunch of plugins in here now I use
things like homebrew so I could add brew
there's a bower plugin and you can see
there's other plugins like Django and uh
hi there's tons and tons and tons of
plugins here OSX so you can add a whole
bunch of cool stuff in here so for me I
use things like node a lot or I believe
there's a Mongo maybe not now looks like
there's just a node and NPM but I can
add those really easily just by adding
them here and we can say node and p.m.
and this will help with using those
situations so OH MY zsh is going to
become aware of NPM and it's not just
going to be a command that you run so
this is really great I can save this now
let's go ahead and make a new tab to
reload oh my zsh and now I don't have
node installed on this computer yet so I
can't show you
what the node plugin is actually doing
but I'll show you the get plugin I'm
going to type git and then hit tab and
it's asking do I want to see some
possibilities sure but it's going to not
only tell you um you know it's not only
going to autocomplete directories and
files you can see that the options that
it's giving me our actual git commands
so like get add so for instance if I
were to type get a and then hit tab it's
going to show me the git commands that I
can run get ad aim am i should say apply
our key import archive so this is pretty
sweet um I don't know like you know if
you're looking up a command I'm sure you
could just type git and get the help you
know but being able to have this
resource to have autocomplete to be
aware of whatever technology you're
using is pretty awesome
so paw through this plugins directory or
you can even just look on the repo
either way
add some plugins just essentially throw
in everything that you use and then
sooner or later you're going to be in a
situation when oh my zsh is gonna do
something for you and you're going to
just be totally impressed and happy that
you set this up so as always this is
Scott with level up tuts if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video or hit us up at level up tuts
on twitter facebook pretty much anywhere
check out these oh my zsh plugins and
themes trust me you won't regret it so
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
