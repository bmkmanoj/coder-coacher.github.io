up tuts and today I'm be showing you two
quick tips for compass one of which is a
best practice what you're gonna want to
with your compass files is you're always
gonna want to keep your base CSS or your
base SAS such as your mix in your
variables in just your import compass
statement stuff like that that you're
going to use on all of your documents
that way if you have more than one as
CSS file they can just all include this
base file and then you don't have to you
know recall mix-ins or read eclair
variables so what I'm going to do first
is I'm just gonna create a new file here
we're gonna do new file and we're going
to save it as ok and my SAS folder we're
gonna save this as underscore base dot
at CSS okay and then in this file we're
going to grab all of these import
compass all that stuff and we're gonna
throw it right here okay and if we were
using any mix since we throw them in
here too but since we got rid of those
after the SAS tutorials I actually don't
have any in this document right now
however you know that doesn't mean that
you shouldn't be writing your own mix
ins with compass we just haven't done an
example yet so in this we're going to
just say at import and we're gonna say
quotes and then base that's it save that
out okay we refresh you'll notice
nothing has changed which is great
because we just got rid of all of our
all of our our variables all of our
declarations there so it's grabbing
those variables no problem out of this
base so you're gonna make sure you have
this underscore in your title and I mean
base is the standard you can pretty much
name it whatever you want but I'd
probably recommend just using base and
then you know you can name your as CSS
whatever you want of course in their
documentation they have it as
application as CSS but you know like he
BMI stuff
Sheetz a style just that's what I'm used
to
okay so one more thing let's say we want
these these social icons to be in this
list here whatever there's actually a
shortcut way you can do that so if I
just get rid of some of this stuff we'll
make it into a serious okay so it's now
a vertical list okay yeah I got rid of
it display:block let me just make sure
that actually we're gonna leave that
display:block on these links okay so I'm
the UL itself we're going to give it and
include we're gonna say include I'm
sorry we're going to do rackets and then
we're gonna do include and then the
horizontal - list and then semicolon
we're gonna say this okay and here are
our links is a horizontal list even
though I've taken off the float as you
can see what this is going to be doing
scroll down here to our social links it
adds this overflow:hidden it adds border
of zero padding arjen zero and then for
the li it's going to be getting a
display inline white-space:nowrap so
it's pretty cool it's an easy way to
take a a list and just make it
horizontal so you don't have to just do
that CSS yourself it's just one more
little uh you know shortcut that compass
and SAS allow to you okay well that's it
for this lesson
