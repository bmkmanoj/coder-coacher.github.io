up tutorials and in this video I want to
be talking about events and methods
within view now we're going to be using
an event to trigger a method and to
actually start to get a little bit more
interactive with our code here so let's
get going on that right now okay so in
the last video we talked a little bit
about directives and sort of what that
means and if you see something with a V
- that means it's a directive basically
it allows us to interact with our HTML
and the V - lets view know that
something is up right that it lets a
know that that needs to do something so
in this video we're gonna be talking
about this last directive that we
mentioned very briefly in the last video
which was on click now I'm gonna go
ahead and delete this one you could see
we have a V - on colon that click and
now on click this is going to do
something now if we wanted this to
actually modify the data properties such
as is true we can actually do that in
here as a string in a JavaScript
expression which sounds sort of weird so
first thing we're going to do is do
exactly that we're going to say is it
true is equal to exclamation point is
true and you're gonna see our first
little bit of dynamic code working here
when we're doing an on click of this
button it's going to evaluate this
statement setting is true to the
opposite of the current is true we
should be able to see the hello world
come and go here as we press our button
press it and hello world either shows up
or it doesn't so this is some of the
cool things we can do with Hum click
here and there's all sorts of other
different on properties now with the on
we have access to all different types of
JavaScript events from things like click
to submit to key up all that kind of
stuff that you'd be used to a normal
JavaScript so you can see if this
onclick is going to evaluate this
statement however this isn't primarily
how you're going to be doing this kind
of thing we're primarily going to
actually be using this kind of
inside of a method right when we do
something like an interaction maybe we
want a function somewhere or a method
somewhere that can handle what it's
supposed to be doing for us now this is
an extremely simple statement so
obviously throwing this in here to show
and hide this well it's fine but it
might clutter up your code before you
know it so one of the things we can do
is break this out into a method onto our
view instance so we can come in here to
our data just below our data and have a
new comma and this is going to be our
very first method something now we're
going to be using quite a bit so we
could say methods and the method is
going to be a colon and then another
object inside of this object is going to
be a property of the name of our method
so we're going to say toggle is true is
the name of the method now we're going
to have a colon and then we're going to
have the word function now we need the
word function here instead of doing an
arrow function so that view correctly
uses this if you don't have the
difference between a function and an
arrow function and how it handles this
you might want to do some research about
that and this we're basically saying hey
we want to refer to this view instance
itself so therefore this is going to be
talking about this particular one if we
use an arrow function that will break
that functionality now one of the things
we can do here is actually have access
to the data that we have inside of our
component for instance we have is true
and hello now we want to access the data
using the this keyword so to do that we
just say this that is true and we can
assign or modify this variable directly
in here for instance we can say this is
true is equal to exclamation point this
is true and you might be saying hey this
is more work than this and that's very
true but this method can be reused it's
obviously more code it's going to take
some of this code out of your template
here and it's going to make things a
little bit more organized
not to mention methods can be quite a
bit more complex than simply just
toggling a value
so now instead of saying is true is
equal to is true in here we can actually
give rid of this whole thing in our
unclick and actually just type in the
name of our method itself which is
toggle is true and we should see the
exact same thing happening that we did
when we had the expression directly
inside of our unclick actually you know
what I'm going to leave this one in the
code here and I'm going to paste this in
here I'm going to comment this one out
and I'm going to have our toggle is true
in here just so you could have both of
these in the code examples okay so we
have toggle is true now when I press
this you can see the exact same thing
happens hello world is showing and
hiding so what we've learned here is
that well to access things inside of our
view instance or in our component it's
not just the data that we have access to
we also have access to things inside of
methods for instance toggle is true did
not have to be defined in any sort of
methods dot toggle is true if you just
sort of new toggle is true is this
method right here now again we need to
use a function here because we need to
access the correct version of this now
this that is true is directly
referencing this data is true now we can
again set and modify this property by
saying this is true is equal to the
opposite of what it currently is okay
and so this is your basic first method
if we wanted to add in more methods you
would simply have a comma method name
function and we could even have events
passed in here this is something that
we're going to go over quite a bit more
but you could have as many methods as
you want it in your component and these
things can do all sorts of stuff from
hitting an API to computing specific
properties it can do all sorts of stuff
and now we don't actually just have to
use methods inside of event handlers
right like an on-click like let's come
up top here where we have our hello we
can have this now be method name right
let's actually output the results of
method name and this method is simply
just going to return a string that says
from the method Oh
and check this out we are getting a
function output in our code what
happening is here is this method name is
actually referring to the method and
it's going to output well not what we
want but that doesn't mean that all hope
is lost here because we can still do
this exact same thing we simply just
need to have parentheses at the end of
this method name to run this like a
function so we're going to say hey
method name and now we can say hello
world from the method okay and again
from the method is coming directly from
this method and this is just whatever
this thing is returning again remember
so far everything inside of here is just
an object we have our element where it's
attaching we have our data that is
coming in here and we have our now
methods which allows us to have some
functionality inside of our code now
again there's more things that we can
add inside of this object that we're
gonna go over as we go but this should
give you a basic idea of what's what in
view you've gotten a little bit of the
templating language here we've gotten
some directives some directives with
arguments and we have done some
interaction now so the last thing I want
to do before we move on to the view CLI
is handle some input and some data with
something called view model okay and
this is going to be sort of the angular
1 famous two-way data-binding example
we're gonna show you how nice and easy
it is to handle user input and assign
that to some data so as always this is
