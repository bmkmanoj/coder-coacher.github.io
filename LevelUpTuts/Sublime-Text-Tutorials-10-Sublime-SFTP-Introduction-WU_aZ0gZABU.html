of Tut's and today I'm going to be
getting about sublime SFTP so you need
to get sublime MSF
if you want to be using FTP directly in
sublime text it's really cool it's nice
and easy and there's a really awesome
sink folder function that if you're
managing files on your server and
editing them then this is going to be
the way to do it in fact it's it's part
of my workflow when I'm editing files on
the server itself what you need to do is
command shift P and a Mac and go to
package control install packages and
search for sublime s FTB and I actually
have it already installed in fact if we
go to my package manager and list
packages we'll see SFTP right here so
you can see that it's name and the you
know it's from w barnett / sublime
packages / SFTP so that's the one and
after you have that installed keep in
mind that this is actually a paid plugin
and you can use it just like sublime
without paying but they're going to bug
you with messages saying to pay I've
gone ahead and purchased excite every
day in fact if it comes up with a
message saying I haven't then that's
probably because I haven't put the
license in this particular computer yet
but if you do command shift P and you
bring up your menu here and we start to
type SFTP you'll see that there's some
commands here we can do all sorts of
stuff so we're going to actually just
set up a server so let's browse to a
server first and it's going to ask to
add a new server if you've already added
servers they'll appear here you can
click on them and you'll just log in
just like that but if we need to add one
let's click add a new server and you'll
notice it's coming up with this the
stock Yuman here and I'm going to go
ahead and put in my server information
and I'm going to leave it as SFTP sink
down on open true and there's not
anything else I'm going to do with this
however I'm going to add uncomment this
line right here that says password and
put in my user name put in my password
and put in my host and then I'm going to
go ahead and save this so I'm going to
do that but because I don't want you
having my SFTP password I'm going to go
ahead and do that off-screen and I don't
have a path to go to so I'm just going
to
leave that like that and I'm going to
save this as Scott and this is just my
site saves the nearest FTP servers
folder and I'm going to go ahead and add
this password okay and one more thing
actually had to have the FTP settings to
FTP not SFTP for this particular login
but that's just for this login so if
you're getting a message saying it's not
working try FTP try SFTP I mean it
should work the same as your normal FTP
client so I have my server in here now
now I can type in SFTP browse server and
now we can click Scott and it might come
up with a little message down here it
might immediately just log elin and
here's a list of all the folders in the
server path that I'm on so here's all a
whole bunch of stuff I got and if I just
go to HTTP Docs and let's go to this is
a Drupal site by the way sites all
themes and I'm going to find a
particular file I want to edit this is
maybe just a CSS folder and it's going
to ask me what I want to do I want to
edit it here it opens it up directly
here and now notice when I save it
there's a message that comes up down
here saying it's uploading this file
back to my server so anytime I have a
file I pull down we'd say SFTP browse
server and I can its notice how it
leaves me off in the place I was just at
I can open any of these files edit them
throw them right back up when I click
Save so that's cool that's sublime SFTP
in the next video I'm going to show you
how to set up a sync folder and at the
wonders of that so as always if you have
any questions in the comment the video
or hit us up at Twitter level of Tut's
we're on Facebook we're all over the
place so as always this is Scott and
thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
