up Tut's and today I'm going to be
talking to you about one of my favorite
apps on OSX called Alfred now Alfred is
an app that you might see a lot of
people use because it's super helpful
and what it does is it sort of replaces
the behavior that spotlight was trying
to do but in my opinion doesn't do super
well
in addition adds a bunch of extra
features so Alfred can be downloaded and
used for free and you can there's a paid
version of it it's at Alfred app.com you
can buy the power pack which gives you
access to some workflow uh things that
are actually really excellent so if you
find yourself using Alfred everyday I
would purchase the power pack to get
access to those additional features but
basically what it is is it sort of a
file launcher it's a file launcher and
app launcher that can be extended to do
all sorts of stuff so if you've used
Quicksilver in the past or uh or
spotlight you you know you could benefit
from using Alfred now I have my alfred
set up to work with the command command
space because that's the command that
spotlight was using before and command
space feels totally natural at any given
point you can hit command space and this
little window pops up now let's say i
want to launch sublime text all i have
to do is hit s and you can see the apps
that I've opened most starting with s
system preferences goes to the top and
ScreenFlow sketch whatever but if I tell
you sublime text is the first one so I'm
gonna hit escape but it's so quick to
open up an app instead of having to move
your mouse down find it and click you
can do your command s you enter and then
it's open so you can switch between apps
that are already open that way just like
that
but of course you can open apps that
aren't already open so if I wanted to
open sketch
it's going to open that now and you can
see that it is open although I think
it's it opened up in my second monitor
but you can see that it's it exists and
it's open
there it is cool so Alfred is really
great for that but it can also do other
things you can also search the internet
right you can search the web with it
like they show you here you can type
things and like if I wanted to say
YouTube level up Tut's it's going to
search YouTube for level up huts and it
wonderfully lists all my videos here
thanks to YouTube's excellent search
functionality but likewise like they
show in the example here you could do
something like maps and you can also use
and create workflows which is I believe
a powerpack functionality only and what
workflows allow you to do is essentially
write your own commands now let's say I
wanted to have I have several places
where I store analytics for YouTube and
level up tuts right let's say I want to
open every single level up touch related
site that I like to look at because I
freak frequently have all these things
open I could write my own workflow so
that when I did LUT of course I haven't
set this up on my new computer yet but
when I could say LUT and hit enter it's
going to open up like five or six tabs
now those are really easy to set up but
I find this to just be excellent now I'm
not going to go over all the features
here you can use it with things like
1password itunes recent documents you
can have it set up to be like giant if
you'd like you can search for individual
files you can use quick look inside of
it
you can use it as a calculator like I
mean it's just really the most handy
useful app in my toolkit and I cannot
get around without it and it just opens
up that easily so I'm going to show you
really quick if I just do Alfred I can
the Elford preferences and you can see
here I have my hotkey setup you can make
your own hotkey whatever you'd like so
you have a hotkey in specific in mind
that you may be used in the past go
right ahead
obviously there is tons and tons and
tons of features to tweak here workflows
you can easily just click and build one
let's actually build a workflow really
quickly with a blank one I can just say
test ok that's all you need but so let's
add an input and the input will be the
key word will be LUT LUT for level of
Tut's we can save this you can add
arguments and stuff and the actions
let's just say open up a URL and this
URL is going to be level up Tut's calm
it's once the HTTP HTTP ok and you can
even choose what browser right so that's
it's pretty excellent and now all you
need to do is connect this to this and I
have a workflow if I hit LUT hit enter
now I just realized I forgot to uncheck
the argument required so I can just say
no argument and give this a title that
says open level up ok now when I save
this and then I type LUT I get this nice
little thing that says open up level or
open level up I can hit enter
and sure enough it throws up the level
of HUD site in a new tab so Alfred is
pretty darn sweet and not to mention you
can even make it look like however you
want you can even see it on different
types of backgrounds but yeah you can
change the appearance you can download
themes you can make your own themes I
was using one called Space Gray which is
actually the same color scheme that I
use for my sublime text usually so you
can have a nice things all matching you
can even position it where you'd like
you can hide things show things whatever
and or you could have this giant version
so like I said you can buy the power
pack to get some additional
functionality but there's just all sorts
of great things in here so if you're not
using Alfred and you're on OSX check it
out it's one of my absolute favorite
apps I promised tutorials are returning
soon
I accidentally somehow destroyed all of
my databases upon building my new
computer and starting with a fresh
version of OS X so I'm having to rebuild
a lot of stuff before I can continue
with some of the series I was doing but
I promise I know Drupal commerce videos
and WordPress videos are coming up as
absolute soon as I can rebuild those
sites so keep watching and in the
meantime enjoy some of these level up
tips thanks for watching and I'll see
you in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
