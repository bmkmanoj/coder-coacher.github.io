up tubs and today we're going to go back
to actual coding here because in the
last couple months we talked about the
Shiv and then we talked about html5
boilerplate so we haven't actually been
getting into that much code yet so we're
going to change that right now and I'm
going to talk about page structure and
we're going to code the basic page
structure of a blog and we're not going
to style this or anything but we're just
going to dive in to some HTML elements
and how we might use them so first
things first I'm gonna get rid of this
welcome to html5 boilerplate I'm going
to add a header here and this header is
just going to contain just maybe an h1
or something so we'll have a header and
it has an h1 that says our HTML html5
site okay
and that's all really the header is
going to contain it actually might
contain a nav as well and that nav will
have list and that's going to have an
anchor okay
nav item number one cool so we have our
header with our h1 and our nav so this
is nothing crazy new we haven't really
talked about the nav tag but the math
tech really sort of wraps what's going
to be considered like a navigation
element of your site and keep in mind
it's not every single menu or anything
like that gets the nav tag we'll go over
them more I just want to have this in
here so we have a basic site layout and
so for the main section of our website
work should be using a new tag called
main and it's so new that my code
completer doesn't even recognize it so
this is just main it's actually been a
sort of controversial not examle
controversial or anything but it's just
basically an element for your main
content and then we're going to have our
footer
and nothing in any of the stuff yet
we'll just leave it like this
but where we want to put our blog is
actually within this main area so main
really is just sort of like section but
it denotes your main content right so
it's just a display block there's
nothing crazy other than that so we have
a blog post right so what is a blog post
well there is a new html5 element called
article an article is the perfect
element for this blog post because what
it does is it represents a component of
a page that consists of self-contained a
composition in a document is what the
spec says so basically it's perfect for
a blog post it's made for a blog post
essentially reusable distributable just
basically content that is in self at UNK
of content so a blog post would be an
article just the way you think of an
article in newspaper to be an article so
we're going to create a new tag here and
it's just going to be article and let's
talk about what we can do inside of this
we mentioned before that the header tag
is not only for the header of our
website the header of our content so if
you know a blog post usually has a
heading or some punk bed so we suppose
you could just have an H h3 or something
for here but really I think what's more
appropriate is to use an actual header
tag so here we can say header and then
side of our header we're not only going
to want to contain an h2 this is our
blog post title we can also put in a
paragraph and this can just be time meta
data or something you know in like blog
posts you typically see like a time or
something after the post title so we
have our header and the next we'd want
our actual blog post so let me grab some
hipster up some or something
and throw it in here is our blog content
so this is our paragraph of blog content
and now we also actually want a footer
in here because a footer can also be not
only the footer of your page but the
footer of something like this like an
article so inside of our footer we can
contain let's say another paragraph that
has metadata okay so this is our blog
post notice how we have an article which
is containing this entire blog post a
header which signifies that this is the
heading information for this article and
the footer is where we'd expect footer
content to be for this article so let's
save this out and see how it looks just
with default styling and everything on a
page it shouldn't be surprising because
it's actually going to look the same as
if every single one of these work divs
but the cool thing is is that they're
not divs and when your browser looks at
this it doesn't just see divs it sees
actual meaning so what it sees is that
this is an article and it's out of here
is the important header information and
there's the content in the footer so
that's a lot more meaningful to a
browser than just div div div div div
because it doesn't really mean anything
so here it is I've opened it up here and
we have our first blog post and this is
an html5 page using some great new
elements and it is working great so now
that you have a little bit more
knowledge about how you can use header
and footer a little bit differently you
know you can experiment using these tags
however I would really suggest you know
reading over some of the specs stuff and
getting a full idea because these tags
are to have semantic meaning now and
there's right and wrong ways to use them
so here is your HTML 5 page blog post in
fact if we want to copy this whole thing
right here oops if we want to just copy
this entire article right here paste it
below I got a second blog post
and cool perfect so as always if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment of the video below heads up to
Twitter and level up this note you're
thinking we always love to hear from you
as always this is Scott with love love
Tut's and thanks for watching
