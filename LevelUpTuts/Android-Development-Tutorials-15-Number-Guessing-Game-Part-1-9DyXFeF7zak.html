it's pulling names from this list but
what happens if we wanted to set this
text to not be my names but we want it
to be
Rando itself and so you might think this
is pretty easy all right all we just
have to do is change your variable we're
setting text to R and oh no and let's
run our app and so this is all going it
looks like it's booted up let's move
over to our app and let's press the
button and our app is stopped you may be
wondering what the heck lies lies our
app stopping all I did was put Rando in
here well set text only accepts a string
so when we're trying to set the text
with this integer like Rando it's going
to be completely confused so how do we
get past this well what we need to do we
need to make a new variable and this is
just going to be random and R and num is
going to be equal to and then now we're
going to be using the integer object and
we're going to be calling the to string
method and we can see that the string to
string right here is Method and it's
code completing it for us and inside of
here for the arguments we're going to be
passing at random and it's giving me
this because we haven't declared random
anywhere so a way before here I'm just
going to do string Rand numb and we're
going to set it equal to nothing and
then we're going to have a semicolon and
perfect we have random in here now we're
assigning random equal to this integer
to string method on rando so now we just
need to change this to be Rand numb and
now we have well let's change this word
from Rand numb to Rand text
because I don't know Rand numb sort of
sounds like random and it's all just
confusing you might just want to have
everything being really crystal clear so
you understand so now we have this and
let's click run again and let's check it
out in our app okay
let's press this zero one zero three
zero one three zero one three okay
perfect so now we can see our number
random number generator in action let's
say we wanted zero through 39 let's try
to run this now and see what happens and
you can see the number variation is much
greater and it's completely random
perfect beautiful this is exactly what
we want we wanted some app maybe you you
have an app that's guess which number
I'm thinking of and then you press this
and you would see if the person was
right cool
so let's actually make this sort of a
guessing game and we're going to allow
you to input a number in here and you're
going to be able to guess to see if it's
the similar number to this and we're
going to come into our app and we're
going to have this be guess the number
and it's going to be a random number
against the number one through five okay
so to get that one through five we're
going to add this to one and this is now
going to give us any number from one to
five and what we need to do is to go
back to our main activity XML file here
and what we need to do we have our hello
level up tuts
and what we're going to do first is
we're going to change this string and to
do that if you recall it's in resources
values strings and this hello level up
tuts is no longer going to say hello
where do we have this little greeting so
hello level up tux is going to say guess
a number okay and let's go back to out
of our strings document here let's come
to this and what we're going to do is we
want to add a
per box above this so that your users
can input their own numbers so let's go
grab a number box from our forum widgets
here and from this text fields we're
going to go grab this plain number right
here just number and we're going to drop
it in right here and we're going to
allow our users to input their own value
here
okay so we'll give our users a place to
enter your number and let's actually
just drop some text under here too so
I'm going to do a text view and I'm
going to put it right above and in this
text view let's go to our XML because
this is going to be faster I'm going to
copy and paste some of the text view
stuff from our previous one we want the
color to be white we want it to be 25
string pixels and let's go up so I can
edit it down here and right now the text
is set to text view but we're going to
delete that and we're going to create a
new string and this string is going to
be it's going to be guest text guess
text save this it's going to get mad
about it not being here but we can
always come back to our strings we can
add a new string to string okay
the name is guess text guess a error we
already say guess a number so we'll say
enter number okay perfect
let's come back to our main XML and see
how that's looking okay so it's a little
cluster here so let's zoom out a little
bit
let's move this press me button down and
this guest number is just going to be
down here and we can have them enter
their number just space it out things a
little bit perfect so here's our app and
let's give it a run see what happens
okay so our apps booted up here and now
if we click into this you'll see that
automatically because we said this text
field was a number the number pad comes
up and allows our users to enter
58 well let's say we should have some
text here to say between 1 and 5 so if
we guess 4 and done
let's press me well huh looks like I
guessed it right the first try perfect
but it's really weird because this just
says 4 and this is 4 but there's no
indication that we got it right so in
the next video we're going to add some
interactivity to this we're going to
make it a little bit cooler it's going
to let you know when you've won the game
ok so as always this is got the level up
touched if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video hit
us up in Twitter level up Tubbs lows
know what you're thinking thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
