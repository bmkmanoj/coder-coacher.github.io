up tutorials in this video we're gonna
be talking about the inspector in
principle now this is where you can
essentially modify and manipulate all of
your items as well as artboards on your
page so it's going to be essentially
equivalent to the inspector and sketch
where you can change color shapes you
can do things like that just a little
bit different because it's going to be
interaction based so that's going on
that right now so over the course of the
next few videos we're just going over
different features and areas of the
principal interface now I want to go
ahead and delete this artboard that we
have here just straight up and you'll
notice you can't in sketch you have this
blank area right where you can have as
many artboards as you want or whatever
but and they can all be different sizes
you know but in in principle here we
have to have an artboard all of our work
has to be done on an artboard we can't
do anything outside of this and more
importantly we can't have multiple
different sized artboards if I click
this plus new artboard you can see it
creates a new one for us and it's the
exact same size if we adjust the size of
this one well some things have happened
here let's go ahead and and if we had
just the size of the second one you'll
notice that ok this was now 722 and
width it adjusted this other one as well
so if we adjust this one now you can see
they both have to be the same size so
artboards in principle always have to be
the same size now the area of focus in
this video is going to be this area over
here now there's a lot here and in
sketch I believe it's called the
inspector this is where we're going to
be basically controlling a lot of our
stuff you'll notice that in in the
applications like sketch we had a whole
bunch of different vector options in
principle we have an option for a
rectangle now you can move it between
our boards obviously but this is
different right we can't really get in
here
do a whole lot of vector drawing and
that's fine because most of the stuff on
the web is going to be sort of this type
of shape if you need to bring in other
assets though from other applications
such as SVG's or anything like that
that's certainly doable you can really
just drag and drop stuff if you want
here's the giant image so if you need to
do any more intense graphic stuff than
what would be a rectangle or as you'll
soon see a rounded rectangle into a
circle then you're gonna want to do it
outside of principle now over here in
the inspector we have lots of tools
let's go ahead and add another rectangle
as well we have two here scale this one
up you can see that we can set these to
be the exact dimensions in size that we
want just by modifying these values for
instance the x value is going to be the
width of this object we want this to be
320 by 240 we wanted this to be at 320
180 you can actually use your keyboard
and either type and new values or hit
the up and down arrows to change this
value in addition we have width and
height which can be locked if you select
this lock and that way they're going to
grow as a perfect square if you select
this lock to have it unlocked we can
increase the height now another thing to
notice if you want to increase this by
10 pixels you can hold the shift key and
this will increase this value by 10
pixels a little bit greater there than
just at 81 pixel thing if you wanted to
just maybe manually go through this if
you wanted to be able to set your number
you can obviously just type in your
number here if you know what it is
now we can also change the angle of
something we can do so just by
increasing this percentage 180 is going
to have this be completely flopped
around you'll notice that the degree
symbol is automatically inserted for us
upon hitting Enter and that's super cool
now next we have scale now the scale
property is going to make this thing
larger by
a multiplication of it right so this is
three times larger two times larger this
is one zero and as you could see scale
is a quick way of making something
larger based on the actual scale
dimensions of this thing it's not
changing the right or left dimensions
it's just overall increasing the scale
for instance one thing you'll notice is
that when we increase the scale to two
of the square the dimensions for the
width and height are still set to 178
regardless of what the scale is and this
thing getting quite a bit larger so
scale is a way that you can grow things
by a set scale okay now in addition we
have opacity which is going to it just
allow us to make something more
transparent the less this number is and
the radius is going to allow us to
increase a border radius now because
this item is 178 pixels wide what we
need to do is have at least 178 pixels
for a radius what we need is to have at
least half of that right we need half of
that to be the radius before it turns
into a full-on circle or in this case an
oval because the height and width are
different but as you can see here that's
how you're going to create circular or
oval shapes now we can now change things
like the fill color we can make this red
you see it's still transparent so it's
not the full red value you can have this
be a photo if you choose media you can
have a stroke on this right now there's
currently no stroke you can have the
stroke be any color so there are some
like really basic vector tools within
principle but to be honest if you're
doing any sort of big vector work here
you're gonna want to do it outside now
in addition we can have things like a
shadow the shadow controls have a blur
and an X and a y-value just like you'd
be used to all of the stuff is
animatable by the way so we can do some
pretty cool stuff in addition we have
this step
and Static and you might be wondering
what's up with this well this is the
drag if we set this to vertical drag now
let's come into our inspector here
you'll notice we can click and drag this
vertically man that's pretty sweet right
I mean it's not doing anything but when
you let go it stays there just like this
Wow so I mean just by simply saying hey
you can drag this vertically we now have
the ability to move this around on the
canvas and have you set horizontal to
drag you could now move this anywhere
now unless it passes behind the square
that's because the layer is below the
layer but all around here you could see
that we've done some pretty cool stuff
already just by messing around with
these options here and this is where
you're gonna spend some time because
these options are going to you know give
you access to controlling any of your
properties now this stuff up here if you
haven't seen these symbols this is all
alignment and distribution if we want to
select both of these shapes we can say
align centers and it's going to move
them on top of each other undo that if
we wanted to align them at the top we
could click align top edges likewise
align bottom edges align Center we can
push them both to the right both to the
left and if we were to have another
shape which we can go ahead and quickly
add here let me just add a rectangle
let's drop in another rectangle here we
can grab all three of these shapes and
say this one distribute horizontally and
it'll make sure the space between them
all is even so this is a tool that you
would find on pretty much any graphics
application if you sketch or anything
like that this should be total common
place but just know that you can align
and distribute your items really super
easy up top here okay so this is the
inspector in principle it's nothing
groundbreaking this is pretty much what
you're used to in terms of other
graphics applications the only
differences we have some things like the
dragging vertical and horizontal stuff
but all in all pretty sweet in the next
video we're actually going to
to create a quick file and sketch and
we're going to import it if you don't
have sketch no big deal but you should
be able to see exactly just how easy it
is to bring in a another document from
something like sketch so as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments leave a
