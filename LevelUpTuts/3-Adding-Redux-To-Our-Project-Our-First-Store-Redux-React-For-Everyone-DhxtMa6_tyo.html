tutorials and in this video we're going
to be creating our very first Redux
store now this is gonna be totally
insignificant in the larger project but
it's good to understand the foundations
of what you're doing in Y so we're gonna
be creating and getting our code started
in this video okay to get started we're
going to create a simple react app using
create react app if you haven't
installed create react app already you
want to do NPM install - G create -
react - app okay so after you get create
react app installed we simply just need
to do create react app and then we're
going to give this just the name of
Redux test it can honestly be named
whatever you want this is just going to
be a temporary codebase to get us up and
running and actually get something going
where we can write some JavaScript okay
so we can now change directories and do
CD Redux tests and we can now type NPM
start to get this application up and
running okay so now I'm going to do two
things immediately I'm going to open up
our inspect and tab over to our council
make this font size nice and big so you
could see what's going on in my council
right here and I'm going to open up this
project into vs code so we can start
writing some JavaScript and now I'm just
going to head inside of app dot J s okay
so what we want out of this is - well we
have a pious which is just a very simple
react component and for the most part
we're gonna ignore all of this because
really we're just looking for some open
space to write some code now before we
get started any further we want to go
ahead and install redux which is as
simple as heading to your command line
and typing in a new window or a new tab
for the same directory npm install redux
okay and we're not installing redux
react just yet just redux because in
this particular example even though this
is a react site which we're going to
elaborate on well it's actually
just going to be using Redux itself and
not the packages from Redux react which
is an important distinction in which
we're going to have to go over later
what is involved in which package okay
so now that we have Redux installed we
can start importing some stuff from
redux for instance the only thing we
really need right now is what's called
the create store now create store is
going to be a function that is going to
accept some reducers and create a Redux
store out of them so let's go ahead and
do import and then we're going to import
from two brackets we're going to import
create store from redux okay and this is
going to be the very first bit of redux
we're using where it's simply going to
take like I said reducer which is
actually just going to be a function
I'll explain all about reducers in a
minute and what it's going to do is it's
going to create a store object now this
isn't just an object with your state in
it it's actually quite a bit more and of
which we're gonna be going over as we go
okay so we're importing create store now
I want to make sure I can see my council
over here and I'm gonna go all the way
down at the bottom now what we're gonna
be doing is we're going to be creating a
new function and this function is just
going to be a function and while this is
going to be our first reducer
technically you don't need to think
about it as a reducer because chances
are you might not even know what that
means yet we just simply need to think
of this as a function for instance if we
wanted to have this be some sort of
hello world we could do a new constant
variable named hello and this is just
going to be equal to an arrow function
okay and this arrow function can just
simply return a string of hello now this
seems extremely unrelated to what we're
doing but bear with me here keep in mind
this is just a function all it's simply
doing is returning the string hello now
what we want to do is use our create
store to create a new store so we're
going to
const store is equal to create store and
create store accepts a function and now
create store is going to be looking for
a function of which we can provide with
hello okay so nothing really crazy here
we're simply creating a very basic
function that's outputting a string and
now we're using create store which will
create a store out of our function so
why are we doing this well at this given
point you may think of your state tree
as a big old object full of other
objects full of other objects or arrays
or data or whatever right it's all of
your stuff that we saw like in the last
video in the level up Hutt's redux store
however this store is with create store
is simply just going to be a string a
single string so this store overall is
going to be a store a state tree that
just has one string in it so this is the
most bare-bones store you could possibly
create however if we did something like
counsel log right now and we logged out
our store we can see that our store is
like I said much more than just an
object full of our state and in this
case would just be the text hello we
have dispatch get state replace reducer
subscribe now these are all important
specifically get state and dispatch and
subscribe could typically be important
however when you're using react with
redux you typically don't use subscribe
that often but what it does is allows
you to look for data changes write and
refresh accordingly now what dispatch
does is allows you to run actions which
are going to change things in your state
tree again this can get pretty jargony
so bear with me here because i will say
some of these words but we're going to
go over in depth what they do in plain
english and then lastly we have get
state as what i've been considering the
most important ones here now get state
is going to get our actual state as and
if you wanted to see what the state of
our current redux store look like you
would use the get
state method so if we come back to our
application and just simply council lug
get state from our store store dot to
get state you're gonna see it just
simply says hello let me actually make
this side-by-side here so we can see
this a little bit better so we created a
function that simply just returns the
string hello then we used create store
to create a store to that function and
had it output the text hello now
typically in redux you see your state as
a big object and in this case it's a
string so one way we can sort of make
this feel a little bit more like what
you'd expect is to make this into an
object we can just simply have this be a
welcome message and the value of it is
going to be hello okay so now you can
see our state is now welcome hello so
this is a bear bear bear bones
redux state but this is it we simply
just have a function returning an object
we're creating a store and then we're
outputting the state using store get
State and if this seems sort of
pointless to you don't worry keep a head
what we're going to be doing in the next
video is well we have our hello function
right now which is technically a reducer
but we don't know what a reducer even is
yet so in the next video we're actually
going to be building out hello a little
bit more and turning this into what a
more common reducer it looks like and in
the process we're gonna be talking about
that word reducer what it means in the
context of this application and we're
going to write our first action which is
going to be very exciting because it's
going to allow us to interact with our
store and modify it and when I say
modify I don't actually mean modify this
store more info on that in the next
video and it's going to allow us to
create a new store with new information
instead of modifying our store so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you want to learn more
about redux and react head on over to
level up tutorials calm for it slash
store and purchase this series or become
a pro this series is going to leave for
absolute beginners who have experience
with react or read
and want to learn more about the basics
and want to understand reacts better
because let's face it a candy confusing
with all of these jargony words and
things like reducers and actions and
dispatching and stuff like that so
follow along in the next video as we
dive into sort of what every deucer is
in the context of our application and
how we can start writing reducers and
actions so thanks so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
