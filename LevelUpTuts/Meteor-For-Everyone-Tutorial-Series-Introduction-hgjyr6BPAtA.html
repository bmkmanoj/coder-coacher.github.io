tutorials and today we're going to start
a new series on meteor for everyone and
what that is is basically we're going to
be learning how to make web apps using
meteor and meteor is a full platform
it's a full stack platform so it
contains view templates it contains a
database it contains the front-end and
back-end JavaScript basically it
encompasses sort of everything and it's
built on node it allows for some really
cool web apps to be created really
really quickly and now it does that by
sort of allowing the front-end and
back-end code to be sort of combined in
a way that's really interesting in a way
that you haven't maybe seen before with
some other frameworks so let's check out
what we're going to be building over the
course of these videos so we're going to
be creating what's essentially a
glorified to-do app but one of the sort
of performance hacks I like to use in my
life as I make a monthly resolutions
list so every single month instead of
doing New Year's resolutions I'm
actually creating resolutions for that
month things I'm trying to improve in
just generally things I want to get
better at right so I decided I wanted to
create a monthly resolutions app and in
this in this way basically we just have
an input text field here and we can
create a new resolution let's say read
five or let's say read four books and
we're going to do that in the month of
March so I just hit enter and as you can
see we have a new resolution now meteor
also has some really interesting
strengths that may not exactly be super
appropriate for this example but are
really interesting so if we were to
let's say open up an incognito window
here you can see that we have this read
for books and marches are you displaying
here however if we come back to our
application and let's say let's get
eight hours of sleep sleep and March as
well and we hit enter
let's tend back over to the incognito
window and you can see there's no
difference we didn't have to update or
refresh this page this just happens
naturally now obviously if you're having
an app where people are going to have
their own user accounts and you're going
to be creating their own resolutions
then this is not going to be
desired functionality in fact we're
going to go over how to do that creating
user accounts and attaching this content
to those user accounts as well so don't
worry if this is not the style of
application you want to build however
it's a really really interesting aspect
of meteor that comes baked in and to
reiterate that if we click remove you'll
notice it's gone on our boat there
incognito and our standard window
without having to refresh so meteors
filled with these cool features and
these things that make it really
interesting however it's also very
robust and you can use it to build some
really great applications now this
series is just going to cover the basics
to get you up and running we're going to
be creating an application just like
this however it's going to have user
logins and attach these resolutions to
logins but other than that this is the
functionality that we're going to be
covering in later level up tutorial
series we're going to go way more in
depth with meteor and how you can create
some really really cool applications you
can even get into mobile app development
using meteor for iOS or Android so
there's a lot of potential a lot of
possibilities with meteor and you just
really have to know JavaScript HTML and
CSS now if your JavaScript skills aren't
top-notch don't worry we're gonna be
explaining everything really basically
so even if you're not a great JavaScript
developer you should be able to get a
handle of what's going on and how you
can add features to your meteor
application in a way that makes sense
and in the process I'm sure you're going
to learn a lot about JavaScript so I
hope you're excited meteor is a really
super cool platform to learn and it
enables you to do a lot of really great
things so keep watching over the course
of this series you're going to learn a
lot about the basics of meteor and how
to get up and running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
