up tutorials and today we're gonna show
you how to use mix ins in stylus now
this is your first CSS preprocessor a
mixin might be a foreign concept to you
but if you're coming from something like
sass or less mixin should feel right at
home what's great about mix ins in
stylus is that they're just so easy
they're completely transparent you can
define and drop them in with hardly even
using any syntax and if you've never
used mix ins don't worry we're gonna
show you what they're all about and how
you can get the most out of them
so keep watching we're gonna get into
that now so to pick up where we left off
I have style is currently running and we
have our CSS over here and our stylus
over here now what we want to do is
start to define mix-ins now what is a
mixin well mixed in is really just a
group of code that's contained inside a
statement right so it could be things
that you need to reuse a whole bunch
maybe like a clear fix and so instead of
having a clear fix class like you may be
used to where you just type clear fix
and have that class apply the clear fix
for you every time you need it
you could have a clear fix mixin and in
your CSS let's say you had something
floating in your main container here and
you wanted to clear fix this container
you could just include the mixin by
simply just using it here for instance
if we had a clear fix mixin we could
just say clear fix just like that and
and now this code would bring in all the
additional code so a good way to think
about mixin is it's essentially like a
variable where you can reuse and
reference it however a mixin can accept
things like arguments okay so to give
you a good example let's use a css3
property border-radius
so in stylus to define a mixin you
simply just have to write what your
mix-ins name is going to be and then
follow with parentheses so if we wanted
to say
border - radius and then parentheses
like that you'll see that our code
coloring instantly decides that this is
actually something you can see it's
green therefore our code coloring knows
that it's not just two standard CSS
property now if we hit enter and tab
over we can now add the CSS that we want
to be generated from this mixin for
instance if we wanted to use the border
radius the - WebKit not WebKit white
WebKit border radius and and give this a
value like five pixels now next we want
to say border radius five pixels okay so
now what happens is that this mixin
right here contains this bit of code and
every time we use this mixin let's say
right here we save this let's check out
what our CSS has generated over here so
for our body main and now not only gets
the border radius five pixels but it
also gets the WebKit border radius five
pixels okay so this saved us maybe a
little bit of typing and this is just
about the most basic example you can get
now let's say you thinking why don't
always want my border radius to be five
pixels well that's where things like
arguments come in so let's pass in an
argument and we can just give this any
particular name in sass you have to
prefix this with the dollar sign because
that's declaring a variable and stylist
you don't if you'll notice that's just
one common theme throughout stylist
development that is not there with sass
you don't have to use a lot of syntax in
sass to define a mixin you have to
actually declare a hey this is a mixin
the way you do that in stylist is the
same way you declare a function it's
just by with these parentheses so it's
really nice and easy if we wanted to
have this border radius argument always
to type in here is radius or whatever
you'd like the name to be now anytime
that you
want to use this argument you can say
radius like that now for this to
actually work we're gonna actually have
to pass in a value into here so we want
this to be something different than five
pixels would say this is ten pixels just
like a function in JavaScript or some
like that you're passing the argument in
here it's getting assigned to this value
and then this value is then being used
for these properties so after I say that
you can see that our CSS output is now
border-radius 10 pixels border-radius
WebKit border-radius 10 pixels okay so
this is how you use arguments what about
if you almost always want this to be 5
pixels except for when you don't and
therefore you think that maybe most the
time you want to just type border radius
just like this well we can actually
design but we can actually just assign a
default value to this variable this
argument here simply by saying equals 5
pics just like that in our variable
declaration and if we wanted to have
more variables you could do that with a
comma arguments that is and if we save
this you'll see that even though we
haven't defined anything here we haven't
passed in the arguments in to our mixin
it's still help putting is 5 pixels
however if we want to override that and
say 15 it overrides that and doesn't use
this 5 pixels now what are some cool
things that you could do with mix-ins
that you can't do in other CSS
preprocessors well you can actually use
mix sense to sort of replace properties
so we have this border-radius property
right and what were to happen if we were
to actually say border radius 15 pixels
like this in fact let's see you
something different than 50 let's use 20
just so it's different would you think
that it would simply output border
radius 20 pixels or would it output
WebKit border radius 20 border radius 20
well in other CSS preprocessors you're
only going to get the property listed
however since the
property is actually defined as a mixin
when this is compiling it's going to use
the mixin rather than just the standard
property to see what I mean here is if
we save this and we check out our CSS we
get both of the WebKit border-radius and
just border-radius so here seeing this
our syntax highlighting who doesn't know
this mix is a mixin it doesn't look like
a mixin it looks like a property but
it's really intuitive we're just saying
border-radius 20 pixels and we don't
even have to notice that our CSS is
outputting all this extra stuff so
that's a transparent mixin and it's one
of my favorite features about mix ins
and stylus let's go ahead and do one
more example let's actually build out
that clear fix mixin that we had talked
about or I had mentioned in the start of
this tutorial so what we can do is we
could just make our own mixin and I like
to keep something like a clear fix short
like C F because that's something you
maybe use a lot so I'm defining this
mixin just by saying C F parenthesis tab
over and let's just say zoom one and
then we can use the parent selector
which is the ampersand which I'll get
into more and we can say ampersand after
space and then on the very next line
ampersand colon before now when we tab
over we can say content this is the sort
of standard clear fix
and display cable okay and then we're
going to say for after clear:both okay
so we now have this clear fix mixin and
anytime that we want to use this all we
simply have to do is say CF save it and
you'll notice that our body is getting
all this clear fixed stuff so if you
want to drop in a nice and easy clear
fix into your stylist project all you
have to do is make it nice and easy mix
and and every time you want to clear
your floats you can do so using just
quick shorthand so this is how you
create and use mix sense there's lots to
do with mix ins and we're gonna go over
at all more once we get into things like
functions more operators interpolation
hashes conditionals all sorts of cool
stuff that exists in CSS preprocessors
and specifically stylus so as always
it's the Scott will level up tutorial so
