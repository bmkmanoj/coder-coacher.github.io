tutorials and in this video we're gonna
start talking about the aside element we
went over a section in the last video we
sort of understood why we use section
and now we're gonna start talking about
the aside element when do use it when
not to use it what exactly does it mean
so let's get going on that right now
okay so in the last video we made our
own billboard here we learned about the
section element now in this video were
to learn about a sort of companion
element in a way to the section in html5
now this element is the aside so we can
make an aside simply by just coming to
our HTML and we're gonna do so well
underneath our section here and we're
gonna say a side and let's go ahead and
just fill this aside with some content
here so we can go ahead and say this is
going to have an h4 and they h4 is going
to say and this is going to just be like
a newsletter sign up or something like
that so we can go ahead and say sign up
and we'll just put a paragraph here I'm
not going to deal with a form right now
because we're not going to get into
signup forms just yet or anything like
that and we can just say sign up to
learn more about websites okay
so we now have this a side tag and we
have enough that we have a section tag
here if we come to our page once more
you're gonna see that the a side tag
really gives this no visual styles so
what's the purpose of the aside tag well
the purpose of the aside tag is to say
this is secondary content to whatever
content it's a part of so this aside
being inside of our main element saying
it says that this is a secondary content
to the main element where this section
this is main content where the section
itself is primary content of the main
section where it this is where this
billboard is primary content of the main
this aside is secondary content now
asides when they first came out
everybody thought that the reason why
you'd use them would be for a sidebar
right and you can certainly use them for
a sidebar oftentimes the sidebar is
secondary content but the actual purpose
of a side is really just to say this is
secondary and we can actually have an
aside within a section we can have an
aside within an article you can have an
aside within the footer you can have an
aside pretty much anywhere as long as it
means that it's secondary content of its
context so now we have an aside let's go
ahead and add another section in here so
we can just say section and I'm going to
close it up and this is just going to
say h3 learn about level up okay now
this is also just going to be a
paragraph and we're gonna say this is
just going to be some text about level
up okay let's close this out save that
so we now have a section we now have
another section we now have an aside and
we know that this is primary content
this is primary content but this is not
primary content so now anytime the
screen reader a robots or anything like
that will be browsing your site they're
gonna know what to look at first and
what the catalogue is being more
important cool so in the next video
we're going to be working with floats
once more but only this time we're going
to show you how you can create a two
column layout and we're gonna throw this
aside that we have right here we're
gonna actually make it into a sidebar
and then we're going to have this main
body context take up like 70% of the
screen or so and we're going to have
sort of the classic two column layout
that you might be used to seeing on some
websites so as always this is called
love
up tutorials of any questions or
comments leave a come in the video here
to set Petra or Facebook at level up
tutorials I'd love to hear from you
