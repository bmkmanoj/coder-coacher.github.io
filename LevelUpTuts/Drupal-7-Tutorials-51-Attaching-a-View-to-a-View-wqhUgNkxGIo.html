up Tut's and today I'm gonna be showing
you how to make an attachment view okay
an attachment view is pretty simple all
it is is a view that attaches to the top
or the bottom of another view this could
be useful let's say if you want to make
like a table of contents or something
like that let's say we have all these
videos here that I had in the last
example and so here we have all at least
and what if we just wanted to list all
of them at the top okay
so you'd want to do that with an
attachment view the way we add an
attachment view is just like adding a
view page or a view block we'll just
click this add and UTech attachment and
what this does is just like your other
one it creates a duplicate in this
different format so all we have here is
our exact same fields we had before the
only difference here is we have this
attachment settings so we if we attach
this to page we could also touch it the
master but you can attach it to
whichever ones you'd like pages the
other view that we were using before and
it'll catch this and you can choose
whether you want it before or after or
both if you want it to but we'll leave
it as before just so it's nice and
obvious okay and you can have an
inherent contextual filter as inherit
exposed filters cool we're not going to
do any of that right now we're just
going to go here and change these so I'm
going to click rearrange and I'm going
to select this to be this attachment so
it's not going to affect this for any of
the other views and we'll just remove
everything except for the content title
so now what happens is it should list
out every single title we have I'm gonna
go into here my semantic fields just to
change this and I'll set this to be with
this I mean this can just be a a
paragraph tag
just because okay so let's save this and
let's check out our page to see exactly
what happens so as you can see attached
to the top of our view here we just have
a listing of all of the different
battles going on and then here you can
see them down here great well that is
how you make an attachment view if we
were to move this to the bottom it'd be
the same thing you're just show up on
the bottom and keep in mind that you can
really do anything you'd like here so
it's not really limited
to these fields you can override any of
these so you can pretty much attach
anything any other view to the bottom or
top of any other view as long as you
make it an attachment view okay so
that's how you make an attachment view
in Drupal 7 if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment on the
video hit us up at Twitter LevelUp tuts
let us know what you're thinking once
again this is Scott and thanks for
