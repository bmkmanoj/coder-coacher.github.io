up tuts
and today I'm gonna be going over some
more Drupal views we're going to be
talking about fields how you can add
them how you can change them and some of
the cool stuff you can do well this is
just going to be a basic overview of
fields we'll get into more later in a
few coming tutorials for a little bit
more advanced functionality but for now
I'm just going to show you how to use
fields how to add them and we know just
what you can do but before we get
started I wanted to give a quick shout
out to Michael McMillan who designed
this awesome logo for us as you can see
we have an actual logo now which is
which is cool and Mike did a great job
on it so I would suggest checking out
his site which is a Michael P McMillan
com you know he's a really good guy
great great designer and he's a very
talented developer as well so with that
let's get started in views so I'm just
going to access my view that we were
working on before which we just called
test view if you have your home page up
or wherever you have your view up and
you're not in the Edit screen you can
always click on the gear and then click
Edit view and this will take you into
your view so if you notice right here in
this column we have fields and right now
it's just content title if we look down
at what's being displayed it's just our
content title
well let's spice this up let's add
something a little bit different here
right now we're looking for articles
that are published well what other
things do these articles have let's
actually open it up in a new tab our
content types so we can look at the
other content fields that our articles
have so let's go to manage fields and if
you remember we had a body we had tags
with an image we had an insert image URL
path settings whatever lots of stuff
here so let's bring in the body so if we
go back to review if you want to click
add and this button next to your fields
it'll pop up with this menu we can use
the search bar or we can just look as
you can see content body is right here
so all we have to do is select this and
if you'll notice it says actually where
this content is located in so if you
have any doubts or you have some fields
that are named something similar this is
a nice way to say okay
the content body appears in a page
article the project and a webform so
let's look at one like insert image only
is in note article or something like
content link which actually isn't one of
your fields this is the actual link to
the specific content that you're pulling
in so there's all sorts of things in
here other than just your fields you
know we have a Content link we can bring
in the note ID if you remember your note
is your piece of content you can bring
in new comments the post date so let's
bring in the post date as well just so
we have something else here and one more
let's actually bring in the content type
just for fun so we can see a couple of
different things and we'll click apply
all displays you'll notice it'll take us
to some other menus but let me just
explain this all displays first you
could have different views that are set
up without very similar things and if
you keep adding different blocks or
different pages to your same view it's
going to retain all of the fields and
the filters but if you want to change
them a little bit you can change them
without changing all of them so if
you'll notice right here when we're
adding it says apply to all displays so
right now if we add this and we have
multiple views it's going to be added to
all of them so let's just click apply
now we'll go over more of the over
writing and stuff like that later for
now know that just this is going to be
able to add to multiple blocks or pages
in your view so we don't want to label
let's click out of that I actually don't
know you know I don't even use label
that often I don't know why that's
selected by default
but it is so that's one of those things
has just got to live with with Drupal
and this exclude from display is going
to make this field hidden which can be
useful if you're rewriting it or you're
using a custom field where you can use
replacement patterns to bring this
information back in here so this exclude
from display is actually pretty useful
however I'll go over that in the more
advanced section on fields and we just
won't worry about that right now because
this is just our content body you know I
actually want this to be a summary or
trimmed because I you know I don't want
all this text in here so we're actually
going to trim this
to just 100 just so you can see that it
brings it in and then we don't have to
worry about all the text although I
don't remember ever putting in that much
text in these examples so down here we
have a couple more things we have style
settings so you can customize things you
can customize the label the HTML you can
customize the field customize label and
wrapper in HTML you can add a default
class or by default it adds the default
classes or you can use a field template
we're just going to leave these as
default for now and this no results
behavior this is what happens if you
have a field that doesn't have any
information in it so by default hide
rewriting if empty so basically if
there's no content it's not going to
show anything although you could have it
display something like there is no
content or pretty much anything you want
so let's go down here let's close this
one and let's look at the rewrite
results so rewrite results are sort of
some extra things you can do if you want
to rewrite the output of this field you
can check this and it's going to
override the output you can use things
like a replacement tokens or custom text
it's you know it's really useful and
I'll get into that more in the Advanced
section on fields I just wouldn't worry
about that right now if you want you can
output this field as a link if you check
this it's going to ask you for the link
path so you could actually set this to
link to the content if you wanted to and
so that might be useful if you have a
title and you wanted to link it to the
content or if you have an image you mean
basically anything that you want to link
is it's very useful you can trim this
field to a maximum length we're sort of
already doing that with this summary or
trimmed remove white space you can
convert new lines in HTML to break tags
I'm just going to leave those as is here
right now and then more you can give
this an administrative title which is
sort of nice if you have lots of things
let's say you're bringing in lots of
fields and some of the names are pretty
similar if you give this an
administrative title it's just going to
make it easier to manage in your view so
this click sort column we're not going
to worry about this either for right now
so let's just unclick this and we're
going to add to all displays so that was
our content body
now we're going to do the same thing for
our post date you know we'll leave a
label for this one just so you can see
what happens it's going to place a colon
after it because I like that the date
format we're going to set it to short
format however you know Drupal comes
with all of these built in and in a
later lesson I'll show you how to
customize and create your own date
formats but for now we'll just pick one
that's built in these will all be the
same style settings no results behavior
we're just going to leave these as is
add to all displays and then the type
we're also going to keep a label on this
one
and just click all displays okay so
let's check this out so now as you can
see there's some sort of broken image in
here we're not going to worry about that
right now I think that's the image
that's in the body for our text it's
just probably not showing up in this
view here in the preview we have our
title we have our body text we have our
post date and we have our type article
so let's just save this and look at it
on the page okay so there's clearly
something wrong with this image link
that's no big deal right now I'll have
to go through and see what's going on
there but as you can see it's brought in
the title the body text the post date
and everything so if we wanted to put
this block somewhere else let's put it
in the main content and save this you
can see how this will adapt now it's in
the main content you can see you can get
started building some really interesting
stuff so once you start styling this
content with your CSS you'll be able to
see how absolutely versatile this is you
can pretty much bring in any content in
any pieces of this content that you want
and just throw it on your page so that's
how you add a field to your view in the
next lesson we're going to be talking
about some format things some pagers and
we'll get back to the advanced
functionality of fields after we've gone
over some of the more basics of views
that way once we get into the advanced
stuff it might all sink in a little bit
better and make a little bit more sense
once again this is Scott with level up
tuts and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
