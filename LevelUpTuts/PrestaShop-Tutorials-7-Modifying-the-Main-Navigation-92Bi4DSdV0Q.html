of tides and today we're going to be
showing you how to modify the main
navigation and PrestaShop now what we're
going to be doing is taking the category
that we created in the last video and
we're going to be moving it up into the
main navigation like we had women's
before now we're going to have women's
and men's and we're going to actually
add a nice little subcategory under that
just so we can see how that works within
that navigation using the module that
comes with PrestaShop for that
navigation so check it out we're going
to get started right now okay so in the
last video we created this new category
now we want to add it to the main
navigation we also want to be able to
modify this main navigation like what if
we don't want t-shirts in here so let's
go ahead and come to the backend of our
store and let's go to modules and then
under modules again we're going to want
to find the module that is the top
navigation so that one is under T so if
we scroll down here of our list of all
these installed modules it's going to be
under T for top navigation or top menu
let's just see if we can find it here
and now that we're at T's I don't want
to blow by it because there's a lot of
modules and that's really the power of
PrestaShop is that it breaks all these
things up into modules so let's scroll
down and we see top horizontal menu now
it says it needs an update and that's
okay however we're not going to update
it just yet we'll cover updating modules
in another video let's go ahead and
click this down down arrow and then
click configure okay so now this should
be looking like what we wanted before we
have women's dresses and t-shirts as our
selected items which means that they are
in our navigation so we don't want
t-shirts in there anymore we said that
is no longer a category I mean besides
we have on underneath women's anyways
let's so let's select it and then click
remove
along with dresses in fact I'm going to
get rid of this so we just have women
and men so now let's look at our
available items and we can see that we
have our CMS pages so you can add things
like about us to the main navigation
just by selecting and clicking add I
think that seems like a great idea to
have
and then down here we can keep going
until we see our categories so under
categories we wanted to have men so
let's select men and click Add now I
want men to be underneath women not
about us so we can select men and then
click change position and it puts it
below women so it goes women men about
us ok and now it adds us if we want a
search bar on our horizontal menu if we
look at the front-end of our site we
have the search bar in the header so we
don't need it in the navigation so let's
go ahead and click Save what's great
about this also is if you wanted a link
that links to any page you could just
add a label and a link and choose if you
wanted a new window here so it's very
very flexible cool so now that we have
that let's give our page a refresh and
you can see our new menu has been
completely changed we now have women we
have men and about us what's cool about
this is we're on the men's page and it
automatically knows that this is the
active page so it's highlighting that
menu part for us we didn't have to do
anything special to do that so let's go
ahead and quickly create another
category and shove it under men here and
see what happens we're just going to
come to catalog categories and let's go
ahead and click add new category and say
this is just going to be t-shirts I know
we already have a t-shirts category but
this one's going to be different this is
going to be men's t-shirts so if we open
up home then select men men is now going
to be the parent category of this
t-shirts and we can just say this is
going to be men's t-shirts again I don't
have an image or anything so we can just
leave this as is let's click Save and we
now have our new category that is
underneath men if we refresh our page
here we now see that t-shirt shows up in
this sub navigation of men and when we
hover over men we know that a drop-down
in the drop-down shows
that we have t-shirts right here if we
were to have another subcategory of that
it would look just like this where we
have these arrows next to it now keep in
mind that this is just for this theme
different themes might handle how this
menu looks in different ways but the
functionality is going to be the same as
long as you're using this module so
check it out we just added something new
to our main navigation in the next video
we're going to start showing you how to
customize your products more using
attributes so we'll get into that in the
next video as always this is scott with
love love Hut's if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video or hit us up at twitter or
facebook at LevelUp tuts
we love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
