tats and today I'm gonna show you how to
reference another node or another piece
of content with a node reference field
so we're going to be using the project
references field so if you go to
drupal.org slash project slash
references you can get this module
however a small word of warning to say
that the you know the past couple months
have shown the current maintainer zone
up to the task
this module accepts new maintainer x' so
there could be some bugs or there could
be some things to work out and also said
that they might be dumping this module
in favor of entity reference since right
now I haven't had any problems with
references and it works for what we're
trying to do I'm gonna show you how to
use references and in the future we'll
go over entity reference okay so check
out references and download the latest
version as you can see it's not
extremely new 2011 but it works fine so
after you have the module installed go
to your content types and I'm going to
create a new content type so just a note
I'm actually doing this on the live
level of Ted site I wouldn't actually
recommend working on a live site but you
know this isn't really anything crazy
here
and not to mention the site is really
just up just to have something and it's
in no way and any completed state in
fact it's a long ways away from it so we
figured that we would show you a little
bit of the building process while we're
making these tutorials and you can see
sort of how we put it together okay so
I'm gonna make a content type and this
content type is gonna be called courses
so the way we have the tutorials right
now is let's say we have like 50 some
drupal tutorials and they go in an order
but the order isn't always yeah you know
some of the times there's like three
views tutorials in a row and then it'll
do something else and then three more
abuse tutorials so we want to have all
those views tutorials together in one
course and the way I'm going to
accomplish that is by creating a content
type called course with node references
that link the classes to the course
so I'm going to give this a course title
I'm going to turn off commenting for now
I might turn on discuss commenting later
depending on what people want for the
site and I'm gonna save in add fields
okay so the first field we're going to
add is just going to be called the the
parent well will just be the topic this
will be the this will be what the the
tutorial course is on so this is gonna
be field topic and then I'm going to
pick a node reference field in our
modules you just want to enable out of
the references modules I'm sorry
actually skipped over this part but if
we go to reference you want node
reference and references and you can
enable the other ones if you'd like but
we're pretty much gonna be using
references and note reference okay so
this is going to be a node reference
field and we're gonna have this one be
checkboxes or radio buttons okay and I'm
gonna save this and now we're gonna add
some of the things here we want this to
be able to have more than one topic
let's say relates to CSS and Drupal or
something we want to have it to be able
to be under both of those so we'll say
that it can pick its what content types
can be referenced we're going to say
that category pages can be referenced so
what category pages are in our site is a
category pages like Drupal WordPress
Magento and so these are the sort of
blanket topics and then the courses is
what we're doing right now and the
videos are individual videos okay so
we'll save this field settings can only
use category pages and there's no
default value however it can use
multiple values if we'd like if we have
this be use one value it's gonna just be
a radio button
but if we use unlimited it's going to be
checkboxes so let's say this and let's
add another node reference this is going
to be included videos so we'll just have
this be videos
and course videos and then I should have
didn't name this course just to keep
things consistent and then field type is
also going to be a node reference
however this time it's going to be an
autocomplete text field and we'll show
you exactly how that works in a second
I'm gonna save it at this and I'm gonna
only allow content types that are videos
or content that's a video to be in this
and we're going to have number of values
be unlimited because we want to have as
many videos that's related to this
course as possible
let's save this and now we can start
adding some content let's go to add
content and I'm going to add a new
course in this course is going to be on
views so I'm gonna write views here and
then in you know and later I'm gonna
have like a description and body but
we'll just leave it blank for now and
we're gonna say this is a drupal
tutorial in course videos now what I can
do is start typing views and you'll see
anything that comes up with views these
are all the tutorials we've done on
views they'll pop up here is I'm going
to click this one and now it's relating
this node number 423 to our course so
let's add another one you only have to
do is click the add another item and
then I'm going to keep going on all of
these
in fact I'm only gonna do a couple of
them right now and I'll go back and add
them on my own time because you don't
need to see me just go and I have more
tutorials like this but let's keep it
like that and I'm not gonna worry about
a menu link right now I'm gonna save
this piece of content and now let's
check out our content the way it outputs
it by default here is here's our pages
views and since we didn't modify the the
display or anything
our topic is going to be Drupal
tutorials what that does is it links to
the drupal tutorials page which again
like I said this site is you know it not
even close to being in you know working
or viewable condition here but uh just
bear with me here and then let's go back
here core videos are going to be any of
these you can click on those and what it
does is it links you right to that
content and here's that tutorial with
its description and it's discussed
comments ok so that's how you use an ode
reference to reference other
pieces of content in the next tutorial
I'm going to use views to output that
content a little bit different way to
make this a little bit more useful for
us okay so as always this is Scott with
level up tuts if you have any questions
please leave a comment the video or hit
us up at Twitter LevelUp Tut's and
