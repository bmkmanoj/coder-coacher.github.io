up Tut's and today we're going to be
working on something pretty interesting
and it's called the mage what I called
the mage it's called mage and it's the
Magento command line tool and you can
actually see this tool by going to your
sites file structure if we go to our
folder our our root folder here you can
scroll down and you'll see this mage
file and what kind of file is this if we
inspect it it's going to come up and
just say it's in a UNIX executable file
so it might not be something you're
familiar with but it's really super
useful and mage can do all sorts of
great stuff with a one line of command
line you can install extensions you can
upgrade extensions you can do all sorts
of cool stuff and we want to check it
out in future lessons we're going to be
using this to install extensions and all
sorts of cool stuff so this lesson is
going to be about how to get made ready
and then we're just going to do a simple
mage command so open up your terminal if
you're automatic it's this terminal app
right here and if you are working off of
a server that your sites already live on
you probably won't want to do this you
can you can via SSH but if it's your
production live site you're probably not
going to be wanting to edit that anyways
for fear that you know you could you
might want to have a development site
ready to try this on so this is our I've
browsed into our sites directory and I'm
just going to do CD into my Magento
folder actually I don't think it's
capitalized there we go and you can see
we have all these files here and we need
to make sure that the permissions are
correct on this so we're going to type
CH m OD chmod seven and we're going to
select this file mage and so now ah
we've been considering doing a course
purely on command-line it's really
useful to learn these commands you can
really just get a ton done really easily
with the terminal so if that would be
interesting let us know in the comment
it's something we've been kicking around
and I mean really terminal skills and
just command-line skills in general will
come in handy more often than not I
suppose so we're going to change the
permissions on this file 700 and we're
going to enter it doesn't really tell
you anything but that's it and now we
want to type period forward slash and
then mage hit enter and you should see
this this is a list of all the commands
that mage can do so you can install
packages you can list available packages
and all this stuff's relating to
extensions so a lot of cool stuff you
can do with extensions you can upgrade
egg package you could upgrade all
packages um just a lot of cool stuff
however what's one really easy thing
that we can do with this and that might
be a pain to do in the Magento well if
we scroll up here you see there's this
clear cache command it's clear - cache
and that's a great one to try out
because if we come into here and if we
have caching turned on let's go to our
sites admin section oops so I'm just
going to put the admin section and let's
say we wanted to clear the cache
normally ok well I got a login and then
after I login I have to go to cache
management
rid of this system cache management I
didn't have to select all of these and
flush the cache or refresh the cache and
then that takes a little while and it's
just not very quick if I had my terminal
open and I'm here I could do period
/page and then clear - cache enter and
our cache is cleared so this is the very
basics of using mage like I said in
future lessons we're going to go over a
bunch of this other stuff and it could
be very useful to you in fact this is
the only way I Excel install extensions
on my sites because it's just so darn
easy and
works every time so as always this is
Scott with level up tuts you know like I
said let us know about that command-line
series if that's something you'd find
interesting otherwise you know leave a
comment or question this video if you
have them and hit us up on Twitter or
Facebook as always thanks for watching
