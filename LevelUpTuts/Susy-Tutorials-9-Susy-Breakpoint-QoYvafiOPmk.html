loved huts and today we're gonna be
talking about the Suzie tool kit and in
particular we're gonna be talking about
the Suzie break point mixin within the
toolkit now what the tool kit is is
basically it's a collection of mix-ins
that's built on the shorthand syntax to
allow you to control every single detail
so there's all sorts of mix ins from
things like gutters mixin to a container
mixin or function which you've used the
mix in here you can even see right here
and a whole bunch of little things like
margins and padding's bleed that sort of
stuff just to make your life a little
bit easier when working with Suzie now
one of the best parts of this Suzie tool
kit is if you're using break point which
we are here if you remember break point
is an extension to assess that allows
for really excellent media queries and
if you're using break point then you can
use the Suzie break point mixin and now
the Suzie break point mixing does
require you to be using break point on
the site so if you're not using break
point already check out one of our
videos where we explain how to use break
point we talked about it in some of
these past Suzie videos if you did not
catch those so to use the Suzie break
point mix in well we have to do is type
in Suzie - break point now that's using
the Suzie break point mixin if we simply
save this come to our page and refresh
you'll see it's missing an argument
so the Suzie break point mixin doesn't
just take a break point mixin right
because at that point it be what's
what's the point of even using it in
fact it takes three arguments now the
first argument is the same as the break
point mixin however the second argument
is going to be a layout statement so if
we wanted to say essentially this layout
twenty-four all we could say here is 24
now if I delete this it's not even going
to require that that's there I can save
this and now at the large media query
it's reset
our grid at 224 columns if i refresh
you'll see everything's back to the way
it used to be in fact just to verify
this is doing anything we could say hey
make this 40 columns and you'll be able
to see these columns should all get much
narrower there we are because I've just
made it 40 columns instead of 24 okay so
back to 24 cool so now the third
argument is actually the no query
statement and the no query is for
falling back for old browsers now I'm
not going to explain that too much in
this video however we do go over the no
query strategy in our sass video series
when we talk about break point it's a
great way to support older browsers that
don't use media queries without using
something like respond at j/s so that's
just about as easy as it gets
this mixin takes three arguments with
the last one being optional as you can
see here we just passed it to and now we
just got rid of an a little line of code
and it's made our life really easy so
you can now quickly change your grid
settings with the susi breakpoint mixin
cool so that's nice and easy in the next
video we're going to talk about some
more of these toolkit mix ins as always
this is Scott with LevelUp Tut's if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment in the video or reach out to us
on Facebook or Twitter pretty much
anywhere we love to hear from you thanks
for watching and we'll see in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
