of tutorials and today I'm going to show
you how to use it layout attributes
using polymer now we showed you these a
little bit a couple of videos ago and we
sort of blew right past them right well
in this video we're going to show you
exactly what they're doing and how you
can use them to define layouts using
your HTML so keep watching we're gonna
get started now okay so a couple of
videos ago we dropped in some attributes
here this full-bleed layout vertical and
flex at the time we sort of breezed over
what they were doing except for we noted
that they were adding some flexbox
CSS to our project without actually
writing any CSS these are what polymer
calls layout attributes and what I
should note is that these are considered
an experimental feature of polymer and
it's going to be best to check out their
documentation if you are coding some
polymer projects sometime from the
release of this video so I'll include
the link in the description of the video
there and you can check it out in case
any things may be now working that way
you can make sure that you have the
correct syntax if things have changed so
what our layout attributes as the
polymer documentation describes it's a
declarative layout system built using
CSS flexbox if you're not familiar with
flexbox level up tutorials we'll be
doing a short little video series on
flexbox nothing crazy but it's really
really super cool there's a great CSS
tricks article out it on it already if
you just look for CSS tricks flexbox it
should give you a basic understanding of
what you can accomplish with flexbox
really the only reason not to be going
nuts over flexbox is the browser support
but honestly in terms of creating
layouts i've never had a better
experience with CSS than with flexbox so
let's go over what some of these
attributes are sort of doing basically
layout is just determining that this
body is going to be a container for a
flex layout it's basically saying the
things inside of here are going to be
able to being flat
this full-bleed basically means that the
body is going to take up the entire
viewport
now vertical is going to mean that the
layout that we have within the body
though would be the elements contained
within it which would just be this core
header panel are going to flex
vertically down to show this off a
little bit more let's go through some
basic examples I'm going to get rid of
these core icons we dropped in here last
time and I'm going to write a div here
and within this div I'm going to have
three separate divs okay so let's do at
a quick example and this one comes
straight from polymers documentation we
can say one two three like this now
let's add some Styles here to make this
obvious so we can say class example so
I'll just using this example class we
can say that this example div has a
background of let's say some pretty
light color we can just say it's going
to be actually this will be a darker
gray I'll be three three three
and then any sort of div within the
example class so any div directly in
example is going to have a background of
let's say EEE ok just like that let's
check out our CSS let's check out our
HTML to see what we actually have right
now and expand this a little bit we
refresh and it's exactly what you'd
expect we have three divs spending full
width one two three down here and
because we don't have any pattern or
anything uh we're not seeing the
container so let's go ahead and add just
a couple of pixels of padding we can
just say even just ten pixels of padding
all around cool so now let's get into
using these layout attributes first of
all we want this div this wrapping div
this example div we
this to be a flex layout so we're going
to use the layout attribute and then we
want to determine if this is going to be
horizontal or vertical let's actually
use horizontal for this particular
example just like that so we now have
layout horizontal and that's all we have
to have and if we come to our page and
refresh you can see we now have our
container div with our three divs laid
out in here horizontally with no spaces
between them in fact if we inspect you
can see these divs don't have any CSS
applied to them other than this
background color but the example has
this flex direction row and display flex
it's even including a couple of browser
prefixes here we have WebKit flex and ms
flex for us now let's give these a
little bit of space so we can just say
these divs we also want them to have a
margin of let's say 10 pixels now when
we refresh you notice they each have a
margin of 10 pixels all the way around
and that gives us a little bit of space
in between them and they're still evenly
spaced here well let's see this flex
attribute in action right we've seen a
flex used up here but let's see what
happens when we throw it into this
middle div if we say flex here just
using this flex attribute it's actually
going to flex this box out to fill the
remaining space if you haven't used flex
box before this should be pretty awesome
to you because it what it means is that
it we don't have to do any calculations
in fact if we add another div let's just
say for it fills the space that's
required so basically one two three four
take up the space that half they have to
take up and then to fill up everything
else and likewise if we want these to
appear at some sort of ratio of size we
can use the Flex ratio and give all of
these flex and for example we can say
this first one is going to take up three
and this last 1/3 is going to take up
two so now if we refresh the page you
can see they're going to be evenly
distributed at a ratio of one to two to
three and you'll notice that this
response to the page with just like this
super cool right and let's say what
happens if we change this flex layout
horizontal to be verticals
so just by changing horizontal to
vertical we refresh now if you notice we
have some weirdness well we actually
have to give the parent div a height for
this example to work otherwise we're
going to have just something that's
totally not what we're expecting show up
so on the example div we can give this a
height of something like 300 pixels and
as you can see we can scroll down and
since I'm zoomed in this doesn't look
like 300 pixels but with the padding
it's 320 so it looks like it's way
bigger than that but it's actually zoom
out a little bit as you can see here we
have the same sort of ratio 1 to 2 to 3
it's just vertical now what kind of
other layout attributes do we have well
instead of illustrating all these just
by typing and refreshing I'm going to
take it straight to polymers
documentation and we'll scroll down here
and we can see that we have some other
items here so we have Center it's going
to vertically sent our elements in a
horizontal layout using start or end we
can position things at the top or bottom
we can come down you can see other types
of ones with the - justified so we have
start justified center justified and
justified and you could just really
check out all of these different ones
where we can have around justified where
it makes everything totally as far
separate as they can be and and as you
can see it just keeps on getting cooler
and cooler with all of these different
layout attributes so between all of
these different attributes and
containers you
be able to create some pretty cool
layouts now there's also some
general-purpose ones as you can see down
here like block hidden relative and fit
block make something display:block
hidden display:none relative position
relative and those are your layout
attributes now I'm still on the fence
about how I feel about layout attributes
I typically like to keep my styling in
CSS my layouts in CSS however I can
definitely see how these could become
super useful when used in the right way
obviously if you're loading up your
document with all sorts of these
attributes it might not be the best
solution but then again it still just
listed as experimental so just like most
things with polymer it's a lot of fun to
play around with right now but I don't
know if I'd go ahead and using it on any
sort of important project so check it
out layout attributes using polymer as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments like a comment a video or hit
us up at Facebook or Twitter at level up
Tut's we love to hear from me thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
