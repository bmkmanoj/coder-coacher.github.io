up tuts and today I'm going to be
showing you how to quickly mock up
Twitter bootstrap sites using sketch 3
using the Twitter bootstrap UI kit for
sketch now like the other UI kids that
we've gone over it has a whole bunch of
symbols that are components in bootstrap
so that you can quickly mock-up your
designs and have the same tools and
environment that you're going to be
using to code in it's extremely helpful
for not only mocking up sites quick but
starting designs for sites that you know
are going to be using bootstrap so check
it out we're going to get started now I
just have one more UI kit to show you
and that's the bootstrap 3 vector UI kit
now this web URL is bootstrap UI kit
comm once again I'm going to link to
this page into the kata the description
of the video so you can find it easily
and what you just need to do is click
download here and it's going to download
a zip that includes UI kit in
illustrator Acrobat or sketch and
sketches of course the one that we want
so let's go ahead and download that
which I already have you can see we have
the AI the PDF and our sketch file so
now let's go ahead and open up the
sketch file and see how it compares to
the foundation UI kit that we were just
using now first off you're going to
notice some things are a very different
now we do have some nice things here we
have all of these icons in as vectors we
can pretty much grab any single one of
those and use it like we want duplicated
whatever we have all of our bootstrap
items like you'd expect our alerts our
labels we even have some examples where
we have a login page a login error and
we have some further examples like
tables and different styles of tables
with things like stars
we have form elements
and we even have some basic page little
messages we have our dashboard style
page and we have a little chat window
and of course there is some information
about after play the company that has
made this uikit now the great thing
about this UI kit is just how much stuff
it includes the bummer about this UI kit
is that if we come to sketch symbol
there are no symbols defined now you
could get going creating and defining
your own symbols but for the most part
with this sketch UI kit you're going to
be copying and pasting and moving around
things and this actually makes it very
apparent just how powerful symbols are
when you're comparing this to the
foundation UI kit now there very well
may be another bootstrap 3 UI kit out
there that I haven't found or still
being created so if that is created
after this video is released with
symbols please somebody post a link to
that and it could really help out
everybody but for now I think the best
course of strategy with this UI kit is
to go ahead and create a new artboard on
your same page if you're not going to
create symbols we can just go ahead and
say create a desktop artboard and we can
drag this maybe over here might be a
little bit easier to see and then from
there you could copy elements like your
top menu simply by selecting in left bar
here copying selecting your new artboard
and command V to paste now let's zoom in
here and likewise we did before with
this element selected we could say be at
0 0 and then we want the width to be
1024 and then the height adjusts
accordingly so now we have this top bar
that fills up the top of our new desktop
page here and we're able to grab compose
simply by coming over and finding them
as needed and moving them into our
document again I can copy this simply by
selecting it command C clicking in our
new artboard and then command paste and
now we have this over on our new our new
artboard so that's going to be the way
that you work in a file like this a
UIKit like this without predefined
symbols now if somebody's really
ambitious you could go through and make
symbols out of everything in here and
that would maybe take a while and maybe
by the time you've done that somebody's
already going to have it but either way
if you do that again like I said post it
up share with the world I'm sure a lot
of people would be very happy to have
that okay so this is the bootstrap 3 UI
kit if you use bootstrap and you mock-up
or design websites then this UI kit is
going to help you out a ton so check it
out start mocking up your pages use it
to create some great stuff and then code
it up as always this is Scott would love
love tuts you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video or
hit us up at Facebook or Twitter or
pretty much anywhere we love to hear
from you thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
