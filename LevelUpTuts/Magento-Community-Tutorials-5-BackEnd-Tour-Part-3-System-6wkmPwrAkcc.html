of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
some more of Magento's back end so what
we're going to go over today is the
system section here and there's quite a
bit to go over so we might as well just
start at the top here and first up is at
my account so let's click on this as you
can see it's really just your
information for your user account as you
can see my username my first name my
last name my email and you can set a new
password here so if you want to send new
password no problem new password and
password confirmation save account you
got yourself a new password or if you
want to change anything let's say you're
passing over the reins to another owner
of the site you can go ahead and put
their information in here
next we're going to go up to
notifications in notifications basically
I don't know if you remember in the
first tutorial when we first installed
Magento and loaded it up there is a box
that popped up and I had some
information about a new version
available well any time you know that
the Gentle team pushes a notification
it'll show up when you first log in and
it will show up in here you can mark
them as being red of course you can
select all actions mark is red or
removed I have all of mine removed as I
frequently do read them and just remove
them however if you like to hold on to
that sort of thing you could mark them
as read and then just forget about them
so next up is tools so under tools we
have backups in compilation so if we
want to do a backup you can do a system
backup database backup database and
media compilation in compilation allows
you to compile all the files of a
Magento installation in order to create
a single path to increase performance so
you just click this run a compilation
process you know but before you use this
tool you have to make sure that the
directory and the file inside of your
the directory includes and the file
config dot PHP inside of your directory
includes need to both be writable before
you go ahead and do this so next up is
web services so this is if you're using
these the rest are any of these web
services I'm not going to go too deep
into these just show you that here's
what they where they exist if you need
to access them we will go over that in a
later tutorial design this is if you
want to add a design change you can add
a like a temporary design change let's
say you want to have a Christmas design
or you know whatever holiday or any sort
of a temporary design change you can
create a design change you know set what
stores from or what the design is here
and then set what dates is active from
okay so next we have import and export
okay so this is really great if you have
used in Magento on another site and you
have all these products that you want to
export out and you can reinforce them
into a Magento installation it's really
awesome and easy so if we were just go
to this export and you wanted to export
all of your products as a CSV here they
are we can select which ones of these
you want to skip let's not skip any of
them let's say continue and in one
second here it's just going to generate
us a CSV a show in finder really quick
show you this and here's a CSV with all
of the product information the
categories and everything so if you were
moving let's say possibly to a Magento
go site or a Magento enterprise site or
you just wanted to move some products to
another installation you can do that by
exporting them here and then using
import to import them we'll go over more
with that and how you can import
products and other things even maybe
import categories or your users in a
more in-depth tutorial on the
import/export feature so manage currency
let's go to rates here and here we're
just saying the currencies that we're
supporting are US dollars so that's
that's pretty much it if you want to
import something else you can here let's
go to symbols symbols is basic US dollar
it's using the standard dollar sign
symbol
you probably won't want to change any of
this when you set up your site in the
first place it's asking you what kind of
currency you're going to use and that's
going to set all of this for you so okay
next transaction oh emails so these are
where the email templates that are going
to live that for the emails that get
fired off when somebody makes anything
on your site let's say they buy
something and I make an account it's
going to send them an email and by
default Magento has sort of a set
standard using your phone number your
service email or things that you've
configured with your site if you want to
change those which you know you very
well may I think on most of the sites
I've ever done the user of this site has
requested that those be customized you
want to add a new template and we'll go
over more in-depth on how to do that in
a later tutorial but just so if you want
to get to that stuff it's under
transactional emails okay custom
variables this if you want to set
site-wide variables you can create a
variable in here let's say something
you're going to be using all over the
site that you don't want to have to go
and change like your phone number or
anything like that
although the phone number is in a
different part of your site it's just an
example if you're having any sort of
persistent variable that you're going to
want to keep around your site
permissions is exactly what it sounds
like you can give permissions to various
users let's click on me since I'm the
admin my user role I'm an administrator
let's go to users or roles I'm sorry
so administrators these are the
permissions that rolls have or the
administrator role has resource access
all pretty much if your administrator
you have access to the whole thing you
can set up different sort of permissions
so that people can use various aspects
of the site so let's say a person who's
just able to add products you don't want
them changing around you know the
configuration or the
pay the payment part or anything like
that you can set that up in there okay
also we have Magento connect and Magento
connect is how you can add extensions
this connect manager and this is just
really a way that you can update your
Magento
and check for upgrades you could install
packages via this extension key I'm
gonna go over this in a whole nother
tutorial there's some interesting and
some complex things here we're not going
to go into it right now but if you want
to update that's where it is
okay back to Magento cash management if
you need to clear your cache select all
flush cash flush cash storage actions
yeah so you can flush your images cash
flows your JavaScript CSS any of that
stuff right here if you need to and then
index management if you need to refresh
your index you can select all and you
need to reinvest your data submit no
problem nice and easy
manage stores so this if you have
multiple stores like the demo comes with
an English French and a German store
they're both using the main store and
the main website so if you want to
create a new store create a new web
store or create a store view you know
this is where you'll do it we'll go over
what entail what that entails and how
you can have like a a quite large site
by having different stores store views
using the same database and thus a
Magento install in order statuses these
are all your order statuses
notice how when print some of the places
in order it's probably going to go into
pending there's also all sorts of ones
depending on the width your process is
set up but here's pending payment review
fraud processing you can put your
payment into any of these states or you
can create a new status and assign a
status to a state nice and useful here
okay well this is the system the next
one is configuration and configuration
is a beast so we're going to take a
whole video to talk about configuration
as it's really important and it's sort
of the backbone of your site when you're
setting up your site you're going to be
in here more often than anywhere else
okay once again this is Scott with level
up tuts

questions please leave a comment in the
