of tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be talking about what is CSS grid
now maybe you've heard people talk about
CSS grid and thought I can't use it yet
it's too futuristic well we're gonna be
talking about the sort of compatibility
can you use it should I learn a now
should I learn it next year what should
I do about CSS grid I'm not gonna get so
much into how to use CSS grid but I'm
gonna give you some learning resources
so you can learn the history of CSS grid
the syntax of CSS grid and some
practical ways that you can learn to CSS
grid so again we're gonna be talking all
things what it is when you should use it
how you should learn it that sort of
stuff right now
okay so in this what is Wednesday I
wanted to do something pretty topical
here considering the modern CSS layouts
course was just released yesterday for
level up tutorials and in this course I
teach CSS grid along with flexbox pretty
extensively where we go over sort of you
know how to use grid in practical
layouts now what exactly is CSS grid cuz
it's really easy to just think okay it's
a basic grid and in fact diet I made
these sort of diagrams here to sort of
talk a little bit about what grid is so
before we get into that let's talk a
little bit about what exactly CSS grid
is it's a new layout engine in CSS now
does grid replace the need to use floats
or flexbox or any of the stuff you use
before well in my opinion it largely
replaces the need to use any sort of
float based layout however those tools
aren't going away so it's just going to
augment your skills and whatever you're
doing basically it's taking a new way of
writing your CSS layouts and individual
macro and micro layouts and making
everything 8-ton nicer now I've seen in
the comments before it referred to as
well back to using tables for laying out
your your HTML
that couldn't be any further from the
truth the CSS grid is by no means HTML
tables and if you think that then you're
gonna need to go ahead and reevaluate
everything you know about CSS grid this
is something that you're gonna want to
add to your tool belt absolutely right
away so whether it's through level up
Tut's or some other means you're going
to want to learn CSS grit because before
you know it everyone in every layout on
CSS will be done with CSS grid so let's
talk a little bit about well the grid
itself this isn't going to be a tutorial
on grids but I want to go over some
basic concepts here so I've put together
some diagrams to help illustrate some of
these terms you can see just a series of
grid cells and sort of like boxes right
and we have something like a grid line
and this is the lines in between your
grid cells right just like that we have
a grid cell itself we have what's called
a track which is several grid cells
which aren't placed in between two lines
like a grid track can be both vertical
and horizontal right this is a grid
track then we have something like a grid
area where it's a section of your your
grid that takes up between four lines
right it's basically just a section of
your grid and so with grid you think of
it as like I mentioned before people
will criticize it as being a table
layout or something stupid like that but
it really is so much more than that
because well we have total access to
anything this is grid by example.com
forward-slash examples it's and this is
just a really good idea to check this
out to sort of open your brain as to
what's even possible if not a great
learning resource for grid but you can
see you can have a really standard grid
or you can even place individual items
wherever the heck you want them and you
can have items spanning multiple columns
and multiple rows and you can do all
sorts of automatic positioning of call
this stuff basically the CSS grid is the
most flexible most well thought out
thing I've ever seen in CSS it allows
you to do just some absolutely amazing
stuff
with very little code and the best part
of all it allows us to abandon things
like clear fixes and floats and stuff
like that then only that we get access
to some properties that became available
to us with flexbox like justify content
so if you have something that's display
grid and there's some grid children you
can now quickly and easily just play
something in the center of your div and
how long has that always been a thing
like a question on Stack Overflow how do
I Center this text in this div so you
can now do it extremely easily with CSS
grid so like I said CSS grid by example
or just grid by example.com is a great
way where you can see some really
complex grid examples but also just wrap
your head around the idea of what is
possible with CSS grid because seriously
anything is possible with CSS grid I've
even gone ahead in in my modern CSS
layouts course I've recreated Scott
Olinsky calm here using CSS grid where
typically in the past you'd have this
video that's positioned absolutely in
the background here and now I can do
this all with CSS grid having this be a
grid row this be a grid row this be a
grid row and the background itself be
its own grid row and it's not using
position:absolute at all and that you
get some nice things like a free sticky
footer and stuff like that out of it so
like I said the CSS grid is just
absolutely flexible and insanely useful
and it just blows your mind all of the
cool stuff you could do again this is
not table layouts so let's talk a little
bit about some of the cool things that
you can do in my modern CSS layouts
course I'm not trying to make this an
advertisement but you can see here we
actually recreate the TweetDeck layout
where it allows you to infinitely span
columns right if we were to add more
columns this would work if we were to
add more tweets this would scroll and
everything is done without
position:absolute without position fixed
this is all a CSS grid and I'm using the
Firefox dev tools here which is
absolutely essential if you are working
with CSS grid from the developer's
edition of firefox there's a little
Layout tab you can click this and see
your grid down here let me even pull
this up you can even
get a diagram of your grid and hover
over the different grid cells super cool
stuff so these these tools only make
your life infinitely easier when working
with grid now let's talk about
compatibility because they obviously
that is something that is on everyone's
mind and we're seeing a ton of green
here I mean it's been in chrome since
version 60 has been Firefox in this
version 52 it's in Microsoft edge and as
it has limited support in IE 11 and you
could check out exactly what that
limited support is now it's got a big
old red from Opera Mini you see browser
for Android Samsung browser for Android
although I think it's coming in the next
version of Samsung I'm not entirely
positive about that but as you can see
here some of this red doesn't really
matter because how many times does your
grid or your layout break down into a
single column on mobile so that's
something to think about right because
if the browser doesn't understand grid
it's just gonna break down so maybe if
your Samsung internet browser is just
going one column it's not that big of a
deal this is obviously something you
want to make sure is good for your
customers now I am using CSS grid on
level of tutorials calm right now effect
if I head to the store section this
right here is a CSS grid and we can even
inspect this if you have Firefox dev
tools open you can inspect it click on
layout we can check this checkbox and
see my grid my even spacing between all
of my different grid tracks and stuff
like that everything is looking super
cool so this is CSS grid and here it is
being used in live production code so
check your can I use list make sure you
know what your audience is using before
you go ahead and use this my opinion is
whether or not you're using this on
client sites right now or not you need
to be using this in all of your personal
projects or code pens or stuff you're
messing around with because it is
absolutely going to be vital to know CSS
grid moving forward again if you think
this is HTML table layouts you are going
to get left behind and of course in this
industry
it sucks get left behind because it's
hard to get back
in you know the swing of things because
there's just too much to learn so CSS
grid is something you need to focus your
attention on and I emphasize that very
strongly if you want to learn more about
CSS grid there's a dope syntax episode
for CSS grid syntax FM if you do not
know is the podcast I do with West boss
for most boss and I basically we just
talked about web dev stuff and episode
18 is all about CSS grit we talk about
all sorts of great learning resources we
talk about different techniques and
examples it's really good episode
especially if you're interested in the
stuff and you haven't yet checked out
syntax so syntax dot F M episode number
eighteen I'll link this in the
description as well now another good
thing to do is read this a list apart
the story of CSS grid from its creators
this gives you a long and detailed
history about everyone involved in CSS
grid and basically how CSS grid has been
essentially a part of CSS for a very
long time and in terms of people wanting
to get it added and different layout
specs that have been attempted to be
added to CSS and how we finally got a
write in what I consider the most
flexible most excellent addition to CSS
in a very very long time ok so check out
this list apart the story of CSS grid
from its creators great article one of
the best I've read again the syntax
episode 18 and if you want to learn CSS
grid you can always go to this screwed
by example for calm forward slash
examples if you're the type of person
who learns better by checking out
examples and if you want a video to
teach you I mean why not promote my own
here we have level up tutorials comport
slash store the modern CSS layouts
course is on sale it just came out
yesterday it's 17 long videos they're
some 18 17 minutes long and just
absolutely great stuff you get all of
the code examples and I teach you how to
build several different layouts so we
build Scott Olinsky calm we build tweet
deck we build Facebook and we built
Instagram and each of those examples
teaches you a little bit more about CSS
grid as well as when they use flexbox
first when to use grid in different
types of situations
so this is CSS grid like I said it is
going to replace everything you know and
love about layouts and CSS and you will
absolutely love it once you get going
using it so as always thanks so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
one
