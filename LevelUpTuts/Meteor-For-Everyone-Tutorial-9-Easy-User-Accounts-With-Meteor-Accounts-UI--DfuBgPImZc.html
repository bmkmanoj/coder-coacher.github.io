up tutorials and today we're gonna be
covering how you can easily add user
accounts to your meteor site and we're
gonna do so with another package called
accounts UI that allows us to drop in a
login form without having to write any
code at all it's really just going to be
with one meteor helper no that's not
going to be ideal for every situation
but it's really great to get up and
going on a project that you don't want
to have to spend too much time on to
test things out so in later videos we're
going to show you how exactly you can
build a custom login form however for
this example we're gonna take account
and accounts UI and build a login system
right now so we have our application
here and it's great but we want to
personalize it a little bit more we want
to give users the ability to log in have
user accounts and that's sort of the
functionality that you probably want on
a lot of sites so it makes sense to
throw it in here so that we can get
experience and see just how easy adding
accounts and accounts UI is to meteor so
let's head to our terminal and add a new
package so from here we can just do our
meteor add like we have been already now
there's a couple of packages we want to
add the first is accounts and - password
ok now the next is going to be accounts
- UI now count - password is gonna give
us the ability to log in with the
password and accounts ui is going to
give us a basic user interface then
we're gonna have to do absolutely
nothing to do to drop into our site it's
really just one template tag and meteor
will take care of the rest so let's go
ahead and enter and add those to our
project here
now as you can see everything's been
added it added accounts base accounts
password accounts UI and accounts UI
unstyled along with some other stuff
that we're not actually going to be
worrying about too much so let's head
back and let's check out our code so
here we have our site now what we want
to do is go ahead and drop in this new
login template helper so if we've seen
these help layers before to load up a
template and it does so with the greater
than sign so let's go ahead and add that
and I'm gonna do so just at the bottom
of this container here just so it's sort
of out of the way and right here at the
very bottom before the body I can do
greater than space and then the name of
the template is login buttons just like
that login buttons plural now you can
see this unstyled is sort of just sign
in a text link right down here exist
directly below our container in fact
let's go ahead and put it in the
container just to make it seem a little
less odd speed right down there so just
right here within this last div okay so
we now have this sign-in text here and
you'll notice when we click it it opens
up this modal window that gives us the
option to enter an email and password
and sign in or it allows you to create
an account by entering your email and
password and create an account well
let's say we wanted to sign in with not
an email but just a a username you don't
want to make your users submit an email
especially if you're not gonna use it
so to give them the ability to just have
a username it's kind of nice so let's go
ahead and modify this to allow us to use
that option so let's head back to our
JavaScript and in our meteor is client
if statement let's actually put this at
the bottom so right before the closing
bracket let's modify the account
you I can fig so we can say accounts dot
you i dot config and we can pass this
config object some parameters so one of
the parameters we can pass it is
password signup fields and what we can
do is in a string just say user name
underscore only just like that and let's
finish it off with a semicolon here and
let's head back to our browser so
accounts that you i dot config password
signup fields and password salmon fields
is camel cased user name underscore only
is all caps okay so now if we head back
to our application now when we select
this you'll see that instead of email it
gives us the option for a username and
password so now what we can do is click
create account and we can ask for a
username so let's just have a username
and say admin you can give this a
password and I'm just gonna have a one
character password just because and
let's click create well you'll notice
it's actually giving us an error message
so by default it wants us to have
passwords that are six characters long
but that's really the only specification
that it needs by default so let's go
ahead and actually make a real password
click create account and just like that
were signed in so with absolutely almost
no code right we have essentially one
line modifying it and then we have a
helper tag but we've just added user
accounts no adding user accounts to a
lot of other sticks is not as much fun
as this this is really super simple and
it can be a little bit more complex once
we get into custom login forms and stuff
like that but it's really not that much
more complex now let's say we only want
users to be able to submit posts so we
only want to give them the ability to
have this submit here and this form if
they are logged in so let's go back to
our HTML and what's great is that this
comes with a built-in helper that allows
us to do just that
so let's come to our our label and our
form input here where we have this new
resolution so around this new resolution
form we can do is simply wrap this in a
if so we do pound if and the helper
function here is going to be current and
then user and camel case just like this
and now we can end this with /if to
close it out so what this is checking is
really just if anyone is logged in so if
we come back to our page and refresh
you'll see that we certainly get this
form however if we click our own
username right here and then click sign
out our form is completely gone so once
again leases I'm in with our username
and password and the form returns
immediately it's great all this stuff
happens without page refreshes it's a
nice modern experience cool so we now
have some accounts we now have the
ability for users to create accounts
login anything like that in the next
couple of videos we're going to be
working more with users going to show
you how to use user data throughout
things so we can attach a user into a
particular resolution and then perhaps
only show that users resolutions to that
user
therefore everybody's gonna have their
own rubb monthly resolution sheet and
you're not gonna be seeing each other
sheets also we're gonna be able to log
in with Facebook log in with Google log
in with Twitter all that stuff just as
easily as we're able to build logins in
the first
so keep watching we're gonna do a lot
more cool stuff with user accounts in
the next few videos as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
