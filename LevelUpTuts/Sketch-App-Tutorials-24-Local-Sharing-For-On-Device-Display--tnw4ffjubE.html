up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be talking about the new feature
in 3.4 that allows you to share your
artboards up to a web page on your local
network that allows you to view these
artboards on any device computer or
phone so let's get going on that right
now now one of the best new features in
three-point-four is the ability to
essentially send your entire project
here up to a URL that's available on
your own network now this is super easy
simply by seeing this share button here
in your toolbar we can select this and
click enable local sharing now what you
can see as it opens a tab on your local
browser with an address here now we have
several ways of getting to this address
but if you're using Chrome and you're
signed in and you're signed in to Chrome
on your device there's a really super
easy way to do so so you can see this
URL and let's head to my phone here so
you can see this in action so I have a
new tab open up on my device and as you
can see we can come in here and select
the recent tabs now under recent tabs
you'll find all the devices you're
logged into for instance I'm logged in
to this heck intosh here it's one of
these links here so as you can see in
our browser on your computer it will say
the name of the document for instance we
have a sketch
phlex prototype is the name of the
document itself
so we could simply type in that long URL
that we saw it with 10012 and then colon
8080 that sort of thing and you can
certainly get to this page as long as
your phone is on the same Internet
network that's an important point here
is you need to be on the correct
internet network as their computer that
you're broadcasting this from but as you
can see in my recent tabs we do have the
latest sketch
phlex prototype right here so I can just
simply select that and as long as I'm on
the same network you'll be seeing your
artboards now this is great we have
access to
every single airport including the one
that is actually the phone layout so if
we select this it's gonna open this up
in a modal now this dimensions aren't
exactly the same as what it is on this
device for instance I think the phone
layout we used was for an iPhone this is
a nexus 6p but I can simply pinch and
zoom and see this a little bit more of
what it would actually be like on a
device rather than just having this be
on a computer screen and not a device at
all you can also swipe between artboards
like this if you want as well but as you
can see it's definitely a nice little
feature to have into this we no longer
just have screen mirroring on iOS but
you can also broadcast this now to a URL
and access it on your own network on any
device any other computer any other
tablet anything you want just type in
that same URL make sure you're on the
same network and you will have access to
this screen now in addition here we also
have this fullscreen button if we select
this you can see we just go into a sort
of a full-screen mode we could select
our artboard and make seeing all this
just a little bit easier but I think
bohemian coding did a great job with
this this is uh one of my new favorite
features and sketch you're gonna be able
to see your designs and now even if I
wanted to take some promotional shots of
this right like let's say I wanted to
take a photograph of what this
application looks like on the screen I
can do that and it's not just going to
be a prototype you're going to actually
be photographing something that's real
on a real screen cool so this is sharing
a sketch art board on your network and
you can use it on any device within the
new sketch three-point-four update check
