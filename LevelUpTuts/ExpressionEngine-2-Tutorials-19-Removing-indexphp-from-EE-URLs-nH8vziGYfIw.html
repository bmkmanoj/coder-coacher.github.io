with level up Tut's today we're going to
cook recover removing the index dot PHP
within your the URL of your expression
engine sites before we do that
as always I'd like you to encourage you
guys to subscribe to our YouTube channel
you can also follow us at level up tuts
on twitter and our website is level of
Tut's comm which is really still in
development but I mean go there and sort
of see what's going on anyway
so let's go ahead and get back into this
again so when you first install
expression engine what you'll find is
this index dot PHP it's the same thing
with Joomla actually and Drupal it's
sort of the same it's a little bit
different it's but basically the idea is
you want the the goal is to have
prettier or cleaner URLs besides them
just being sort of aesthetically
pleasing
there's obviously also a benefit for
search engine optimization all right so
what we've done is we've created a page
in the last tutorial or one of the last
tutorials and there's just a static page
using the page module and it lives at
index.php slash about but what would
happen is you know once you start
developing your site more so you have a
new section to your site it would be
news so this is the template group and
then maybe we would use the new news new
template and then like on an our babies
ate detail and then you know the title
of the news article so this URL would be
pretty nice except for this index dot
PHP so we are going to cover the
expression engine recommended way for
moving this in earlier versions of
expression engine expression engine one
you really there was two methods of
handling it but they were really not
sanctioned necessarily by expression
engine where else labs but now with
expression engine two they have a
recommended way and that's the method
that we're going to be looking at so
it's a three part method really the
first the first thing what we need to do
is create a dot htaccess file and this
file should live at the root of your
site folder for expression engine so it
should live in the same I should lever
the same file level as the index dot PHP
in admin dot PHP so I'll go ahead and
login to my site I'm just using transmit
but you can use any you know FTP program
you want and here we're seeing the admin
dot PHP index dot PHP but there's no
htaccess file if you're wondering why
one wasn't uploaded it I don't really
remember if it they're not included by
default but as an invisible file so if
you don't have if you're not able to see
invisible files on your system which by
default you do not then it could be that
you just your files system didn't upload
it or when you when you uploaded it to
the server
it just didn't select it because it was
invisible because on Macs if a file
starts with a dot then that means it's
invisible
so really all we're doing is we're
creating a file called htaccess
sometimes they show invisible and right
so now we just created this empty file
I'm gonna go ahead and open that up
oh whoops so I have an open up a text
file on
this version yet let's see here all
right empty pot so now all we're gonna
do and I'll link to this in the episode
notes we're gonna copy and paste this
code and what this is doing is it's
checking to see if mod rewrite is
installed and enable on your Apache
server which it probably is in most
cases in most hosting environments it is
the ocean environment environment and
I'm currently in is media temple but you
know I've done expression engine sites
on many hosting environments and mob pre
write is has always been enabled it's
just been some university settings where
you have to request it or something but
typically that is something that's
included you can check to see if it's
included by running like a PHP info PHP
function and it will tell you what
what's installed and then if you just do
a search for rewrite you should see it
there alright so this is your first time
even learning about htaccess there's
there's a lot to cover but we were not
we're really not going to get into that
just the basics we're saying is first
we're saying if mod rewrite is even
available then we're going to do this
stuff
this module isn't installed or isn't
enabled then it's just really gonna skip
over this which is just a nice way to
sort of wrap this function and then it's
turning on the rewrite engine anything
that starts with a pound or hash symbol
is a comment than htaccess and then
really what the rest of this is saying
is you know we're gonna remove this
index dot PHP and one one thing to point
out in some hosting environments
this note says here if you're running
into issues what you could try to do is
add this question mark here I know that
in some hosting environments that had to
have to do that and really what I do is
try to see if this works and if this
doesn't works and typically that's all
that it will need trying to think maybe
maybe Rackspace I had to do that doesn't
matter really so I'm gonna go ahead and
hit save now I have that in here other
stuff that may go in and htaccess
if you need to increase some PHP values
for example memory limit that's a
popular one if you're doing like image
manipulation you may need to increase
your PHP memory and that's something
that can go in your htaccess file and
that what that will do is override your
PHP that I and I enough about that so
I'm gonna go ahead and save that I think
I've done that close it down so what
we've done so far is created the file
dump this in here and the last step what
we need to do is we need to remove
index.php from the general configuration
so i'm logged in over here admin general
configuration by default that's going
ahead and went ahead and plop this index
dot PHP in there I can go ahead and get
rid of that hit submit I can now go
ahead and refresh this about page just
didn't want to lose my spot so now what
I should be able to do is just go like
this hey what do you know I didn't it
looks like it didn't do anything but it
did if that htaccess wasn't wasn't there
we would have got probably the home page
in fact why don't I break it for a
second so I'm just gonna throw this axe
thing in here just that all that's doing
sorry all that's doing is just making it
so that I can't find the htaccess file I
could have just deleted this doll the
same now if I were to refresh this yeah
for for
for there is what I'm getting I work it
and even if I were to add in it got PHP
oh so if I use an industry okay right it
did find it this time because I spelled
out everything so I'm gonna go ahead and
just rename this so that it finds that
file again get rid of that and there we
go now we have clean URLs right and
that's it so I will link to this article
or removing index I PHP from our
expression URLs I'll put that in the
show notes and if you guys have any
questions on it definitely let me know
alright well that's it that's all we're
gonna cover in this in this video in the
next video we're gonna start covering
expressions in the expression engine
module preformed by sole space so check
that one out
alright thanks a lot for watching take
care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
