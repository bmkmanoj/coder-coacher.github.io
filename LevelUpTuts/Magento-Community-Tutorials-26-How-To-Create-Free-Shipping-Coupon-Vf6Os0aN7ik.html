up Hudson today I'm going to show you
how to create a simple coupon code
that's going to give someone shopping at
your store free shipping and so you can
use this coupon code for maybe a
promotion and they can enter it for free
shipping or you can hand it out to
certain people that you would like maybe
special customers or something people
you want to have access to free shipping
so over the next couple of tutorials
we're going to get more involved in this
promotions tab right here because
there's all sorts of stuff it's really
complex and it's really cool
but it's not difficult so we're going to
go through everything you can do with
promotions but right now we're for the
very first one baby steps we're going to
keep it really simple so notice how this
is catalog price rules or shopping card
price rules this is going to be a
shopping cart price rule and what that
means is really just that these are
going to be something like that's going
to take an effect at the shopping cart
level not like a product level so this
isn't going to be a promotion where all
t-shirts are 50% off or something this
is going to be free shipping ok so we're
going to say rule name free shipping
coupon ok and I'm actually going to put
that in the description to just double
dip and we're going to have everybody is
available to use this let's say we only
wanted our wholesale people to use this
or maybe our general people or maybe
even just first-time customers people
that aren't logged in I don't know why
you do that but I want every every
customer group there is including this
QA AAA one we randomly created so uh and
you'll notice that this coupon with an
asterisk is set to no coupon by default
so what this means is usually or not
usually by default that's set up so that
there's certain conditions that would
allow you to get free shipping let's say
you buy pay for you buy like $100 worth
of a certain type of product you can get
free shipping well we're not doing that
because it's a little bit more complex
right now we're going to do specific
coupon and you can click this auto
generation and it's going to generate a
it's going to be able to generate
automatically multiple coupons we're
just going to write our own we're going
to say free 99 is the name of this
coupon I'm going to copy that uses per
coupon and this is I'm going to leave
this blank because it's infinity I'm
gonna you can use this as many times as
you like and uses per customer we'll
leave it to infinity as well and we're
going to say this starts today actually
this started already
so everybody listed okay and January
31st is what it ends we don't need a set
of priority right now we'll go over that
later public and RSS feed sure
conditions we don't have to have any
conditions because it's going to be true
for all products actions you can see all
these different actions you can apply to
the price a product discount a fixed
discount amount by X gift X free fixed
amount this kind of whole cart we want
to say free shipping for shipment with
matching items since it's going to be
all items and we don't need to stop any
further rules
so basically we're adding no percent
discount but we're adding free shipping
for matching items and since all that
all items are going to match it's going
to be free shipping for all items and
you can have this for specific stores
label whatever we don't need to do any
of this we'll just click Save and let's
go to our site so if you notice I
actually took this back to the default
theme right now it's because I haven't
styled any of these pages in this check
out I'd have an item to my cart here it
says computer and I have my discount
code here added I'm going to click apply
coupon and we're going to be seeing
something sort of weird here it says it
was applied but our shipping still says
$19 there's no there's no real anything
that's free nothing really says this
coupon has allowed me to have free
shipping well I know this is a bug or a
design flaw or something but to get this
working there is something you have to
do you have to come to system
configuration
and what we're going to do is we're
going to go to ship shipping methods and
we're going to turn on the free shipping
method and you might be thinking well if
we turn on this free shipping method
everyone's going to get free shipping
that's sort of true what you want to do
is you want to add sort of a gigantic
amount of the minimum order amount
something that nobody's ever going to
spend let's say this much I don't even
know how much it was I wasn't counting
my zeros when I was typing but if we
save that no one's ever going to spend
that amount at this store so the free
shipping method exists for people who
have spent that much money so now that
the free shipping methods turned on if I
apply this coupon I might actually have
to refresh this page before it finds
this but you'll notice I hit my apply
coupon and free shipping is now showing
up right here update my total free
shipping is going to be right here
free shipping let's say if I cancel my
coupon I don't want to use this coupon
anymore I don't know why I decided I
want to pay for shipping
you'll notice that free shipping is no
longer there again if I add it free
shipping is back we can apply this
updater total and move on perceive the
checkout and purchase our things with a
free shipping so if you were to use this
code and somebody it was to come here to
your store use this proceed to checkout
they would see this free shipping as an
option for the checkout screen once you
get down to shipping methods so I'm not
going to illustrate that because I don't
want to have to fill out all this
information but this is how you create a
free shipping coupon really quickly with
Magento and if you're having any
problems just follow these steps and
you'll get it working as always to Scott

questions please do this up on Twitter
you know we're on Facebook or YouTube
