level up tuts and today we're going to
be going over the second half of the
admin bar in Drupal 7 so picking up
where we left off we're going to head up
the modules page and this uh modules
page is something you will be visiting a
lot so what modules are under poll are
they're sort of added functionality
there's sort of blocks of functionality
that you add into this site to do all
sorts of stuff and that's really what
makes Drupal so powerful so on its own
the the base install of Drupal I don't
know how many sites would be just the
base version of Drupal with no
additional modules installed as in well
core modules included in that the core
modules are the ones that come with
Drupal so as you can see not all of them
are even turned on this gives you you
know contact site wide contact forms I
mean here's a discussion for arms is
turned off you know not all these you're
going to use so it really just when you
install Drupal it only installs the ones
that it thinks are the most used so as
you can see you know sometimes you might
depending on your needs you would turn
on maybe something like trigger that's
going to have an action happen when
something else happens for the most part
these these core modules won't cut it
for your whole site and the great thing
about Drupal is all of the additional
modules you can find on Drupal website
so if we go to drupal.org and then we go
to well you can just click on modules as
you can see there's over 15,000 modules
some of the most used ones are views
I personally use views on every project
it's sort of a way of displaying content
token paths Auto these are all things
that we're going to get into and the
spend some time on them when I install
them on our site but for now just know
that modules
a way to extend the functionality of
your site to install them we'll be going
over that process as well but once
they're installed they show up here and
then you can enable them and unable them
or you can access their permissions or
you configure them based on what that
module has to offer
next is configuration this is another
big one because configuration is where
you're going to find all sorts of stuff
and one of the things I want to do right
away is I want to add this performance
to the shortcut bar so that now would be
a good time to show you how to add
something to the shortcut bar clearing
the cache in Drupal or something you
will have to do frequently so I'm just
going to click this plus button that is
next to the name right here and it adds
it to my shortcut bar if I want to get
rid of it you can click it again sure
you want to delete this a shortcut yes
well because I want it let's leave it up
there as now you can see anytime you
click this shortcut it's going to take
you to this page and here you can also
aggregate and compress your CSS files
and Edgar great your JavaScript files
and that's something to that's good to
do once your site is live and working
because what that's going to do is it's
going to improve the load time of your
site so here's where you set up by your
caching stuff and here's where you clear
your cache if you need to so let's go
back to configuration and here we have
all sorts of stuff you can get into site
information this is you know you can add
a slogan this is sort of sort of some
front page stuff and at the tutorial
we're going to be making our own front
page and not using their default front
page you can set a 404 page yeah there's
really a lot in here so we're going to
be going over a lot of these
individually in their own tutorials but
feel free to poke around here and just
sort of see what this configuration menu
has to offer you know if you need to
change your your regional settings
here you can set up image styles where
that when you would upload an image or
when you're displaying an image it's
going to create a cached version of it
that looks a certain way for you this
actually used to be a separate module
called image cache but in Drupal 7 it's
built right in here you can also find
things about logging and errors you can
put your site into maintenance mode if
you're updating so that people don't see
that you're offline you can have your
own customized message saying you know
what that you're updating or something
you know
so in reports reports are really good if
you are having problems this is where
you're going to want to come you know
you can get general status reports but I
like to visit this recent log messages
if something weird is happening this
pretty much keeps a record of everything
that's happening as you can see because
we installed the site it's pretty much
installing all these modules and that
all happened when we installed the site
and then helped you know I hope it's
going to take you to help help content
that sort of tells you how to use this
stuff I don't really use help that much
but it would be helpful if you want to
learn about some of the functionality in
Drupal so this overlay menu this is just
a setting some people turn this off I
usually just leave this overlay menu on
if you click off of this you're back on
your site here so one last thing if you
want to log out of your admin you can
click this log out and it's going to
kick you back here
if you've configured your site to not
have this user login right here in the
home page because personally I'd you
know don't usually have that on there
unless you know clients need to log in
or or if it's a site where lots of
people have accounts you know they'll
want to log in on the home page or
usually set up a link to it you know
either open up a modal box or take them
to another page where they can log in
but let's just say this user boxes in
here to log in you just simply browse to
user
then it comes up here with your username
and password okay well that's it for the
menu bar in the next lesson we're going
to show you how to install a theme
once again this is Scott with level up
