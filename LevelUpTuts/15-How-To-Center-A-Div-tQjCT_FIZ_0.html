of tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
show you how we can take that to column
layout put it in a div and have that div
centered now this centering a div
technique is going to work anywhere that
you need to Center a dividing piece of
content itself or any block level
content for that matter so let's get
going on that right now this video we
got to separate our two columns out into
a two column layout here and if you'll
notice when we resize our browser
resizes quite nicely until we get down
really to mobile but we haven't really
talked about that aspect of building
websites yet however you can see we have
a nice flexible two column layout here
the only problem is once we give way way
way big here it looks like everything's
just too far apart not to mention our
content here we don't actually want this
pushed up directly against the left side
of the screen well we do however one is
this content the main column and the
sidebar to both be centered in the page
with the width of about 90% so let's go
ahead and see how we would accomplish
that the first step would be adding a
div around these two sections now if you
remember a div tag is really just a
divider tag and this is a tag that
allows you to essentially wrap around
content and you can give it a class and
do things with essentially before
section and aside were available and
main all we had were div tags and we
just threw div tags to wrap everything
so let's go ahead and give this a class
and this class is going to be it's just
going to be column wrapper like so and
we're gonna copy this class and save
this and now let's head over to our CSS
listener to keep things in order I
usually like to have my class names if
it's a small app like this just sort of
in the general order of things that way
you know where to find things I actually
have a quite more elaborate method for
organizing and laying out my style
sheets on larger projects however for
this project just putting things in
order is a good idea
so now we have Cullum - rapper and we
can go ahead and say width of 90% okay
now when we refresh this you'll see it
worked if we check out our inspect
element just somewhere around here we
inspect the div that is rapping here
you'll notice a couple of things usually
when you highlight over things there
they get this background color we're
hovering over this and we don't see that
background color well one of the reasons
why both of the children of this div are
being floating are being floated and you
saw that happen with our header when our
header head items floated in it it did
not have any height because it requires
the document flow for height so if you
remember in that video to fix that we
actually had to use a clear fix now we
added a clear fix class to our project
and we simply just dropped in that
clearfix class onto the header so let's
come down here and paste in the clear
fix class on our column wrapper as well
let's refresh okay and now you'll notice
something the footer information
actually jumped down quite a bit because
now the wrapper has the height of the
tallest element inside of it now this is
accomplished just by having a clear fix
so we added a width of 90% and since
both of the children of this both had a
percentage based width
they both scaled correctly to match the
correct size so nothing got pushed out
or anything like that
however it's it's still on the left here
this isn't centered so what's a good
technique for centering a div well the
center div you need a couple of things
you need it to essentially have some
kind of width pixel based percentage
base width it just needs to have a width
and then you need to say margin and in
this case we're going to get the top and
bottom margin of zero because we don't
actually want a top or margin bottom at
this point and then we're going to give
it a left and right margin of auto so
Auto essentially is going to autumn
matically calculate the left and right
margin for us and now when we refresh
our page you can see that the learn
level up and our sidebar are now both
centered in this page and we check this
out you can see that we have equal left
and right margins here perfect so this
is how you Center a div with CSS now if
you're trying to Center other things
let's say text if you're trying to
Center this headline that there is a
text-align:center property that you can
use to align text however you're trying
to line buttons or or links or really
anything that's not a display inline
inside of a blade block element you can
actually give that display block and
then a width and then a margin:0 auto
just like we did for this to Center
pretty much any element cool so this
layouts really starting to come together
in the next video we're going to make
our footer work and just look a little
bit nicer here and then we can continue
making this site better and better until
we have like a really nice working
website and by that point you should
have a great handle on the foundations
of building your first website so as
always this is Scott what level of
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments if it come in the video I'll
hit me up at Twitter or Facebook i level
up tutorials I'd love to hear from you
thanks for watching and i'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
