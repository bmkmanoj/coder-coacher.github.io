up Hudson today we're going to be
talking about padding in CSS so a couple
of lessons ago we went over margin and
we were able to Center our div here and
we're able to add a margin on the top
and the bottom and so now we're going to
show you what padding is and sometimes
people get padding a little confused
with margin because it does something
similar so when you have margin you're
applying the margin to the thing you
want to move so in this case we had this
big white box and we wanted this box to
move itself so we applied margin and it
has that margin on the box
but what say we want the content within
this box to be pushed in so instead of
the div itself being you know positioned
it's sort of like the content inside of
it is going to be pushed in so it's
adding padding to the inside so you can
sort of see how this is the box model
and with the box model as we went over
you have your margin then your border
then your padding and then your content
so the padding is going to be within
this border line here and it's going to
push the content inwards so to do that
let's actually take this content that we
have here of course we don't want it
right up against the edge and we're
going to apply some padding so let's
just go to our CSS and this was the
wrapper if you recall we give it a width
of 70% a height of 400 pixels background
a white and a margin of 50 pixels and
auto so now we're going to add some
padding so we're gonna add padding and
just like with margin as you can see we
can do margin or padding - left padding
- top bottom whatever or you can do the
shorthand the same way as margin so what
we're gonna head to do is we're going to
add an even padding to the sides and an
even padding to the top in the bottom
and it's just going to be a little bit
more for the top in the bottom so we'll
have let's say 40 pixels on the top and
bottom and then we're going to have 20
pixels on the sides so let's say this
and let's check out our page let's go to
refresh okay so now you can see we have
this this bit up top here this is our
pixels this is our I think we hit 40 and
this is 20 and this is 20 so even if we
shrink
this main content let's do that if we
shrink this once it hits that 20 right
there you could see even though this is
all scrunched in we have this 20 pixels
here it's never going to go outside of
that so let's pull this back here and
now if we click this in the we right
click and check out inspect as we've
been doing so far if you hover over your
wrapper div you can sort of see this box
model come into play here so the the
orange on the outside is the margin in
the green on the inside is the padding
and then of course you can see the
border there as well
if we go over here we can adjust these
values here if I modify this to be let's
say even we'll have this 20 pixels there
and let's add something even bigger 80
pixels you can see the difference it
made what it actually did is it added to
the width the total width of our div so
if we subtract this you'll notice yes
the padding moves in so does the width
of our object okay so any padding you
add by default with the CSS box model is
going to add to the total width so if
you run into a situation where you know
your box is supposed to be let's say 500
pixels wide and you know it's supposed
to have 20 pixels padding on it this
actually isn't exactly 500 pixels right
now if we hover over this look at the
value its 540 pixels so it's 500 plus
the 20 of the 2 padding so if you wanted
this to be total 500 pixels you would
have to have this at 460 pixels and now
if we hover over this you can see that
it's total now 500 pixels so there is a
way to get around this and uh actually
if I would recommend this article this
box sizing border box for the win by
Paul Irish this teaches you a little bit
a little snippet here you can add to
your code that instead of having these
things add to the total weight with it's
going to just be a part of this so like
I said read this for more information on
how to use this box sizing border box
I'll go over this in a tutorial later on
but right now
there's some more important stuff we
have to get through first for now just
know in this typical box model as long
as you're adding padding it's going to
add to your total width or height where
margin does not so this is padding in
CSS padding is the is the space between
the element border and the element
content okay it's space between your
border and your content so that's how
you add padding and adjust it and that's
pretty much the basics if you want to do
anything more you could feel free to
just mess around and do whatever you
want but padding is something that
you'll use very frequently in CSS along
with margin and many of the other CSS
properties as always if you have any
questions leave a comment the video hits
up a Twitter level up Tut's my twitter
is esto linskey even hit me up there too
but yeah so just let us know what you're
thinking and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
