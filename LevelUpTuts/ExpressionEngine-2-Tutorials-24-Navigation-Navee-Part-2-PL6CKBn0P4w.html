tuts today we're going to pick up where
we left off with our navigation system
in this video we're still using na'vi
and in the last video we covered
creating our navigation in this video
we're going to output it to the page so
let's go ahead and do that so we need to
go up one level and take a look at this
here this title main nap i'm gonna go
ahead and copy that so i have main
hyphen nav you're going to want to
remember whatever your title is and we
are going to output this to the page and
we need this because this works as the
channel name or title URL where you know
this is the unique identifier for this
this navigation ok so let's go into the
template manager includes you could use
the same menu and output it multiple
times on the page you could output it
you know like along the top area like up
here and then sort of sort of think
about like this so this is like one the
navs in this system and this is like a
sub nav that belongs to the template
manager so you can do that same type of
thing they're really just outputting a
nap twice but once you get inside of a
section maybe you only want to show the
children of that page so the na'vi is
really flexible you can do stuff just
like that so let's see here so i
actually created the header as a snippet
so what i'm actually going to do here is
just create a new template it's a new
template
it's call it nav I'm not going to change
anything here i'm going to create and
edit and i just want to show you how
this works so we in this example we're
going to use the expression engine na'vi
tag which is exp na'vi nav and then the
only required field is nav underscore
title and that's that that item that we
just copied and pasted from the previous
screen so i'm going to show you what
this looks like as is nothing special
and then we'll talk that through so i'm
going to go ahead and grab this I'm
update and finish this here we'll come
back to it and to actually output this
to the page I'm going to go into my
snippet and just add this to the header
right so whatever we'll put it put it
right here div with an ID and yeah sure
okay with an idea of Maine oops
navigation
okay oops embed equal okay so now we've
rebelling that template inside of the
snippet that you can finish that go over
here and give this refresh and there we
go so now we're seeing you know this is
obviously there's no Stiles attack but
what we're seeing is we're seeing a
nested unordered list so let's go ahead
and look at the code and it's a little
bit the white space is trimmed and all
that stuff we can still see so here's
that div that I created and here's the
UL and I'm on the home page that
automatically add the class is selected
and then so we're seeing you know one
list item we're seeing the bow list item
and before the about closes we have a
new UL for the child page that is the
level of Tut's link and then we're
seeing this properly all closing the
youth allies closed in the US closing
the ally then we're seeing the last Li
and that's the end of that close so this
is what you get out of the box nothing
special but it does so much and that
might be all you need just just that but
maybe you don't want to use the selected
class or maybe how about this maybe you
need the first item in the list and the
last item on the list to have a special
class because right like a lot of times
like the first item won't need any
margin or padding on the left and the
last won't need anything on the right if
you have like a horizontal navigation so
let's go through that example so let's
go back to that snippet or actually
whoops no let's go back to that template
I could have done it all in the snippet
really but
we chose not to so what we're going to
do here is we're going to add an
attribute called wolf do this let's
create an ID or an ID called main aur
Meena let's create um let's see here
we'll say first class think that's the
right thing we say first and we'll
create another one called last class
equals last and there's another really
handy one called max depth so maybe on
your main nav you really only want the
first level items and not the child
pages so you could say you know only
give me the depth of one and there's
actually a whole bunch of other
attributes that you can assign and you
can go ahead and look those up over on I
think it's under getting started
yeah here you go so there's a ton of
parameters that you can assign that I'm
not only not going to get into except
for I'll just talk about this one this
include ignore include in nav remember I
talked we talked about one of the
options in that last video where you can
say you know true true or false whether
you want that item to be in the nav or
not well here you can say override that
value so this is a pretty good example
of you know why you put it to false in
some cases maybe you want to override it
here using that parameter alright but
anyway so I don't think I hit save so I
didn't tell us it looks what's hit
update and let's go ahead and refresh to
see what we did here okay cool so now
it's loaded here and notice that the
level up Tut's is now hidden it's gone
let's let's refresh our source code real
slow here we go so whenever I give it an
idea of main nav the LI the first one is
still selected but it also has a class
of first the about just has right
there's no nested UL here and the last
one and the list has an item of last so
there you go that's that's how easy it
is to set up na'vi using the default
expression gin are their default
expression engine na'vi nav tag in the
next video what we're going to cover is
the expression engine na'vi custom nav
tag pair and talk through some scenarios
when you would use that thanks a lot for
watching really appreciate it and again
