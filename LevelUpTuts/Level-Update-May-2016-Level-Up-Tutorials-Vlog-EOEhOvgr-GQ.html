tutorials and then this level update i'm
going to share with you what's been
going on in level of tutorials in the
past few months now it's been a couple
of months since i released a level
update but that doesn't mean i haven't
been working hard in fact i've released
nearly six videos a week for the past
few months really just releasing more
and more content that I've ever released
before but the most important thing is
while that's been going on i've actually
been recording this really long exciting
and in-depth series on react native now
its next level react native for iOS and
Android and it's a series that teaches
you how to build real apps real native
apps that can be sent into the google
play store or the ios app store for
users to download and they use real
components and real aspects of the
actual ios and android operating systems
this is all built using react native
which is just JavaScript and it's
JavaScript through react and allows you
to create these actual native absolute
components it couldn't be any cooler so
I actually recorded over 59 videos and
the entire series at the longest version
is nearly nine hours long it's eight
point it's eight hours and 56 minutes or
so long so it's just about 9 hours of
content teaching you everything you need
to know about getting started with react
native now this is it the
all-encompassing guide because there's
just way too much there but it's really
more than enough to get you feeling
confident to actually build native apps
using the same tools that you're using
to build react and web apps and I
mentioned in the series it's not a
write-once deploy everywhere sort of
situation but it's more of a right
everywhere with the same knowledge and
tools they are used to so if you're
interested in learning how to build
native apps react native is a hundred
percent legit it's a really super cool
so head to store doubt level up
tutorials com or click the link and the
annotation or in the description of this
video and purchase next level react
they're for iOS and Android now if you
use the coupon code lunch you'll get ten
percent off and if you're already a pro
subscriber you'll get twenty percent off
so pro subscribers will automatically
get twenty percent off deducted when you
go to purchase this now this is a series
that's not going to be found anywhere
other than for purchase on store to
level up tutorials com so these videos
aren't going to be available for YouTube
however over the next week I will be
publishing samples trailers and all
sorts of stuff if you're sort of on the
edge and you want to see what you're
going to be getting now with nine hours
is a little too much there's also a
standard package which is only about six
hours long and it's a little bit cheaper
so there's a couple of package options
there based on how much and what your
commitment level is and how you're ready
to dive into react native so I wanted to
point out next level react native for
iOS and Android is up available right
now on the store doubt level up
tutorials com now that's not all pro
subscribers are also going to be getting
some cool new stuff this month a series
on get lab and a series on chart that
j/s are going to be both available for
early access for pro subscribers and
Magento two videos are going to be
coming as well so if you're pro
subscriber don't worry about the next
level series being paid and purchase
only there's a lot of content coming for
you as well that's all going to be
included within your subscription now
whether than that I'm hard at work on
improving experience on both level up
tutorials and stored out level up
tutorials com so you'll see a lot of
both visual and functional updates to
the sites coming this month I'm going to
be hard at work I'm going to be making
pro subscription features better easier
to access everything so although I've
been a little quiet the past couple of
months I've been extremely busy and in
May there's going to be a ton of new
content and features coming to both pro
subscribers free subscribers youtube
subscribers and customers of stored out
level of tutorials com now over the
course of a year might be seeing some
new sketch videos here and there with
some new features in the latest version
of sketch so if you're a sketch fan
you'll get to update your abilities and
skills with the latest version of sketch
and all the new features there too also
there's going to be new developer life
and QA videos coming starring my wife
dr. Courtney talansky making a peer
and so keep presenting me with ideas for
what you'd like to see out of the
developer life series and keep sending
me Q&amp;amp;A questions so that we can answer
them in our QA series that we've been
doing and don't forget to head over to
store doubt level up tutorials com and
purchased next level react native for
iOS and Android these premium series are
paramount to keeping level up tutorials
videos free on YouTube and on a regular
release schedule I'm extremely excited
for may I have a tremendous to-do list
for not only this day this month this
week whatever there's going to be a ton
of new stuff coming so as always this is
scott without love tutorials thank you

i'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
