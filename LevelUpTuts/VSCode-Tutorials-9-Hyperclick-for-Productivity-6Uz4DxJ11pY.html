how you can easily jump to any of your
JavaScript modules in vs code now I
would assume that this would work on
other languages and platforms with
imports as well I primarily write
JavaScript so for me this is what this
is going to be encompassing now keep in
mind that this feature came with atom
editor as a plugin called hyper click I
believe and in vs code it's in here by
default it makes getting around Vyas
code really easy especially if you're
working in something like react or any
sort of import heavy thing where you
have a bunch of different components for
instance I could be working on this
component and I could say hey this cart
component I'd really like to edit this
now there's a couple ways you could go
about this you could do command P open
this up and start typing cart right
especially if it's recently opened it
could be in your recent but a really
nice way to do this is simply just hold
the command key on Apple I believe it
will should be the control key on
Windows if it's not please correct me
and what you can do is you'll notice
that the component now actually gets a
little mini peek into the definition of
this component but it also underlines
the component name now why is that
interesting because the underline means
it's a link now when we can click on
that link and as you can see it opened
the correct file and took us directly to
the definition of this thing that we
click done now this also works from the
import directly if we were up top here
and we're like oh let's see what this
card is hold down command click on it
and there we are Rouge right here
exactly where we want to be right again
ah item detail here what is ID in detail
well it's actually not even a separate
module it's just a styled component
definition so if I click item detail
here it is it just jumps me to it even
if it's in the same file so just jumps
you to the definition of whatever you're
trying to access and this works all over
the place and works pretty much anywhere
that I've found except for one minor
issue I've been using a lot of absolute
imports with forward slashes to start
them and it's not working for these just
yet or who knows if it will be but in
most situations it works
really nicely it's interesting about
this is if I do remove that first
initial forward slash and try it it
works so just a one caveat there right
if you're using absolute imports that
look like this it's not going to work
you're using them like this it will work
okay for the most part it works right
unless you're doing some specific thing
here and to be honest I couldn't
actually find the name of what this
feature was I googled around I mean it's
hyper click an atom editor but I
couldn't find the name so if you know
the name please leave a comment in the
video I will update the description of
this video explaining directly the name
of this feature but it's basically a
hyper click feature to click to the
definition go to the definition right if
you're already at the definition it just
keeps you there so I hope this was
useful this is something I use all the
time in vs code and if you're working
import heavy projects I'm sure you will
too thanks so much for watching and I'll
see you in the next one if you would
like to help support level up tutorials
have to store down level of tutorials
calm I got a ton of series there for
sale I also actually have a bunch of new
stuff coming I'm doing a big series on
figma right now you're gonna become a
figma master with this series and if you
don't know about figma it's basically
like a next generation drawing tool it's
a lot like things like sketch however
you have access to components right you
can build components that actually have
constraints and sort of CSS like
properties you can manipulate them on
different types of designs and it's
going to respond directly so if you're a
developer who works in react and you
want to be designing stuff thinking that
lends itself really nice to that mindset
and workflow so keep your eye out for
that it's gonna be out this month or you
can become a level of pro the prices
going up this month I believe it was
gonna be halfway through this month but
I'm working on a new shopping cart for
the site I want to get that done first
so the price will be going up once that
new shopping cart is done so if you
would like to become a level of pro good
streaming access to all the stuff along
with future series you can get in now at
the $8.99 a month price or pay yearly
and get that price which is the lowest
it's ever going to be so thanks so much
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
