up tuts and today I'm going to be
showing you how to add a CSS grid to
your Magento site so that we can get the
layout of our site start to take shape
this way we can have our site be
responsive for mobile so it's going to
look great on it your phone it's going
to look great on tablet and it's going
to look great on the desktop no matter
what your browser window is going to be
this site is going to adapt okay so
we're going to be using skeleton which
is a boilerplate for a responsive mobile
friendly development and we're going to
be adding this to our site and then
we're going to be modifying some of our
template files so that it uses the grid
and if you're not familiar with grid
frameworks it you can just scroll down
here and you can see basically by
assigning classes to your divs it's
going to determine how wide those
particular divs are in this particular
example they have one 11 to 10 and this
is an 8 out of a 12 maximum however the
maximum amount of columns in this grid
which is based off of the 960 grid is 16
columns this keeps going away and here
in their example you can see of a
container which is 960 and it's centered
and then inside of here you're saying
the this is a full width of 16 columns
down here we have something else that is
a width of 6 columns and then 3 within
that 3 within that we're using alpha to
show that's the first item Omega to show
you the second item like I said if
you're not familiar it's frameworks
you'll see how this is working in just a
second however we're going to download
this we're going to add it to our site
and then we're going to get going and
you're going to see how a grid can make
things nice and easy for developing your
layouts of your site so this is Pages
wwg skeleton calm and like I said
there's many other grid frameworks this
is a one that you like if there's ones
that you're used to feel free to go
ahead and use them I know I've been
particularly fond of one called Suzy
that's made for sass and compass
development so I haven't been using this
one in particular just because it's been
replaced to me by Suzy or just the norm
960 there's all sorts of grid frameworks
and find which one you like the best and
go with it even Twitter bootstrap has a
a grid framework built into it as well
so I'm gonna click this download button
I'm just going to download it from
github and what comes in here is just an
HTML file that's going to show you the
initial markup and some other things
that's a base style sheet in this base
style sheet is actually going to include
some Styles you can see it makes forms
look like this by default it's changing
the way buttons and headings look it's
using Helvetica new and stuff like that
so you don't have to input this file
where was I scroll down here yeah so if
you don't want this basic Styles you
don't have to use this base CSS I'm
going to put in here just because it's
going to look nice skeleton that CSS is
the according to this the glorious
skeleton grid so this is what we want
and instead that this layout is just
some code here to help us out with some
media queries if you don't know a media
queries are I would suggest checking out
the book responsive web design or just
googling a little bit about it we
haven't hit those tutorials yet level up
Tut's but we'll be covering responsive
web design and css3 tutorial series
later but you can get a little bit idea
basically media queries are just saying
depending on what the device width is
how the site should change how the
styles should change so I click download
I have this folder it has my stuff in it
let's bring up my actual site and we're
going to drop these CSS files into our
particular theme our own theme so let me
scroll back out of here I want to find
level up so I'm going to go actually
yeah
design actually I think I'm in the app
folder let's go back here okay we're at
the root of our folder root of our site
we're going to go to skin front end and
then I'm going to find LevelUp default
and then inside of here is our CSS eat
we had our Styles dot CSS folder or file
in here before of course got used to
that one so I'm going to drag these
three in here I'm just going to drop
them right in the CSS
and now in my page template let's go to
I'm going to open up another Finder
window here
so I'm just going to open up another
window here now in this one I'm going to
go to app and then app we're going to go
to a design and then design front-end
and the theme we're going to be looking
at is level up close this layout folder
and we're to be looking in the template
folder instead of template Li one page
and we're actually going to be grabbing
the default home page we'll go over the
other pages in a later lesson but for
now let's just hook up the home page so
to know that let's go back to our site
we have these development Stephane you
can see it it's using this two columns
right peeta HTML so we know that's found
in our base our default we know that's
found in our base default and then lay
out our I'm sorry template and this is
going to be page and we're looking for
two column right PETA HTML okay let's
drag this down here I'm actually going
to change this file around a little bit
because I want this to be my own theme I
don't I don't want to use sort of
Magento's defaults
however there's things I want to keep in
it so I'm going to drop this into here
okay so the next thing we're going to do
is link up our CSS files base layout and
skeleton into our Styles dot CSS file so
this way that our Styles will actually
show up they'll be added to the site
we're going to import them into this
style sheet simply because um I just
added says how I want it you could
actually have it in the XML file you
could hard-code them into the head dot P
HTML there's all sorts of different
approaches you can even open up those
other CSS files and copy and paste them
directly into your style CSS but this
one is going to be working pretty clean
for me right now so I'm just going to do
import and then URL because these are in
the same folder I just have to have like
that base CSS and now I'm just going to
copy and paste those three times to put
lay out and then I'm not table layout
and then I'm going to put skeleton dot
CSS is the third and this CSS file
should be right away easy to use or
ready to use so one thing we'll notice
is because this base CSS file has so
many styles with it when I give this
page a refresh you to see a lot of
things change like the search button and
some of this stuff okay so you can see
all our forms changed all of our body
text color has changed in fact if we
want to overwrite that we can that
should be no problem because it looks
like it's giving all this text in these
links sort of a light gray look which
isn't going to work super well in our
background in fact that's something that
I'm going to want to overwrite actually
let me just see exactly what else these
things are this P tag so it looks like
everything in the body is getting a
color four four four and all the links
are getting a color of three three three
or something so let's give the links a
color of white just so they stand out
and come back here under body because
the CSS is coming in after this base CSS
it's going to override it so we're going
to do color for body and then we're
going to have this be something a bit
darker one one one and then for anchor
tags we're going to want all of our
links to be color white let's refresh
our page all right things are looking a
little bit better I mean there's some
wackiness going on here we'll fix all
that stuff because to be honest and I'm
going to keep these really like this
anymore
but it's looking a little bit better we
have our files in here now and we can
start using this layout okay so that's
it for this video in the next video
we're going to pick off right where we
stopped off and we're going to go from
there as always it's got with love love
Tut's and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
