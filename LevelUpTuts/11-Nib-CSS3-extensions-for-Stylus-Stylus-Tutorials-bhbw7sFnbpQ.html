tutorials and today we're going to talk
about nib for stylus now name is an
additional library that you can add in
the stylus that gives you a whole bunch
of extra features it could be considered
sort of like a bourbon or compass if you
used to using SAS of for stylus and it's
a package that's extremely popular so
let's check out what makes nip so
popular and all of the different
utilities that come baked in so in the
last video we installed nib and got
going by importing everything and we
showed you this a gradient mixin now as
you can see it's really just giving us
our browser prefixes to this stuff but
these mix-ins go a little bit more in
depth to get a good idea of all the
things that nib has to offer you can go
ahead and go to TJ github do /n ib and
i'm actually going to link this in the
description so you can have a link to
that and check out this page where it
has the complete documentation for nymph
about everything that comes with it well
that's that seems like it's really just
some CSS property stuff css3 browser
prefix stuff however what kind of cool
mix-ins does nib come with well one of
the coolest ones and i think it's the
coolest because i use this all the time
is that we have a mix ins called fixed
absolute and relative so instead of
saying position fixed and then having to
give it a position you can declare all
that in one mixin so you can simply say
fixed and then pass it a value if we
were to just say something like top left
and save you can see we get position
fixed top 0 left 0 so it's going to put
it right in the top left and it's going
to position it fixed in fact if we were
to say absolute instead of fixed here we
get the same thing position absolute top
left well you might be wondering let me
change us back to fix and it also works
for relative to uh so let's just say we
want to actually give it a pixel value
here because I mean
how many times you're going to want them
to be at 0-0 top left top right maybe
it's usually like let's say 20 pixels in
or something like that or maybe even a
couple percentage points in what we can
actually do is pass those values so we
could say something like top 20 pixels
left 20 pixels just like that and you
can see instantly we get this position
fixed top 20 left 20 in fact that's
going to work with anything like if
we're say yes it's going to be two
percent from the left then it certainly
works that way as well and keep in mind
that the first value here is always
going to be top or bottom the second is
always going to be left or right so as
long as you remember that top bottom
left right this mix-ins going to be
awesome for you it's a one liner that it
outputs three lines that you're used to
have to typing fully like this and it's
something that I said I use all the time
another mix in that we have is a clear
fixed mixin no we created our own CF
mixin however let's go ahead and just
get rid of it let's just completely
delete it there we go we cut down on
some of our mix ins and in this CF here
we can change this to clearfix just like
that no ours actually had a more concise
name than clear fixed but this one's
more descriptive and it tells you what
it does so we now have a working
clearfix and we didn't have to make it
ourselves now there's also some nice
little helpers like let's say we were to
have a link in our main text and we
wanted to have the overflow property
with ellipses so that once it's wider
than a certain width it's going to give
us the dot on the text we can always use
this overflow and then ellipsis now this
isn't an actual a CSS property overflow
ellipsis however you'll see what we get
is text overflow ellipsis we get
overflow hidden and white space no rep
so again it's essentially three lines
for the cost of one line and those are
the
since that I really liked things that
you would typically have to type or
memorize and type several lines when you
can just type one quick expressive line
and have it take care of all of that for
you now there's also additional things
like functions that bring in resets so
if you're familiar with Eric Myers reset
you could say reset and then hyphen
html5 and then in parentheses and save
and now that quick it took one second we
now have the Eric Meyer CSS reset at the
top of our page here or if normalizes
more of your flavor if you've used
resets or normalized I personally use
the normalized package instead of the
reset you can use that simply by
normalized hyphen html5 save it and here
we have all the stuff is getting display
block we have audio canvas we have audio
nod that sort of stuff and we can also
have that's just for normalized for
html5 elements let's say we want the
rest of it we can give normalized base
that's going to give us a whole bunch
more like HTML font family size just
body margin zero that kind of stuff the
stuff that we're used to having and you
can get all of the different whether
it's normalized links normalized text
that sort of stuff and you can use any
of those in which you would like to use
now some more shorthand things are
things like a border so into the saying
the border solid one picks color we
would simply just be able to say border
at color or just simply our color and if
we scroll down here and look for that
border output it's giving us the solid
and one picks so often you're just
wanting to specify a border and you have
to type you know the width and the the
type when you know more often than not
you're using a solid border so this is
going to take care of a couple of those
lines of code for you we could also use
some interesting things like they have
this shadow stroke which is actually
giving a stroke around your text using
text shadow so we could use the function
shadow hyphen stroke and then give it a
color we can use blue we can save this
and this it's going to let's scroll up
down our CSS to see the result and this
is giving us several texts shadows in
position differently at negative 1
negative 1 1 negative 1 negative 11 and
11 so it's essentially going to create
an outline around if our text that's not
fuzzy or anything just using text shadow
and likely you've already seen there's a
whole host an entire list down here of
miscellaneous properties which are
essentially css3 things like box sizing
or back face visibility opacity
transition and these are going to be
transparent mix-ins that give you the
browser prefixes that you're looking for
so i would call around this a TJ github
daioh front nib and it seems like this
documentation isn't as in-depth as this
one on github so if you want to see
truly completely up to date it's really
not that different to be honest but if
you want to see the latest docs I found
under the github page github com TJ /
nib the docs folder and that will take
you to this page which I will actually
also include in the comments where
you'll have a whole set of docs that
look very similar just slightly
different cool so this is nib for stylus
it's something that I would probably use
on every project because the cost of
entry is so low it's not really going to
affect your compile times or anything
with that you saw how fast it was and
it's just really easy to drop into your
project and have all those really useful
utilities and a half of them don't even
get in the way so as always this is
Scott would level of tutorials if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video or in just a bit
twitter or facebook at level up tugs
we'd love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
