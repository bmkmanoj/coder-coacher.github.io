up tutorials and today we're going to be
showing you how to add packages to your
meteor site now packages like NPM
packages or ruby gems or anything like
that can encapsulate functionality that
you can just drop into your site and
some things can maybe modify the build
process for instance adding something
like an autoprefixer or allowing you to
use a CSS preprocessor or even it's
going to be additional functionality
throughout your meteor development so
packages are a great way to add really
advanced stuff to your site without you
having to build it from scratch so let's
get started right now okay so this one
is not going to be too hard what we want
to do is we want to use a package now
there's tons of packages available in
meteor and you can actually find them by
going to atmosphere so if we type in
atmosphere dive j/s the first website
you're gonna get is atmosphere j Escom
i'll make sure to put a link to this
page in the comments of the video or the
description of the video so you can go
ahead and just click on it from there
what you can see here is that we have
this Explorer meteor packages and we
have a trending packages we have recent
packages and we have most used packages
top searches all sorts of stuff in here
and these are all sorts of ways that you
can extend the functionality on your
meteor site so like I said it could be
adding things to the build process it
could be a CSS preprocessor or we have
something like iron router here which is
routing and it's it's really the best
routing package for meteor and allows
you to do all sorts of cool stuff with
routing changing your templates and and
pretty much anything that you'd expect
from other frameworks can be handled
inside of iron router it's really great
they use it all the time
we also have things like accounts
password accounts UI bootstrap les send
emails underscore CoffeeScript there's a
lot of good stuff in here and in fact it
takes some time exploring and sort of
learning what's here but I've totally
recommend just coming in here and trying
to add things to your project following
their readme
and just experiencing these packages so
I'm gonna actually come up top here
because the package I want to add is to
add a stylus now if you haven't used any
CSS preprocessors I think stylus works
really well with meteor it's really
great because the the language can be
written as minimal or as much like CSS
as you'd like and it has a lot of really
great features in fact if you're
interested I'm doing a series on stylus
at this very moment on level up
tutorials so you can head to the YouTube
channel and check out that tutorial
series if you're interested I highly
recommend it so I can type in stylus
okay Chrome's gonna ask me for some
context I'm gonna type in stylus and as
you can see there are a few stylus
packages and I've used a lot of these
however the one I like the most is
stylus multi because what this includes
is it doesn't just include stylus itself
but it also can includes nib which is a
css3 package that includes a whole bunch
of really great utilities autoprefixer
which auto prefixes so you don't ever
have to type the CSS prefix jeet which
is a really great grid system i'm gonna
be doing some videos on g soon rupture
simple media queries and access a ton of
awesome of functionality so oh what we
can do is to add this is simply by
running a single command and that is
meteor add and then the package and
you'll see every single atmosphere page
has this command up top here you can go
ahead and copy this and then head to
your terminal i'm going to change
directories into the root of my project
and from the root of the project here I
can just paste this in here meteor add
and the name of the package and hit
enter as you can see it's going to
download the package and once it's all
complete you're even gonna see the
meteor server up here it's going to let
you know that it has officially added
the package okay so we have the stylus
multi package added and that's really
cool let's see what we have to do to
actually implement something we come to
our page refresh everything is fine so
you can tell it didn't break anything
right so it's actually come to our code
and the first thing I'm gonna do is come
to a resolution stats CSS to make sure
this is working all I really want to do
is click right click on here and click
rename now I'm going to type in dot st
yl which is the stylus extension so
resolutions dot st yl instead of
resolutions dot CSS now again if we save
this come to our page you know nothing's
changed so that's great so let's go
ahead and actually make some
modifications what I'm going to do is
I'm going to start getting rid of some
of our brackets in here let's say I'm
going to delete these HTML brackets and
we're gonna do it just with indenting so
just like that I'm gonna get rid of this
stuff HTML border size okay and just to
add something else I'm gonna come in
here to body and do the same okay so now
I'm going to change the background to
just red so it's gonna be painfully
obvious and let's head back to our site
and as you can see we have a super red
background immediately and it lets again
let's just make sure this is in fact
working blue and we have blue cool so
this is really super cool because if
you're used to working with any CSS
preprocessors in other systems you might
have to set up a gulp task or a grunt
task or you might have to just tell your
CSS preprocessor to watch your files if
you'll notice we have in the Left
sidebar here you're never gonna see any
CSS files in fact you don't ever get to
witness the compilation and have that
CSS output because you don't need to the
one of the things I really like about
using a
CSS preprocessor like stylists in meteor
is that it just sort of obfuscates the
fact that CSS even exists and we can
just write our CSS and stylist just like
we would if we were writing normal CSS
so for me that's a huge huge huge upside
and in fact you can just like a normal
stylist or sass or any of that stuff you
can create folder structures you can
import files and stuff like that and
it's absolutely no problem and likewise
if we wanted to use one of those
packages that came with this package
here this stylist multi you can just do
ad import and then nib just like that
and now it's going to be using nib so
just like that we've added a ton of
really advanced functionality into our
project we have a grid system we have
media queries we have some css3 we have
auto prefixing everything simply by
downloading one package and that's
really the usefulness of these meteor
packages they can just really help out
and take some of the weight off of you
when you're developing so check it out
let me know what kind of cool packages
you use there's a lot of really great
ones if you find anything feel free to
share it in the comments we'd love to
hear that so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments they've become in
the video heart is up at Twitter

for watching and we'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
