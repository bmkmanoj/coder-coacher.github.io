of tutorials in this video I'm gonna
show you how we can get started with our
project first things first we need to
install meteor and then go on from there
so let's get started right now so to get
started head to meteor comm click this
install meteor button on the home page
and now you can see four windows you can
download the official installer or we
can use this curl command on OS X or
Linux so I'm going to head to my command
line and I'm simply just going to paste
in this curl command and hit enter you
can see this is going to install meteor
on your system if you already have
meteor installed you can totally skip
this step you don't need it however if
you're new to meteor and you haven't
used it yet make sure that you have
meteor installed in your system I'm
gonna let this go and install and come
back when it's done okay and if it
prompts you for your password just make
sure you give your password but as you
can see we now have meteor installed and
as you can see it says to create a new
application we can just run a meteor
create my cool app okay I'm actually
just going to hit command K to clear my
command line and let's get started by
creating our meteor project so to get
started let's go ahead and first create
a new meteor project we can do that by
heading to our command line so we can
create our new project just by saying
meteor create and then we want this to
be my resolutions so this is going to be
your new resolutions application and
right now it's going to download all of
these standard packages but really
quickly we're going to actually need to
upgrade meteor to a version that's not
released yet at the recording of this
videos now we want to make sure we're
gonna be on meteor 1.3 so let's go ahead
and run meteor update and you can see
this projects add meteor one point two
point one so basically it says I'm
already at the latest release now we
need to be on 1.3 so if yours like mine
says anything other than 1.3 here we
need to upgrade to the latest beta now
the latest beta at the time of recording
this video is going to be beta
twelve so we can get that simply by
typing in meteor updates - - release no
the release is going to be 1.3 - beta
dot twelve ok so let's go ahead and
enter here now you'll notice this should
be grabbing everything we need now I've
been running beta 12 for a little while
now and have had no issues so you won't
necessarily run into anything however
with running betas it's always a
possibility so hopefully by the time
you're watching this meteor is already
up to 1.3 and the actual release and you
don't have to use the beta 4 1-3 however
if you do need to run this meteor
release command like I said I haven't
had any issues myself it seems very
stable now you might be wondering why
meteor 1.3 rather than 1.2 or anything
other than that well with 1.3 there's
actually a tremendous update that now
allows the use of NPM packages so this
means from now on when you're writing
your meteor sites we don't have to use
wrapper packages anymore you might
recall something like adding the package
for low - and having to use the
atmosphere package for low - which may
or may not have been at the latest
version when you went to download it now
this has kind of been a bummer
throughout the development of meteor
sites however that's all been solved now
with the 1.3 because we can import and
export modules just like you would
expect now this has a big change in
react because before we would have just
added the react package and that would
include it at some mix-ins like get
meteor data that allowed up working with
react to be nice and easy however things
change quite a bit when we go to 1.3 and
now we need to start using the NPM react
just like we would if we were developing
a site that was not on meteor so this
update may take a minute so just let it
hang out for a little bit I might be
talking a little bit more about 1.3 as
we go here so if you see any other video
tutorials using react
mix-ins or react get meteor data
then come 1.3 it's sort of going to be
an outdated technique so I'm gonna be
doing my best to make this series as
up-to-date as possible so that you can
use these techniques moving forward and
we're going to be doing this all with
es2015 or es6 as it's been known so that
you have just a handle on all of the
modern ways to do things so as you can
see this is still updating I'm just
gonna give it a second and come back to
this when it's done
okay so we're now up to date with meteor
1.3 now at this point we can simply run
meteor the meteor command is going to
start up our meteor application and we
should be able to now access it at
localhost port 3000 so once this gets
going let's head to our browser and in
my new tab I'm going to say localhost
3000
now let's tab back now I can check on
make sure this app is up okay it looks
like it's running and you can now see we
have this welcome to meteor where we
press the button you know however many
times if you've used meteor at all
before you have seen this so although
this video is gonna be focusing on react
right now looks like we're all up and
running all right so where do we get
started here how do we actually take
this down
well the start I'm actually going to
just start deleting some stuff so let's
actually go ahead and come to our
application I'm just gonna open mine up
and find our and drop it into sublime
text you are more than welcome to use
whatever text editor you would like and
if you're wondering I'm using the
oceanic variant of material dark for
color scheme and theme here and I've
even made the accent color purple I
always get questions about that so it's
nice to start a series and just make
that up front so you notice we have all
of our blazed code like normal because
this is going to assume that you're
using blaze and that's no problem
because it's easy to get rid of all of
this stuff so first and foremost let's
go ahead and just delete my resolutions
that j/s gone see you later
okay let's go ahead and delete my
resolutions that CSS I will be providing
styles in this that you can download and
let's go ahead and delete everything in
here except for the body Ted will leave
the body tag for now however I will warn
you the body tag will go eventually okay
so we now have our project all ready to
go to get started to actually reading
some react code we have a total blank
slate here and as you can see we haven't
had to add any packages yet we haven't
had to do anything sort of fancy yet
we're just sort of getting rid of
everything in the next video we're gonna
be adding react to our site with NPM
we're gonna be doing our very first
importing of a package through NPM
rather than meteors own package system
and we're going to create our very first
react component within meteor so so as
