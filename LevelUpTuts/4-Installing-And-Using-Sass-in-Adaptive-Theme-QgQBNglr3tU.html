love tutorials in this video we're going
to show you how you been going with sass
in your new adaptive theme so we're
going to show you how to install sass
and compass on your machine and then how
to run a compass watch and a little bit
about what's going on when you do that
so let's get started right now so one of
the most important parts about working
in any sort of theming environment is
going to be your styles and because of
that CSS is going to be an important
part of any sub theme or any theme that
you're building unless of course this is
a theme that you've purchased and you're
just installing and you're not touching
it visually you're going to have to be
commanding most of the sites styles
layout all that stuff using your CSS now
adaptive theme becomes built in with a
nice little sass framework although it's
using a compass is something I haven't
been using myself much lately however
sass is a incredible tool to learn how
to use and it's something that I would
highly recommend so if you don't
necessarily see the importance of
reasons to you sass by all means in the
next video I'm going to show you how you
can use this theme without using SAS
however i would highly recommend using
SAS for your own own personal growth and
benefit in learning this new skill if
you haven't used it before if you have
you cess or less or any other
preprocessor then you've probably
clearly seen the value there so to get
going using SAS we need to install sass
and we also need to install compass if
you go to sasses website at SAS hype and
Link calm and then the / install page
i'll tell you a couple ways that you can
use says you can use it through code kit
or through the compass app and there's a
whole bunch of other apps here like pre
process and scout live reload those
types of application and now for this
video we're going to show you how to do
it using command line now if you have a
Mac then Matt comes pre-installed with
Ruby so you should be all set to install
sass if you have a Windows computer
you're going to go ahead and have to use
the Ruby installer the single click
installer now let's go ahead and come to
our command line or our command prompt
if you're on Windows
and we're going to go ahead and run the
gem install SAS command now you can do
this from anywhere in your system
because it's going to install it
globally now if you get an error here
saying you have permissions issues
you're going to have to run it with sudo
like sudo gem install SAS like so so i
would go ahead and try it without the
pseudo first just like so and see if
that works for you so as you can see it
installed sess correctly for me without
any errors however if you get some big
red permissions errors or anything like
that you're going to want to go ahead
and do the pseudo version now we can
make sure that we have SAS installed
just by typing SAS space hyphen V and
that's going to tell us which version of
SAS we have installed which is the
latest at the time of this video three
point four point one point 16 which is
selective Steve now we also need to
install compass we can do that just by
doing gem install compass like so and
again if you're getting permission zeros
go ahead and use sudo now like I said I
am in fact running this command from the
Drupal the Drupal site we have going but
you can run it anywhere because it's
installing it globally on your system
okay so compass is installed now let's
actually change directory into our
themes so from the root of our theme we
can change directory into sites all
themes and then the name of your theme
okay now i'm going to do a quick LS just
to make sure that i am in my theme and
you can see one of the files in here is
this config dot RB file now the config
dot RB file if you're not familiar is
really just a ruby file to let compass
know where and how to output your code
so let's check this config that our B
file and as you can see the current
environment is set to development our
CSS directory is just CSS our SAS
directory is just as you can verify that
just simply by seeing SAS CSS and we
have an images directory at CSS / images
which is right here okay
and we can scroll down here and as you
can see it says output style equals and
really what this is saying is if the
environment is set to development then
use the expanded and if it's set to
anything else use compact now the reason
why this is important is because
basically when we're in production code
we want our CSS to be minified and
compressed however if we're developing
it we want to be able to read our CSS we
want it to be human readable so because
as you saw up here development
environment equals development if we
scroll down this ternary expression
equate stew true and therefore the
output style is going to be equal to
expanded now relative assets there is
also equal to true and we have some sass
options here like we have if environment
is developed then that debug is equal to
true and if it's not always update is
equal to true okay so this isn't too
important because we're not going to be
having to modify this file at least not
in this video so we can just exit out of
that so now that we have a compass an
seson stalled we can use sass in this
instance simply by just typing compass
watch now the reason why we're running a
compass command here another watch
command is because what compass is going
to do is it's going to actually run the
assess pre-processing for us and if
you're not familiar with what compass is
it's essentially a set of tools to help
you in building assess you can check out
compasses website to see exactly what
all that entails but it's essentially a
SAS toolkit so it's an extension assess
that adds additional features so if we
type a compass watch like so it's going
to use that config RB file and we're
going to get a message saying compasses
watching for changes press ctrl C to
stop so now that compass is watching for
changes we can simply come to our CSS
and we come to not the CSS files but the
sass folder and you can come to any of
these files let's just tuck check out
global styles you can see that it's
importing this base CSS file here for
some reason my sublime text is having
issues with these
for slashing comments here and sash
these double forward slashes equal a
comment and so you can do commenting
like this or like this so this actually
should be grayed out but for some reason
I think maybe it's a problem with the
syntax highlighting package that i'm
using right now so as you can see we
just have some standard SAS code here
for instance we're using a variable to
set the background color which is the
variable set to page let's actually just
come in here and add a new background
color to the body just to make sure that
everything is working fine so we can set
the background to just 000 which is
black and if we come to our command line
you should see that it has written this
global styles that CSS file now there's
some word of warning about how compass
is using some of this stuff like I said
I'm personally not using compass a whole
lot anymore myself and in a later videos
I'm going to show you how to maybe pull
out compass and use something else
however now that compass has watched and
compiled our SAS files we can come ahead
and check out this home page here
refresh and as you can see it's
effectively getting those CSS changes in
fact if we change it to anything else
right we can just add 0 0 and then FF
here you can see it's compressed
compiling again we refresh now we have
the super ugly blue so let's come back
to our CSS there we go we've deleted
that and SAS is compiling just fine and
we're ready to start really getting in
to theming our site now that we are all
set up with sass and compass so as
always this is Scott would level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments they become in the video edits
about Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
