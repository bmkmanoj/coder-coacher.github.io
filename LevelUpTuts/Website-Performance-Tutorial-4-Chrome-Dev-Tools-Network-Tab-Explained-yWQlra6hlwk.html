of tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you the network tab in chrome
dev tools now the network tab is a deep
well of really cool stuff that you
couldn't learn see how exactly your
sites loading your content so now this
video is really just going to be an
introduction to seeing what the sort of
tools are you have and how you can sort
of debug your site so let's get going on
that right now
so we've experienced now the basic sort
of device mode but what are some ways
that we can dive in deeper to see
exactly how the site is loading now one
thing that we have here is a couple of
that really need tools in the chrome dev
tools some of which you can get really
really deep on in this video we're gonna
start to talk about the network's tab in
chrome dev tools and really just why it
exists and how to use it
so let's come in and inspect our page
and I'm actually gonna break out the dev
tools into its own window you can do
that by clicking and holding on here
selecting the window above I'm gonna do
it this way just because it's a lot of
information here and we want to make
sure we can see it all so when you
arrive on the network's tab its blank
and you may have seen this and wondered
okay what's what's here and why do I
need this well if we come to any given
web page let's go to the stored I level
up tutorials calm so for on our page and
let's actually make this a bit smaller
so we can see them both we can actually
see something going on here you'll see
that when we refresh the page this
starts to populate so you'll notice that
for me this site loaded really really
quickly which is a great thing here and
we have a couple of bars here we have
this red bar and then we have this blue
bar now the blue bar is the total length
it took for the Dom content to be loaded
and the red bar is the total load time
in addition you'll see a whole bunch of
stuff here we have this table we have
this view we have this filter bar let's
go ahead and get rid of the filter bar
for right now it just allows you to
filter these content
now what we can do here is let's make
this a little bit bigger and let's start
to explore so we have a nice table here
we have what's being loaded we have the
method so this is via get its we have
these status
so you'll see 203 Oh force and maybe
some 404s or other things but the 200s
are essentially saying that this has
been loaded for the first time and this
is a fresh load the 304 is basically
saying it's being loaded from your cache
so if you want to make sure that
everything is being loaded freshly every
time there's this disable caching button
you could select this and now this time
when you were refresh so now you can see
that we have mostly two hundreds and the
load time was a little bit longer now
that it's not pulling things from cache
but we're still at one point four four
seconds for loading and that's pretty
good considering that some of the
largest load times are coming from some
of our images okay so now next on our
little table here we have what type of
file is being loaded we have a documents
we have a style sheet we have scripts we
have style sheet we have scripts we have
a document the initiator is sort of what
is telling this item to load so a lot of
the stuff is being told by our index
page next we have our size of the file
so these are going to be your file sizes
and this is going to be the amount of
time it took for that particular file to
load and this is your timeline view and
if you have more than things on here
then fills up you can scroll down but it
gives you a nice view if you hover over
any of these showing exactly let's say
this one took a long time we can see
that it was waiting for 67 milliseconds
and then it actually took 295
milliseconds to load and you can get
some more in-depth explanation by
clicking this now what's great here is
that this entire table is sortable so we
can certainly say time let me see so the
thing that took the longest to load on
this entire page was this ladies t-shirt
and it's 492 kilobyte file it's 624
milliseconds long to load and if we have
over this you can see that most that
time was spent downloading
now one thing that's really important to
note about this is I know that this
image is larger than this is being
displayed because I'm using the same
image here now this is actually a
terrible practice if you're having
images that are being loaded and that
are quite a bit smaller what you're
gonna want is a responsive image loader
hour I load er is a good option for that
and then you can load in multiple
different images and that way the one at
the correct width will load for when you
need it to that way you're not loading a
giant image when you don't have to so
we're gonna go over a technique to do
that in a later video
not too far down line because that's one
of the first things that you can do to
make an impact on your page load but as
you notice here by using this network
tab we can get some really nice insights
into what exactly is taking the longest
to load and how we can stop that from
happening right so another thing that's
taking a long time to load is this font
awesome file right and this is a 63
kilobyte font file now if you were
really going to try to chop off some
time here right what you could actually
do is build your own icon font using
another service using only the icons you
need instead of loading the entire font
awesome library now it's not totally
necessary this page is loading still in
1.4 seconds and when it's cached it's
loading quite a bit faster than that but
if you're absolutely performance
obsessed this network pain here is going
to give you a lot of insight into what's
going on and if we click this filter
here right here we can actually filter
in and say show me just the CSS just the
images just the media all that's good
stuff here and it just gives us a little
bit more of a filtered view or you can
even search for things cool so this is
the network tab peanut chrome dev tools
now I'm not going to act like this is
the Biol definitive video explaining
this network tab in fact once we start
to really dive into some stuff we may
even come back here and pick apart the
network tab a bit more but it's an
important resource for you to know that
it's a great fact-finding to know
what resources are taking a long time to
load and why your website loading time
might in fact be slow cool so for
another example really quick let's let's
just check out level up tutorial site
I'm going to inspect this page I'm then
going to come to my network tab and I'm
gonna refresh this page and as you can
see this loaded in one point seven
seconds now keep in mind that disabled
caching is still checked once you check
it it remains checked so that's
important to remember if you would have
expected this to pull the checked the
cached versions of things you're gonna
want to make sure that you uncheck this
regardless of what site you're on and
keep in mind that your filter is also
going to carry over so this is only
showing us our JavaScript we check the
all and you can see let's check out our
time you can see that the one of the
things that's taking the longest to load
here is this shattered ping image which
is this background image and that image
is entirely unnecessary and one of the
things to note about this is that this
shattered dot ping image is preventing
the full page load so maybe you could
look into something to actually loading
that image after the fact that way it's
not getting in the way of something else
finishing the error site to load so it's
really nice about this is that the site
is still loading in under one-and-a-half
seconds nothing is really huge here we
have the longest anything's taking to
load is 357 milliseconds and that's a
aggregated javascript file moderniser
it's a library that's also being loaded
is taking 202 milliseconds we have some
things like the font awesome again is a
42 kilobyte file that could potentially
be slimmed down a little bit but like I
said this is just sort of really
nitpicking here because at this point a
really fast load time and there's no
visible sort of delay in loading here
what's also cool is that you can enable
the same sort of throttling we saw in
the device mode inside of this network
of mode so that you can really get a
good handle on what somebody with a
really slow internet
internet connection is going to see when
they load your site okay so this is the
network tab in chrome dev tools I hope
this was very informative I hope you now
Noah to dive into the network tools to
figure out just exactly how your site's
loading next video we're going to talk
about the timeline tab in chrome dev
tools which is another very interesting
tab that we could go way more in-depth
on if we need to so as always this is
Scott wood level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments it did
come in the video hit me up at Twitter
or Facebook I level up tutorials I love
