of Tut's and today we're going to be
doing some cool stuff every single time
we press this this button that we have
here we're going to have a different
name be displayed or we want to have
this output number zero through three so
not one through ten so let's get rid of
this stuff and we're just going to
multiply this by 4 here and so now our
math.random random is going to be a
random number times four okay so great
now we're generating a number random but
this is only going to generate a number
randomly once when we put the program
actually let's see how that even works
so we want to pass Rando into this and
we want to give a random number here so
instead of three we can actually just
type Rando like that and it's going to
say that this needs to be a final sure
whatever we used to sing that but it's
not something we'll have to worry about
it's just these particular examples so
let's come back to our emulator and this
is going to boot up here and once it's
up here we should see a random name that
could be Scott could be anything so
let's click this Tim okay if we keep on
pressing this it's going to keep saying
Tim though and that's a once because
once this boots up that's going to go
through assigned a random number and
it's going to be equal to four well
that's a bummer we don't want it to do
that so I'm going to cut this out here
like this
and I'm going to save this and I'm going
to put this inside of our on click and
just like that we're going to reboot our
app and we're going to see what happens
so ry labs booting up here wilts wait
for a second here comes okay and let's
press the button then let's press it
again Tim Kourtney Kourtney Scott bed
then then Tim Scott perfect so let's say
for some reason you wanted to have some
sort of app that does like witty sayings
when you push a button this is this is
that app right there this is as good as
done you clean up the Styles a little
bit press the button it gives you your
witty phrases and you could push it on
the market you know we could throw some
ads on there you could start earning
yourself some ad revenue cool so we have
a button that's randomly grabbing a name
randomly producing a word from an array
and this is our first step to making it
some interactive apps that can do some
cool stuff so as always if you have any
questions leave a comment the video hit
us up on Twitter level up Tut's let us
know to think
thanks for watching this is Scott bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
