level of Tut's and today we're gonna be
talking about boolean data types within
JavaScript and boolean is the word if
you are new to programming you might not
have heard before and it's named
actually after a famous mathematician
philosopher all sorts of stuff who
basically invented what's now called
boolean logic which is the idea of true
and false oh this guy's name by the way
of course is George Boole so thus
boolean and so boolean values in
programming are really important and
you'll be using them all the time so how
can we conceptually use true or false
values well let's say you wanted this
screen to be blue if a certain value is
true or something like that you could
say if it's green if this value is true
then this green is blue if the value is
false the screen is red of course you
could change the color of the screen
with JavaScript or jQuery or something
like that but either way you will be
using these boolean values and
conditionals and ways to prove things
and ways to check to the see if things
exist and all sorts of stuff so let's
get into it and let's see how we can use
boolean's and we're going to use this in
a basic way but in the next video we're
going to talk about some operations yeah
you know equals greater than that sort
of thing and actually we're going to get
into a little bit here as well but we're
gonna get into it a little bit more
useful way with if statements so that
said we're going to make a new variable
and this variable is going to be open so
let's just say open maybe you can think
of this as being a door if the door is
open we can set this to true and just by
typing the words lowercase and no quotes
or anything and then put a semicolon at
the end and the stuff I put quotes
around it it turns yellow
this doesn't actually have the same
meaning as it does without the quotes
without the quotes it physically means
true with the quotes it means the word
true so let's get rid of these quotes
here and now this means true notice how
my code coloring is actually showing a
color just like this three is so open is
equal to true that's great and now if we
did something like council dot log open
of course you'd expect sorry for my
typing here council dot log open and
then a semicolon at the end if you
expect our browser to then spit out
something that said true like we see
here of course because it's just
spitting out this value now we can get
into things where we can make a true
value false simply by putting an
exclamation point in front of it so by
saying not open it's saying it's not
true which is going to be equal to false
so now let's refresh this and we see
false likewise if we move this
exclamation point in front of true it's
going to be setting open to not true
which is then going to print out to
false now we don't have to do
exclamation point true to get false we
can just type in false here and that is
just like true it's going to come up
with false but what happens if we do not
false well now we refresh it's going to
be true so you have two options here
true or false not false is equal to two
not true is equal to false that sort of
thing so you can use this exclamation
point to check for things like that
however if you're setting something like
this to be false you would almost never
ever say var open is equal to not false
you would say var as a
open is equal to true now we'll go over
this exclamation point in uh in in later
videos and show you exactly how it's
useful for other things but just to know
that that exists in it negate something
or it reverses it in this case true and
false so it negates it true it's yeah
okay so what are other uses right so we
have this console.log value plus value
down here and this just output the value
itself well what happens if instead of
some sort of math operation
notice how we could do a stress here
refresh you get the nine and that's
multiplying we'll go over more math
stuff too but what happens if we want to
see if this value is equal to itself
which it's going to be so actually let's
get rid of this value and let's have a
three here we want to check to see if
value is equal to three so we can say
equals equals now we save this refresh
and instead of council logging any value
it's council logging true because we're
doing this check and we're a single
equal sets things a double equal checks
things so equal equal is saying if this
value is equal to 3 and we're console
logging net so it's almost like a
sentence you're saying is this value
equal to 3 yes it's true so thus we are
printing out true here so this is just
very basic into operators and we're
gonna be getting into lots more
operators in fact we'll have a whole
video on them all the cool stuff you can
do with that but first we're gonna show
you the if statements so in the next
video I'm going to show you what an if
statement is and then we're gonna go
over our operators and you're gonna be
able to control your if statements in
all sorts of ways and then you're going
to get into some really cool stuff and
before you know it you're going to be
having these interactive cool
experiences with job
script on your websites so as always
this is Scott with level of touch if you
have any questions or comments please
leave a comment the video or hit us up
at Twitter at level of Tut's let us know
what you're thinking we're also on
Facebook we're all over the place so you
know I try to get two comments - I
actually just noticed that I haven't
been receiving email to my level up
Todd's email for a couple of weeks and
I've been super busy so I didn't even
notice so if you emailed us or wrote a
comment and I'm trying to catch up right
now so you know just keep that in mind
always doing our best to catch up so
thanks for watching and what's going
this is Scott but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
