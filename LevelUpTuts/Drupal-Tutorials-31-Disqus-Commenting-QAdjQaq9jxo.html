level up Tut's and today I want to show
you how to add disgust to your Drupal
site using the disgust module and then
the service disgust that they offer so I
don't know about you but I've been to a
ton of blogs and a ton of websites where
they had this commenting system that's
really nice and easy if you click here
it lets you log in with your Twitter
your Facebook or you can even create a
discuss account and log in and the
system's just really nice it's become
sort of a standard that's nice and easy
to use that people are sort of used to
by now you can upload and down vote you
can report comments for spam really
easily it's just a really nice thing to
add to your website I like it much more
than the built in Drupal commenting
system so I'm going to show you how to
take this and add this into your site so
if you want to go ahead and go to
discuss com
that's D is Q us.com and you want to go
ahead and first you're gonna have to
create an account so go ahead click sign
up I'm going to log in to my account
that I've already created and we can get
going from there okay so now that you've
logged in it's going to show you all
your sites that you have moderating and
stuff like that this is sort of like a
add dashboard for your admin as you can
see already have a couple sites here
let's go to our dashboard and let's add
a new site I'm gonna add this for my own
personal website so let's click Add and
then it's going to ask for the site URL
this is a right now it's a localhost so
um I'm just going to use Scott talansky
dot-com is the URL because that's what
it's going to be and so we'll just say
that's okay so that way you can keep it
separated from your other sites I'll
click continue and it's going to ask you
where you're using this and you can see
they have plug-ins for all sorts of
different content management systems all
sorts of stuff you can even use it on
something like blogger or tumblr as you
can see Drupal is right here so we're
just going to click Drupal okay and now
it's going to tell you exactly what to
do it gives you the link to where the
module is
as you can see that's just a normal
discuss module and it's going to tell
you how to install it in six easy steps
so we're going to download this module
and we're going to install it into our
modules folder
as and if you remember that's insights
all modules just go ahead and grab this
and throw it in there okay
now let's click out it here and you can
see the next step you know put it in
your sites all modules ok did that now
we need to enable the module let's go to
modules we'll go and look for discuss
and see so I'm just going to go search
for word discuss ok we'll enable that
save the configuration now it's just
going to want us to go to admin settings
discuss and it's going to tell you to
add your short name my short name is
Scott to Lensky so we'll just copy that
here let's go to configuration let's go
to discuss it's right down here under
web services on the right and we're
going to add our short name Scott to
Lenski ok and you let's go back here it
says which nodes do you want to discuss
to appear on and then you can just
enable discuss commenting permissions ok
cool so let's close out of these and we
want these discuss comments to show up
on our articles which are really our
blog posts and we want to show them in
the content area you could actually
choose them to display as a block and in
that case you would have to add the
block on to the page that you want to
show so if you chose block this is just
going to create a block and then you can
put it wherever you want I want to be in
the content area I just want it to be at
the bottom of it so no big deal we'll
just select content area here and if you
know for some reason you wanted to be at
the very top I can't imagine why you
could you know change the weight but
we'll just leave it at 50 so under
behavior it's going to ask for your user
API key you can get yours where it says
get yours here it will open up a new tab
for security reasons I'm just not going
to show you what my user API key is but
grab it and then after that we can go to
advanced and as you can see it's asking
for a public key and a secret key these
are some advanced features but for the
most part you don't need to use them
for right now we just want the comments
to show up so don't worry about that
we'll just click Save here okay so now
let's just go to a piece of content one
of our articles it's going to just find
content and grab one of our articles
let's see this test one looks nice okay
you remember this one from before we
have lots of big images we'll scroll
down here and actually says it can't
connect to our URL
well that's because this HTTP local
whatever this is discussed is basically
looking for our site in our services and
saying well this isn't a real site so we
can't find it so what you're going to
have to do is go back to configuration
and then in discuss right here under
behavior you're going to want to click
this testing and this is basically going
to put you in developer mode since
you're working locally if we save that
with a developer and then we refresh our
page and see let's refresh this okay
here's our discuss so let's go to
another piece of content that I've
already had and let's just check this
out as you can see this is this one's a
little bit easier to read which is why I
went here you can see disgust shows up
it's no big deal I can just make a post
hey what's up and it's going to work now
because it's not checking to make sure
you're at that URL that it told it to be
of course when you put your site live
and or you have it on the internet and
it's already live you're not going to
want to use the testing and it should
show up fine so as you can see it's
pretty painless it took a couple seconds
to install that module get it going and
I now have disgust on all of my articles
if I wanted to add disgust to any of my
other node types it's as easy as just
clicking it here
and it's going to show up at the bottom
in the content area if you need a more
configurable you can always have a job
as a block okay well that's how to add
the discuss commenting system to your
site or blog using Drupal 7 and the
discuss module if you have any questions
please feel free to leave a comment on
the video it is up a Twitter level
just let us know what you're thinking
once again this is Scott and thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
