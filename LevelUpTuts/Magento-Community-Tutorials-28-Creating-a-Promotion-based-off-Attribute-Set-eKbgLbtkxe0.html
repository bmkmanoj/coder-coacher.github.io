up tux and today we're going to dive
further into promotions by creating a
promo code for a catalog price rule and
we're going to apply a certain
percentage to a particular type of
product actually so let's click catalog
price rules and we're gonna have this be
electronics and we're gonna have this be
cell phones so anything that's a cell
phone in electronics is going to be
getting a discount automatically with no
coupon code at all so to illustrate this
was go to promotions and let's go to
catalog price rules and you'll see
there's all these ones in here already
and these well if you have the sample
data installed you will see all of these
ones in here these are ones created by
the sample data itself you can click on
these if you have them to see exactly
what's going on here if you want to
create more advanced promotions in the
mean time but we're gonna be going over
all this stuff eventually anyways so it
doesn't really matter let's just check
this out so we're gonna click add new
rule and then here we're going to say
we'll give this 20% off cellphones and
this is gonna be for anyone anyone that
uses their site it's gonna be active
it's going to be from it's gonna start
today and we're gonna move through March
first okay we're not gonna worry about
priority on this one and then the
conditions this is where we get into
condition if all of these conditions are
true so we'll click this plus and then
you can look and see all this different
stuff you could say if the prices of a
certain amount if the manufacturers a
certain amount if the dimensions are
something you can see there's all sorts
of stuff that you could key off of you
you know even urlp you can ask very
specific products with this URL here SKU
you can have very specific SKUs on sale
with this you can also have it be just
pretty much buy anything that you can
see in your site you can key up as a
condition to add for your price rule so
we're going to say attributes set we're
going to want
okay key off the attribute set and
attribute set is and you notice you can
change this is and their sister dot dot
let's click on the dot dot that first it
is cellphones so if the edge of you set
is cell phones they're gonna get this
discount what if you want to have this
discount on everything that's not a cell
phone well then you wouldn't have to
just keep adding these attributes that
as this attribute set is this you could
actually click this is and change it to
is not so now it's going to find
everything that's it not a cell phone
and give it a twenty percent off well we
want this to be cell phone so let's
change this back to is but it just shows
you this is really powerful you can have
this very specific or very broad you can
really get exactly what you want so
let's go to actions we're going to
discount by twenty percent off by
percentage of the original price and
we're not gonna enable this counts to
sub products and we're not gonna stop
further rules from processing this way
they can use their free shipping one or
their overall ten percent off if they
would like cuz you know I've generous so
I'm gonna click this save and it's going
to save our price roll and now it says
the rules that have changed we're not
applied please click apply rules to see
immediate effect in the catalog let's
let's click apply rules right now okay
rules have all been applied and now
let's refresh our cell phone page and
you can see it has this special price
$1.99 it's 20% off it shows it here
crossed out if we let's click on the
phone let's still shows it here let's
add it to our cart and let's check it
out and and we're still getting this 10
spot discount we have the Nokia phone
it's already at a special price so this
is a good deal we've got getting two of
these things for super cheap apparently
so really this is you know this is a
really powerful thing you can set all
sorts of temporary discounts you can set
them to the last 24 hours or as long as
you want so as always if you have any
questions please leave a comment the
