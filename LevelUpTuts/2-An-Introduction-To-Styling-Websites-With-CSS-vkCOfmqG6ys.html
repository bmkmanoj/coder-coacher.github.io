up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be exploring CSS now CSS is
what you write to style your websites so
you can give them any sort of visual
character whether from moving things
left to right changing the color any
sort of website that you see on the
Internet has been made visually possible
with CSS because of that CSS is one of
the most important fundamental languages
you can learn and the best part is is a
lot of fun to write because it's very
visual when you make a change you can
see it on your website immediately upon
refreshing so let's get started right
now so in the last video we referred to
HTML as the language that builds the
structural and content aspect of your
website as you can see we have an h1 and
a paragraph tag here that are used to
display our text however those tags
really gave us no control over how these
things look the browser picked the font
ax to pick the color and it picked the
spacing and the size of the text now by
default browsers have a certain set of
default styles that they use to make all
your websites look the same in fact
without the browser's help an h1 and a
paragraph would look the exact same
however we can find out that the
browser's applying some default styles
to these elements simply by
right-clicking on it and then selecting
inspect element now this will bring up a
menu that you may have never seen before
this is called the dev tools section of
chrome now dev tools is something you
want to become very familiar with
because not only does it show you the
HTML source right here but it also shows
you what styles are being applied and it
even shows you a Java Script council if
your council isn't showing up you can
always hit escape to make it show up or
you can select it down here and it
escape to make it disappear now there's
a whole lot of other tabs in here such
as Network sources timelines profiles
and even some more to help you really
understand how your websites work but
these are all advanced debugging
functionality and we won't need them in
this series now as I said before there
are some default style
being applied to this text as you can
see we have some code right here now
this code is CSS or cascading style
sheets CSS allows you to apply styles to
your elements and you can do so in a
number of ways you'll notice that this
is h1 and then it has a curly bracket
and then a closing curly bracket in
between that are some statements we have
font size is equal to 2m s it has this
display block it has some margins after
before it has some font weight on it now
the font weight is just making this bold
the font size is making this two M's now
an M is a relative text size which we
won't quite go over yet however you can
play around with some non-permanent
style changes in here simply by clicking
in this element style area from here we
can type font - size and then after the
semicolon we can say something like 100
then we can use the unit pixels so by
having this font size 100 it's now made
this font size to 100 pixel however
you'll notice that if we hit command R
or refresh this page that style that we
changed here is gone it is non permanent
so any changes that you make within your
inspect element aren't going to remain
there so let's figure out how we can in
fact change this text and have it be
permanent so we can do so within our CSS
in our HTML file however in this video
we're going to show you how you can just
add a CSS to your HTML as is so we can
have a new tag which is the style tag
and we can close that up like so now
you'll notice this is in the head of the
document now in between these style legs
the opening and closing one we can
actually write that code as we saw it in
the inspect element
let's tab back to our browser and you
remember it was the name of the element
then open and close curly brackets and
then our definitions in between so we
can now modify our h1 simply by typing
h1 and then we can have an open and
closing curly bracket like so and in
between here we can type the property so
the property we want to change is font -
size and then we're going to have a
colon and then we're going to have the
value which was 100 pixel
and then you finish it off with a
semicolon so we have the element then
the brackets the property and then the
value now let's save this let's come
back to our page and refresh you notice
that this time we have our font size it
was 100 and sticking there in addition
if you look over in your inspect element
you see h1 font size is equal to 100
again we can modify this and you can see
I'm just holding the down arrow with
shrinking it and upon page refresh it's
always gonna go back to the style that
we've declared in our files now let's
remove this font size 100 because we
don't actually want this to be 100
pixels however a good idea might be to
make this a color let's go ahead and
give this a new color we can say color
and then colon and now the color we want
to define it can be given several ways
we can give it an actual color name in
plain English let's say red and let's
save this and refresh now it's very red
now this is the default red color that
your browser provides and there's
hundreds of so default colors that your
browser is able to read that you can
look up however the better way to define
your colors is by hexadecimal now
hexadecimal is a six digit code preceded
by a pound sign so we can say pound and
then we want to give it a color
no it's RGB so we can say 0 0 FF 0 0
let's say this and see what color we get
when we refresh you can see it's green
remember how I said it's RGB which
stands for red green blue if you'll
notice the first two values are the red
the second two values are the green and
the last two values are the blue zero
it's absolutely nothing so a total
absence of color is going to be black so
if we change this to six zeros instead
one two three four five six it's going
to be black and because it's in
hexadecimal it goes all the way from
zero to nine and then for nine it goes
from A to F F being total white so if we
have this be a whole bunch of whites one
two three four five six you can see that
it's completely white anywhere in
between we can add in a couple of zeros
we get this
he'll cyan color remember we had green
here again we can add 2x at the end and
you should see this being blue now
because of this there's a ton of
combinations here we can change a second
F to be zero and we get a little bit
different shade of a blue in fact if we
change this is something like a it's
even another shade of a blue a little
bit darker maybe a a and it's still
darker now you could really just sort of
play around here and as long as the
values are from 0 to 9 and a through F
you should be able to see a change in
the color here now you would never want
to try to guess your color via
hexadecimal that's why I plication is
like Adobe Photoshop or sketch or
anything that you're working on you
should be able to get the hexadecimal
value out of that using a tool like the
eyedropper for instance the color 5 6 4
3 6 3 is a shade of purple that we use
ad level up tutorials now I didn't come
up with this by typing in the hex code
for this I used it in a visual editor
and pulled that color directly from the
editor so as you can see we have our
first styling being done to our website
using our very first CSS in our HTML in
fact if we would like to keep this
sticking here we can actually come here
directly into our inspect element our
dev tools we could copy this entire line
we can come back to our HTML and we can
paste this in here now this is in here I
can then refresh and you can see it's
permanent so we're off to a good start
we have our first HTML code we have our
first CSS code and in the next video
we're gonna learn a little bit of more
about how and why you do things a
specific way with HTML and CSS as we
move our Styles into their own file so
as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video hit
us up at Twitter or Facebook I level up
to Torres we'd love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
