up Tut's and today I'm going to be
showing you how to change your date
formats well so in the last lesson we
made this view page and here it says the
post date is Saturday April 21st 2012
and then the time so let's say we want
to just say something like sat you know
421 2012 or something you can actually
have it say whatever you want so if we
go into the view you can see under post
date here it offers a couple of date
formats our options are long format
medium format short format time ago
there's all sorts of stuff in here and
even this one I've already created
called article format and this says
Monday , May 1 2012 well let's say we
wanted to create our own and none of
these are quite working out for us what
do we do so let's click out of here and
let's go to configuration in
configuration we can go down here all
the way to the bottom and then there's a
date and time under regional and
language and as you can see these are
our date types we have long medium short
and article and they're using specific
formats so let's add our own date type
and we're going to select this we're
just going to be a new date and the
format let's click this and you can see
there's a whole ton of options here but
they're all kind of similar they all
have the time after them and while some
of them you know might be perfect for
you you can just select one of these and
use it however if there's not something
that's totally here for you you can
create your own date format so let's
cancel out of this let's go back to date
and time and you can see in this tab
over here in the top there's also a
formats tab if we click that it's going
to get to here and you can see this is
the Monday May Mon whatever this is the
one that I created already that we're
using in the article type so let's
create a new format that we can add to
our new date type so it's going to ask
you for a format string and if you're
not familiar without PHP date formats
then you can just click this link
to the PHP manual and it's going to give
you your options so we're going to open
this in a new window and these are
really just straightforward so if you
want the let's say the day with the
leading 0 before it we can just do a
lowercase D and as you can see it even
has a little preview here so you can
make sure you're getting exactly what
you think you're supposed to beginning
so we want to say let's delete this D we
want to say that this post was done on
let's just say the month and then the
day and then the year but we're going to
have it be the short sure for the month
so if we go here you can see that if you
just wanted to say Jan or the first
three letters we can use a capital M so
we're going to say a May and then space
and then now we're going to have the day
which we had before which is a lowercase
D space and then so now it's saying May
7th and we want the full year see the
full year is a four digits is a capital
y so capital y so now our date is going
to say May 7th 2012 and if you want to
add things in here like an exclamation
point or commas or any miscellaneous
characters as long as they're not
default characters into this they'll
show up so you can see this exclamation
points came in here and then when I
added some other stuff it all tried to
give you the actual time format
representation of it so let's get rid of
these but you know if you want to add a
comma or period or whatever it's no big
deal so let's click add format ok it's
time we have lots of updates I get it ok
so now you can see our two formats are
the one that I created before and this
new one May 7th 2012 so now if we go
back to types and we add a new date type
we'll call this new type and look at our
date formats our new format that we just
created is going to be right here at the
bottom so let's add date type ok we'll
save configuration' now let's go back to
our view
we'll edit the view and then under post
date we'll click this again we're going
to select our new date format which we
called we called it new type format here
we go so apply to this display and now
we're going to save and as you can see
our posts now say post date April 21st
2012 just like we wanted it to and so if
you ever get hung up just check out this
the PHP date function you know the date
formats if the link for this is in the
date formats page if you lose this or
you don't know what this is so don't
worry about that when you go to create
your new date format it will give you
this link okay so that's how to create a
new date format you can create as many
of them as you'd like you can tweak them
you can do whatever you want
totally customizable up to you in the
next lesson I'm going to show you how to
use the connecting system discuss on
your website so we're going to be adding
the discuss module and then we're going
to be configuring and setting up discuss
with your own account once again this is
