up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you how to start thinking in
components we're going to start
reworking our project directories and
start rewriting things to be a more
component based system so let's get
started now
so if I now this page is getting kind of
unwieldly we have a bunch of stuff going
in here for instance we have this like
my resolutions title we have a forum and
we have what's going to be our actual
data and all of these things themselves
could and should be their own components
now the one thing you can think of it
about components is if something is
going to be used more than once then
obviously make it a component more than
that if something is its own chunk of
content make it a component I find once
I notice a component getting a little
bit too large I'll start to see what can
be its own component now there's varying
levels of this some people make
components for buttons and little tiny
things like that other people make
components for much larger things and
all around that scale is sort of what
works for you and your team obviously
people are going to be having different
opinions about the size of components
and things like that I'm not going to be
telling you to make your components any
sort of way however I would recommend to
keep your components nice and organized
and to make them as frequently as it
makes sense for you so in this video
we're gonna be talking about react
components and what we want to do is we
want to go ahead and take something like
this form here and we want to actually
have this form be in its own a component
so now I'm gonna make a new file I can
just throw this in the route right now
of course we're going to be updating it
in the next lesson let's me go over file
structure and things like that basically
I want to make this file be something
like resolutions form and that's going
to be the name of the component as well
so make sure your file names in
components really sort of tell a good
picture about what exactly that
component is obviously you want to not
make this be something totally arbitrary
like duck I mean if this is a
resolutions form why would it be
anything else
okay so resolutions form dot JSX now
let's go ahead and actually make this we
can import
react we can import react and this time
it check this out this is going to be a
different technique I can update my
other components but I'll show you this
we can have a comma here then inside of
brackets write component like that from
and then a string react now the reason
why you would do this is now we have
access to this component without saying
react dot component you'll notice up
here in our app we have react dot
component if you have it like this we
can now just say component instead of
react dot component not a big thing but
it will save you a little bit now let's
go ahead and let's do export default
resolutions form and now we can say this
extends component notice how we're not
doing the Trekker reactor on this that's
because we don't need to pull in any
data in this particular component so you
only need to use tracker react when
you're pulling in data okay so we now
have resolutions form extends a
component let's go ahead and we have
this component if you remember from our
very first component what we need is a
render function inside of this render
function it needs a return and this
return is just going to have parenthesis
like this so now let's go up back to our
app JSX let's scroll down here and let's
grab this entire form I'm going to grab
it out of here and I'm going to paste it
directly into this return now you'll
notice some things here we have this on
submit this dot e decent bind this if we
were to head to our actual website right
now it's going to well it's going to
complain about a lot of things but it
certainly won't let us use the form even
if it didn't complain about some things
right now because this dot address
Aleutians is still in app dot JSX so
let's also come here and grab that
grab this whole method right here pull
it out and plop it in directly above the
render function okay and now our app dot
JSX
just got a lot skinnier just got a lot
smaller here we now have the render and
we just have the resolutions and really
all this is doing is bringing in the
data and actually looks like I forgot
the class warning to export default
class resolutions form that is my bad
there again if you notice that that's
good
so we're exporting resolutions form as
the default class of this document here
now we can come back to app dot j sx and
this should stop complaining by now so
now what we are seeing is this my
resolutions and the text but obviously
no form so let's go ahead to app dot j
sx and import our form so we can say
import and then we can just import
resolutions form from then we want to
say this current directory resolutions
form JSX and now we have access to the
resolutions form component now if you
remember we can use this component now
simply by just having an HTML element so
resolutions form is going to grab
everything it's going to go to here
which is going to go to here which is
going to look in here for the default
class here and it's going to output this
render function set to our page and as
you can see now we now have our form and
if we add something new like like do
handstands you can see that although
obviously we're not about putting this
you can see if we open up our meteor
tools we now have do handstands inside
of our list of resolutions cool so my
resolutions here is looking a little bit
better as in we now have a component
here that has its own unique piece of
functionality this new resolutions form
all of this does is
add a new resolutions form and check it
out if we wanted to use this anywhere
else on the site ever again on another
page and who's gonna drop another one
any of these here you can imagine this
is like another template or another page
just by simply dropping in that
component you can have both of these and
either them will work independently from
one another but they'll both actually
take care of their expected
functionality so that's really the power
of these components is this extreme
reusability we can just like I said we
can drop this form in anywhere we need
to now and it's going to work now one
thing we haven't touched on really is
props now a prop is the ability to pass
data into one of these components now to
illustrate this let's go ahead and just
create a new component so new file here
and this file is just going to be going
to be resolution single dot JSX so this
is going to be an individual resolution
now we can once again import react the
comma component make sure your component
is in capitalized and we can say from
react semicolon now we can export
default class resolution single extends
component now once again this is going
to be we don't have to use tracker react
even though we're gonna be displaying an
individual component here we're not
gonna be grabbing that data from this
component we're gonna be grabbing the
data from the parent of that which is
going to be passing that data into this
individual resolution so let's go to say
render and now we can return at this
point you should be getting used to this
render return stuff so we now inside of
here really just need the actual sort of
shell for what a single resolution is
going to look like so let's go ahead and
have a list item because we're gonna
have this being a list
and we can now say I'm gonna put this on
a new line actually this which is going
to refer to this object itself dot props
dot resolution dot text so this doesn't
exist yet but in a second we're going to
be passing data into this component and
you'll see props in action so props
refers to essentially the data that's
passed in here resolution is that
individual piece of data so you can pass
in tons of data into a single component
and this is how you identify that and
this grabs the individual property from
that piece of data now we can also have
let's copy and paste this we can say
this dot resolution dot and then we can
say complete that's going to give us
whether this is completed or not now
let's go ahead and close off this list
item cool so we know our exporting
resolution single which means to use it
in app data JSX we need to import it I'm
gonna just copy this whole resolutions
form line here and we can change this
text to say resolution single resolution
single like that so we're now importing
resolution single where we can then use
it again down here I'm going to use it
in place of this so I'm actually gonna
turn this into a ul okay so we now have
an unordered list and I'm going to use
the resolution single component now this
is where we actually get to past props
into the component we can do that by
giving this an actual property by saying
resolution if you'll remember from a
resolution single we use that right here
so this text has to be the exact same as
what this text is so resolution is equal
to and now we can pass this in data to
do that we just have brackets and we can
pass in this res
the first item in our list here let's
just get rid of this we no longer need
this dot text so as you can see here res
is grabbing the the entire object of
resolutions I'm passing in just the very
first resolution which is an object into
this variable into this variable which
is called a prop and I'm then accessing
it with this dot props resolution dot
text and the solution that complete okay
let's actually come in here and let's
refresh see if we have any errors and as
you can see we now have this finish
react meteor series inside of an
unordered list now the reason why
completed as not outputting is because
it is a boolean and not a string if we
wanted this boolean to be output as a
string you'll notice that we can just
use straight JavaScript in here so we
could say just dot to string and now
once this refreshes we should see false
here okay so as you can see anything
within brackets here is going to allow
us to just access JavaScript as normal
without that we would not be able to so
quote we've now built two components
here and you can start to get the feel
of things we have our resolutions form
and a resolution single now this really
reflects the data much better than just
a whole bunch of HTML here you can now
see that okay we have a single
resolution and it's accepting an object
which is one resolution that resolution
is then outputting that data here now
this is going to make even more sense
once we need to have functions that do
things like updating this resolution or
maybe completing this resolution let's
say we have a checkbox then that's all
going to live inside of here inside of
this resolution single so all of that
functionality gets wrapped up in one
component so hopefully this has got you
thinking in components quite a bit more
so in the next video we're gonna do a
lot more cleanup we're gonna have this
code looking a lot nicer and
we're actually gonna have the site
looking a lot nicer by adding some
styles so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you want to help
support the creation of these videos and
many many more to come in the future
head to store that level up tutorials
comm and purchase this series right now
because you're gonna get a lot of extra
content that's not available in this
series such as how to use react router
but I get server side rendering and more
so you can purchase from store that
level of tutorials calm or head to that
same site and sign up to be a level of
pro to have access to streaming this
content before it's available on YouTube
as always is the Scott with level up
tutorials thanks for watching and I'll
see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
