Hut's and today I'm going to show you
how to take our previous CSS experiment
where we had the slide over navigation
menu and we're going to turn it into a
push over navigation menu so this menu
is actually going to push all of the
main content over and it's going to feel
very similar to like what you've
probably been used to using your phone
so check it out we're going to get
started so in the last video we left it
off with being able to completely change
our animation whether it's coming in
from the top or bottom simply by
changing this translate X value here to
reset this I have this set at the
original what we had translate X add
negative 100 that way when it slides in
it slides in from the left and we're
going to leave it at negative 100 now
what we're going to do is we're going to
delete this main navigation open class
because we're not going to be needing
this translate we're actually going to
be doing for this example is pushing
over everything and since the main
navigation is going to be positioned
just off-screen here when everything is
pushed over our main navigation is going
to come into view so to get this push
over effect that we want we actually
just need a wrapper we need a div to
wrap around everything so we can go
ahead and do is type period wrapper if
you're using code pen or Emmet you can
just hit tab and it's going to create a
div for you with the class of wrapper
now I'm going to take this close div and
put it at the end of everything so this
wrapper is going to encompass our entire
page now I'm going to indent everything
like that so we now have this wrapper
class and what needs to happen with this
wrapper class is that this is going to
push over everything so when we have our
CSS let's come back here I'm going to
open this up so it's just CSS here if I
can do that there we go let's come to
the bottom here okay so for wrapper
let's edit a transform like we had
before so we can say transform translate
X and then in here let's just say 50%
and close it off so what's funny here is
that we moved over everything but you
can see that our navigation is now
coming into view and that's because it
was pushed off just directly to the left
of our content so now that we're moving
the content and everything else over
you'll see that we have our navigation
actually showing up here and likewise if
we keep moving this to translate it more
and more our navigation is going to
slowly come over but it's not going to
come over our content it's pushing our
content out of the way so this should
look familiar but a little bit different
because we now have this wrapper that's
able to push this so let's go ahead and
set the translate value initially to
zero now we're going to also have a
wrapper
dot open just like we had before where
the transform translate x value is going
to be at 100% now we're going to give
the initial state a transition actually
I'm just going to go ahead and copy the
transition exactly from this one because
we're not going to be needing this main
navigation transition anymore this main
navigation is always going to be staying
negative 100% we're just moving its
parent over cool so we now have this
transition of transform over six seconds
and we're easing we're pushing
everything out of the way okay now with
our jQuery we need to modify this a
little bit instead of toggling the class
open on main navigation we're now
toggling the class on wrapper so now
that now when the nav toggle is clicked
right
proper is going to get a class of open
when it gets a class of open it's going
to translate 100% effectively pushing
over everything so let's check this out
it should be working now I'm going to
give this a save and click the toggle
and you can see nice and smooth it
pushed all of our content over and now
how excellent is that that is just
really it was just incredibly easy
however you'll notice that we have some
weirdness here you'll notice that
there's a scroll bar here and when I
click and drag the scroll bar over all
of our sites here so now we just have
this really wide site so what can we do
here well we can actually add another
wrapper to the outside of everything and
give it a class of and give it a
property of overflow:hidden so let's go
ahead and do that we're just going to
say outer wrapper and we're going to
wrap absolutely everything including the
other wrapper in this class I'm going to
make sure my denting is correct there
and now the outer wrapper is simply
going to get overflow:hidden okay so now
when we push open our menu here we don't
have any scroll bars and you can't get
over because everything that is not in
the window is going to be hidden perfect
so we now have this style of pushover
navigation now if you're wondering how
to get this to come in from the left or
right we would have to change two values
this time so instead of just changing
the sorry let me open the CSS all the
way here instead of just changing the
main navigation we would have to
position the main navigation because
you'll notice if we just change this one
to 100% the main navigation when we
click this it's just going to be blank
we don't want that so we would also want
to have everything transition OH
or negative 100% so if you'll notice
this is sort of an inverse relationship
here you want the content of the thing
you have pushed over to be off the side
and then you're moving everything over
so here we are it's moving in from the
right cool so this is one approach to
doing the pushover style navigation now
there's all sorts of other techniques
that we can do to make this type of
navigation happen but it should give you
enough to go along just to get the
basics of it down you know that you're
translating and pushing things left and
right and then you're transitioning
those and that is what is causing this
off canvas animation style so as always
this is Scott with level of Tut's if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video below I heard us up at
Twitter or Facebook at level up Tut's
you can always check out the level of
Tut's comm and check out level up Pro
which is the subscription service for
level up Tut's so with level up Pro you
can download the videos you can have
code examples for the CSS experiments
and we're even going through and doing
the back catalogue to make sure those
have code examples there's a private
forum you get an ad free experience on
level up Tut's calm
there's even a two hour sass mastery
course which is similar to the saz
videos that I have on level up Tut's but
it was made special for the touch plus
marketplace which no longer exists so
now I'm able to bring that to you as
part of the level of pro package so sign
up for $8.99 a month or 95 dollars a
year and just check it out help support
level up Tut's with level up Pro thanks
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
