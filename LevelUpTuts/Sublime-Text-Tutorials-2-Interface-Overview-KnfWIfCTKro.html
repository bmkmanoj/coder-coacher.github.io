up Tut's and today I'm going to be
giving you a little bit more of a
overview about what sublime text -
really looks like so I just opened up a
project here this is when I already have
open basically this little sidebar
window will pop up if you throw a folder
on to your sublime text window so the to
illustrate this I'm just going to go to
here to my desktop and I have this CSS
folder right here and I'm going to just
throw this onto onto my sublime text -
or you could even toss it onto the icon
and what it's going to do is it's going
to open up a new window and in this
window you'll have this folders here on
your left these folders you can open up
and if you'll notice you can click on
these documents to edit them right and
they're not going to pop up up here in
the in the previous window you'll notice
I had this CSS file this index.html up
here if you want the file to actually
stay open you just double click it and
it'll pop up as a tab so that way if you
have multiple files open and let's say I
open up index here I don't want to go
back and forth between these two files I
can if well if you're on a Mac you can
do command 1 to go to the first tab
command to go to the second tab just
like you're used to in Chrome also
you'll notice that over here is a mini
map of your code so you could grab this
slider hand and have it scroll down or
you can physically grab the highlighted
part of this scroll window here and you
might be able to get a little bit more
visual representation of your code I
know some people just turn this off
right away but I'm working on a large
enough monitor that you know I actually
don't mind it I don't mind there being
sort of a visual overview of my project
or whatever code I'm looking at just to
the right here so I usually leave that
on however I know lots of people turn it
off to turn it off you just go to view
and you would click hide mini-map and
it's gone you can also hide the tabs if
you like you can hide even the
the sidebar we can head sidebar right
here it's gone and now this is real
bare-bones uh if we wanted to let's say
jump to our CSS file you're wondering
how do we get to our CSS file it's still
open you can do still do tab or control
one to get to the first tab but if you
don't have the tabs open you're not
going to remember that another thing you
can do is you can click a command T and
this is going to be all of the files
that are in the project that you have
opened so if you do command T and we
just start typing styles okay you can
see that it's the only one we'll hit
enter it takes us into styles since we
already here it didn't do anything let's
do the same thing again for index so
we'll do command T index who are ready
there so you as long as you know your
file names you can really quickly jump
between them you don't even have to use
your mouse you can stay in your keyboard
if you'd like so this is a way you can
just sort of get around sublime text to
for right now I'm going to turn the
sidebar back on I'm going to turn the
tabs back on because I have enough
screen real estate have you even blown
up the text size ton your text size will
obviously be smaller than this but
really keep in mind here we can do
anything you want just like you normally
expect move these tabs around whatever
there's even a full-screen mode too if
you're working in one of the later Apple
operating systems I'm on lion here but
I'm a mountain lion on my laptop and
it's you know really the same thing so
nothing crazy there nothing out of the
ordinary
so let's see what else we have here for
options there is preferences but
preferences might be a little confusing
if you jumped in I know if you're used
to something like textmate or Kota
there's going to be a nice visual menu
for preferences that's what I'm going to
take a whole video in the next video
show you exactly how to change the
preferences and how to do it you know a
way that it works and how to do it the
right way under file you'll have exactly
what you would expect open open recent
save all that stuff under edit
we can you know undo/redo copy/paste all
the stuff you'd expect we also can
choose the inline indenting so you can
see keyboard commands here let's say we
want to indent this line I just did
command brackets like it said here to do
so you can look through here to see any
of these different key commands insert
line after insert line before delete
line so you can change how the text is
wrapping so you can wrap the paragraph
that you know a certain amount of
characters or something
so in here it's exactly sort of what you
would expect nothing too crazy selection
split the lines like I said you can just
go through these menus but there really
isn't a ton here I know if you're used
to something like Dreamweaver there's
just a whole ton of buttons and options
and I like a thousand buttons click to
add a anchor link and stuff like that
you really don't need that because it's
it's a heck of a lot faster this just
type you know the anchor link itself
yourself so under find it's you know
just like any other application
command-f find something you'll see this
little menu pops up down here if we do
command shift fine you can find find and
replace you can even have this where
where it can check in multiple files or
folders you can do things like have your
fine be case sensitive you could look
for whole words regular expressions if
you'd like so they really have a lot of
features here and then if you want to
get rid of this command find you just
hit escape and it's going to remove that
menu from down here just command F and
then it was command option F to find and
replace and then command shift F for
find and replace over multiple files
okay so let's also go to view so views
were returned off our sidebar mini-map
all that stuff there's also things in
here like layouts you can set multiple
columns here now if I have two columns I
can drag this tab all the way over here
and have both of these files open at
once and this is really great if you're
go
to be going back and forth between two
things you'd like to have them both open
maybe to check class names or something
like that as you're typing them freely
it's you know could be helpful in
certain situations I typically just
leave them here or not even have them in
tabs at all and do what we did before to
switch back and forth okay so I'm going
to click view you can notice you can
also in view under layout you could have
rows and you can have multiple columns I
think you have up to four columns four
rows you can have a grid of four where
four documents are open here and this
could be useful in all their different
various situations
I personally mostly have it in single
you know 99% of the time but having the
option to do that is is very good I like
it a lot so I also noticed you'll be
able to edit what syntax you're using
here which is the same thing we would
get if we were to click the HTML in the
bottom right corner we can set out what
our indentation is that an indentation
is using for spaces and that's pretty
standard so that should be maybe what
your comes without a box but I don't
typically change the tab because most
people haven't set up that way as far as
I know this word wrap if we were to
uncheck this word wrap you'll notice our
paragraph tags go this way a little
extend into oblivion
you know that's really nice to see your
code at a glance if you'll notice it
made this document a whole ton shorter
but I usually use word wrap because I
like to see all of the content I don't
want to scroll right I don't have you
know unlimited horizontal space okay and
of course there spellcheck in here a
dictionary if you need to use that you
can go to anything tools if you're using
a language that needs to be built uh you
can it I usually have it on automatic I
haven't had a situation let's say I'm
I'm running some Python or I'm running
some Ruby or something I haven't had a
situation where I've needed to build it
using the automatic and it didn't
correctly find the right language but
thing and I'm not doing anything crazy
usually running you know Python or Ruby
so uh the this if you need to build the
command is just command B you know run
your code you can also create plugins
and snippets of course we're going to go
over some of this stuff later projects
we have a project open right here it's
just this tab right here if you want to
save a project and open it up again
later you can save your project here so
if this is a set of files you're going
to be using all the times you might as
well just save a project if you're going
to be closing the window that way you
can just open the project and have all
that stuff come back to where it was
okay like I said there's not a whole lot
to sublime text but there's a lot of
cool stuff you can do so you know keep
watching and become a sublime text tube
master as always if you have any
questions you know hit me up on Twitter
or level up Tut's Facebook now we have a
level up Tut's or you can reach me at
Twitter a test Olinsky personally as
always thanks for watching and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
