video I'm gonna be showing you yet diff
which allows you to quickly and easily
see what's changing your files in
between commits so that's it going on
that right now
now as an accompaniment to the last
video we have get control now we don't
have one of my favorite features from
one of the best packages for sublime
text so let's go ahead and make sure
that we can have some functionality that
shows us what's changed between commits
on individual lines of each file we can
simply get a package called git diff so
we can come here to install
and we're just going to look at get -
if like so and we're not looking for get
diff details we want this one with a
hundred and forty nine thousand installs
called get diff after installing a get
diff you can see that it basically just
marks the lines of the editor where
things have changed we have some key
bindings where you can move to the next
diff previous diff that sort of stuff I
don't really use as much it's more of an
visual indicator for me so we could also
say show icons in gutter which is
something I prefer honestly instead of
the just standard colored markers and we
have a plus and minus and a dot you know
that's your personal preference it could
either look like this or could have
those icons there I prefer the icons and
if we come to our page here now you can
see when we add a line we're getting
pluses when we modify a line
you can see we're getting circles and if
we were to delete a line let's delete
this line entirely you could see we have
a minus in between those lines and once
you commit these icons in your gutter
will go away so you don't have to worry
about anything permanently or whatever
it's it's just going to be a nice
indicator while you're working on things
I actually really like it for the simple
fact that sometimes when you're writing
code you can sort of get lost in what
you're doing and not realize maybe how
much you've changed and it's almost a
good visual reminder to commit more
often and I'll really just allow you to
see what you've worked on while you're
committing your files cool so this is
git - diff it is a nice alternative to
get Gutter from sublime text 3 and I
would highly recommend it as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video of me up at twitter or
facebook at level up tutorials i love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
