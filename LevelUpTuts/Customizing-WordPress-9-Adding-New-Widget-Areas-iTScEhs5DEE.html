up Hut's and today we are going to be
talking about how to add another widget
area to your theme and now you might be
using a child theme or you might be
building your own theme but either way
the process is the same so to add a
widget area we need to do two things we
need to first tell WordPress that a new
widget area exists and that will make
the widget area show up on your widgets
page and then from that step on you can
add items available widgets to your
widget area however simply adding items
to your widget area and telling
WordPress your widget area exists does
not make it show up on your site what we
then have to do is go into one of our
templates files and wherever we so
choose to display this widget area we
need to give a little bit of code that
displays whatever widgets are going to
show up in this widget area and then
don't show up anything
if there are no widgets in this area so
great let's get started head to your
functions dot PHP file and we're going
to start adding things there so just
like in our last example what we need is
a function that's going to add this
widget area and then we need to add a
hook that's going to run this function
in a particular example or a particular
reason cool so what we want to do is we
first want to write this function and
last time you remember that we preface
preface our functions with our theme
name in this case since we're using a
child theme we're going to say function
and then 2014 underscore child
underscore and then the name of the
function is going to be widgets
underscore in it like initialize so then
we're going to have two semi or two
parenthesis curly brackets and then in
between our curly brackets we're
going to use this existing function
called register sidebar now don't be put
off by the name register sidebar it's
not actually going to force anything
about a sidebar we're just registering a
widget area so it's going to say
register underscore sidebar and then
parentheses okay now keep in mind we're
going to finish this off with a
semicolon like that now what we want to
pass into this is a needs to be wrapped
in an array so we need to say array and
then parentheses and you can put this
parenthesis on the same line as the
other one just to make it nice and tidy
here like that
and what goes in here is going to be
essentially an object or an object of
what we want our options to be for this
widget area so first and foremost we
need to give it a name so inside of
quotes we can say name outside of the
quotes we're going to say equals greater
than which is basically adding this as
the value to name and so in quotes here
again we're going to give this a name so
we can say this is going to be just for
sake of being able to see this easily we
can call this level up new widget area
okay that's a really long-winded name
for no particular reason other than
that's going to be easy to see now we
need a comma because on the next line
we're going to add something else it's
going to be again in quotes ID and
you'll see a pattern here where once
again going to have the equals greater
than and then in the quotes here again
we're going to give it an ID this is
going to be an all lowercase no spaces
so underscore for spaces version of your
name up new widget area sure up please
give your widget area the name
aim of what you would expect this to be
used for so that it makes sense to you
and not just use something like level up
new widget area because this is just
obviously a filler text for this
particular example
now we next thing we need to have is
what comes before the widget and what
comes after the widget so this is going
to be before underscore widget so this
is essentially what HTML element is
going to wrap your widget so we want to
just say because this is going to be a
side content it doesn't assign no html5
aside the aside element does not
actually denote something that's on the
side or sidebar content
but something that's not main content so
we could say aside cool comma now we
want to say after widget you can spell
this keep in mind that you can always
copy this example directly out of the
WordPress codex I'll paste a link that
way not to type it to make sure that
you're not messing anything up and
modify it as needed now this is the
closing tag for the aside keep in mind
before and after widget our the element
that's wrapping our widget now we need a
before and after title to keep in mind
what we want the title to be like what
element we'd like to use for the title
of the widget area so we can say before
title and again equals greater than and
this is also going to be an element we
could say h3 with a class of and see how
I'm using double quotes in here because
we're using single quotes on the outside
you can safely use double quotes in here
so I'm just giving this a class of
widget title you can add a title of
whatever you'd like or a class of
whatever you'd like
now after title
okay equals greater than and then once
again we're going to close out this
element okay so now we have our function
the function exists and um actually
could have a count here you don't need
to comment the last one but might as
well we have our function here that's
going to register our widget if we save
this you will notice this widget area
does not exist yet we still just have
our three widget areas so how do we get
this to show up well we need to actually
run this function keep in mind just just
by declaring this function this is never
run therefore a side bar is never
registered so to register a side bar
let's add an action like we did before
ad underscore action and then in
parenthesis the action hook that we're
going to hook into is widgets underscore
in it so when the widgets are
initializing run this function is what
we're going to say so the function is
going to go in as a string here and that
is just this name of our function this
is going to look familiar because it's
the same thing that we did when we
wanted to in queue our script we hooked
in and then we ran our function okay so
we've added our function now keep in
mind we need to wrap this all up with a
semicolon and I've saved it here now
let's come to our widget page and
refresh and voila we now have the level
up new widget area that we can drag
widgets into just like any of these
other widget areas that's pretty
fantastic so that's how you add a widget
area in the next video we're going to
continue adding a widget by modifying
one of our template files to add the
widget area so that when we add widgets
they actually show up on our site
because right now if we do they're not
going to show up at all so as always
this is Scott with level of touch if you
have new questions or comment
anything leave it on the video hopefully
somebody can get to it or I can get to
it or anybody can help asking comments
is always appreciated even if I'm not
personally able to answer them myself
so uh just check it out try it let me
know what your your thoughts are we love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
