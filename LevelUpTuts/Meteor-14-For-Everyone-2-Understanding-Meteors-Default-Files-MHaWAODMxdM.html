up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna go through the default files that
are created when we created our project
in meteor let's get going on that now so
by now you should have your application
up and running you should have your code
installed we're going to be editing our
code and generally looking at it with an
atom editor if you do not use atom it is
no big deal you can use any text editor
you would like I'm using atom with the
material dark theme and the material
dark syntax theme so in case you're
wondering that's the way this is set up
and let's check this out basically
instead of our voting app folder what we
have is a dot meteor folder this is
essentially going to contain a bunch of
stuff you for the large part do not need
to worry about if we open this folder
you'll see that we have another folder
that has logo where it has our build it
has our database all this sort of stuff
chances are you're never ever going to
head into this local folder the only
thing that you might touch with in here
is the packages file now the packages
file is what packages your application
is currently using
now you can modify this file with
various commands like meteor add package
name or meteor remove package name or
you can come in here and just paste in
or delete from here now you'll notice
the packages we have our meteor base
mobile experience Mongo base blaze HTML
templates blaze is the front-end
framework of rid of meteor by default so
we're going to be using blaze in this
series if you've ever heard that or
we'll be hearing the word blaze that's
what that refers to
that's sort of the front-end coding for
meteor and we have a reactive var which
allows us to a reactive variables we're
gonna go into a little bit about
reactive variables and how they differ
from session variables which are
included in older versions of meteor and
we're actually going to be including
session variable
and talking about the difference a
little bit now if you've ever used
jQuery you'll see that jQuery is
included as well as tracker which allows
us to have live updating and sort of
data that's constantly being pushed
through when new data comes in has an
overly simplified description of what
tracker does but that's basically what
it does tracker allows us to auto run
code then we have a standard minifiers
for CSS and JavaScript that's basically
just going to minify and concatenate our
javascript in CSS we have an html5 shim
allowing allowing us to use HTML we have
an es5 shim which basically allows us to
use a comma script v or javascript 2016
or ES 2016 as it's called and Eknath
script package allowing us to use es
2015 syntax shell server auto publish
and insecure now these last two packages
auto publishing and secure are both not
packages that we're going to be leaving
here by the end of this however these
are essentially going to make sure all
of our data is available on the client
side of things now if you don't
necessarily understand the difference
between client side and server side
we're gonna get into that quite a bit
now let's go ahead and close this folder
here and you'll notice we have a two
folders speaking of client and server we
have client and server now client side
code is going to be the stuff that is
loaded into the browser we have things
like CSS HTML and a JavaScript which
should be standard fare so inside of
your client folder you'll see we have
main dot CSS main HTML and main j/s
between these three this is basically
everything that you see here on your
browser our main dot CSS is empty
obviously because we have no CSS if we
were to say something like body and then
background of black you'll notice that
upon saving this file the browser's
instantly
refresh this is one of the cool things
about meteors build system is that it
has built-in live reloading it basically
pushes the code into your browser
without a page refresh it's pretty sweet
and it's something that you're going to
grow accustomed to if you haven't used
any sort of live reloading your hot code
pushing before they have it built into
meteor without having to do anything is
just pretty awesome I'm gonna go ahead
and delete this because we do not want
this okay inside of our HTML file you'll
see some really basic HTML let me just
pull this open a little bit and as you
can see we have our head tag we have our
body tag and now what's odd is that we
have these template tags that are
existing outside of the body tag we're
gonna go into exactly what these bean
but template tags basically allow us to
have different templates and several
different files that we can import in
the news and then basically output using
this syntax where we have a greater sign
and then the template name in between
two double brackets so this hello here
is outputting everything within this
template if I change this click me to
click you you can see we've get a click
you in this button here just like that
in addition we have this learn meteor
template where we have this info here
and if you wanted to remove this we
don't have to simply delete this
template we can just delete inside of
our body where it's referenced okay we
save that and as you can see that learn
meteor is now gone even though it's
still defined in our in it's out of our
main dot HTML so basically if we define
a template to output it we use this
syntax okay so this is the basics of
what's going on inside of our client
folder now you'll notice something
interesting if you were to put any sort
of file inside of this client folder and
save it it's gonna be automatically
imported and compiled right if we add
another CSS file name and anything we
want let's go ahead and actually do that
because that's super easy just do new
file inside of clients and we can just
say
dot CSS and we could now do body
background color and let's do right this
time save it you'll notice it
automatically gets minified and pushed
into our code despite us never ever
telling meteor to do that now this is
something that many people have found to
be really awesome about meteor and other
people have found not to be awesome
basically anything inside of your client
folder is going to get automatically
compiled as client-side code now things
have changed a little bit as meteors
grown and meteor now supports full-on
es2016 import syntax which allows us to
make use of JavaScript module so that's
gonna help us really organize our code
but our code will also only have access
to and use the things that needs to so
as we get going we're gonna be creating
an import folder and stuff like that and
we're gonna be sort of abandoning this
client folder however it's important to
note that if you have used meteor in the
past and you loved this feature where
you could throw everything in your
client folder you can still do that I
mean that's still going to work but in
this video we're gonna be using the
import folder and we're gonna be talking
quite a bit about imports as we go cool
so let's go ahead and just delete this
test file here and as we delete it
our code will recompile and just like
that our HTML is back to normal no red
background let's check out the server
folder inside of the server folder it's
essentially just a single file and
you'll notice here we're getting into
some of this import syntax where we're
importing meteor from meteor and then
we're saying meteor dot start up and
this is code that's going to run on the
server on startup for instance if we do
a console log here and just say hello ok
this is basic hello
don't forget your semicolons okay if we
have this basic counsel log let's
actually open up our inspector and
you'll notice that if we refresh this
page and our counsel we don't get
anything right this is server-side code
so the server-side code is the code
that's running on the server rather than
in the browser so anything running on
the server is not going to be accessible
to anyone using your site on the browser
unless you make it accessible via a
meteor method so we're gonna obviously
go over meteor methods quite a bit more
but as you can see we have nothing in
our console so where's this actually
being output well if we head to our
command line you'll see that we're
getting output hello on the server so as
our server restarts we're getting output
hello in our terminal here okay so just
a little bit of difference between
client and server-side code obviously if
you have only worked in client-side
frameworks like angular react that sort
of stuff then you probably haven't done
a ton of stuff on a framework that
includes both server-side and
client-side stuff or maybe you've never
even worked on the server you've never
built a node app using Express or
anything like that we're gonna be going
everything that makes it server-side and
client-side code different okay so let's
go ahead and delete this and let's close
this folder and next we just have a git
ignore which is ignoring a node modules
folder which obviously we do not see
here and we have a package.json know
inside of here we have nothing really we
have a script that says start which is
meteor run so if we were to just type
NPM start it would run meteor but other
than that this is a standard node.js
package JSON if you aren't familiar with
nodejs or a package JSON note it as
essentially its own package system which
is an entire ecosystem of packages to
assist you in writing your code and
since meteor is built on node we have
access to all of that and we can install
packages with a simple NPM install
command and what's great is that by
default we'll have access to those
packages on the client or the server
side depending on wherever we need them
so let's say you use something like
lodash or underscore I would highly
recommend lodash myself
you could always install lodash
and then use it directly on the kleiner
server-side just by importing it
obviously we'll be seeing a lot more of
that as we go so basically this is what
you get when you create a meteor
application client-side code server-side
code you have blaze you have everything
and we didn't have to write a single
configuration file no configuration
files and everything just sort of knows
how to compile as some of the strengths
of meteor is just how easy it is to get
up and running awesome so this is the
files that are included with meteor in
the next video we're gonna get started
actually writing our application we're
gonna nuke out this code and really dive
into some of the stuff that makes meteor
cool directly out of the box meteor can
be easily used with react or angular 2
or even others like polymer or view for
that matter and you don't have to be
using blaze however I will mention that
blaze does not get enough credit for
just how easy it is and if you're
building a small project experiment or
anything like that I'd highly recommend
using blaze getting to know blaze and
you'll see just how nice it is to create
something quick and easy in blaze
however if you are looking for those
other frameworks I will be doing this
exact same series with this exact same
code in both angular 2 as well as react
and you can get all of those on level up
tutorials early access by being a
LevelUp subscriber or you can head to
store dot level up tutorials and
purchase those when those come out
however I'll be recording those directly
upon completing this and we'll have a
complete suite of getting started with
meteor series so like I said if you
would like to complete this series head
to store dot level up tutorials comm and
purchase this series now meteor 1.4 for
everyone the basics of meteor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
