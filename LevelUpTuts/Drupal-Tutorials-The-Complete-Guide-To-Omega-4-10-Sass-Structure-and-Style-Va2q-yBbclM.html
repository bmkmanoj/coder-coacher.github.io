up huts and today we're gonna continue
our talk about omega 4 and we're gonna
dive into the sass the basically the
styling structure and how it differs
from things that you're used to but it
really allows for complex large websites
to be organized and it keeps your code
really great and just all-around super
nice so we're gonna get started by
talking about this Styles dot s CSS file
and this is just in your sass folder
hits in the root level of your sass
folder and it's just and it's whatever
your theme is that styles that s CSS and
you know this this file doesn't contain
a whole lot of information in fact the
only thing it really contains is this
body background purple that we threw it
in here originally and now let me go
ahead and just remove this line and this
is what it looks like when you first set
up your set your Omega project right and
so you'll notice all these import
statements and these import statements
are something incest that allows you to
bring in additional functionality
libraries partials that sort of thing so
we see these these first four are
importing external libraries so this is
importing compass then it's importing
compasses a library that allows for all
sorts of predefined mix-ins that perhaps
are you know make it so you don't have
to type browser prefixes for css3 and
there's a bunch of really great
utilities within compass so check out
the level of Tut's series on sass
encompass there's a lot of great videos
there and then we have break point which
is in a media queries library which is
going to be very very important to
making a responsive website here and we
have singularity GS singularity GS is
the grid system that we're going to be
doing in these tutorials you can also
use Susy however you'll notice that Susy
is not imported so this site is not
going to be using Susy despite the fact
that it's in our gems file so if we
wanted we could be importing Susy here
instead
but I have actually grown very
accustomed to singularity I like it a
lot so we're going to be using
singularity which is the default with
Omega 4 and now we have toolkit no CSS
toolkit is another sass library that
contains some great little tools that
can help you of course we're gonna go
over exactly what those do in later
videos
now after importing our libraries it's
split up and there's 4 more import
statements so the difference here is
these are libraries and you're not going
to edit break point and you're not going
to edit compass but down here these
import statements these are actual sass
files that you're going to be writing
yourself and using a sass extension
called globbing it allows you to import
any file that's in these folders just
without without having to declare that
file so typically incest if you wanted
to import a file within the variables
folder you would have to do it like this
and then you would have to say the name
of the file here so if you wanted import
let's look in our variables folder we
have colors if you wanted to import
colors you'd have to say colors just
like this so we want to say import
variable colors and then in addition to
that if we wanted to import our legacy
we would have to say legacy right
basically anything that was in here we'd
have to import separately but using this
s a globbing extension that comes with
it you can see it gives you a little bit
about it here then if we say let's
import anything that's in the variables
folder and then anything that's in a
folder of that that's what these
asterisks are for so this gives you the
option of having a colors s CSS file or
if you had a folder within here so let's
say let's do a new folder and we can
just say we'll call it test for now and
inside of test
have a new file in this new file is
going to be underscore test dot s CSS
spelling correctly now if we type
something in here
let's do body BG purple keep in mind I'm
just doing this obnoxious body color
because it's easily noticeable actually
let's change it to yellow so we can
actually see that this happened in
action now if we come back to our page
the background is going to be yellow so
we didn't actually have to tell our
styles to s CSS file to look for this
test on s CSS in particular but it knew
that it we wanted to bring in everything
that was within our variables folder and
compile it into our CSS file so if you
haven't worked with sass a lot you might
be wondering what's with the underscore
thing well the underscore these are
partial CSS files and what they do is
they get imported into whatever your
final CSS file is so instead of having a
thousand different CSS files there's not
going to be a test CSS file this code
itself gets compiled right down into
Styles dot CSS and here it is so that's
one of the ultimate benefits about using
sass &amp;amp; globbing is that I'm gonna delete
this is that you can have your CSS
broken up into a whole bunch of
different files keeping it really
organized and then you don't have to
worry about importing all of those files
or adding them together because it
automatically adds them together for you
now the first one we have is variables
and the reason why it imports variables
first is because variables are most
likely the thing that you're going to be
using throughout any of your other style
sheets so you would set your variables
to be all sorts of things in fact colors
our way that you would define pre used
colors in your site so if we wanted to
have the link color so let's say we want
our default link color to always be red
right so we're gonna say link and then
colon and then we can just say red you
could have a specific color here
keep in mind I'm just using these really
ugly colors to make things obvious so we
have linked as red and no if we went
into our Styles sheet we could then say
so now if we come and give our anchor
all of the color of link you'll see that
it compiles it all down and we're using
this color right so your browser or your
sass is able to say alright first import
the variables and then your website's
going to or your style sheets are going
to know whenever it sees this link color
to use the link variable that's in your
variables now what are some other things
that you're going to be declaring in
your variables file I mean your
variables folder well you can give all
sorts of stuff so basically you could
use variables for your grid sizing so
when we get into singularity we're gonna
be creating a new grid s CSS inside of
our variables and deciding our different
you know total grid sizes maybe our
gutters or our vertical spacing that
sort of thing you're gonna be defining
your colors your sort of general font
sizes legacy browser support stuff will
go and legacy but anything that you need
a variable that you need to a value that
you reuse you want to want to put into
variables and this just allows your code
to be really flexible because let's say
you take this like that your clients and
your clients off well this red is too
ugly it's too red or something or this
yellow is this red is too red so we want
this to not be this color red so we come
back and we say okay let's try a new
right so we have this other red that's
maybe a little bit more appealing come
back to our site and it's now this tone
more toned down the version of red and
it's changed everywhere even though of
course we're only using this link color
once but let's say we were using this
link color throughout our website you
change it in one spot and it's gonna
update it everywhere they have a
variable
okay well this is just the first a
little bit of the sass file structure
and I'm going to stop right now
only because I don't want this to go
super long and I'm going to cover the
last three abstractions base and
components in the next video so as
always if you have any questions leave a
comment on this video or hit us up at
Twitter to level up huts and just so you
know this information provided here is
really really helpful so anytime you see
comments and these stuff just take the
time and read it because it's gonna make
you understand this stuff better and
also in the next video we're gonna tear
through ohm a little bit which is the
the theme that comes with it to see how
they're doing things too
so as always this is Scott with level up
tubs if you have any questions or
comments it is up at Twitter I level up
Tut's listener at you're thinking thanks
