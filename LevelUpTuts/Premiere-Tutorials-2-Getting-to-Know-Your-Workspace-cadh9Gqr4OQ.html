Tut's calm i'm bringing you today your
second adobe premiere tutorial this
one's going to go over the workspace so
picking up where we left off once you
load up adobe premiere and set up your
project settings this is this is where
it takes you this is the basic workspace
this is the sort of default this is your
source clip this is the the clip that's
in your sequence this is your sequence
right here on the timeline is your media
browser info effects history over here
is your your project so this is where
all the files in your project live on
you know you can create new folders or
create new items over here trash them
whatever up top of your tools so it's
your selection tool track select ripple
edit rolling edit rate stretch razor
tool slip tool slide tool pen tool hand
in a zoom now we'll get into those later
once we have some footage in our
sequence an hour yeah our sequence here
also over here is your audio meters and
keep in mind any of these items in this
pains can be configured so to see some
of the other default configurations up
top here is the workspace selector so
you put this and let's say you're
working primarily on your audio you
would select audio here this gives you
better access to your your audio mixer
it gets rid of the the source clip here
I mean it just hides it really but it
sort of resizes everything where the
footage isn't necessarily as important
as it was before and this is mostly
where you're focusing over here in your
audio mixer something for the color
correction so you'd have a reference in
and then this would be your program
which is your sequence editing of course
is the default effects you know effects
doesn't really do a whole lot of just
sort of uh you know as you control your
effects right here which really if
you're in
the editing workspace anyways all you
would really have to do is just click
over here to effects control so I mean
these things that are sort of sort of
useful but I don't find myself using
them that often the metal logging is set
up you know so you can you know easily
edit the metadata for your fear items
but you know in the end I don't really
ever change away from editing except for
you know sometimes I want to have a
larger version of my program window so
if you notice when you hover over any of
these gaps in between the windows this
the mouse state changes and basically
you can just grab and move and stretch
any of these and you can see this auto
adjusts to fill of course it's set to
fit yeah you can have it be anything but
fit should I don't know why you'd have
it it as anything I've been fitting so
in the case that you wanted a big
version of your program and let's say
you wanted a longer sequence maybe even
you know so you can see a couple of
these so basically you can move
everything around and for some reason if
you wanted to you know put your effects
up here when you grab the top if you see
what I did you grab the top tab here you
click and hold a drag when it's when the
the purple colors in the center like
this what it's going to do is add it to
that tab if you drag this and then you
see if you have it in any of these
sectors up here the it's what it's going
to do is actually going to put it below
and not have it be its own new window
area now so here effects is over here
now and then of course we can just grab
it back and throw where it was so cool
so your workspace is perfect in its own
it's the workspace of your dreams and
you want to save it because it's really
useful and you're going to use it all
the time so you want to be able to come
back to it just like any of these
presets so what you do is you come up
here to work space and you click this
and then you click new workspace
and then call this my awesome workspace
enter so now it is one of your defaults
let's see so we go to metal logging I
know takes you that one let's come back
to my awesome workspace and it's right
back to where I was um if you click
let's say we go back to editing you'll
notice that this is still stuck how it
was when we saved my awesome work space
so to get this back to the way it was
you just do reset current workspace are
you sure you want to read yes and now
it's back to normal you can go to my
awesome back and forth and we're all
good all right and that's it for the
workspace in the next tutorial we're
going to show you how to import some
footage so then we can then get into
some editing and all sorts of cool stuff
once again this is scott with level up
tuts calm you know feel free to let me
know if you have any questions or if
there's anything else you want to learn
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
