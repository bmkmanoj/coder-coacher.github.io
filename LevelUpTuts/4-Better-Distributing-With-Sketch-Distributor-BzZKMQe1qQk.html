tutorials and this is going to be a
quick video on a really nice plugin that
gives you the distribution features that
may be sketched should have by default
this is going to allow you to select
some items and say distribute these
layers and then you're going to be able
to specify the distance between these
layers instead of just equally
distributing them it's going to equally
distribute them at a given distance
apart so this could be really useful if
you're designing some sort of a
navigation and then instance you'd have
nav items and you're going to want them
to be a certain distance apart and this
is going to take care of that for you so
check it out let's get started right now
so here we have a site and it's really
similar to the one the last video but as
you can see I sort of messed up the
order of these and I got rid of the rest
of these lines here let me zoom in so
you can possibly see that a little bit
better okay there we go now what we want
to do is distribute these evenly right
when we select all these in first let's
click align left and then let's click
distribute vertically so what's great is
that they're all evenly placed it's all
vertical but the amount of which it is
if we do alt and then highlight over the
next layer we can see that it's 23
pixels and that amount was sort of an
arbitrary amount based on the distance
between the first and the last so to
have this work you have to have the
first in the last item set up where
you'd like select and then distribute
and then now they're distributed between
those two points however that's not
necessarily how we'd like distribute to
work so let's say you're doing this
design and you already know you want the
margin between these two be 20 pixels
even what we can do is use a plug-in
called sketch distributor and
distributor is going to allow us to
actually put in a value while it's
distributing our layers so let's come to
the sketch tool box if you don't have
sketch tool box just google it and
download it best
but I feel like at this point you should
probably have it so we can say
distributes I'm going to just type in
dist and you'll see distribute or by Pez
so now if we click install it's going to
download and install this okay so we've
now have sketch distributor installed
now what I'm going to go ahead and do is
select these four groups and like I said
I want these to be distributed by 20
pixels in between each one so we weren't
able to define that with the previous
method but now we can come to sketch
plugins and then distributor and select
this and we want to distribute these
vertically and we want to distribute it
by 20 spacing so let's go ahead and
click OK now you'll notice they've come
up together a little bit now with one of
the layers selected if I hold the Alt
key while I hover over the next layer
you can see that it is in fact 20 pixels
so again 20 pixels 20 pixels perfect so
now we can select all of these let's go
ahead and align them over here with all
this stuff in fact I'll just I'll just
select all of this and hit a line left
now what we want is we want these lines
to be distributed evenly between all of
these different layers now because this
line is six pixels of what I actually
want it to be ten so I'm going to bump
this up one two three four fold out we
can see it's now 10 pixels away now i'm
going to go ahead and create four copies
of the sign just by having this layer
selected doing command D we have 45 so
let's select all of these lines let's
come to plugins sketch distributor
distributor now this value here I came
from some math that I'm not going to
necessarily go over but we want it to be
10 pixels distance between these two and
then we always want 10 pixels on top of
each of these so what it comes out to is
66 pixels of spacing you can do that
math on your own time and I'm going to
Khloe head and click OK and as you can
see we now have all five of these lines
equally distributed
as you can see we can hold alt we can
see that the line is 66 apart it's seven
on the bottom and 10 on the top from
every single one of these like so
perfect so you've now distributed these
and if you notice that there's also the
sketch distributor allows you to
distribute things vertically as well as
horizontally just is a check box when
you're making that selection cool so
we've now shown you how to use sketch
distributor to do some really cool even
distributing where you have a lot more
control over what's going on so as
always if you have any questions or
comments we become in the video here to
set that Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials we always love to hear from
you thanks for watching and we'll see in
the next 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
