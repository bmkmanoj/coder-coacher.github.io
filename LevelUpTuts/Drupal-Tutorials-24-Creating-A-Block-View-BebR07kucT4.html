up Tut's and today we're going to create
our first view and this view is going to
be a block view so to do that we I'm
going to assume you've already installed
views and if you installed views you
should have also installed the KS tools
module those too you can get over at
drupal.org search for views if you do
install views make sure you install the
views UI as well it will tell you that
it requires KS tools so you want to grab
that one and then forecast tools the
only thing you need to enable is just
the base KS tools so if you see here I
have both those installed so go and
install those pause this video and if
you already have you can you know keep
watching and we'll create our view so
we're going to go to structure and then
we're going to go to views since I use
views all the time I'm going to add it
to my shortcuts so we'll end it here
here you can see and you can see I've
already created this featured projects
well that's what I showed you in the
last tutorial when I was just going over
what views are but we're going to create
our new view so we'll click add new view
okay and it's going to ask for the name
we're going to just go to just call this
a test view you can call it whatever
you'd like you can give a description
that would show up in the admin section
just maybe for further clarification
test view delete later so just so I
don't have to you know keep this around
and it's going to by default check
create a page but we're not going to
want to create a page we're going to
want to create a block the page views
are a little bit more complex and I
think it's easier to start with the
blocks so we're going to unselect create
a page and select create a block block
title we'll just test view but right now
we can leave the display format as an
unformatted list of titles and it's
going to say 5 and do we want to use a
pager no so we'll click save and exit
well I'm sorry you should have clicked
save and continue' I click save and exit
but any great I'm back here at the view
screen you can just click Edit here
so this is the views edits screen as you
can see there is a lot going on although
there's even more under this Advanced
tab there's all sorts of stuff here and
even down here if auto preview is
selected which does by default you have
your view is already outputting content
so let's go over a little bit exactly
what this view is doing as you can see
all of our content is here it's pretty
much everything we've ever created any
piece of content it's pulling articles
it's pulling projects it's pulling
pretty much you basic pages anything
that we've ever created and you can see
it has a pager as a title Ken so let's
start at the very top the block name
display name we'll just call this test
this is just something you can identify
it by in the back end of your site this
does not display anywhere this well does
not display anywhere on the front end of
the site this title is what's going to
be shown right here if you don't want to
display a title which let's keep the
title for now if you don't want to
display you can just delete this and it
won't show up no big deal
format lets you choose between all sorts
of things grid HTML list table and we'll
get into those more once we mess around
with the format in a later tutorial but
for now just know that format is
selected here and unformatted list has
its own settings which you can access
here so this is saying show fields which
we're going to want to show fields and
if you remember for many of our other
tutorials and your content type your
content type is made up of various
fields so what we're saying is fields
show the content title ok as you can see
all of our content titles are being
shown so fields is really what you're
going to be displaying filter criteria
is a filter so the only filter we have
set up right now is just that it's
published says published yes ok if it's
published it's showing up okay sort
criteria
this is the order in which it's coming
in it's coming in from post-date and
descending okay so our blacks innings
our block name is set to none
permissions if you can view published
content you can view this block okay all
the stuff we're going to get into more
advanced in the next couple of tutorials
but I'm just going to go over the basics
here header if we wanted to add a header
you can add one or a footer we are using
a pager right now as you can see if we
want to turn this pager off we can just
click display all items or display
specific number or specified number of
items we'll click this one and we'll say
display five items so now as you can see
that pager is gone and even though I
updated here if we were to exit out of
this window these changes would not take
an effect into our site we have to go up
here and click Save before we will
notice anything okay so well we have
this view it's just a whole bunch of
titles with the title of test view it's
you know not super useful but this is
the very basics of views so let's add
this view to our site somewhere in the
next lessons we're going to go over how
to get more into filters to make this
more advanced but for now let's click
out of your views and as you can see it
doesn't show up anywhere
that's because what's happened is that
this view has been created as a block if
we come into blocks and scroll all the
way down to our disabled blocks we
should find one named test so you can
see view test view test is right here
and let's say show up in the content
actually I'm going to take that back
let's show up in the sidebar first right
above the navigation click Save and
we'll come back to our site here and as
you can see right here test view has
shown up and here's the title and here's
our five pieces of content that we've
told it and if we would have told it to
have the pager it would have had the
pager right down here and actually if
you would have noticed just now when I
was in the block screen and I was
moving this around and I click saved it
sometimes when you're initializing a
block that's disabled and you're putting
it somewhere if you put it at the top of
the list and click Save it sort of
always drops it to the bottom so just a
heads up if you notice that if we
actually wanted to be above it you know
you could come back in here move it
above it and click Save and then this
second time out
it'll be on tab cool so this right here
this test view is a very first view
you're bringing in five pieces of
content and you're displaying it in the
way that you have told used to display
it in the next lesson I'm going to show
you how to use filters to control your
view just a little bit more once again
this is Scott with level up Tut's feel
free to leave a comment if you have any
questions as always thanks for watching
