tutorials and in this video I'm gonna be
showing you a new plugin for sketch
called sketch constraints now sketch
constraints allows you to set all sorts
of layout constraints onto your layers
so that way when you create a new
artboard with these same elements in
them you can hit a single key command
and have your whole layout sort of
refresh and refit the layout making
adaptive design really easy so let's get
going on that right now
so sketch constraints you can grab from
sketch toolbox which is really just the
easiest way to install any plugins if
you haven't heard me say that a thousand
times
and we can just find that just by typing
in constraints you can find sketch
constraints right here click the install
button then go ahead and reopen your
sketch app and we'll be ready to go
using sketch constraints so here we have
an artboard right now this is really
nothing fancy it's not going for any
design awards or anything like that but
we basically just have this layout and
we have a button down here we have some
hello text we have this header and we
have just the standard gray background
all these colors actually come from
sketches default colors let's actually
say that we've decided that we want to
make a new version of this layout that's
just a little bit bigger right it's a
little bit larger overall made to
accommodate a different sort of tablet
portrait size so what we do is maybe we
right-click on so maybe we click on this
artboard and click command D to
duplicate it then from there we can drag
this artboard or we can type in the
dimensions for it to be exactly how we
want it but now you'll notice we're
stuck with the problem we have to come
in here to resize this or type in the
numbers here to match resize this the
type and the numbers we have to recenter
all the elements and reposition them and
in some cases we'll need to resize them
and this is just sort of
an unnecessary step it takes a little
too long and it's just tedious well
that's where this plugin really comes in
handy because what you can do is set
constraints or rules I'm gonna delete
these layers so I'm just deleting this
entirely what you can do is set
constraints and rules to your layout
here and individual items based on their
layout name so we have this rectangle
here I'm going to change this to header
we have this hello word I'm going to
change this to heading okay so we now
have several different layers in here
and we all have sort of ideas about what
we'd like them to do so another we have
constraints and stuff let's go ahead and
start setting some constraints so a easy
constraint essentially would be that we
want this hello text to always be the
same distance from the top of the
application and we want it to always be
in the center so with this layer
selected we can hit command E brings up
a menu now what's great about this is
since we always want this to be the same
distance from the top of the artboard
which is 252 pixels so we could type 252
in here for the Y position or we could
click this drop-down and select 252 so
the drop-down is going to have its
current value in there so we don't have
to go fishing for that if you don't know
it offhand so now this is going to
remain 252 away from the top of the
layout no matter how large our layout is
in addition we want this to align
horizontally so we always want to stay
in the center ok let's go ahead and
click OK now let's go ahead and once
more select this entire tablet portrait
and the duplicate it I'm going to click
in resize this make it nice and big now
I'm going to do command L and you'll
notice this hello jumped to the middle
so it stayed the distance away from the
top but it jumped in the middle so what
this command L does tells your layers
inside of your artboard to sort of hey
get in line with these constraints
let's go ahead and delete that once born
let's add some more constraints and
really see this come together so I'm
gonna delete the layers okay let's add
some constraints to the header and app
name I'm going to group these together
and it's just going to be header now add
some constraints we're going to want
this to remain 0 from the right and 0
from the left it's going to take up the
entire width we're also going to want to
just keep this exactly where it is other
than that so we want it to stay 0 from
the top 0 from the left and 0 from the
right
okay in addition we want this background
let's add a constraints let's add
constraint to the background command E
and we can just say and if we want we
can just say 0 all the way around okay
so now let's go ahead and let's see now
that we have a couple more let's redo
this duplicate let's go ahead and change
the layout let's do command L and you
can see our app name is now filling up
the entire width the hello is in the
center and we are looking pretty good
now there was a little bit of a
difference here you'll notice that this
app name right here is now it's now 51
pixels away from the left we're before
heroes 36 that's because it's trying to
make this sort of distribute as this
gets wider and that's certainly no
problem if you ever owned wider screen
that distance can certainly be changed
however let's go ahead and try to keep
this the same so let's delete the layers
once more I'm gonna come in to this
header folder I'm going to add another
constraint by command E command E I'm
going to say make sure that you are 36
from the left and 31 from the top ok and
let for the last one let's come to this
large button here we want to first make
sure that this click here constraints
this is the text of click here we want
this to
line horizontally the thielemann thing
I'm going to add here now the button
itself command e let's actually say we
want this button to grow with the
application so we can say we want you to
be 80 from the edges at all time so this
button should now stay aligned
horizontally but it should always stay
at this far from the left and right and
we can pin it to the bottom too by just
saying 84 here okay
so we now have our whole layout it's set
to these constraints we can duplicate we
can make another artboard here we can
increase the size running command l once
more you can see we now have a scaled up
version of this layout and it works
again if we want to do this once more
you can see based on the rules we set
its scaling this up appropriately so
this is a great way to make a layouts
that are going to adapt to your width
and adjust accordingly based on the
rules that you're setting so as always
this is scott with level up tutorials if
you have any questions or comments leave
a comment the video is up at twitter or
facebook at level up tutorials I love to
hear from you thanks so much and I'll
see you in the next one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
