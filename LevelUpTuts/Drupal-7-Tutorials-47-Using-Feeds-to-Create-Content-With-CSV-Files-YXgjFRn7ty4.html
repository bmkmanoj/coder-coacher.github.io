level of Tut's and today we're going to
take our CSV file that you have made or
I have made or whoever and we're going
to import it into Drupal and create
nodes out of it so to get started you're
going to want to have a CSV file mine's
really simple has a name column and a
body column and basically I have four
titles here and for short non sentences
and this is going to important to the
body and this is going to import in the
title and I'm going to show you how to
do that using feeds for Drupal okay so
the first thing we want to do is we're
going to need to create this content
type if you've already created your
content type great skip ahead a little
bit and get to the feed importer section
where we're actually creating that but
I'm going to create a content type here
and just so this is painfully obvious
we're going to call this feed so feed
title whatever
I'm not going to display the I it
doesn't really matter I'm not really
displaying this stuff anyways okay so
I'm going to just save the content type
and this is pretty much any content type
you know if you're creating one and you
have all sorts of fields you can have
those fields import just keep on using
this example and extend it to your own
fields but I'm just going to show for
simplicity sake just the title in the
body in this one so we don't have to add
any fields but if you want to by all
means go ahead and try it out okay so
now we have this content type now we're
going to go to structure feed importers
feeds importer I'm sorry and here's the
one that we created last time if you
haven't just create Adam click add
importer and you can name it anything
you want I just named this simple CSV
and we're going to start at the very top
here this basic settings and we're going
to go down and we're going to configure
this okay
so let's click settings here and as you
can see it's simple CSV description can
be whatever you want if you have lots of
feed importers it's going to be helpful
to name them and have their descriptions
so that you could you know decipher what
the different ones are so we're going to
be using a standalone content form for
this I'm going to click import and it's
going to
port and we're not going to have this
periodically import and it's going to
import on submission click Save okay now
let's go to change so the fetcher is
going to be a file upload and not an
HTTP fetcher this is a file I physically
have on my on my hard drive here and I'm
going to upload it and then click import
so we'll click Save here and you'll see
now it says file upload down here so we
can edit the file upload settings and
here are our allowed extensions you can
use txt CSV TSV XML OPML we're going to
be using a CSV so it's nice and easy ok
and the supply path to file or director
it directly instance if it's for experts
we're not going to do that anyway so
basically we're just going to click
browse find the file and then get it
that way ok so parser this is going to
be a CSV parser because we're using a
CSV and so this is how feeds knows how
to handle this file
ok we'll click Save and you'll see that
this is now since CSV parser down here
we'll go to settings for that ok
the default delimiter of course this is
a comma separated file so the delimiter
is going to be commas however if yours
is separated by semicolons or tabs it
can also do that
ok and this no headers check to see if
the does not start off with a header row
this does start off with a header row
I would recommend it if you're
controlling your CSV file just to do it
ok so we didn't change anything there so
now it's on to processor ok we're going
to want to create nodes the nose we're
creating our of our feeds and a content
type so let's go to settings and what we
want to do is we want to update existing
nodes so let's say we change something
in our feed and then we re-upload the
feed it's just going to change that data
it says it's a little bit slower but we
only have four items in our feed so it's
not going to be a big deal
and the content type is going to be feed
because that's the content type we just
made of course it could be anything if
you'd like we could even import these
into a basic page if we want to do so
text format we'll leave it as plain text
it's no big deal right now but of course
if you you know had a preference for
that when you're importing your body
text you're going to want to select that
here the author we can have this be
let's be Scott okay nodes expired never
click Save on this and then mapping okay
so this is where the headers come into
play right so let's select a target here
we have our title and we want our title
to be the name column so let's use this
name right here it will come back to our
Drupal and the name of the source field
is going to be name and the target is
title so now these names are going to
get imported into title ok and now we're
going to select body and if you look on
your spreadsheet it's whatever it is an
hour so it's body so it's nice and easy
of course it could be anything you
wanted and we're going to click Add so
keep in mind when you're importing feeds
you have to have something that is a
unique target usually if you have like
an ID or something that's getting
imported you're going to use that if we
go to our spreadsheet you'll see that
all of my feed titles are unique and
they're going to be unique for this
example so we're just going to say that
the title is unique however you're going
to want to make sure that whatever
you're clicking here is in fact and
always going to be unique okay so now
let's click Save if we see this legend
this just like sort of tells you what
each of these targets are of course you
can probably figure them out by what
they're called but if you need help this
is what they are ok so now we have our
feed is all ready to go it knows where
to look for each of these targets and it
knows what to do so now's the fun part
now
get to import the feed remember at the
last video I said that our feed importer
would be available at our domain /
import okay and here I'll list all of
the different feed importers you have
sorry this is a little small here this
says simple CSV so this is our feed that
we created click that and so okay this
is going to be easier to read with your
theme I should probably just put this on
back on garland or whatever for a second
or Bartek I guess so import CSV files
with one or more of these columns name
and body ok the column name is mandatory
and could and considered a unique which
it is and our file is going to be
delimited by commas and again you can
check if there's no headers in your
particular file here but we have headers
so if you had a Google spreadsheet you
could just click file download as CSV
okay if not you have any other they're
sort of CSV just export it as you choose
make sure it's saved as a CSV so now
click Choose file right here it's going
to bring up in this dialog box
of course mine's in my downloads and
should be right at the top here okay so
I'm going to check this and untitled
spreadsheet whatever and we're going to
click import and this is going to import
our notes if all is well if all is
correct
okay so let's click import so I'm sorry
you can't really see this a little small
but it says status and no imported items
okay so the problem is somewhere in our
importer and let's actually check it out
let's go to the basic settings here and
you'll notice somehow this import on
submission got unchecked I might have
done that one I was clicking around by
accident and just did not notice it so
import on submission needs to be checked
here so sorry about that and let's go
back to our feed and now let's as you
can see it already has our file your
file name will be right here so we don't
have to upload it again you can just
click import and this time you see that
there was actually a progress bar going
across since it created four nodes okay
so let's check out our find content here
and you can see the feed worked import
incorrectly okay and let's go to edit
and the body is also here it also looks
like it didn't save my out there for
some reason maybe I just was clicking
around too fast or something
okay so let's change this a little bit
let's go back to our feed here and let's
let's change some of these okay
I have no idea okay and actually let's
add a couple more this title needs to be
unique okay and now I'm going it down
let's says a CSV again okay so now I'm
going to go back to our importer I'm
going to do a choose file and I'm going
to grab the new one this one right here
we're going to open this they're going
to import again okay so now you can see
it says created two nodes and updated
one node that's awesome so if we refresh
our content here you can see our new
items and the updated one which we
change the title changed and if we go to
the body you can see the bodies here as
well okay so this imported node
information off of a CSV and turned it
into nodes if you wanted to delete all
of the items we just created in your and
most Drupal themes up top here there
will be several rows of buttons I'll
site import delete items log I have mine
up here just because I usually do that
in my projects for some reason I enjoy
it I'm going to click delete items and
click delete and just like that if we go
to find content it deleted all of the
feed items so let's say you import some
data and it's not quite right and
instead of just updating it you just
want to get rid of it completely that's
an easy way to make sure that the
content that you've brought in with that
feed it can just be deleted okay well
that's how you import a CSV file using
Drupal's feeds in the next lesson I'm
going to show you how to use an RSS feed
that's on the Internet to import into
nodes
once again this is Scott with level up
tuts and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
