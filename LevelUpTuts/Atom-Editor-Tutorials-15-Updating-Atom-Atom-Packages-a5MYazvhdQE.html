up tutorials and in this video I'm a
showing you how you can update packages
with Adam also quickly and easily show
you how you can check for new updates
and Adam itself so let's get going right
now so Adam offers pretty transparent
and easy ways to figure out how to
update your application if you've
installed a bunch of packages you may
noticed over time that there's a little
purple to updates or however many
updates available here in the bottom
right if you were to click that it's
actually going to take you to the same
page that you'd get to if you went to
preferences and then selected updates
from the left-hand column now you'll see
that we have the available updates for
the packages we need now we can just
click update all and it's going to
update the packages that have new
versions for us so after these take the
time to download and install an update
you'll just have the new package version
here and you'll be good to go now that's
nice is that we just have a pretty
standard interface for this kind of
thing we see the available updates if we
want to check for new ones we can always
check for new updates I can't imagine I
would have any right now but you can
check for updates yourself manually and
as you can see all of your packages are
up to date now if you want to update
Adam itself you can always head to Adam
check for update and you'll see that I'm
currently on the latest version if
there's a new version it's going to
download and install the latest version
while closing and reopening Adam for you
so as you can see updating your packages
and your application and Adam couldn't
be any simpler we have some pretty easy
ways to do that we can just go to
preferences updates or if there's an
update available it will make itself be
known in the bottom right corner where
it'll tell you that there are updates
available
so this is just about as easy as it gets
and it's one of the reasons why I really
like Adam it just has a really nice
interface as an application and works
the way you'd want it to as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments that
become in this video or hit me up at
Twitter or Facebook elavil tutorials I
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
