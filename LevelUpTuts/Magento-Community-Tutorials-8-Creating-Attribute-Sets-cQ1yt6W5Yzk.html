of Hudson in the last lesson we created
the category tutorials and then we
created a sub category Magento tutorials
in this lesson I'm going to show you how
to use attributes and why they're
important for your products and product
types so what I actually go to catalog
attributes and then we're going to click
manage attributes sets first off we're
going to create an attribute set and
it's going to be for our tutorials if
you notice the ones that we have here
our monitors hard drive furniture
computer cell phones so these are
actually the type of products well they
very well may be how you have them
broken up into your categories it's not
really the same thing these attribute
sets are really what distinguishes what
kind of attributes each product has so
the attributes might be something like
size or color or parts or just something
that would be distinguishable from each
type of product to the next so let's
create a new attribute set and this is
going to be for tutorials so we're going
to add a new set and we're just going to
call this tutorials ok and we can choose
what we want to base this off of but we
don't want to base it off of anything
we'll base it off of the default this
will allow you to create a very
different if you want to base it off
something let's say we base it off of
shorts t-shirts it's going to have all
of the same things as t-shirts and then
you can change them and add them from
there that's a nice time-saving method
in case you have very similar yet
different attribute sets to create so
we'll click Save attribute set
okay we now have our attribute set now
in this screen here's the name of our
attribute said if we need to change it
you can just do that right here groups
these are the attributes that the
current attribute set is already
assigned and these are unassigned
attributes the unassigned attributes are
ones that have already been created for
other attribute sets and are just not
being used for this particular one as
you can see something like hard drive
speed CPU speed RAM size shoe size
gender these things don't apply but they
do apply the t-shirts or computers or
whatever so this were created and then
left alone so after you create an
attribute it's going to show up in this
menu unassigned attributes and then you
can then add it to your attributes set
so by default our attribute sets are
named skew weight status tax class ID
URL key visibility and now those ones
are all things that Magento needs as
well as news from date and news to date
and country of manufacture these little
red marks here mean you can't get rid of
these but let's say these tutorials
don't have a color but this is something
that many products do so they sort of
add it in by default we can actually
click and drag this off of here and we
can click and drag this manufacturers
off and over to unassigned attributes
because these tutorials don't have a
manufacturer or our color we're going to
remove those from them and they're just
in there because it's the default so
anything that you can see that doesn't
have a red a little minus sign within a
circle next to it is something you can
remote like cost these tutorials are at
no cost they're going to be digital
files or whatever they're just fictional
if you want to have cost in there then
you can leave that in there but these
don't have any cost so I'll be removing
that as well so you can see there's the
general categories here to which we can
collapse so we've already gone through
general and has everything we need right
now we can minimize this and now we can
just see what's next so prices we don't
need to really change anything special
price you just have priced
group price special price MSRP so you
can have all this stuff in here we don't
need to changing this right now will
minimize this meta information meta
title keyword description perfect images
thumbnail small image gallery yep cool
design description this is all stuff
that is normal and stuff we can't remove
anyways so recurrent profile gift
options when we create a product I'm
going to go through each of these and
show you what they do
however just know that these are ones
that you cannot remove for now and we're
just going to click Save attribute set
okay so now we have our attribute set
tutorials under our manage attribute
sets when you create a product you can
now select it to be a tutorials however
we want these tutorials to have some
specific options so in the next tutorial
I'm going to show you how to create your
own attributes and then add them to your
attributes set that way we can get our
attributes at all ready for starting to
create products if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
