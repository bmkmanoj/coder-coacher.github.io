up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be explaining the difference
between a black level item and an inline
item now we're gonna show you what the
difference is and what it means when
you're placing elements in your HTML so
check it out let's get going on that
right now so in the last video we talked
a little bit about structure and how
we're using different elements to do
different things despite not having any
sort of initial styles like the main
element doesn't really provide any sort
of initial styles like in terms of font
size or things like that like you have
with maybe an input or an a header
element or something like that however
there is an important distinction so
let's head to our website I'm going to
right click inspect this element and
you'll remember I said there was
basically no built-in properties however
if you remember you select main you see
that we have display block and you might
be wondering well what is display block
and what does it have to do with this
main element well the two polar
opposites in terms of display our
display block and display inline
so display block you'll notice all of
these header main footer these all get
display block along with in the header
tag like h1 and a paragraph tag this
paragraph tag here they're all block
level elements now in HTML you have two
types of elements you have a block level
element and an inline element now block
elements are going to take up the full
width they're going to be able to set a
width and height on so we could actually
say width is 80 percent or something and
this block level item will obey that and
you can have margin top and bottom left
right and padding all the way around as
well
now inline elements by default do not
take up any sort of whip and in fact you
cannot assign them a wit so an inline
element might be a span attack so we can
have a span tag to our build websites
and against a span like so and then
close this off around the B okay
never on the build there so we now have
a span tag here and if we refresh you'll
see nothing crazy nothing's changed at
all if we select span you can see that
it is display:inline here it's inherited
that but what it's not doing is it's not
taking up any sort of width if we were
to come here and click on this element
style we can give this some temporary
styles and we can say display block now
what you'll notice is that automatically
it's taken up the full width and it is
now separating these two paragraph tags
when I remove this display block you can
see it's definitely in line again now
what kind of things can we do to display
block that we can't do to in line well
we can't add a width if I were to say
with 100% it's not going to be taking up
100% it's in fact it's not going to
change at all and we can't actually set
a height and we can't give it a margin
top and bottom if we were to say margin
- the top and then say 10 pixels you can
see that just by hovering over we don't
get any sort of margin at all like we do
with the h2 by the way in this inspect
element view when you hover over an
element in your browser you can see the
orange lines above and below the blue
selected element well those are actually
the margins so if you see over in the
bottom right over here you can see that
we have the margins right here and we
have border padding and then the element
itself so as you can see padding will be
green border is going to be yellow and
margin is going to be this orange color
now we'll get into a little bit on when
to use margin and when to use petting
and
but but all you need to know right now
about display:inline verse
display:inline-block is for block level
elements are things that need to take up
the whole space and need to have margin
with height that stuff applied to them
and in line displayed elements are going
to be elements that are going to be
styled in line with your content like we
can take this and even though we can't
apply a width margin top to it we can
say color red and you can see just the
text within this span is getting a mart
is getting the color red so if you want
to affect something in line you can
always wrap it in a span now what other
display:inline tags are there well well
the basic display block tags are things
that we've come across like paragraphs
and headings we have these mains form
tags header any sort of div unordered
lists list unordered lists that sort of
stuff we're all going to be display
block by default however you can't
certainly change them if you'd like for
instance we can come in here and say
display inline on our h2 and you can see
it no longer takes up the entire width
but since it's sandwiched in between
block level items nothing's going to
come up on the line with it but as you
can see it's it's no longer taking up
the whole width just the width of the
text here so we have display inline but
as far as elements that are display
inline by default most common ones are
things like an anchor tag that links to
another page a span tag like this one
that just allows you to sort of wrap
certain pieces of text to style them
things like AEM which is an emphasis tag
which you can use to make things
italicized pretty much anything that
you're just using to style a group of
text now the ones that you're going to
be coming across most often are the
anchor tag and the spam tag other than
that by default and display inline
elements you won't see as much so this
is display inline and this is display
block I hope that clears up the
difference for you
in the next video we're going to start
talking about how to identify pieces of
our content in our HTML using an ID so
as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments they could come and the video
artists up at twitter or facebook at
love love to
we love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see you next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
