level of Tut's and this is going to be
an introduction to this Omega for Drupal
7 course and now I'm going to approach
this a little bit differently and now
I've planned this course out it's not
just going to be a series of maybe
sometimes related tutorials this is
going to be a complete site building
you're going to learn all about the ins
and outs of Omega 4 what's different how
to get by and how to do everything
you're also going to learn about what's
different in Omega 4 how to use all the
cool sass functions that are within it
how to use all the cool drush stuff
that's going on and basically how to use
one of the most advanced cool drupal
parent themes that exists so this is
brand new it's cool stuff and it's way
different from Omega 3 so if you've
downloaded Omega 3 and you're used to it
and then you thought hey let's try Omega
4 and are completely stumped or you've
never used Omega at all this is the
video series for you you're going to
learn everything here so what does this
course assume this course assumes that
you have at least a knowledge of Drupal
at all you can stall Drupal you've used
Drupal you've maybe watched our videos
before this also assumes that you have a
working Drupal installation this course
will not go over installing Drupal we do
have videos for that on our channel you
can check those out if you want to learn
how to install Drupal locally on your
machine however I'm going to be starting
with a completely fresh copy of Drupal
here that way we can make sure that
there's going to be nothing else getting
in the way of learning Omega this course
also assumes that you have drush
installed we have a video tutorials on
drush also on our channel however it's
not required but we will be going over
things using Drudge and without using
dress so this assumes that you already
either know how to install drush or have
it installed this course also assumes
that you have at least a very basic
understanding of what sass is we're not
going to be going over
the SAS basics here however it's not a
topic that's extremely difficult if you
have CSS knowledge so keep watching in
this series we're going to go over
everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
