tutorials and today we're going to
continue showing you the major logins
that you can use for meteor so in this
video we're going to talk about the
Google login so you can use your Google
account to log into your meteor site and
it's really easy to set that up so let's
get going on there right now so in the
last video if I sign out here you can
see we haven't sent in with Facebook and
Twitter so now we're going to continue
that run of adding different types of
accounts here so in this video we're
going to show you how to you you can
install log in with Google and as you
probably guess the process is very
similar so let's head over to our
terminal and in our terminal window
where we've installed our plugins we can
hit meteor add and then the package
we're going to add is going to be
accounts - Google ok so this is going to
grab our Google accounts package and
after this installs we'll head back to
our project and once again let's go
ahead and you'll notice that we now have
the red or this orange button that we're
seeing this configure then we start with
our last two authentication strategies
so let's click continue so let's click
configure and you'll see you want to go
to code.google.com slash api's now from
here we can go ahead and create a
project so let's click create a project
with this large blue button and then we
can just say New York resolutions ok and
you can give this a project idea of
anything you'd like however it's
dynamically creating one so let's go
ahead and click create so now that our
projects done we can go out and select
meteor resolutions here and over in the
left hand column we want to select ap is
an auth now here we want to go ahead and
select consent screen okay so here we
can add things like our email address
Angela want to enter the product name
this will just be meteor resolutions
okay now let's go ahead and click Save
now we're going to want to go to
credentials which is just above consent
screen from here we can go ahead and
select oo auth so here we'll just click
create new client ID from the OAuth and
let's go ahead and select web
application which is already selected
for us now authorize JavaScript origins
and authorized redirect URIs we're going
to go ahead and get from that
configuration window so authorized
origins are just going to be our
localhost the port let's go ahead and
just add this and you'll notice it
automatically added this ooofff to
callbacks let's go ahead and verify that
that's what we want however we want this
authorized redirect URI to actually be
something different its underscore OAuth
forward slash Google that's what our
application is going to respond to so we
can just paste that in there and click
create new client ID now this is
creating our client ID now keep in mind
you're going to want to make sure that
this information is your information to
keep we have the secret the email
address the client ID all this stuff
here you're not going to want to share
with anybody else
however because I'm deleting this
immediately I can go ahead and show you
this process so don't try to steal this
information as I've said in the past
couple of videos it's not going to work
so client ID and client secret so we're
going to copy this entire client ID
we're going to paste it in here then
we're going to go ahead and copy this
entire client secret and we're going to
paste it into client secret now we want
the pop-up based login and let's click
save configuration we now have the blue
button like we've seen with the other
two we can click sign-in with Google and
it's going to say that mediate
resolutions like to view your email
address and your basic profile so
basically we don't have access to a ton
of stuff the user shouldn't get too
scared by this we can just click to
accept here and now it's created an
account for myself and it's logged me in
with the Google account so anytime any
of your users already have a Google
account
actually have to enter in your user
password they can just log into your
site using their Google account okay so
this was super easy and the next one's
not going to be too tough either so this
is adding a Google login into your
meteor application as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments to become
in the video or it's up at Twitter or
Facebook at level up tuts we love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
