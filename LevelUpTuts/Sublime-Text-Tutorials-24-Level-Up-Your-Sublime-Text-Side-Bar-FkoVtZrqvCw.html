of tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
solve one of my biggest pain points in
using sublime text 3 now the sidebar
well it leaves much to be desired when
you right-click on something it gives
you only a couple of options well this
package sidebar enhancements adds a
whole ton of options that you would have
wished have been in your sublime text
all along so let's get going right now
so many times if you right-click on one
of these files hoping to have more
features than rename delete file or
reveal and finder and personally
sometimes you can right click on a
folder expecting reveal and finder to be
there and it's not we just have a new
file rename new folder that sort of
thing so what's a great way that we can
fix this well sublime actually has a
really great package so if we do command
shift P to bring up our package control
ctrl shift p.m. windows we can go to
package install packet so what we want
to search for is sidebar enhancements so
sidebar enhancements is as it sounds
like just a bunch of nice little
improvements upon the functions that you
can do from the sidebar so when we now
right-click on a file you see we get a
whole bunch of more options here now
there's a lot of great ones like open in
browser so we can just simply click on
this index.html open in browser and here
it is which is you know just something
that is nice especially if you're
working on HTML files or something like
that without a server but we also just
have all sorts of other things like find
and replace find advanced copy the name
copy the path copy as text duplicate all
these things are things that I feel like
should be there but aren't unless you
have this package installed we also have
things for our project like exclude from
project and things like that and what's
really cool that I like here is that we
have this open with now open with
doesn't really sound super useful if
you're editing an HTML file but let's
say we had an image in here and we
wanted to open that image in Photoshop
make some modifications well we could
right-click on that and then select open
with and then
shus Photoshop would be an appropriate
application and allow us to edit that
directly verse from here and then we
wouldn't have to reveal and finder or
open in Photoshop and then open the file
that way so these things by no means are
groundbreaking however they are really
super handy and they allow you just some
additional functionality and if you'll
notice the directories now have open
with finder so you can now open your
directories with finder instead of
having to find a file and then find that
file and finder like I said nothing
really groundbreaking but it just fixes
some little issues here and there so
sidebar enhancements is definitely a
package I would recommend that you put
in your sublime text 3 so as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments they
become in the video are too symmetrical
or face book at level up tutorials I'd
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and I'll see you the next one
