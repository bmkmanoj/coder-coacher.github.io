up tuts and this video is just going to
pick up where the last one left off and
we're gonna continue talking about the
files that came with your Omega 4 and
this video in particular it's going to
talk on a few more files that are mostly
configuration files and things like that
so if you're not going to be doing a lot
of crazy stuff you might not need to get
into these files um and if you just want
to learn about what they do feel free to
keep watching and see what other files
have come with Omega 4 now we also have
templates and templates doesn't really
include anything right now however if
you need to override Drupal templates
they'll be going inside of this
templates folder if you were to look at
the oum example or the drush exam or the
Omega for base theme you'll see that
inside of here there's folders with
things like note or something and inside
of that are our actual template files so
what's cool about this is that you can
throw folders with template files in
here and override your templates that
way keep them nice and organized is that
they're just having a folder full of you
know template files and here we have
your theme folder which is going to
contain your theme overrides and down
here we have this actually lets grow up
so you can actually see the contents of
some of these files we have this bower
our C file and really what this is doing
is saying it's using Bower which is a
utility that basically grabs JavaScript
components from the web and pulls them
into your site it manages libraries sort
of like how ruby gems or node package
manager does and you can basically keep
a listing of all of your plugins or
libraries that you're using in a file
and you can say bower go get all of
these and it's gonna go get them and
throw them in your libraries folder and
it's gonna throw them in our libraries
folder because this is already
configured to say directory libraries
now we don't have to use bower for
anything right now and you might not
ever have to use it in this project but
it's there if you want it and it's a
nice utility to learn now we have a git
ignore file and if you're
version controlling your theme on get or
with get I should say you could use this
get ignore file that comes already in
here and it says what to ignore you know
it says to ignore the SAS cache because
yeah we don't want to have the SAS cache
and get it creates a bunch of cache
files that just stack up so of course we
don't want that now we have the J s hint
RC file which is basically a configure
file for J s hint basically J s hint has
a whole bunch of options that you can
pass to it so that it when it checks
your code it knows what your code is
like and so these are all of the options
you can go to Jay's hints website and
see exactly what all these options are
doing now we have a ruby gem set and
this is naming your gem set its omega
dot level of omega and you might be
wondering why we have ruby anything
basically to compile your SAS code using
the extensions and stuff like that the
the compilers are actually written in
ruby in little ruby applications called
ruby gems so if you don't know ruby it's
fine because we're not gonna have to
write any ruby all you have to know is
that ruby is being used to compile your
code here and you'll have to install
some things to get that working but it's
really no big deal and it's it's really
not difficult or anything so don't worry
about that for now don't worry that it
says ruby it just is now next we have
our bower.json file and now we actually
when we said in bower before we just say
what what libraries want to use and go
get them well this is exactly what that
file is doing notice how it says we want
response luck divisor html5 ship and
this matches exactly what we have in our
libraries folder so if you wanted to run
the bower command and you didn't have
these in your library file you would run
your Bower and it would drop these into
your libraries folder now we have our
config dot RB and
this is a ruby file and like I said you
won't have to edit this because this is
already configured this is basically
just telling SAS what sort of ado it's
gonna require some stuff like SAS
lobbying and it's gonna require some
stuff right it's it's no big deal and if
you don't want to have to modify this
stuff you don't have to but if you use
SAS before and you know these
configuration options this will be
really nice to get in here and maybe you
know change your SAS directory or change
the output the output style from
something other than expanded so that's
great
and our gem file this is almost the
exact same thing as bower.json but for
ruby gems so these are all of the
wonderful gems that omega4 is using and
when you run a command bundle it's going
to go and grab all of these for
rubygems.org and it's going to install
them on your system so that when you
were running your guard command it's
going to know how to compile everything
now we have a grunt file which grunt is
sort of a similar thing grunt is
basically it's a task runner for
javascript it's gonna do things like
compiling your sass and stuff like that
and it gives you the option of using a
grunt and pre-configured here within
omega4 if you would like I personally am
just using this guard command and guard
file is going to be pretty much the same
thing but for guard and you'll notice
it's triggering live reload at the end
here now we have our info file which
you've seen before and this is a
standard info file if you want to add a
region you add a region like normal we
can go over adding a region in a later
video now we have a libraries that make
file which this is a brush make file if
you run a dress make it's going to
automatically download these libraries
and it's going to throw them in your
libraries theme no so it says
alternatively you can use Bower so when
we said you know bower does this this is
gonna do the same thing what's really
nice about Omega is they give you
different options if you're familiar
with Bower you can use Bower
if you want to used rush make
go ahead use dress mink and you can add
libraries to this file and in perhaps
create your own sub theme of Omega that
when you've run your your make command
it's going to go and get these libraries
that you use for your particular sub
theme it's really powerful now of course
we just have our logo we have a package
dot JSON file which is a grunt
configuration file that's basically just
be it's just going to say what would
grunt plugins you need and stuff like
that so we don't really need to worry
too much about this if you're not using
grunt you especially don't need to worry
about that and we have my template dot
PHP which if you're familiar with Drupal
theming template that PHP should be
normal basically it overrides pre
process as well as process and alters
hooks for the level of Omega T so if
you're doing some hook functions in here
or whatever pretty much the standard
stuff you would do in template dot PHP
maybe you need to override something
before the page is processed now we also
have a theme settings dot PHP and this
allows you to hook into the theme
settings so it allows you to modify the
omega base theme so basically it says
you should look at the extensions
concept in the omega base theme and
that's actually a great idea for most of
this is if you're confused about
something look at the omega base name
and see what's going on there or even
looking home and see what they're doing
and it might make sense of sort of how
things are normally so it's really great
it allows you to modify Omega as a theme
and basically Omega gives you a lot of
options and it's extremely powerful so
this is the files that you get with
Omega that's it so that's it and if
you're confused about what any of these
files are doing after this explanation
don't worry because we're going to be
using all of these files in various
videos and you're going to be you know
totally comfortable getting in here
building your theme by the time we're
done with this course so as always this
is Scott with level up Hut's if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment of the baby or hit us up at
Twitter level up tuts let us know what
you're thinking we love to hear from you
