up tutorials and in this video I'll be
showing you four great techniques for
reducing the image size on your website
now reducing the image size is super
important because the smaller your
images are the less time they take to
load therefore the faster your site
loads and therefore the less people run
away from your slow site so let's check
it out right now so as we continue along
in this series there may be a lot of
these techniques you've heard of and
maybe there's some that you haven't
heard of so if you have already heard
this and you know exactly what you're
doing
feel free to skip the video or stick
around for any sort of extra information
you might want to learn but we're
essentially going to go through a whole
bunch of different techniques you can do
to optimize different performance areas
of your website now and the main thing
is is that every website is really
different so it's going to be hard to
recommend a universal technique for
every website but we're gonna be
stressing more of the overall big
picture techniques here and the first
one of these techniques is reducing
image size now as you may or may not
know images are a large part of your
website in terms of file size and that
file size all of those files have to get
downloaded so the slower the internet
connection the slower those downloads
are going to be now images aren't as big
of a deal now as they were before
because back in the day used to have an
image for every single button or things
like that because you couldn't do some
of the stuff with CSS however it's still
very important to optimize your images
so the first suggestion I would have
would be to use sort of image
optimization process now if you don't
have a build process like you're not
using gulp or grunt you can always use
this free option image optim now this
application is pretty cool if you have
your website and let's say you have a
folder full of images like I do here on
my desktop you can essentially just drag
your entire folder in here and it's
gonna go through and it's gonna remove
all the extraneous data from these
images now image Optima is really super
fast as you just saw it just flew
through this
and as you can see it actually gave me a
savings of around you know around 12%
overall but I get like 13 17 and if you
wanted to run all of these through once
again you could certainly do that and it
may find some additional savings it
doesn't look like it did that for me
though so now you can see in a couple of
seconds we just shaved off some
kilobytes of these images and while it
may not seem like much in this regard to
every little bit counts and this step is
just really too easy to ignore now you
might be wondering well I don't want to
download an application and drag my
images into it that's fine I mean this
is really easy but you can always build
in a process into your build process
using something like gulp - image min
you can add different image minifiers
you can see compressing JPEGs
compressing pings compressing SVG's and
this is just gonna remove all the data
that's not going to affect the way it
looks so keep in mind these compressions
they're not compressing the file
visually you're not going to notice it's
going to remove things like metadata
that you really just don't need and
don't even want on your images that are
being loaded online so something like
gulp image mint and throwing this into
your build process if you're using gulp
is really quick and easy you can do it
once forget about it you can do it once
and then reuse it on every single
project you ever use be either way
compressing your images in this way is a
really really nice thing to do now
what's another way that we can actually
make our images more performant well
it's become less of a thing now that you
could use icon fonts and things like
that but CSS sprites are still relevant
despite not being as important as before
now you can use a tool like this sprite
gen tools like this that allow you to
add images to this canvas you can see
they all exist here the ones that are in
here and basically it's stitching them
together in one large image and then
this technique you'd be selecting your
image you can see in this sprite
generator it gives you the actual
position coordinates so then you would
be defining your images in your CSS
using a background image so you would
set the dimensions
correctly you would set the background
image to be that of this sprite
containing all of these images and then
you would use the background position to
only show the correct image so CSS
sprites is a topic you can find written
about a ton online it's a technique
that's been used for a very long time
they're sets like this there's like
sprite cow which are nice that allow you
to upload your sprite and get that CSS
data so you just don't have to deal with
finding out the perfect coordinates for
your background position but nonetheless
CSS sprites are certainly a technique
that can take six small images take it
into one image that's a little bit
larger but only is required to download
once instead of six separate times okay
so now it's one other main thing that
you can do to reduce the image size and
image load on your website
well other than just using less images
you can use things like an icon font
instead of it using image icons so there
are tons of icon fonts the most popular
seems to be font awesome
now font awesome has a ton of icons and
although the icon font does take a bit
to download if you're using a lot of
icons right having an icon font like
this is going to be more performative
than loading this many images however if
you're only using a couple of icons this
whole pack might not be worth it that
doesn't mean icon phones aren't useful
you can actually use a service like ICO
moon to build your own icon font package
now you can do it from all sorts of
other icon fonts but what this does is
essentially allows you to build an icon
font yourself that only includes the
exact icons you need this makes it so
you don't need to download the entire
collection of the font and the font size
is reduced dramatic now the last
technique I'm going to show you to
reduce your image file size is to use
something like picture fill now a
picture fill is a responsive image
polyfill for the picture srcset sizes
and more it basically allows you to
define several diff
print images for different widths so
it's essentially break points for your
images and because of that you can then
only serve the correct size image let's
say you have a large image and you want
that image to be large on your desktop
but you also want that image to show up
on mobile correctly you can actually
make a copy resize or even have your
server make a copy and resize this image
and then load up an entirely different
image based on the browser width this is
a way if your users are browsing on
their mobile phones they're not gonna
have to download that giant desktop
image but they can still get the correct
image so using something like picture
fill is a great way to reduce the size
for those users on mobile cool so I hope
these four techniques are reducing your
image size and your image load on your
website become very helpful and just
become regular parts of your development
workflow I would love to show each of
these techniques and all sorts of
different platforms but unfortunately
there's just really too many different
ones to cover so it's up to you to seek
out options for whatever platform you're
using Drupal or WordPress or angular or
media or any sort of system even if it's
just plain HTML that you're using all of
these things are going to help so as
always this is Scott with LevelUp
tutorials if have any questions or
comments overcoming the video hit me up
at Twitter or Facebook a level up
tutorials I'd love to hear from you
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
