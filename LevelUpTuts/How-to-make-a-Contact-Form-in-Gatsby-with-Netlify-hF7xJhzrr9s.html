set up really really quickly if you want
to go ahead and grab or check out the
code you can grab it directly from the
level up Tut's github it's under it
gatsby site i'll have this link in the
description so you can see it is a
Gatsby starter I have this thing pushed
up to net laughs I I'm not going to go
over the process of this this is covered
in the pro Gatsby series that's covered
in the level of tutorials Pro Gatsby
series so if you want to learn more
about hosting on nella Phi or Gatsby in
general check out that level up
tutorials comm forward slash door and
either purchase the pro gets B series or
subscribe to become a pro and you can
learn all about this Gatsby stuff what
we're gonna be doing in this video in
particular is building a contact form
into your static website which is
something that's a huge of pain most of
the time however we're going to be using
a net liffe is built in forms function
which is currently in beta to set up
form handling now because nullifies form
handling is in beta this might be
subject to change I don't know so if
this is all of the sudden not working
for you then maybe that's something to
look into maybe this has changed or let
me know in the comments however right
now this would be a great way to get
form handling on a Gatsby site which
again is something that nobody really
loves to be honest so to get started
here I'm just gonna fire up this site
inside of my text editor I'm using vs
code the theme is level up so we have
our pages components all the sort of
stuff and we have our index page here
which you've seen as just a really
standard HTML page let me actually make
sure I'm running gets be developed we
can have a local version of this up as
well it gets be developed and make sure
we have this up and running so it's not
just our net liffe ID version that we
have okay
set back to firefox here and check this
out we have our local version of this
site up and running what we're gonna be
doing to do here is set up a very very
basic form as in a very most basic
contact form and this form is going to
look really just well in this example
it's going to be very bare-bones now I'm
going to use Emmet here to get some auto
come
leading some in essay form and inside of
my form I'm going to say we have an
input and maybe we'll just have one
input for now and then a button as well
okay let me have this like this now our
button can just be send okay so this is
a very very very basic form now form
action we're going to go ahead and
delete this form action and we're going
to change this to be form method which
is going to be equal to post okay and
we're going to need to add a whole bunch
of more properties to this form here or
at least the form tag itself to get this
working so that net lafay is aware that
this thing exists so what we want to go
ahead and do is add a name to this and
this will be contact okay and let me
actually put these on their own line so
you can see these properties a little
bit better than if we were to do this in
a big line so we have a name we have a
method now we're going to need a data
attribute which is data net laughs I
know data net laughs i is going to be
equal to true okay and your autocomplete
ER may change that to just be data Anila
phi and then we're also going to need a
data net with I - honeypot is equal to
bot - field okay now the next thing
we're gonna want to do is on our input
to give this a name and this name is
just simply going to be well name okay
placeholder will be place holder will be
equal to your name and using a
placeholder as like a Nate labels job
this isn't a great practice here
typically when a label that says your
name and a placeholder that's like a
fake name or something like that but
that's not really important to figuring
out how this works so right now this
should be a okay so let's go ahead and
save this and head to our gatsby site if
we head back to firefox you should see
we have a very basic your name and we
can type in my name just click send here
and have it not do a whole lot
let's go ahead and push this up to
github and see what happens with our
nullify I'm just going to do it get ad
commit it's farm and it we should see
this go up to github and then in turn we
should see our nullify sites start to
get a new version you can see it's
already building and hopefully this
builds quickly I'm just going to fast
forward until then okay so now at this
point looks like we've deployed this is
going to be really interesting because
nullify is already going to be aware
that your form exists if we head to
forms you can see we should have an
active form now you might be wondering
how the heck did that active form get
here and it's simply by using the data
net lafay is equal to true as well as
the data nullify honeypot okay if you
have both these things your form should
show up here now at this point we can
select this contact form and you can see
there's no submissions now in addition
if we were to submit this form it
wouldn't even necessarily know what to
do just yet let's actually head to our
Gatsby nullify site this is the live
site not the local site and I'm gonna
just enter my name okay click send here
you can see it's actually taking us to
this nice little thank-you screen which
is actually kind of nice that it does
that for you
you could actually have your own
stateful form and handle this sort of
submission I'll have to do that in
another video I just want to get a very
basic contact form going here and you
see I head back to my site and let's
head back here and let's give this page
refresh you can now see that we have a
new submission now we could download all
of our submissions we could select this
one you can see that the value is simply
just the name and well the name comes
from the name field and here's the value
and when it was received now in a
standard contact form you're gonna want
this thing to send you an email though
right I mean like isn't that the point
of a contact form you're not gonna want
to come into a nullify dashboard check
your submissions all the time and not to
say maybe that you wouldn't want to do
that but you wouldn't want to do that
for maybe a professional site or
something like that so let's go ahead
and talk about how we can handle
thing if I head back to the forms page
overall and we're gonna select
notifications from forum handling this
is going to take us to the notifications
forum in our settings and we can add a
notification now this is really super
super cool because the contact form are
the forms inside of nullify they don't
just have to send you an email they
could post to a slack channel they could
hit a web hook maybe this email is
coming in to another system that you
have and it's getting saved and stored
somewhere maybe it's hitting a web hook
that does something really interesting
right it gives you a ton of different
potential different interesting usages
of these forms the most basic would be
just simply an email notification with
that message so I'm going to select the
email notification I'm gonna select the
new form submission and the email to
notify is just going to be will have
this be Scott at level up tuts and we're
gonna select the contact form
specifically or you could have all of
your forms in the entire app if you have
multiple forms from here we can click
Save now anytime that any one submits
the contact form I'm going to get an
email let's go ahead and submit this one
more time and say my name is Scott I'm
gonna head back to my site and I'm going
to fire up my email now as you can see
here I've received an email from nella
Phi and it has the actual web address of
the site up top here and it simply has
the contents of the contact form so my
name is Scott here okay let's go ahead
and add a couple more form fields and
get this thing finished out here so we
can actually have a really nice contact
form you've seen how easy this is so far
we just have a basic form a send button
and it handles pretty much everything
for you I'm gonna go ahead and have a
new field here which is just going to be
input and this is going to be email and
it's going to just be will this actually
use a valid placeholder this time and
name at name comm and the type is going
to be of email okay
we're using some html5 input attributes
here and lastly we could do a text area
as well let's go ahead and get that
going you just have a text area
Hey and the name will just be message
Kevin and it doesn't need an ID I'm not
even gonna give any rows or columns so
just leave it like this let itself close
here and let's head back to our site
let's look at our okay this is an ugly
ugly looking forum here obviously you're
going to want to style this that's not
what matters right now we're just
worrying about the functionality
obviously I expect you to be able to
style your own forms so let's go ahead
and now push this live to our site and
see this contact form fully created in
action again you're gonna have the code
for this available at the level of Tut's
github it's in the comments now you can
just copy and paste and modify this as
you need let me go ahead and push this
to github okay it looks like everything
has been published let's head to our
site let's give this a refresh to see
this ugly form let's add our name and
it's got at level up Tut's come and say
hey Scott what's what's up okay
let's click send we get our nice little
thank you now there's going to be an
issue with this if i refresh my
submissions is that well we're getting
the name but we're not getting the other
fields now if you were seeing all of
your fields come in then that means that
this little bug has been fixed but right
now there is a little bug where if you
have added fields after creating a new
form then the net Liffe I service will
sort of be like oh there's there's no
new fields now I know they're actively
working on this so this is very well may
be fixed by the time you're watching
this that's why I wanted to just have
you go ahead and do it now if you are
seeing this issue like I'm seeing right
here where we have our contact form like
this and it's not submitting all of our
fields the solution and workaround right
now is to just add a new name for our
contact form which is right now contact
and we can have a be contact - form now
obviously this isn't super ideal but
again they are working on it and it
could very well be fixed by the time
you're watching this video so if you're
running into this issue just change the
name we can just read deploy this and
I'll show you in a second that it's
working typically anyways you you don't
really change your forms that much you
set them
when you're ready to go but obviously
the fact that there's a fixin for this
means that this shouldn't really even be
an issue for much longer here but so
let's go ahead and just wait while this
pushes up here I'm gonna head it back to
the dashboard here and check out the
build status let's go ahead and resubmit
our form actually gets give this page of
refresh first now let's go ahead and
resubmit this form here let's click
Submit let's say thank you let's head
back to our nullify here and this time
I'm just going to hit to the forms tab
you're gonna see we have our new contact
form here again like I said this is just
a workaround so you shouldn't always
need to change your name here if you're
changing your fields but you can see
that we have our new form and just like
this it is going to have all of the
information from the message the email
and all that good stuff and of course if
we wanted to have this send us an email
we would want to come in here and say
let's add a notification email
notification the new form submission
we're going to want to email Scott at or
whatever email and we're going to have
it be attached to the contact form
either way you can see how incredibly
easy this stuff is the most important
thing that we need to have here is that
on our form we have data in lfie quills
true data in LF I honey pot bot field
okay other than that it needs to just
act like a normal form now this is in
Gatsby okay this is a static site if
your site is a non statically built
react site this method will not work so
this is specifically for statically
built sites like Gatsby
okay or standard HTML this would work on
a normal HTML page okay so thank you so
much for watching this is how you can
get a contact form up and running in
Gatsby with natla Phi and we even go
over some may be the issues that you
might have with the system it is in beta
so it is actively in development and
again if you want to learn Gatsby
completely head to level up tutorials
comm forward slash store you can check
out Pro Gatsby which is a new Pro Series
which is a 25 videos teaching you all
about Gatsby hosting it show you how to
get up and running with hosting on
nutloaf I I create our contact form in
this video so thank you so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
