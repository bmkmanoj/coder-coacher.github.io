tutorials and today i'm going to give
you a small update about what's been
going on in the world of level up
tutorials since i last gave an update in
april so the good news is i have
completed my move across the country on
now stationed in denver colorado and i
have my office almost set up the way i
like it it's just coming together here
so you'll see things change a little bit
throughout the introductions of the
videos here but that means i'm going to
start to be able to record tutorials
this week so a whole bunch of new
tutorials are coming this week and this
month and now you might even see the
largest amount of new tutorials coming
in a single month but we'll have to see
on that depending on how much time I'm
able to free up here also in really
exciting news I'm developing a new level
of tutorials website which you can
possibly see on these screens behind me
as you can see i'm developing the site
using this new device lab that i built
which shows me every single device size
I could even want to know the best thing
about this device lab this even rotates
to show you the portrait and landscape
so that I can see them all in one quick
glance now it's using software called
ghost lab to auto refresh so when I make
a change on this site itself you're
going to see that auto refresh across
every single one of these devices in
fact i'll be doing a quick tutorial on
ghost lab in this month because as a
software that I've really grown to love
and I use it pretty much all the time
now and a quick word about the new level
of huts website is you can actually see
it at level up that video and i'll put a
link in the description of this video so
you can check it out but a word of
warning the design the implementation
all of that stuff is still very
preliminary so if you're clicking around
things are going to be broken all over
the place things are not going to look
or feel right but just to let you know
i'm doing sort of a life beta where i'm
continually updating the site and
pushing new updates all the time so you
should see this evolved over time until
it's eventually a full working a much
much better version of the current level
of tutorial site so check that out i'll
put a link in the description of this
video now third i want to talk about the
upcoming tutorial series that you'll see
this month
now I'm going to continue producing our
angular series until we get into some
intermediate / advanced stuff in
addition to that I'm going to continue
the exploring sketch package of series
or realign some of my favorite sketch at
packages and I'm going to be starting an
intermediate meteor series where we go
for various meteor packages that you
probably be using in most of your
projects whether that's like things like
routing or performance hex collection
helpers all sorts of cool stuff that
you're going to find yourself wanting to
use in most of your meteor project now
there will probably be Drupal in the
gent oh those sort of videos along the
way too so don't worry about that I
still have the plans for an updated
drupal theming series I'm just trying to
find the time to get that done right now
so keep on a lookout for all that and if
you're interested in supporting level up
tutorials and you need hosting you can
send it for bluehost for I think like
395 a month I'll put a link in the
description as well so if you need
hosting you can sign up using our
referral link and then that helps
support level up tutorials keeping these
videos free for everybody and gives you
some good cheap shared hosting in the
process if you don't need hosting you
can always donate on the donation page
of our website or sign up for a level of
pro account where you can get access to
downloadable videos for 899 a month and
that just helps support us keep going
with these free videos for everybody so
I'm really excited for july we're gonna
have a great month here so keep watching
for new videos the first batch of which
is going to be out this week so thanks
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
