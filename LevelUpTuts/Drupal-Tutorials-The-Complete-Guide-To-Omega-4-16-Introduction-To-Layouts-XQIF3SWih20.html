of Tut's and today we're gonna be
talking about layouts with an Omega 4
and we're going to be doing a few videos
on layouts and this first one what we're
really going to do is just create a
layout and we're gonna create this
layout and then once we have that we're
gonna take it and do some more advanced
stuff with it we're gonna show you how
you can bundle your styles together with
the layout itself we're gonna show you
how you can contextually change the
layouts and stuff like that so you can
use more than one layout based on the
path or maybe content type or something
so we're gonna do a lot on layout and
this is just the first video so and in
this video I guess I kind of want to
explain what layouts are and then we're
gonna get creating one so layouts are
really exactly like sort of what it
sounds like right when we turned on this
enable layouts extension before it let
us choose one of these layouts that
exists in the I think two of them are in
home or maybe they're an Omega but
they're in the base themes and they come
in there and basically if you want to be
using any of these layouts you can just
use them right in fact the things that
are included in this layout are a TPL
file which includes the PHP that shows
what regions are going to show up and
then an info file which is going to show
exactly what needs to get loaded what
regions need to get loaded that type of
thing and then there's also the CSS
component so bundled with each of these
layouts is the grid CSS that it needs to
assign of these different areas to their
spot on the grid so in this first video
we're going to create a layout and the
layout is simply going to be the layout
that we're working with already on the
site however we're going to be doing it
as a layout and let's go to find content
on test page one here we have this this
page right but it's not using any layout
what it's actually using if we go to the
code here it's using if you well we
don't have anything in our templates
using his the page TPL template from the
omega base theme and in addition to that
it's just using the dot info file from
your base theme as well as to what
regions it's going to be loading so if
we come here you can see that it's
telling it to love these style sheets
here's our theme here's what regions and
if you want different layouts to have
different regions available maybe
there's a region that only shows up on
the home page so why should you have it
in your TBL file well you shouldn't
and you don't have to now with these
layout options so so these are the items
here right and what we need to do first
to create layouts is to create a folder
for layouts so now I should actually
mention that this is my first tutorial
since I've upgraded my desktop it's my
hackintosh high upgrade led to Mavericks
so if anything inexplicably goes wrong I
know what to blame so I'm sort of
keeping my fingers crossed here that
nothing's going to freak out on me
because sometimes upgrading these
systems can be a little difficult but so
far so good
okay so we want to create a layout in
our theme we just need to create a
folder called layouts and let's click
new folder and let's name this layouts
ok now inside of here you're then going
to create another folder in this folder
is the folder of the layout name itself
so we want this to be a interior page
right so we could call this interior or
you could describe it more about what
the layout actually is so like single
sidebar or something like that so
actually let's since this is going to be
site-specific we can just click this and
let's give it a new file I'm sorry not a
new file we want to give this a new
folder and and we'll just call this
sidebar nothing too complex here and
sidebar is going to be the name
of our layout so now that we have this
we can click new file and like I said
before we need a couple of files the
first one that's most important well I
guess they're all most important but
this is going to be our Inc file and
this is basically going to be telling
the theme what regions to use and
basically some information about this
layout itself so we're gonna say side
bar dot layout Inc okay so we have this
file here and inside of it we need to
give it a name so it's name is equal to
sidebar okay it's we got to give it a
description mmm a single sidebar
interior page okay and now we want to
give it we can actually give it a
preview JPEG right if you've checked out
the current layout you'll see that they
have these little images now there's
nothing really to create these images
you have to create yourself I you just
and I'm not doing anything with it
because it's too much of a hassle but if
you were going to be let's say
distributing this layout or something or
reusing it then you might want to create
some sort of a logo I've actually been
considering creating a whole set of
layouts myself that I could have
available for people to just download
and run their projects I don't know when
I don't have the time to do that but
I've been considering it and thinking
about a lot now we need to tell it what
the template name is and this is going
to be the name of the file that the
template is we just say template equals
sidebar - layout like that nice and easy
cool and the next we need is our regions
and since there's nothing really crazy
on this side we don't have any new
regions or anything like that we can
come to our info file right down here
and let's grab all of these regions so
I'm just gonna copy these and I'm gonna
throw them right into our ink file like
that and you could have a comment here
that lets people know that these are
regions if you'd like you do that by
doing a look at
semicolon okay so we would also be
defining style sheets here for loading
style sheets in with this particular
layout but for this example we're gonna
keep it nice and easy and we're just
gonna get a layout working okay so we
have the sidebar layout and now we need
the actual PHP template so let's create
a new file again and we're gonna save
this one as exactly what we said we were
in the ink file so we could say sidebar
- layout that TPL dot PHP and if you're
familiar with Drupal of TPL files or
anything like that it should be super
familiar to you just sort of that naming
convention and what these files are like
let me grab something here so I'm trying
to do this in full-screen so what you
can do is you can actually go into the
Omega I'm throwing this in here you can
go into the Omega base theme the one
that you've downloaded into your site
and if you go into templates and then
it's under shoot I think it's an error
system okay yeah we have page TPL dot
PHP you can go ahead and copy this whole
photo now we don't need this entire file
but let's just copy this and we can
throw this into our sidebar layout to
that TPL dot PHP and I'm gonna go ahead
and get rid of all of these comments at
the beginning because we don't really
need them not for this we can just get
rid of that like that here we go
cool and so now we have a TPL file for
our layout notice how we have div with
the class of page here we have our
header and these are all the regions
that we said we're going to be in it
because these are just the default
regions now what's really cool about
this is this site just has a single
sidebar we don't need two sidebar first
in sidebar second so let's go ahead and
modify this theme right so what we can
simply do is delete
this entire line of PHP that's print
that's rendering the second sidebar
there we go it's gone and now in our ink
file we can also say second sidebar is
not using this theme at all so that's
gone there and now we don't have to
worry about the second sidebar getting
in the way or anything like that it's
not going to try to render it and we
just have the stuff that we're using so
this is a TPL file and this is our
layout these are really all you need
right you could if you had your image
here that you got for your preview you
would also throw it into this layouts
folder laid it out sidebar you are your
little preview image there but we don't
have anything so so let's get enable
let's go to our admin section of our
site and we're gonna clear the cache you
should install admin menu I can't
function without it let's clear the
cache or I could have gone to drush but
I didn't have terminal open right now
and we can refresh our appearance page
and what we see here is a new layout
sidebar a single sidebar interior page
and you'll notice there's no image next
to it because we didn't have one now all
we have to do is enable layouts
extension click sidebar and let's save
this and our pages I don't know it's
asking me for content ok our pages are
now going to be using this sidebar
template if we refresh we notice nothing
has changed right because we're using
the same CSS we defined our let's see we
defined our actual grid stuff out here
where we said that sidebar first was
going to have a span of this and that's
still true in this layout it's because
we're only using one layout right now if
we were to do this a different way which
is probably the better way what you
would do is actually define CSS within
the layout itself you'd put all of your
layout specific CSS in there that way
the grid stuff is not going to get
confused with other layouts since we
only have one layout at this point it
doesn't really matter we have one layout
we
have to worry about it but to prove to
you that this layout is in fact working
let's come to our sublime text so I
don't know which direction it is there
we go and let's come to our TPL file and
at the very top of it I'm gonna put in
just a big test
just for fun here we refresh and there
test is way up here top top left but
it's there
so Drupal is now using this page
template to actually generate the page
because we've told it to through this
layout you've officially built your
first layout it's nothing spectacular
in fact it hardly does anything more
than what we were doing before other
than just using its own TPL file but it
exists it's a layout we've selected it
and it's working so in the next video
we're gonna do something a little bit
more complex we're gonna start taking
your CSS and bundling it into the layout
itself so it's always this Scott with
love love Tut's if you have any
questions or comments please leave a
comment the video or hit us up at
Twitter LevelUp Ted's Facebook whatever
we'd love to hear from you thanks for
watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
