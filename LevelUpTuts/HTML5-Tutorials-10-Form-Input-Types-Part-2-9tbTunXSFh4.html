up huts and today we're going to be
talking about a few more input types and
these input types are the same as the
last they're just really helpful they
had all sorts of different options when
you're trying to have a forum it's not
just the standard texted field or text
area so let's get started and this is
going to be a new type of list so we're
going to the values can be for this type
of list it can be all sorts of things so
we're just going to use a type of let's
see input and for the type we're just
gonna leave the type as text however he
can give it a list and we're gonna say
list is equal to and we're gonna have an
ID so this will be let's just have this
be input list just so we can have this
easy to be remembered however of course
in your form you probably want to do it
a little bit something where it has to
do with your form itself and that's
great so here we have an input type
that's just looking for a list of input
list so now we had to create this list
and we can do that with data list and
inside of data list we can add an ID and
this ID will be equal to input list
great and now we're just gonna have a
options similarly are like you would for
a select list so we're gonna have an
option value and it's just going to be
that one and let's see it's label is
also going to be Val one like this and
I'm just going to copy this line here
and repeat it a couple times just so we
have some options in our list value 283
just to keep these a little bit
different okay
now let's save this let's come back to
our site refresh we see just a normal
text area but when we type in V it has
these options for us and I mean if we
type in anything else it's not going to
however its pre-selected with this
option list and now if I click value 1
or value to whatever it shows up now
keep in mind you can use this with other
types of input types so this is great
this is the input type with a list and
now let's try an input type of email so
you can see we're just stacking up these
input types there's a lot and it's
really great my favorite things about
HTML 5 is all of the variety here for
your forms so let's do input type of
email this time
now let's refresh so although it looks
just like a normal text area this input
type is actually going to be
automatically validated upon form
submission and it's gonna be looking for
an email itself and in what's great
about this also is that smart phones but
their keyboards that pop I'm gonna
recognize this as being an email field
and phones like the iPhone or Android
are going to add things like the @
symbol or dot-com to the keyboard
because that makes it easier to fill out
when you're filling out the form so this
is a great thing to do for your users
just as a usability issue so similarly
we can also have one that's for a URL
and it's nearly the same thing so we're
gonna have input type URL so this and
like the email one looks just like a
normal text area but on on smart phones
it's going to have the dot-com so it's
also automatically validated when a form
submitted to to make sure that this is
in fact a URL that way you don't have to
do it with JavaScript or regex that sort
of thing so we have another one and it's
going to be an input type of tell and
tell is for telephone numbers so you
might not notice a difference and there
in fact isn't really any support at this
moment for a telephone but it exists and
in the future it's probably going to do
things like have the phone you know
keyboards show the correct thing or
proper validation that sort of thing so
keep in mind all this stuff's a little
fresh so things like this you know might
not have support at the moment but when
you're watching this video it might
already be
supported so we have one more input type
I'm going to go over today and it's
gonna be the search so input type search
I'll save this and let's refresh so this
one you'll notice is also a text area
these ones have been considerably boring
compared to the last video however this
does let your browser know that this
input is a search box it's great to let
the browser know what is what like this
is a search box there's a telephone any
sort of thing like that so we may see
you know different things and different
browser support coming up for these and
in fact once these are a little bit more
well supported maybe a year from now or
whenever I might have to make an update
to this video just to show some of these
cool new features great so these are the
form types that we're going to be going
over in the next video I'm gonna talking
about some new attributes for form
elements for input and that's gonna be
really cool so there's some some fancy
stuff going on so as always this is
Scott with LevelUp Tut's if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video or hit us up at Twitter I
level up Tut's let us know what you're
thinking we always love to hear from you
thanks again for watching all right what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
