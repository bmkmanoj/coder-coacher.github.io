tutorials and today we're going to be
installing meteor and getting a new
project initialized and we're going to
show you how easy all of that is so
let's get started right now so to get
started we want to have two windows open
we have meteor comm open and we have no
js' org open because meteor is running
on node you're going to have to have
node installed now to do that we just
want to go to node.js org and you can
click this install button and that's
going to download and bring up your
platform's installer because I already
have no js' installed I'm going to omit
that part however it's as simple as just
following the instructions in the
Installer clicking next and installing
so one do you have node installed you
can head on over to meteor comm and
what's great about meteor here is the
very largest button on the home page is
install meteor you can see at the time
of recording this video the latest
version is 1.0 0.3 0.1 so that's a J
give this some context in case things
have changed however now that it's at
version 1
I know meteor is growing but I can't
imagine that this video become
invalidating too quickly so let's go
ahead and click install and what you'll
get is that to install the latest
version of meteor using OSX or Linux all
you have to do is use this curl command
so I'm actually going to copy this like
so and I'm going to head on over to my I
term now from your terminal you can just
really paste this command here and hit
enter so as you can see here it's
installing meteor and because I already
had meteor installed to just let me know
that it's removing the previous one
however if you didn't it would not give
you this line right here
it looks like we have meteor totally
installed so it says to get started fast
what you can do is create a meteor
create and then give your app some cool
name and then change directories into
your app and then
meteor so what meteor does is it
basically combines a lot of the
technologies that you use and it takes
care of it all so we don't have to worry
about setting up a database and starting
it we don't have to worry about writing
a server or anything like that and we
don't have to worry about a build
process because it's all encapsulated
within this meteor with this meteor
command here okay and using meteor with
Windows it says they're working on an
official Windows installation and
they're going to be notified soon
however they give you some options on a
way to be able to use and try meteor on
Windows you can use something like
nitrous IO or you can use vagrant to
spin up Linux for a virtual machine and
use it that way so unfortunately it
doesn't look like a Windows meteor
version exists right now however I would
highly recommend checking out vagrant in
fact I'll probably end up doing a video
on how to get going on Windows using
something like vagrant to get going with
meteor so if that's something you want
to see please let me know in the
comments and I will definitely do that
towards the beginning of this series so
that you can follow along okay let's
head back to our IT room here so now I'm
going to change directory into where I
keep my sites so this can be anywhere on
your computer I like to use it in a
folder named sites in my user directory
and inside of there I just have a level
up tutorials folder now I want my app to
be named resolutions so I'm going to
type in this meteor Craig command and
what it's going to do is it's actually
going to create the folder and the
project within the folder so let's say a
meteor and then create now from here we
can just simply type the name of our
application I want it to be named
resolution so we can say resolutions and
hit enter now it's going to run this
quick command that's created our project
let's change directory by typing in CD
resolutions and hit enter now if I hit
LS you can see the files in here our
resolution CSS
resolutions HTML and resolution CAS
there's also a dot meteor folder which
we'll see once we add our project to our
text editor so let's go ahead and type
the word meteor as you can see it's
starting all of the stuff it's building
our application it's starting MongoDB
which is our database and it started our
application so you can now visit it by
visiting localhost colon
3000 so as you can see on localhost
colon 3000 we're greeted with this
welcome to meteor page which has this
click Me button that counts how many
times you click the button so let's
click click click click click
cool so every single time I'm clicking
this it's telling me how many times it's
been clicked cool so we now have our
first meteor project started we haven't
created and we're ready to get started
exploring what comes into meteor so in
the next video
we're going to show you all of the files
that are created with this meteor HTML
the meteor is the meteor dot CSS and
where we go to edit what and how things
work within meteor so check it out the
series is going to be a lot of fun by
the time you're done you're going to be
creating an app that's both persistent
on saving to a database and things like
that but it's also going to be live in
real time and it's just going to be a
really exciting experience so as always
this is Calvin level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment this video or hit us up at
Twitter or Facebook at level up to torus
we'd love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
