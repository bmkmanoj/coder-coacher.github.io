of tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be showing you how you can use the
controller as syntax defined in your
state provider in your route so that way
we don't actually have to have that
wrapping div we threw on there last time
to simply have the ng controller we can
actually define the controller and
controller as within the routing itself
so let's get started on that right now
so in the last video we put our new
templates into some additional files
here and have you noticed one of the
things was kind of clunky we had to
throw this wrapper around here that
essentially said ng controller
I mean we didn't necessarily have to
have this bit of HTML here so how can we
go about getting rid of this HTML well
you can actually define your controller
and your controller as within UI router
now what we could do here is we can come
to our directory j/s now on the state
provider here where we have our URL we
have our template URL well we can add a
comma to this object and add another
property which is controller now you can
add your controller simply as the
controller's name here or we can add
using the controller as syntax like we
did here so we can actually say
directory controller as dira list so
let's go ahead and just let's get rid of
this whole div even so we don't have to
worry about it any more being here and
in our directory jeaious we can say
directory controller as der lists so now
it's going to know on this route this is
the controller that we're using and
we're going to be using it as der lists
so now we should be able to head to our
app and we should be able to see
everything working as expected just the
way it was working before however in our
HTML we're never actually saying what
the controller is so this is a sort of a
new step and something that we haven't
done since we started learning angular
where we've always been defining the
controller in the HTML template itself
we're not defining the controller in the
state provider here cool so what's
something else that we can do
to actually make this a little bit
better here we can start putting our
files into some folders now it's a good
idea to arrange your project in a way
that makes sense to you however a way
that is used commonly throughout the
angular community is to sort of put your
features in their own folder so now what
we can do here is I can make a new
folder and this can just be maybe static
pages because maybe this is going to be
our home page in the about page so we
could contain any of our static page
content in here so we could just say
static we could throw in the home and we
could throw in the about page now even
though the home page doesn't necessarily
have a totally static content on it
right now I guess the idea would be that
a home page would have static content
now what we can do in this is in the
template URL we can just simply change
this to static /home like so we can come
in here and do the same thing with the
about HTML now you'll notice everything
should be working just as we had before
so we now have thrown some of these
additional templates into another folder
so getting them out of the way and we
are now having our controller as syntax
directly in the state provider so that's
really great in the next video we're
going to show you how you can work with
layouts in this type of routing scenario
so we can reuse templates and layouts
and do nesting and stuff like that that
we can build some sort of a partial and
navigation system like you might be used
to in other systems so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments leave a
come in the video we're how to set that
Twitter or Facebook and level up
tutorials we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
