up Hudson I'm going to continue the box
model tutorials here with CSS margins
and so you already saw a little bit of a
margin in the last lesson when we
inspected the body it had an 8 pixel
margin on it by default in fact let's go
back here and let's highlight over the
body and I'll click on it and as you can
see the browser default has an 8 pixel
margin that's why we have the space
right here first off let's see what
happens when we remove this a pixel
margin so to do that I'm going to go to
sublime text and I'm going to come up to
the body and I'm going to say margin and
then 0 and what this is going to do is
it's going to set every single side of
margin the top the left right the bottom
it's all going to be 0 and say this will
go back to our chrome refresh and you'll
notice that it goes to the whole edge of
the screen in fact if we were to set
this width for the the wrapper back to
100%
which it originally was refresh it it's
going to go edge to edge but you'll
notice there's this little bit here this
is actually the margin for the header
and we'll get into why that happens a
little bit later but just so you know
you can check this out here and this is
all pushed down because this has a
margin of it's at point 6 7 m/s through
the browser okay and if you want this to
actually get pushed down we're going to
be doing that with padding and I'll show
that in a couple tutorials after we do
border but just so you know this
distance right here is not margin on the
body
it's margin on the h1 which is pushing
the div down itself and so this div
doesn't have any margin itself either
but let's say we want to give this div a
margin and just like width we can do
this in pixels or percent so I'm going
to go down here to wrapper and I'm going
to give this some margin and we're just
going to give this a margin of let's say
50 pixels and just like before when we
had 0 this is going to apply to every
single
side so let's save and go back we
refresh and we now have it's sort of
weird right so this is set to be 100%
well if we have a 50 pixel margin on
each side this can't really be a hundred
percent so let's go back here and revise
this I'm just going to get rid of this
width entirely save this and come back
okay as you can see now we have a fifty
pixel margin fifty fifty fifty it's
going to be everywhere in fact if you
hover over this under expect in fact if
you forget how to get here you right
click inspect element if you're using
Chrome I believe it's inspect element on
Safari and Firefox as well and so if you
just hover over the div here you can see
this margin and since we have it at
fifty and fifty it's going to be
centered well let's add us something a
little bit different here let's go to
our CSS and I'm gonna get rid of this
margin and I just want to margin on the
right and that's going to be 100 pixels
and then we'll also have a margin on the
left it's going to be 50 pixels and then
a margin on the top and it's going to be
let's say 200 pixels we'll save this and
then we'll come back to our document
here and refresh let's hover over this
as you can see we have the fifty 200 and
100 and then no margin on the bottom
because we're not specifying any margin
anywhere but let's say you don't want to
have to write margin top margin let all
the time because chances are if you're
using the margin tank you're going to be
using you know a margin on more than one
face of an object so if we delete all
these we can use our word margin again
so just like before however there's an
order in which you're defining margin
and when it goes as it goes top so let's
give 200 on the town and then it goes to
right so let's give let's do something
150 on the right and then it goes to the
bottom which is we'll just have this be
30 pixels even though you won't really
see it and then the left which will do
as 10
schools so now let's come back to our
Chrome and as you can see we got ten on
the Left 200 on the top 150 on the right
and then let's hover over this you can
see that little bit of 30 pixels on the
bottom so it goes top right bottom left
around clockwise okay so let's say you
have the same top and bottom margin and
the same left and right margin well you
can actually leave off these last two
values if I delete this like this what
this is going to do is that this 200 is
going to be applied to the top and the
bottom and this is we the left and the
right so it goes top right bottom left
if you were only wanted to find the top
and bottom as being different you could
say like this and now this does top is
200 right is 150 bottom is 100 and left
is 150 let's save this and you can see
it in action okay so now that writing
the left have the same top and then a
100 earth 200 and 100 cool well this is
really great um and as you can see here
this is all all fine but let's say we
actually give this we want to have this
box has an actual width and I'm just
going to give this a width of we'll say
so it's going to be 300 pixels okay
we'll save it and come back well now on
the sudden we you know our margins
aren't as clean because this has a width
of 300 our margins are the same but
since this has to take up the entire
width here this margin on the right here
is just way bigger than it should be
what if you want this to be completely
centered in here you you're not going to
be able to account for all these
different browser sizes so you can't
give it a margin of you know you can't
keep bumping up this margin until it
fits in the center because you'll never
truly be in the center so let's say we
want to put this in the center the way
to do that is with Auto
so this says automatically determine the
margin for the right and left so as long
as you have a div with the width
and then it has a cadet as zero for top
and bottom margin will put these at 50
pixels and we'll have them both be at 50
pixels so what this is going to do is
it's going to have 50 pixels on the top
the left and right are going to be Auto
and it has a width of 300 so this dim is
going to be perfectly centered on our
page no matter how we have it laid out
refresh and now let's move this around
so a lot of people when they're first
starting CSS they think they want to
have something centered like a div so
what do they do they can look on the
body and they could say oh the body
needs a center a line Center but there's
only one property in CSS as the line
Center and it's text aligned so text
align Center is not appropriate here you
want to Center a div you use you give it
a width and then you have it a margin
which communauté can be zero but as
long as it has Auto for left and right
so the ended like this
it's still going to be the same okay so
this is how you Center a div using CSS
margins as always if you have any
