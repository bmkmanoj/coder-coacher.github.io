tutorials in this video we're gonna be
talking a little bit more about jsx and
specifically we're going to be using
conditionals to modify different
properties in our jsx we're going to
show you how you can do that really
nicely and follow some best practices
let's get started now
okay so we're doing pretty good here now
let's go ahead and make this a little
bit nicer for instance we need some sort
of indication when we check this more
than just that this is checked right
because that's not really that
impressive so let's head to our code
here and we're going to go to the single
resolution now what we're going to do in
this video is we're going to explore
sort of a class names we're going to do
some conditional stuff i'ma show you why
this is a little bit weird in react so
let's check out this render function
what we want to do is we want to toggle
a class of checked on to this list item
now in other things you could do like an
ng F sort of thing what we want to do is
we want to say const and we're going to
make a new constant variable and this is
going to be the resolution class so we
could say resolution class is going to
be equal to now let's just have a
ternary condition here where we can say
this dot props dot resolution dot
complete is uh we want to see if this is
complete then we want this to have a
class of checked otherwise we want this
to have no class okay so you can see
here we're defining a new variable
resolution class and if this is equal to
true then set it to checked otherwise do
not set anything to checked now we can
add this class on our list item by
saying class name is equal to and then
within brackets we can say resolution
class so now it's going to grab this
value and when we assign something a new
class it's going to update and grab us a
and either grab us checked or unchecked
cool so let's go back to our document
now and as you can see without doing
anything we already have this grayed out
so do handstands is still there but
beautiful it's checked and grayed out
cool it's actually make this a little
bit more interesting here I'm actually
going to head to my styles and I have
this really basic transition mixin we're
just adds a transition of 0.3 seconds
let's go ahead and search for checked so
you can see I'm changing the color of
checked to be ccc I'm not actually
making it more transparent I'm just
changing the color let's go ahead and
actually add a transition onto this on
the list item I can do that simply by
using that mix and I just told you about
and just say trans like that just a
simple trans function like so and we're
going to get an instant transition on
this thing now when we check these it
just fades out it's just nicer yeah
that's not too important but it's
certainly just a little nice thing you
know these little transitions when not
overdone can be just a tad nice things
to your experience cool so let's go
ahead and now that we have that let's
check out we want to actually display in
addition to this we want this to display
that this is complete so let's come back
here so we did this where we had a
conditional displaying whether or not
this is a class here let's do something
very very similar I'm actually going to
zoom out my code slightly hopefully it's
not too hard to read we can say constant
status and status is going to be equal
to this dot props that a solution dot
complete again and we're gonna have a
question mark here if this is complete
then we're going to set this constant
variable of status equal to and this is
where it gets interesting we can
actually put HTML here we can say span
with a class name of completed we can
say this class with a class name of
completed and have the text be completed
close out this band and this is pretty
interesting here we can now have a colon
once more and say
or nothing so if this is completed then
this variable is now going to be set to
this HTML element otherwise show us
nothing now let's actually go ahead and
drop in status into our code and because
like I said we have access to straight
JavaScript when we use these brackets
let's just head after our text here
let's make a new line we can put
brackets and just simply say status this
is going to be referring to this
variable right here let's check back to
our page and we should see we get this
beautiful completed right here when we
check it off completed awesome super
cool so as you can see here doing this
sort of conditional thing in this jsx
what we're not doing is we're not
throwing these in line here we're not
doing like an if this in line the best
practice is to keep your conditionals
outside of your return statement now you
may be thinking well we checked this
dead prop set resolution twice couldn't
we have just declared both of these
variables and then done if this dot
props that resolution yeah you
absolutely could have done that but this
is in two lines and to me this reads
really nicely if this doesn't read
nicely to you can certainly declare your
variables and then set them inside of an
if statement but for me I just like the
nice compactness of this so as you can
see simply by having this variable not
equal to anything we don't get any
markup on our page there's nothing here
when we check it shows up now we still
have one more security lesson to learn
of which we're going to go over in
another video coming up and we also have
some react techniques to go over and I'm
going to be showing you how to get some
nice fancy animations going on this
thing in no time at all they're going to
be super fancy so as always if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment the video have me up at twitter
