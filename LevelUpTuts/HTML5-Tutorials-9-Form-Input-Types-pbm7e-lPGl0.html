of tux and today we're gonna be talking
about some new form input types in html5
and there's lots of them so this is
going to be broken up into a couple of
videos so these form input types the
compatibility is a little scattered so I
would recommend checking out the
compatibility individually for these
input types because over the course of
time for when this video is created too
when you're watching it who knows if the
compatibility that I'm saying is going
to be accurate so please do research on
which items they are going to be
compatible with browsers that you need
to make them compatible with although
the fall backs are pretty are pretty
nice so they look like just normal input
fields so it's you know it's it's a
little bit of a difference but if you
want to use one of these by all means
check out the compatibility before so
you know what you're getting into
so we're just gonna have a basic form at
the bottom of this and this is just
going to be in side of we'll just have a
section here and I'm gonna make a
foreign tag and I don't I don't gonna
have a action or anything right now
because I just want to show off these
input types so the first one we're going
to talk about is number so if we say
input and type we can have a number tag
and this is a little bit different than
anything we've seen before because there
hasn't been an input type number before
so let's check out what happens in our
browser you'll notice that we have this
number box here and there's an up and
down on it also if I hit up and down on
my keyboard allows me to increase or
decrease numbers you can also likewise
click these up and down or you could
just in fact type a number so what
happens if you try to type letters in
here well you can but then your browser
gives you a little message that says
please enter a number and this little
message is going to be specific to
browser this is what the message looks
like in Google's Chrome so what kind of
things can we do with this number input
well there's actually some attributes we
can give it we can give it the value
minimum and maximum attributes so if we
say something like let's go right here
and let's say minimum 10 the minimum
value is going to be 10 so if I type in
or if I just hit up you'll notice it
starts at 10 and I try to go any less
than 10 it's not gonna let me do it more
importantly if I try to have 9 it tells
me I need a value greater or equal to 10
this is great the things that we've
never been able to do without JavaScript
so now we can say it has a max also and
then has a max of 20 now we can't go
over 20 and it can have a step as well
so every single time you go up you're
gonna go up by 2 and it's starting value
it's just going to be its value and this
value will just have it start at 10 so
now it's refresh now our field is
starting at 10 every single time we go
up it goes up to all the way up to 20
and then no higher than that if we try
to have an odd number it says it's an
invalid number that's because our step
is only allowing us to do intervals of 2
here so this is the number input style
so before we do another one I'm actually
gonna fix this CSS here and just in our
main area I'm just going to add it so we
have a width and that it's in the center
otherwise these things might get a
little hard to see so in main I'm just
going to have this say width of let's
say 80% and margin can just be 0 and
auto and let's increase the input font
size let's have this just be 24 now just
so we can see these nice and big great
so this is a little bit better here's
our number input great alright let's
come back to our code and I'm going to
add another input and this is just going
to be an input type of range so what is
that range do well range you might think
is sort of like a number range or
something well know
actually let's save this and you'll see
that range is actually a slider we have
this slider and this is going to have
the value of a number just like this
number list however it's going to be
like a little slider here and how that
slider is rendered is determined by you
browser itself
now for this range we can also have a
initial value for it we can have a step
in a minute and a max so we could also
have men equals zero max equals 100 and
you can also have a step but now it's no
no big deal so I'm gonna have it a value
at currently 50 and you'll see when we
refresh this the slider is going to
start dead in the middle here now on
browsers that this is not supported in
like older just older browsers in
general and an Explorer Firefox you're
just going to see an ordinary input so
that would accept a text or a number
value or something so your users would
be able to enter a number itself
okay so we have range and we have number
we also have an input type of date let's
save this and see what happens now we
have this date picker you can use this
up and down you can use this click that
opens up a browser's calendar widget
here which is really nice because we
don't have to do this with JavaScript or
anything like that and it just is really
elegant solution of course if you want
this to be compatible with most browsers
you're probably gonna have to write a
JavaScript fallback for those browsers
that aren't compatible because otherwise
this is just going to show up like an
ordinary input field so if you're just
seeing ordinary input fields for these
try to use a browser like Chrome and
you're gonna see these sort of results
here so what sort of attributes does
this accept this accepts a value in
which the format is similar to well if
exact same has that we accepted in our
date time time element so if we say
value we want to have it be today MB
2013 - oh six - twenty - save this
refresh we now see that is the default
text default text value here we can also
have the certain step may be a step in
days so it's going up by every time you
click the up button that's going to go
up by two days and you could also have
it a minute um acts this way you don't
want people may be picking things in the
past or later than 2013 there's
something like that
you could say min is equal to 2013 0 1 0
1 so this is going to be the minimum
that allows you to choose is January 1st
2013 and let's go back here and you'll
notice the widget doesn't even allow me
to go further than January 1st and won't
let me select 31st of the previous year
however will let me select January 1st
great so so far these are three
incredibly useful input types and they
really just keep getting more and more
useful there's all sorts of really great
one so let's do one more and we're going
to do color so input type and it's color
now I don't believe colors support it
very widely so you're gonna want to
check out what browsers are supporting
color at the time that you're watching
this video however I know Google Chrome
supports it and it's going to be a color
picking widget which opens up your
systems color picking menu on oh s X
this is what it looks like and you'll
notice it's going to be selecting a
color for me and great I just click the
X box here and now it's this green color
has the value that the color chooser has
picked and when it submits it's going to
be the hex value of the color so of
course browser support and the fallback
is just going to be a blank text field
where you can put that hex value but
this is going to spit out a hex value
which is pretty darn cool
so in the next video we're going to go
over some of the other input types that
are still to come we have like an
autocomplete box we have an email URL
telephone search box so there's a lot of
great elements and we're gonna keep
going over these input types in the next
video
so as always if you have any questions
or comments leave it come in the video
here to set that level up tots on
Twitter or at level up tots on Facebook
or just wherever once again this is
