tutorials and in this video we're gonna
be creating our very first page within
Drupal this is gonna be to the standard
page it's gonna be in about Us page and
it should show you just how easy it
really is so let's get going on that
right now so now that we at least have a
basic idea of where everything is we're
gonna go ahead and start adding some
content you'll notice we have an add
content button directly here on the home
page or you could add content simply by
clicking on the content right here you
know we can add content and it's going
to allow us to select an article or a
basic page now you might be wondering
what the difference is an article is
more of like a blog post where you have
maybe like a teaser on the home page and
then you click to get inform or or you
click to have more information an
article could be seen as something that
you would have multiple of of any given
kind of topic where a page it's gonna be
something like more informational and
static like an about page a contact page
something like that let's go ahead and
just click in the basic page and let's
make an about Us page we're gonna give
this a title of about us and we can just
paste in some lorem ipsum let me grab
some lorem ipsum text here from the
first lorem ipsum generator i can find i
just want to get a few paragraphs so
let's grab a couple of paragraphs here
paste them in here and now we have some
text now you'll notice that this WYSIWYG
is now built into Drupal this is
something that was left out of Drupal 7
and was something that people often have
trouble with trying to even get a
WYSIWYG into their site because of
adding libraries and things changing in
that way now it's really nice that
Drupal has a built in WYSIWYG it's about
time you can see that we have basic HTML
has our format that's fine if you'd like
to edit the source you can always click
source here we'll go over WYSIWYG stuff
in more detail once we talk about
actually editing this WYSIWYG okay so
now that we have our basic about Us page
let's go ahead and check out some of the
stuff on the sidebar here
you mostly have our main content right
here on the left
we have save and publish and preview
down here but over here we have some
information this is sort of meta stuff
now we can say we can create a new
revision if you want to have a revision
assistant which is nice that the skin
revisions are in here by default now
because that's another feature that you
would have had to have install a module
for before we could create a revision to
allow multiple people to work on this
and look at it and make sure that things
are okay that way if we mess something
up we can always jump back to a previous
revision since this is just the initial
creation I don't need to create a
revision just yet menu settings is where
we can add this to the menu when we can
add this to the menu directly within the
creation process so if we click provide
a menu link it automatically pulls in
the title if we would like it to keep it
that way and we can say yeah make this
in the main navigation and the weight
here is going to be where it exists in
the menu itself now keep in mind a
higher number is a heavier weight since
we want this to be second in the list we
can always put this as number two that
way we can align the number with exactly
the positioning of it if we want another
item that's the third item in the menu
we could have that as number 3 now 2
doesn't equal second in the menu and 3
doesn't equal third in the menu if we
were to set this to 3 right now it would
still be second in the menu because
there's only two items the weight simply
just makes the heavier item fall further
down the menu ok now we can set URL path
settings and this is alternative URL for
the content we'll leave this alone for
right now and to see what happens when
we create our page again authoring
information we have who this is authored
by we don't need to touch this because
this is information is filled in
automatically and promotion options now
we'll see sticky at top of list and
promote to front page however we don't
really need to deal with these just yet
let's go ahead and click Save and
publish if you wanted to prove it you
could always click preview before now
once this content is published
that means it's live on the site so if
you want to save this in 3
mein unpublished that there was an
option in the drop-down save and
unpublished
that's going to keep this content saved
in your website but not have it
available to users who aren't logged in
this could be useful if you're working
on this same piece of content with
multiple people so here we have the new
about us page and here's our text you
notice we have these view edit delete
tabs that we've seen before if we head
to a non logged in version of the site
with the same URL you'll see this is
what it looks like
we have our about Us page we have our
home page and here we are
so we now created our first piece of
content and it shows up in our main
navigation and you'll notice that we
still have this no front page content as
to because by default this is reserved
for articles and they'll automatically
populate in here now that doesn't have
to be the case that's easily changeable
and is something that we'll go over in
the future so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments they become in the
video army up by Twitter or Facebook if
you want these videos for early access
you can sign up to be a level up pro and
get early access to streaming this
entire series or you're going to store
that level up tutorials calm if
subscriptions aren't your thing and
purchased the video series before
they're released on YouTube as always
this is Scott thanks for watching and
I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
