up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be showing you pre CSS which is
really for individuals who aren't quite
ready to give up their sass syntax but
are ready to give obsessed let's say you
want to take advantage of all of the
packages in post CSS and you don't want
to use sass but there's some things
you're not quite ready to let go of like
the variable sintac nested selectors
nixon's that kind of thing so pre CSS
allows you to use a lot of that syntax
within your actual CSS files so let's
get going on that right now so let's say
the CSS next syntax wasn't doing it for
you and you don't feel like using
multiple processors including sass and
post CSS and you want to still take
advantage of the the additional packages
that comes with post CSS well you can
actually use this package called pre CSS
which allows for essentially sass syntax
with CSS files so let's check this out
we can go ahead and install pre CSS and
then check out some of these features so
let's go ahead and do that simply by
typing in in our command line let's
cancel this we have NPM install hyphen
hyphen save hyphen dev pre CSS so this
is sort of a preprocessor style syntax
for post CSS now we can go ahead and
come to our gulp file and let's go ahead
and add it in here and we can leave CSS
next if we'd like and just duplicate
this line and let's just say free CSS
like so and now we can go ahead and add
pre CSS one of our processors now I'm
going to add this first because it's
going to compute some of the some of the
syntax see stuff first that way before
auto prefix or CSS next runs it takes
care of some things for us so we can do
pre CSS and
again I'm going to leave these curly
brackets where our options would go if
we were using any sort of options now
let's go ahead and run our gulp watch
command and let's come to our CSS and
let's use some sass syntax for example
let's just do some nested at anything
here we could do h1 inside of here and
let's do let's just do color equals blue
like so now let's check out our CSS you
can see even though we're working with a
dot CSS file we're not using SAS head
still was able to compile this nested
element property in fact we can use
these sass style variables where we
could say this is our primary color and
it's going to be equal to let's say just
green now we can go ahead and simply
just use that primary variable just like
you'd be used to in SAS and you can see
that it of course compiles to green so
what's great about this is just about
how similar to sass it is if yours to
working in SAS a whole lot and that
syntax is sort of ingrained into your
brain and how you do things it's really
not a bad choice to go ahead and use pre
CSS now some of these syntax see things
are a little bit different we have
conditionals we have loops we have
mix-ins but you'll notice a mixin needs
to be defined with this at define hyphen
mixin instead of just what you might be
used to with mixin and then of course
you can use it now with at mixin so
these things are just a little bit
different but it really allows you to
use a lot of the things that you bees to
incest with just plain old CSS so let's
actually try to do a mix in so we can
come to our pre-compiled CSS and let's
make a mix in we can say define mixin
now we're going to give this mix in the
name let's just say this is going to be
hello and this is simply just going to
output a margin of zero and auto like so
now we can then use this mixin
let's just say in a section tag and we
can go ahead and say at mixin hello save
this and you'll see that this body
section is in fact getting the margin
zero auto so things are just a hair
different in some respects but it does
allow you to use this nice variable
syntax within your CSS instead of using
the next CSS syntax with this colon root
and the double hyphens if you're not a
fan of that so if you would like to
abandon sass but not totally abandon
sass free CSS with post CSS is for you
as always this is Scott what level of
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video
artists about Twitter or Facebook at
level of tutorials we love to hear from
you thanks for watching and we'll see in
the next 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
