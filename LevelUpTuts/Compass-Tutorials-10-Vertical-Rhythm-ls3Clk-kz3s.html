up tuts and today we're gonna be going
over vertical rhythm encompass and if
you're not familiar with vertical rhythm
I would suggest that you would go to
this twenty four ways org article from
2006 called compose composed to a
vertical rhythm by Richard Rutter it's a
great article it'll teach you a little
bit about what we're going to be doing
with compass and after you've read this
article you will have a greater
appreciation for what compass is
actually doing for you so to summarize
the vertical rhythm is the spacing and
arrangement of texts as the reader
descends the page it's contributed by
three factors font size line height and
margin or padding all of these factors
must be calculated with care in order
that the rhythm is maintained the basic
unit of vertical space is line height
establishing a suitable line height that
can be applied to all text on the page
be it heading copy or side note is key
to solid dependable vertical rhythm okay
so go ahead and just go read this
article come back and then we're gonna
get working into compass using the same
source from the video the previous video
with code kit I just have h1 and h2 and
then an h2 in my main div and then for
paragraph texts and then two buttons and
then an anchor within my paragraph so to
get started here I'm just going to
delete this anchor color red here
because it doesn't pertain to this
particular example so to get started
we're just going to have to declare two
variables one of which is the base font
size so to do that we do dollar base
font size and we're going to use 16
pixels alright and then we're gonna have
to include a base line height size which
is base line height and that's going to
be 24 pixels and now we need to include
a mixin that compass has created called
established baseline
so if we check out what our CSS is doing
it's basically giving our fonts that's
100% line height of 1.5 n in their HTML
body 16 pics so let's see what our
chrome looks like after we refresh this
okay so now if we check out this text we
can see the font size 16 pixels and the
line height it's been given this is to
give our document of more better flowing
text so we now have a vertical rhythm in
our document as you can see the line
Heights is adjusted accordingly but
let's say we want to send this paragraph
which is has a class of three we want to
have this text be larger but we wanted
to maintain the vertical rhythm let's go
down to our CSS and do our class three
so we're just going to do @include
adjust font size too and we're going to
give it a size we want it to be let's
say it was 16 pixels before we just want
this to be 18 and that's it we'll save
this okay so now what this is going to
do is it's going to adjust the font size
and the line height if we go to our s if
we go to our CSS you can see it's not
only given our font size and M value but
it's also given our line height a new M
value let's go to our document and see
what's changed as you can see we now
have the newly adjusted paragraph text
here let's make this a little bit more
drastic to see the line height in action
so let's make this 28 go back to our
page as you can see it's larger and it's
adjusted the line height - what if the
documents vertical rhythm is as you can
see oh don't save let's go back to the
CSS yep as you can see it's now given
our font size 1.75 m/s and our line
height is 1.71 4 m/s so let's knock this
back down to 18 and let's say we want to
add a leader on to our first paragraph
which is actually
of one so we're just going to say
@include leader and then we're just
going to give a parenthesis because
there's no value here that we're passing
it
however we could pass it how many lines
the font size or what property if we
wanted to use margin or padding to
accomplish this but we're just going to
use leader and let's refresh our
document as you can see let's go to our
first paragraph as you can see there is
a margin top of 1.5 m instead of the
normal just margin top of 1m so as you
can see it's our leader that's adding to
our top paragraph and it's giving just a
little bit more space on the top that's
going along with our pages vertical
rhythm and if we just wanted to have
this be a margin leader we could do
margin leader instead or padding and be
padding leisure padding leader or you
could pass that as a variable within the
function itself or the mixin itself well
let's say you wanted to add a trailer
that's easy to same thing we can do on
for we can say add to include trailer
and then we're not going to pass it
anything save and of course as before
although there's nothing below it so you
know we'll just have to see it in expect
inspect here you can see it's giving it
a margin bottom of 1.5 m/s and just like
later you can add it by saying margin
leader or our margin trailer or padding
trailer before it to do that in padding
or margin so let's say you wanted to add
a border but you wanted to maintain
rhythm you can do that with this mixin
called rhythm borders we'll do that on
the second paragraph and we can say
include rhythm borders and now we're
just going to print the seas and we're
going to hit save refresh our page here
and as you can see it's added borders
and maintain the vertical rhythm in the
page with the amount of space between
the border and the amount of space
afterwards so let's say you wanted to
make this border wider let's say you
wanted to make it five pixels we can
make it five pixels
check it out it's five pixels and if we
wanted to change the border to be dashed
we could do a couple of things but one
thing let's say you always wanted your
borders to be dashed here we could
actually set that variable as default
rhythm border style and that's going to
be equal to we'll say dashed save this
and go back to our site as you can see
it's going to be - so any time we use
this now it's going to output a dashed
border of course you could just specify
the border in your anchor or in your
paragraph as well no big deal but if you
wanted to change all of them you had a
certain style you can do that as well
there's a whole host of things to be
found on this compass - style - org and
that's a for the vertical rhythm section
and it basically includes all of these
different variables that you have access
to and all of these mixes that you can
throw in your s CSS so that if you ever
get lost you for getting into this stuff
just go to a compass style and just
check out those mix-ins they're pretty
straightforward if you have any
questions you can always you know send
us a comment we'll try - we'll try to
specify a little bit more for you so
let's just add a trailing border to this
trailer and that's nice and easy it's
just one more it's just include and
we're gonna say trailing border and then
that's it with save check it out now
there's a nice little trailing border at
the bottom of our page so this is a nice
way to make your text look really nice
using minimal effort I mean we have if I
deleted this it would be eight lines of
code here so if I were to turn off
compression for this CSS file you can
see that it's written a ton of lines of
CSS for us it's on all those
calculations for us given these really
deep number values that we would have to
do by hand it's really just saving us a
ton of time to establish this really
nice vertical rhythm and it really took
all of a couple seconds to just type in
you know to set the base font size and
set the baseline height and establish
baseline
that's it so this is vertical rhythm for
compass it seems a little bit daunting
so really it's just these three lines
and then besides that these extra
nixon's and variables and you can just
go to compass - style org and look at
their documents and see all of the mix
ins that they have but this is a good
introduction and it pretty much covers
what you need to know once again this is
Scott with level up tuts and if you have
any questions or comments you know leave
a comment on the video or hit up a
Twitter and level up tuts you know we
always want to hear from you let us know
what you're thinking and thanks for
