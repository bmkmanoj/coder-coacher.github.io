talking about linting in vs code and
we're going to be using es lint now the
first thing you're going to want to do
is head to the extensions we're going to
type in es lint
now es linter if you don't know is a
really nice javascript linter and you're
going to want to go ahead and install es
lint this is the one you can see it's
very popular 1 million downloads it
works very well there's a lot of really
nice stuff about this package or just
linting envious code in general and
that's one of my pet peeves about
sublime text is really just how
difficult it can be to get linting
working because the interface doesn't
really give you a whole lot of hints if
it's not working in this particular case
vs code is going to yell at you and
basically tell you what's going on if
it's not working so the first things
first is we need to install this then we
want to install es lint either in our
workspace or we want to install it
globally known install globally for the
case of this video now to do this you do
need NPM which is notice oh you want to
install node J s if you're using
javascript and what we want to do is we
want to get to control and then what
would be D tilde key or the back tick
and we can paste in NPM install - GES
lint as long as we have node installed
in our computer let me hit enter this is
going to install es lint globally into
our computer ok as you can see have been
installed es lint now per these
instructions what we do need is an es
lint our C file into our project now
this is a hey react native project but
despite that I don't have an es lint
file in here yet so now is a good time
to create one and we can do so using the
command es lint - - in it and now this
is going to ask you some questions I
apologize if the text is a little bit
smaller for this it's not as easy to
bump up here let me see if I can and
that's just going to make the whole
interface bigger but either way
I'll shrink it down in a second so how
would you like to configure es lint well
you could say let's use a popular style
guide let's answer some questions about
your style inspect your JavaScript file
was really nice about this es lint and
it is basically it's going to get you
going how you want to have the linter
register errors in your code I'm going
to use a popular style guide now the one
I really love is the Airbnb style guide
I use this all the time I do in fact
turn some things off occasionally but
for the point of this video should be
alright click OK do use react in this
particular instance I am so yes
JavaScript and you could have selected
any of those and what we want to do is
just wait as this installs es linty
eslint plugin react es lint JSX Ally and
the configure B&amp;amp;B which is a big one so
let's just hang out while it does that
ok as you can see we got a whole bunch
of stuff a whole bunch of stuff
installed and let's check it out we now
have an es lint j/s file we could have
had an es lint JSON file as well but as
you see nothing crazier extends air B&amp;amp;B
plug-ins are these ok
so super cool let's actually hit to the
problems tab here and look at this no
problem so far so let me shrink this
whole thing down a little bit again and
we can do control tilde to hide our
terminal you might have to hit it once
or twice because it brings up terminal
first and now let's check this out I'm
going to go ahead and delete a semicolon
here and you'll notice
nothing's complaining in fact and
there's no errors down here if we were
to head to this where it says es lint
down here we can click on this and you
can see if you scroll up a little bit it
says to use es lint in this workspace
please install es lint using install es
lint or globally bla bla bla you need to
reopen the workspace so what I'm going
to do is reopen this workspace because
currently it's not going to work now an
easy way to do this honestly is just do
command Q close it
click it reopen it fire it up you know
one of the best things obviously about
via SCOTUS just simply how fast it is
compared to some other text editors and
just like that we do have e as lint
working we have some crazy red
underlining zuv things that it doesn't
like now let's check this out some of
these are not super valid right some of
these are basically saying okay styles
used before is defined it's pretty
common especially in this sort of use
case to define your status below the
component so a rule like that is
certainly one I would consider turning
off and then we have another one
basically trailing spaces not allowed
this is a good one to have because well
when we'll see in a second when we get
this sort of auto fixing some of our
problems it's going to remove any sort
of extraneous stuff and likewise here
it's complaining about that semicolon
that we're missing
so let's actually start configuring this
we can head to our es Lind rjs file now
you could have used an es linty JSON as
well in fact I think there's probably
the most common so for instance let's
head to our file and we hover over this
one that I really don't agree with right
this is going to say es lint not allowed
files with extensions j/s basically it's
complaining that we don't want to use
JSX in files that are not dot to JSX
this is what I turn off pretty much all
the time
and you'll notice every single time it
has an error it's going to give you the
rule that it's breaking so for instance
if we wanted to modify this particular
rule we could always come into our EDS
lint file and configure it as such we
can have a comma here we can say rules
now you're going to want to look up the
exact rules for a lot of this stuff but
rules takes an array and inside of that
array we can pass in our rule in the
string which is react forward slash JSX
filename extension and then we can say
well we could turn this off entirely
just by saying the property value of
zero here now in rules the property of
rules is going to be an object the
first property in that object is we're
just going to paste in a react JSX
extension file name : and we can give
this value of 0 simply just to turn this
rule off and now let's head back to our
app now when I save this you'll see even
before I saved it these squiggly line is
gone and again let's turn this one off
to where we can come in here check this
out say no use before define copy this
head over here paste this in just like
this and you know this es lint file
isn't part of of this es lint file isn't
part of BS code or anything this is es
Lintz syntax and turning everything off
here so if you need to consult sort of
the documentation for this head to es
Lintz website but as far as the
implementation of es lint and BS code
goes is really super cool here now what
we want to do is actually turn on auto
completing because I certainly like that
I like it when it saves if you have your
rule set up exactly the way you want
them to having it auto fix everything
when you save a file can be just
insanely insanely time-saving so let's
head to our preferences here this is
really the first time we're getting into
preferences we're going to click code
preferences settings now in this case we
want to type in lint now let me get rid
of the editor so we can have this a
little bit bigger and the searching in
this settings is really super nice
because really allows us to get to what
we want to and then each setting is
categorized by some sort of accordion
here now this interface is not
necessarily as visually nice as Adams
but it's certainly better than sublime
text because it follows the same sort of
stuff but it gives you at least an
interface and it makes things easier on
you
so we can see we have es lint settings
here we could have just searched for es
lint but it's nice to see all this stuff
and and what I want to look forward down
here is es lint AutoFix unsafe now when
we hover over any given setting it has a
pencil next to it where we can
click and we can set it to true or false
so it's not like it's giving you no
interface and you have to type out all
of this this JSON essentially we can
type in true here and it automatically
adds it to our own user settings now I
can say this van W to get out and let's
save this file watch something really
cool happened one thing you'll focus on
is maybe this parenthesis here we could
save this not only do we have no more
read but this parenthesis now jumped in
here so as you can see here yes lint has
fixed everything it's able to fix do
easily right and the stuff that it
hasn't been able to fix is let's see
this hello and basically it's saying
hello is defined but never used so what
it's not going to do is it's not going
to go out and delete this import for us
even though we're not using it anywhere
in here and that's quite alright because
that we don't want we don't want any
lint
getting that into our code so check it
out this is es lint linting in vs code
there's a ton of other linting packages
you can check them out they all function
very similarly because vs coding this is
just how vs code handles linting you can
see that we have any errors they're
going to pop up down here with this X we
can click this it's going to show us the
exact error right here
what file it's in double click it it'll
take us right to that line this is just
super nice I mean this is this is really
as nice as it gets as far as linting the
auto auto fix unsaved the jumping to the
lines the showing you exact your errors
just really great stuff so this is es
lint in vs code check it out install it
use it if you're using this kind of
stuff es lens going to save your life so
