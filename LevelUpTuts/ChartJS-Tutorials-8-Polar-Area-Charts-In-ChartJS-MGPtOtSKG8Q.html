up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be focusing on polar area charts
in chart j/s let's get going on that now
okay so by now we sort of seen the
pattern with these we've created these
charts
they'll look really super nice they all
have really great animations so at this
point we're gonna continue just talking
about different charts until we've
covered the last two now the last two
are going to be a polar area chart and a
pie and donut chart now what's great
about both of these is that we should be
able to use the same data which is
really where we've been going this whole
time right so we have now once again
compared to our radar our data is going
to be a little bit different but we'll
get to keep some things since we had
this radar chart before with these
labels we'll continue to keep these
labels the first thing we need to do
though is we need to change this from
radar to polar area and that's in
camelcase so polar area okay so the type
of a chart is going to be a polar area
the data is going to be in a similar
structure but not entirely similar here
let's go ahead and get rid of one of
these data sets okay just so we have
this nice and easy now in addition to
this data set what we'll need here is
four different colors now we have a
background color which is this green and
we have a border color sure let's
actually just get rid of order color for
now make it less complex here and what
we really need is for each one of these
points of data we need a background
color and we don't have to do anything
special because these labels there's
five labels here and those five labels
are going to pertain to these five data
points and for this background color we
want this to be an array of strings here
and I'm just going to grab some flat UI
colors because why not fly UI colors
look good
and we'll just need let's see we need
these five colors in here and we should
be good to go by the way I didn't pick
these colors based on anything I just
sort of grabbed five at random okay
so we now have our five colors we have
our data the label is going to be for
this particular type of data and the
labels themselves like this so we should
be good to go here because we have our
data which is five points our color
which is five points and our labels
which are five points and if we head
back to our site and refresh you see we
have this awesome awesome polar area
chart now polar area chart is great
because as you can see each one of these
chunks is an equal size right however
the amount they extend out is what is
going to be determined by their actual
value and the further and further they
go out the larger they end up looking
because they end up taking up a bigger
slice here even though they only take up
the same fraction of this circle in
terms of radius but as you can see I
mean we threw some data in here and as
always this thing looks awesome
at this point I can't necessarily
recommend using another charting library
honestly because unless you need
something really really customized this
thing is just awesome now this chart has
a few particular options that we can
actually modify you'll notice that when
we refresh this we get this rotating
hand scaling in let's say we weren't
super excited about that rotation it's
hard to believe but I like the rotation
but it's hard to believe that you
wouldn't be excited about it because
personally I like it but if you hated
that rotation you can actually turn that
off I mean this is a great part about
any of this things is that if it does
something automatically you can tell it
hate cut it out so we could say options
and just like we've passed into options
before we can have a object here
now we can have a property of animation
and the animation has a couple of
different options here we can do this
animate rotate our animate scale so if
we were to say animate rotate we could
say this is false and this should allow
us to have this animate on but not
rotate so if we refresh you see we now
just get this scaling based animation
word zooming out from the start perfect
and let's say we wanted the opposite of
that to be true or we love the animation
but we thought the scale sort of messed
with how you understood it so we can say
animate scale is false and it's going to
keep Angela's pretty darn sweet look at
all our data flow in there and if we
wanted to both of them off you can have
both of them off just pass in another
property here super cool so this is
polar area charts with chart GS if you
want to have access to this code as well
as downloadable videos and some extra
content including some chart j/s themes
that i've created myself you can become
a level up pro at store to level up
tutorials dot-com or if you just want
hourly access to these videos stored I
level up tutorials dot-com and you can
purchase both downloading and streaming
access of this series if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video hurt me up at Twitter or
Facebook I level up tutorials I love to
hear from you thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
