up Hudson today we're going to be able
to take our hard work and finally put it
on the App Store and that's awesome and
this app is not perfect right this app
is just for training purposes really
we're just experimenting with this app
so if this was really something that I
was creating for somebody to purchase or
use on an everyday basis sort of thing
there's all sorts of things we want to
do we would want to make sure we're
testing this on different sized devices
and tablets and we want to make sure
that everything is usable and is just a
great experience so that when your users
pick up this application they don't just
immediately uninstall it because you
don't want to just make lots of bad apps
you want to make good apps and this app
is for all intents and purposes is
really just a an exercise right so
please when you're making applications
test them try them out try to break them
do what you can to make them awesome and
then get to this step but we're just
going to show you how to publish this
app now and then you can of course
download and check this out so what we
need to do is we need to export this
application and we need to sign it with
a key so let's go to file and then
export it's going to ask you what you'd
like to export this project as we have
Android as an option we're going to
select export Android application and
then click Next now it's going to ask
for what project we're talking about we
click browse find the name of the
project ok
now let's click Next now it's going to
ask if we have a key store already we
don't so we're going to create a new one
and now I'm going to browse with a
location it's just going to be let's put
it wherever this application actually is
give me a sec and so I'm just putting it
in HUD me have a folder here then
calling exports and inside of this
folder I'm going to folder called
level up first app
okay cool and now let's go ahead and
save that key inside of this folder and
then we can just give this a name like
level first key store and turn okay and
now we can give it a password and I'm
going to make sure this is a password
that I remember let's click Next now
okay we need to enter some information
here and so this is all information that
it's going to use to generate this key
so for alias we can say level first
alias password again it's going to be
the password and validity we want to say
this is valid for a thousand years and
then we can enter our information here
tuts
and you don't have to enter all of this
information you just enter some of it if
you want there we go and let's click
Next
and now it's going to ask you the
destination of the APK an APK file is
the Android package that is ready to go
in the market I'm going to select this
my first app folder the same place I
have the key store and now let's click
finish and now if we browse to our files
you'll see that in our level of first
step we have not only the key store
which is a file you won't be able to
really do anything with but we also have
this apk which is what we're going to
need to upload to the market so let's
get working and upload that to the
market so if you remember the last video
we create an account we're at this
screen now now all we need to do is
publish an app on the market so let's
click publish app on Google Play and now
it's asking for the default language
which is English US and this is just B
level of Tut's first demo app yeah just
first demo first demo so this level of
Tut's first demo and we're going to
click upload apk and this is going to
upload the apk so then we can then it
and all the the store listing stuff
and if you've used or tried to use the
developers council in the past this is
like a way better experience and it was
even a year ago I mean this is it's
really nice they've really done a great
job with Google Play in general and so
let's go ahead and click upload your
first apk let's browse the files and
let's find this where I have it at my
documents and everything like that
Android dev exports okay let's find it
click open now it's uploading our file
and all should be good quote so it
actually says here supportive devices
3950 - supported devices that's pretty
amazing
Android is a really expansive platform
in this app works on three thousand nine
hundred and fifty two different devices
it's pretty crazy
cool so we have this app and this is a
draft in production and we can you know
have beta testing and stuff like that
we'll go over more of this stuff in the
future but we have our app here cool so
let's go to the next thing which is the
store listing and we want to add a
description that just says a little bit
about this app this app is not meant to
be
used for entertainment but an example of
the first level up Tut's Android
tutorial app cool and so this of course
you get 4000 characters and you're going
to want to use this space to tell your
users exactly what they're getting the
last thing that users want to do is
download an application and then have it
not function like how they expected and
that's always a big thing is you want to
make sure everyone's expectations are
met so promo text this is also not
required so I'm just going to go ahead
and paste in what I had here you're
going to want to write some oh I guess
it doesn't obviously the promo text
blank you're going to want to go ahead
and write some promotional text that's
under 80 characters recent changes there
has been none yet and now we want
screenshots it's asking for screenshots
at least screenshots for your phone to
are required at least so how do you get
screenshots for your app well in the
next video we're going to show you how
to create these screenshots upload them
to Google Play and finish publishing our
app although we are not able to publish
it yet because our payment hasn't gone
through we're going to show you
everything that needs to happen for this
app to be ready to go so as always this
has got a little of Tut's if you have
any questions or comments please leave a
comment the video check us out in the
next one we're going to finish this up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
