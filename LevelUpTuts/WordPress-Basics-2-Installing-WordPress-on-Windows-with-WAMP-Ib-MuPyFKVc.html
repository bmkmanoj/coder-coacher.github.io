level of Tut's and today I'm going to be
showing you how to install WordPress
using WAMP on a Windows computer now
here I am at wordpress.org I already
have WAMP installed and configured so if
you need to set that up please refer to
our video on how to setup WIMP we did in
the Magento series I can link it in the
comments of this video or in the
description now what you're going to
want to go ahead and do is download
WordPress so there's this big blue
download WordPress button there's also
one here at the top if you click this
it's going to take you to a page where
you can then click this download button
and it's going to get you the latest
version and it's going to be zipped up
now I've already gone ahead and
downloaded this and I extracted this zip
into my WW folder here I have you can
see this wordpress folder it's in my c
drive and if i open this folder you can
see some files here we have a readme
content admin this stuff this is what
comes with WordPress this is the
WordPress files so now what we need to
do is we need to come in here and we
need to make sure our server is running
so I'm going to go ahead and make sure
our web server is running okay so we
have the red W is no green W I can
confirm that this is in fact working
just by going to my local host and then
going to PHP myadmin now I got there by
clicking on the W and then selecting PHP
myadmin to log in here passwords just
root and blank unless you have changed
it I think a look login here and now
let's click databases and let's create a
database so we're just going to call
this WP - level up now let's click
create and this is going to create a
database for us WP underscore level up
so that's the first step is we need a
database created of course we need to
have WordPress downloaded now we need to
set up our web space to do that in WIMP
we click on the W now we can come up to
where it says Apache and
we want to go to alias directories and
you'll see that we have a couple of
directory set up but we want to set up
the WordPress so let's go add an alias
now it's asking us to name it we're
going to name this wordpress or whatever
you would like to name your site on your
localhost now it's asking us where we
want this to point to so we have put
this in our C WW and then word press
like that and then a forward slash now
we can it enter it says our alias was
created and we press ENTER to exit you
notice the W briefly turns orange that's
what the server can restart then at once
it adds the new property here now we can
go to this property by opening a new tab
going to localhost and then slash
WordPress just like this and now it's
going to tell you there isn't a WP
config file and this is because the WP
config file gets created during
installation so let's click continue and
now it's going to ask for this
information that of course we already
have our database name is WP underscore
level up our username is root our
password is blank and the database host
is localhost now it's going to say you
can have a table prefix prefix if you
want to have a multi-site in fact we can
talk about that later but for right now
we're going to leave that as the default
so let's click let's go our database
name is WP underscore level up our
username is root our password is blank
database host is localhost table prefix
is just WP underscore now you could
change this if you want but like I said
we're not doing anything crazy with this
so we're going to leave it as is now
let's click Submit if everything went
fine you're going to get this screen
this is all right Sparky you've made it
through this part of the installation so
now it's going to populate our database
and install WordPress so let's go
okay now we need to add in the site
title which is just going to be level up
WordPress my username can be admin my
password is going to be just a really
easy password although you can see
there's an indicator here it's a the
indicator is basically going to tell you
if your password is very weak which mine
is um but you are going to be wanting
your password to be strong because this
is going to be the password that you
login to the site as an administrator if
somebody has this password and it's a
cheap easy password that they can get
because you use it for a bunch of stuff
or something then they could login to
your site delete all your content
basically wreak havoc so you want this
password to be secure something that
nobody else knows and I'm in my password
or my email be it's got at level up tuts
calm cool and we're going to allow
search engines to index the site because
we of course want places like Google to
find this so let's click install and now
we get this success WordPress has been
installed we are you know it's saying oh
what that you know it's really easy so
your password your password username is
admin and let's click add login so
notice when you click login it takes you
to your address here slash WP a - login
and now this is the path that you're
going to get to anytime you want to log
into site so you might want to maybe
bookmark this or something or save it or
copy it so you know how to get to here
to log in click remember me I don't
trust that it does remember this
password so I'm going to go ahead and
click login and it's taking us to our
dashboard here now if we open up the
front end of the site we get the hello
world page and we have officially
installed WordPress on Windows using
WAMP and this is Windows 7 but the
process is going to be the same
regardless of what version of Windows
you're using as long as you're using
WAMP so check it out
we now are ready to go you can follow
the rest of the video
and this is going to be the exact same
although for the rest of videos we will
be doing the development on a Mac it
won't matter you should be having the
same exact process and experience on
your localhost for Windows as well so as
always this is Scott with level of touch
