of Tut's and today we're gonna be
talking a little bit more about
dimensional things so in a the first
few tutorials we taught you about width
and height right so we tell you how to
set this content to be a width that's
either a percentage or a length in
pixels or something and a height as well
but sometimes you don't always I mean a
lot of times you don't always want an
exact number for that let's say we have
this we want this to be you know when
it's small we want this to take up 80%
of the window but when it's large we
don't want it to take up I don't know
how long this is let's check it out I
don't even know if I can let's see if it
let me either way when this page is long
this content can get upwards of 1033
pixels wide which is no big deal
but let's say we don't want that we want
this to only get to 800 pixels wide but
we want it for the the rest of the time
we want it to be 80% what we can use
things like min width next with min
width or min height and max height so
let's do this example that I was
actually just talking about so we want
our wrapper for the majority of time we
want it to be 80% but we want its max
width we want the maximum this width can
get to be um let's say 800 pixels and
then in the same right we want the
minimum width that this can get to be a
let's say the least a can get is 400
pixels so if we save that let's go to
our document refresh we might see some
change here let's get rid of this
refresh okay so you can see right now
it's 80 pixels wide well it's actually
going to be 80 plus the two 20s for the
the padding that we had added a couple
of lessons ago in the padding but either
way the width is set to 800 despite we
us telling it with 80% so if we come in
here at the moment this gets
to the point where 80% of this this area
is smaller than 800 pixels we'll see the
start to move again okay so now it's
moving and you can see it's decreasing
in size with it until we're going to get
to 400 pixels and then it'll stop
decreasing in size and the window will
start to overlay it like that okay so
check it out
okay so now it's the perfect width no
matter what because we built the site to
be able to accept this sort of flow and
let's in the same right let's say our we
don't want this giant chin down here
because our content doesn't go that far
but let's say we put the height add I
don't know we'll put it at 100 because
actually I take that back
but that's illustrating my point anyways
we let's say we put it up 150 refresh we
have all this content and then later we
decide hey we want to add a ton more
content of course because your site will
hopefully be growing so we had a whole
bunch of new paragraphs here and now
let's refresh our page and you can see
since we've declared that this has a
height here it's not gonna it's not
going to move down so let's say if this
content is in here we want this to be
the same height right now as it is
anyways so we can set a height for this
let's set it to 200 and see how that
looks
oh boy okay I need more than that so
let's have the site to 300 okay so this
is going to be 300 but then of course if
we add more it's going to have that
problem again so we can have this be the
minimum height is set to and that's the
same it's just mi n - height and
actually let's set this to 200 pixels
now refresh your page here and not much
has changed other than the just just
adjust it a little bit so now we have
our padding padding padding padding the
content is nice in here if we add more
content
um let's add five more paragraphs let's
say yo refresh it adjusts in the same
rate if we get rid of all of these
paragraphs that say yo except for the
original ones the smells that's going to
be is I believe 200 pixels so yeah so
now this is great because you know this
is as small as we want it but it also
adjusts for the more content that we
have so you can use height min height
max height min width max width and you
can get all sorts of great stuff going
and I should mention that you know these
aren't supported in ie6 but if you're
still developing for ie6 and 2012 here
then I feel really bad for you because
that is no fun but yeah so just to
mention it but check it out use these up
and completely control the size of your
divs without having them be totally
rigid as always if you have any
questions leave a comment the video hits
up at Twitter level up Tut's let us know
what you're thinking
I'm sorry about not getting any videos
out last week I ended up getting really
sick in fact I've been drinking water
all day hoping that my voice is going to
be okay for these tutorials and it seems
like it's lasted so there will be more
this week I'm gonna try to make up for
by doing a little bit extra but you know
whatever I'll do it if I can so hit me
up the Twitter level of Tut's uh a test
alinsky lesson what you're thinking as
always this is Scott thanks for watching
