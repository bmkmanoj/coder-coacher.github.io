up tutorials in this video I'm going to
be talking about another package that
adds some sort of base functionality
that we'd like to see within atom now
this is just some sort of an open recent
menu into your file open so let's get
going on that right now next on the list
of essential add AMA plugins is going to
be some functionality that you might
expect to be an atom already if you were
to have multiple projects open at any
given time let's say you close a project
it's always right when you close a
project that you need it again I feel
like that happens all the time so you
would expect to come in here and say
file open recent and sure here so
there's less open that last item here
but that's not really what we're looking
for so let's head to preferences let's
come to install and let's do open recent
okay open recent and as you can see open
recent files in the current window or
recent folders in a new window so let's
go ahead and install this
you can see that it's simply just adding
open recent okay so let's head to open
recent and now you can see that all we
just have is this this first site so if
we click this it's not really gonna do a
whole lot
let's close this project let's close
this project now for this to work I
actually have to open something so I'm
gonna just throw some folders and open
some various projects here and as you
can see let's say we have this
animations folder and I close this we
had to file open recent and you can see
that this animations folder has now
listed here in our recent folders when
we select this it doesn't just open
these files in a tab and this current
project actually reopens the project
itself so like I said this is sort of
base functionality that you would expect
to already be in Adam but luckily
because Adam is so flexible it's able to
handle sort of any of this stuff that
anybody wants to add so as you can see
the files are separated from the folders
themselves in the projects themselves
and it's moved this reopen closed file
that we actually had available before
just move this into this menu as part of
this we can also clear this list if we
want to cool so this is nothing
mind-blowing but open recent is a
package I recommend you have just as
something you will add install and
forget about so as always this is Scott

questions or comments have become in the
video herd me up at Twitter or Facebook
