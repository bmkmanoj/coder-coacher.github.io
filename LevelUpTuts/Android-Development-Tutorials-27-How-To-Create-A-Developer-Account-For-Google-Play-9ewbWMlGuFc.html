of Tut's and in this video we're going
to
count for Google Play so that we're able
to publish our applications on the
android market or as it's known now as
Google Play so if you go to
developer.android.com you will see a
screen that looks like this if you are
there any time around when I'm
publishing this video otherwise the
design layout may have changed
especially because Android 4.4 is
probably going to be really soon and I'm
sure some of this jelly bean stuff will
be out of here but from here you can see
that there's all sorts of great stuff
there's designing tips and stuff like
that UI stuff basically just tips to
make sure that your apps are functional
and look great for your users and then
under develop there's great API guides
great training tools all sorts of stuff
like that but what we're interested in
is under distribute and this is this
your apps on Google Play go to the
developers council so we're going to go
ahead and click this button and it's
going to ask you to sign up if you're
already signed into Google it's going to
give you a screen like this otherwise
it's going to ask you to sign in with
some sort of Gmail or Google Apps login
and so I'm already signed in it's got a
level of tuts
and I don't have an account with Google
Play yet on this account so I'm going to
go ahead and check this box to say I'm
gonna gree and basically you can read
their distribution agreement and there's
a lot of great info here just to
research exactly what you're getting
into when you sign up for the store
also keep in mind you're going to have
to pay 25 bucks 25 bucks it gets you a
developer's account on the Google Play
here and lets you publish all the apps
you can publish and stuff like that so
you're going to need to do that but it's
well worth it especially if you're
interested in making some money or just
distributing your apps in general $25 is
just a small price so let's click
continue to payment and I'm going to go
ahead and put in all my information here
I'm going to do this of course off
screen go ahead and do the same and I'll
meet up right after
so okay now that I've submitted my
payment information I can now finish
putting in my developer profile so my
developer name is going to be level up
tuts and my email address is going to be
I will just do Scott at level up let's
calm level up tuts comm is our website
and a phone number if I put my phone
number here but feel free I'm going to
block this out because I don't want a
whole bunch of people calling me and
then of course I'm not going to check
this emails because I get enough emails
from Google already but you are more
than welcome to so let's click continue
complete registration okay perfect it's
now told me my information is valid and
I'm ready to start publishing an app on
Google Play so this is where we're going
to end this video in the next video
we're going to publish our app from
eclipse we're going to create a version
of the app that is available and working
to go on to the Android Market and by
the end of these videos we're going to
have an app on the market that anyone
can go download and I'm going to paste
the link at the end of the video and you
can download it yourself although it
does say that the payments are going to
take 48 hours to process I can't
guarantee that I'm going to have the app
up in the Play Store tonight I guess to
look at but in the next couple days it
should be there and I'll make sure
everybody gets that link so as always
this is Scott with LevelUp tuts check
out the next video we're going to keep
going with this thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
