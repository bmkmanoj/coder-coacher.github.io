up Tut's and today I'm gonna talk to you
about something that you may have seen
around Magento and may not have been
quite sure of what it is
well what I'm talking about is the is
anchor under categories are under
catalog manage categories select a
category and then other display settings
you'll see this display mode CMS mode
and then this is anchor and you might be
wondering what it is you may have turned
it on save the page checked out your
category turned it off and see what it
did but maybe just don't necessarily
understand what it does is this actually
uh personally I don't understand the
naming convention however his anchor is
really just turning on the layered
navigation so this should say like used
layered navigation instead of is anchor
because that would probably just make
this a lot less confusing so really what
this does is it makes it so the customer
is no longer going to subcategories like
you were if this was turned off however
they're going to be filtering through
attributes to move lower into your
products and filter through them so I
have turned is anchor on for this
apparel category we go to apparel you
can see shop buy and here we have all
these different categories if you select
one what its gonna do is it's gonna
throw it up here and it's now filtered
and it only has hoodies since there's
only one hoodie it's showing just things
that are existing left now so you can
only filter right these other options if
we clear all it's gonna remove all of
the attributes and let's say we want
things that are dresses and now we want
only dresses that are above $100 okay
cool so this is exactly what it's gonna
be if you have the is anchor on this so
notice if we turn it off let's save this
and now what you're going to get when
you refresh the page you're not going to
have access to this layered navigation
you're just going to have access to the
subcategories in themselves so it's a
choice between drilling down through
subcategories or filtering your products
through attributes so this is what is
anchor is all about I hope that cleared
up some of the history and as always
this is Scott with LevelUp Tut's if you
have any questions or comments please
leave it come on the video or hit us up
at Twitter level of tuts thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
