about dot bind this now if you are
writing your react components in the
class component name extends component
then chances are you have run into the
fact that when you went from that they
react I create class syntax to this you
if you want it to be using this inside
of your methods here you'd be having
sort of an issue where you wouldn't have
access to this without using dot bind
this and your action calls with your on
click on submit that sort of thing for
instance in this application what this
is is this is a meteor and react
application the fact that it's meteor
shouldn't really matter much here but
simply what we're doing is we have a
form of two items that we're going to
vote on and when we submit this is going
to hit a function up top here add items
which is essentially going to grab the
values using this dot Refs
and then it's going to hit the server
right so what's the problem
with dot bind this I mean this works
right but how annoying is that to have
this extra line in here every single
time anytime you have any sort of action
you need that by this I find that to be
extremely annoying and you know other
people might say it's not annoying to
them or it's not a concern well if it's
not a concern to you in the terms of
having to type that dot by in this every
single time which just seems absurd to
me then you should at least be concerned
about the potential performance
potential performance issues still a
little bit of premature optimization if
you're not building a huge site this
this isn't necessarily a huge concern
but there are some very real performance
benefits from not using that by this in
fact every single time you're rendering
you're creating essentially a new
version of this function which like I
said is it could be premature
optimization but it's a performance
concerned nonetheless and it's one that
you should potentially be concerned
about especially if you can essentially
fix it for free
so let's fix it for free here and what
we're gonna be doing is adding a
decorator now you might be wondering
what a decorator is if you haven't used
one before a decorator is essentially a
function that's wrapping around your
class and the reason why it's cool is
that well it's not necessarily in es6
yet it's in the gs-7 proposal I believe
it's in the spec it's it's essentially
Specht out but it's not official yet but
there's plenty of people already using
decorators all over the place and this
little decorator can save you a bunch of
time and once you use this decorator
you're gonna see just how how nice and
convenient it is so what we want to do
is the first thing I should point out is
even though this is a meteor site all
you need is essentially a site that's
using babel if you are using any sort of
build tool whether it's gulp or or or
web pack or any of those as long as
you're using babel and you're able to
receive a babel our c file which is
essentially the babel configuration file
then you should be good to go on this
now this video is gonna be talking about
those aspects that cuz there's just
there's a lot of build tools i don't
want to necessarily cover them all but
what i will cover is essentially how you
can get this up and going first things
first we need two things
we need the babel plugin transform
decorators legacy that is big long
package name so i would recommend either
googling that or whatever babel plugin
transform decorators legacy and just
coming up and copying this because this
is a typo nightmare here somebody who
does typos quite frequently it's very
very real opportunity for you to mess
that up
so i'm using yarn in this project you
can use npm to install this and just add
yarn add babel plugin transform
decorators legacy that's added to our
project so what this does is it's
basically a plug-in for babel that
allows us to use decorators in our
project now you'll want to make sure you
read this documentation here for
instance if you're using other plugins
order of plugins matter it gives it a
little explanation about it not too much
it's a short read might as well know
what you're doing or what you're getting
into so like i said get this in
all of it via NPM or yarn or whatever
and the next thing we want to grab is
core decorator so you can head to NPM
and and look for core decorators now
core decorators includes a whole bunch
of stage 0 decorators aka the 2016 es 7
decorators you know basically you want
to read again read this stuff this is
another short read you don't have to
read all of the usage of all this stuff
but the one in particular we're going to
be using is for classes dot are at Auto
bind so if you click on this one it'll
send you down here I don't know why I
did it for me but should
and the what we're going to be using
here is really just this for classes
Auto bind right here
so no biggie there we want to make sure
we grab core decorators and that's
pretty easy we can see yarn add core
decorators and you might be wondering
why these are Auto completing for me
well I had actually just recorded this
video and there was no audio so I'm
having to do all this stuff over again
but really this core decorators but for
you it shouldn't make much of a
difference we just need to add babble
plug-in transform decorators legacy and
add yarn or add core decorators and we
should be good to go essentially what I
also want to do is I want to head to my
website and I want to change in babble
RC if you don't have a babble RC make
sure that your build tool is in fact
using adapt babble RC and if it's not
figure out essentially how it can be it
should be a quick google web cat you
know web pack babble RC whatever if
you're using meteor beauty of it all is
we don't have to do anything we just
have to create a new file bevel RC in
the root of our project you don't have
to do anything right just create this
bevel RC if you have the icon package in
atom or your texture you should see the
little babel logo that's a good way to
make sure you spell everything correctly
now if we come into this file it's
essentially just an open object with
plugins and then we have an array I'm
not using any other plugins for this
project so the only plug-in in here is
transform decorators legacy now this
text is really sort of the second half
of the package name it's like babble
plugins transform Decker's legacy so you
only need to write transform decorators
legacy keep that in mind and this is my
plugin so really your your dot babble RC
file if this is the only plugin you're
using should look like this
now let's go ahead and what I want to do
is I want to stop my build tool and
rerun it I'm just doing that so that it
it definitely sees the new babel RC file
this thing kind of thing can burn you
you you're wondering why it's not
recognizing your plugins I always just
start and stop your package man
takes a couple seconds you could see
mines up and running okay so here's the
site we're working on which is
essentially a real-time voting
application and before we could vote
pretty easily we just had like I said in
our our form here we're submitting what
this dot add items bind this and without
using this decorator probably removed up
buying this on our add items we're going
to get let's come here and say run first
swim let's add these items we're gonna
get big red error says we cannot read
property of undefined that undefined
that to referring to is where I'm using
this in this case this dot refs but it
could also be this that set state or
this not anything that you're using in
your component so we remove the dot bind
we added our auto decorator package how
do we actually use this decorator it's
simple it's very very simple all we need
to do is come up top here I'm going to
import this I'm an import Auto bind from
core decorators core - decorators keep
in mind this is just sort of a sub
module of core decorators there's a
whole bunch of other decorators you can
use I recommend checking them out
Auto bind is certainly my most used now
we can cut the top here above our class
and this is your first time ever using a
decorator you're gonna see why people
like them you know some people don't
like them but I like them a lot because
personally they make things a little bit
easier sometimes like this all we have
to do is type at Auto bind no semicolon
because it actually continues on into
this class and essentially this Auto
bind is going to wrap around our
component and it's going to eliminate
the need to ever write dot bind this
ever again so anytime you need to write
something that has a bind you just throw
this Auto bind on top of your component
after importing it having your babel set
up correctly and check it out i didn't
have to change anything keep in mind our
code right here for the onsubmit still
says this dot add items
so let's come down to our application
and we're gonna do run first swim once
again and it added it because I didn't
vote for dogs or cats let's vote for
this one you could now see run for swim
is here let's actually vote for run swim
okay
I click swim even though I'm not a great
swimmer here we can have let's say MIDI
verse audio hit enter you can see them
show up immediately so this is a
real-time voting app that we made for a
level of tutorials it's now using the
core decorator auto find and it's doing
so to make binding really easy I use out
of mine pretty much all over the place
there's a little performance benefit it
makes so you don't have to write
extraneous code which I hate and it's
easy to add so honestly it if you have
the ability to use it why not so that is
the autobahn decorator it's something I
highly recommend using if you are using
the component syntax the EES Tony
cignoli more es6 syntax I liked it
better when it was es6 but using that
syntax the classics app extends
component whatever syntax auto bind is a
really nice thing to have if you want to
learn how to build apps like this right
this is a real-time voting application
using react and meteor head over to
store doubt level up tutorials calm and
you can see it's right here on the
billboard the level 2 meteor 1.4 and
react this is the latest series as a
sort of an intermediate series I
actually do cover the auto bind
decorator in the series along with some
other really cool stuff if you're new to
meteor entirely it might be worth it to
pick up the meteor 1.4 react for
everyone to which is the beginner series
you pick these both up together for
under fifty bucks or you could become a
subscriber a level up pro subscriber and
get access to streaming or downloading
these right away at level up tutorials
calm or start out level up tutorials
calm its clicking this level up Pro
right here you want to build this this
type of content this sort of real-time
application voting app check out these
two series we'll be building this exact
app right here and you'll learn a lot
about meteor and a lot about react
even if you know very little about
either so thanks so much for watching as
always this is Scott and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
