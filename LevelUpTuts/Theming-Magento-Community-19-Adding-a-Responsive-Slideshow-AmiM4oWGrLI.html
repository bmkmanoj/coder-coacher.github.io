up tuts and today I'm gonna show you
have to add a responsive slider to our
Magento site here and it's gonna be
we're going to be using flex slider
- so head over to flex slider
woothemes.com right here and you could
download flex letter from here and we're
gonna be going over everything to make
this exact slideshow I'm actually going
to even be using these images because I
don't have images ready for this so
we're gonna go ahead and use these
images and get started so go ahead and
click download and we're gonna move from
there so in the last lesson you remember
how we added our j/s files via the
locals XML file we're gonna be doing
that some more however first we need to
get our J's file and our CSS file in to
our skin so we're going to put these in
skin I'm gonna put a flex letter that
CSS into CSS and the jQuery - min flux
letter this is just the minified version
of flex letter I'm gonna put this in my
J s like so and then we're going to go
to our local dot XML file okay so what
we're gonna do is we're going to copy
this one I'm actually gonna paste it in
here twice because we're gonna modify it
for the second time that we use it so
I'm gonna not delete that okay I'm gonna
paste this in here twice and the first
one we're gonna add an item it's gonna
be J s slash and then we're gonna use
the script file so this was jQuery flex
leather - Minjae s and now for the
second action we're not going to have
this be at item but we're gonna have it
be add CSS and we're gonna delete this
type right here and we're gonna change
name to stylesheet and we're gonna close
that one out again and this is going to
be the path to our CSS files so CSS
slash and then it was just flex letter
dot CSS now if we save this we should
see this be edit to our page let's
refresh and we can see we have our flex
slider CSS coming in
and we have our jQuery minified flex
slider and that's all good let's refresh
this page and see if we have any
JavaScript errors I think these are just
errors about not being able to find
these images and let's actually kill
most of these errors out right now I'm
going to go to my back-end and I went to
CMS pages and then we went to home page
and this home page demo came with a
whole bunch of stuff on it I'm actually
just gonna wipe all of this stuff out
all of it entirely and I'm gonna save
and continue to edit well I guess it
needs something so I'm just gonna write
hi and let's refresh this page and all
this stuff should be gone okay
so cool now it's only complaining in
that bad not being able to find it print
CSS I don't have to worry about that
right now and that's the thing I've
really super care about so let's import
our images and we're going to be doing
that through the editor here so we're
going to upload some files let's browse
for them going to grab these okay
I've seen this error and I don't know
why I've taken some time to research it
I couldn't find a really good answer but
I'm just seeing this on my own
Chrome but I heard that if you use
Firefox that it goes into no problems so
it shouldn't be a problem with the site
either way I want to open up Firefox
really quick just to do this if you're
having those same errors
check out Firefox but most likely you
won't even have those errors at all I'm
going to add our images here let's
browse some files let's grab the right
ones upload these things okay and let's
add them all
I'm actually going to go to the code
view so I don't have to be staring at
this giant image and let's continue
uploading the rest of the images well
since I already uploaded cool
so if we look at the demo for flex
slider I'm gonna throw it into sublime
text and we're gonna look at this and
really to get this flex slider going all
you have to have is it looks like a ul
with a div class flex letter and so all
we really need is a div wrapping that
says flex slider and then some new wells
and these images here I'm actually gonna
grab this code straight out of here just
so I know that I'm not doing anything
wrong so it just need this little bit
and we're gonna throw this into our
Magento site I'm like get out of here go
back to Firefox because that's working
and I'm gonna paste this in here and
where these other images are I'm gonna
go ahead and put these image tags from
the ones that we uploaded to our site
and then we're going to save this out
I'm gonna get rid of this first one
looks like one too many brilliant okay
now let's say this let's go to our page
I'm gonna go back to Chrome here cuz now
that we have this this all in let's
refresh the page we should see a bunch
of giant images and and we don't that's
because if we come in here the CSS is
already working at stuff but if we look
in this unordered list images are
definitely here the Java scripts just
not running so it's not going to be
doing anything so let's hook up that
javascript and get this thing going and
we'll be all set with our new flexible
slideshow gonna get rid of this logo
click thing that we had here from the
last lesson and instead of our document
I'm ready I'm gonna do dollar sign J and
we're going to use that flex slider
class that we have on that div and it's
going to dot flex slider and we're gonna
do use the method of flex slider here so
that flex slider and just like this
we're gonna have an animation set to
being slot and you can check out flex
lenders documentation to see what other
options you can pass it and stuff like
that but we're just gonna use this for
now real basic animation slide flex let
Eric make sure there's no typos great
no its refresh our Magento page and here
we have what looks like a slideshow
let's click these and it's a sure enough
slide showing well now let's check to
make sure that it is in fact responsive
with the rest of our site we keep going
down to mobile we still have a working
slideshow so this is great we have a now
big old slideshow in the front of our
page we can do a lot more with it all we
have to do to modify this code is to
stylize things with CSS or add more list
items or add things into these list
items but basically we have a nice
working responsive slider using flex
site or two in Magento
as always if you have any questions
please leave a come out of the video I
hid us a bit to our level up huts let us
know what you're thinking as always this
is Scott with level up huts and thanks
