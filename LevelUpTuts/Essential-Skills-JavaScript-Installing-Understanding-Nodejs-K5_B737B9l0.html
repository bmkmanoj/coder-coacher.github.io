to get set up with a node J s now this
could not be any easier but I did want
to take a video just to talk a little
bit about getting set up and what it
means so in modern web development we're
frequently using node.js for all sorts
of things
in fact the package manager NPM has now
become one of the largest ecosystems of
open-source libraries in the entire
world this means that if you're working
with JavaScript packages then NPM is
going to be the way that you interact
with these packages and therefore you
will need node installed even if you're
not writing server-side code with node
at all even so what we want to do here
is just how to node.js org and you can
see that we're greeted with a download
page now there's more technical ways to
download and install node.js but as you
can see here it's detected that I'm
using OSX or Mac OS and if you're on
Windows it's going to detect the same
thing because of that you're greeted
with an installer basically here's the
way to download for Mac OS and here is
the current release now recommends a
6-point 11.4 for most users however I
end up usually installing the current
release and at this time of recording
this video is at eight point seven so
you can go ahead and select your version
like I said before I'm going to go ahead
and select the latest version and it's
going to download a package installer
now on OS X or Mac OS you simply just
need to double click that installer on
Windows it's the same deal just a
different type of installer and it's
going to install Noda on your system I
already have node installed on my
computer so I'm not going to download
and run to the package installer but you
download the package you double click on
it it installs on your system and that's
that so go ahead and select your
download get that going install on the
package manager pause this video and
pick it up when you're done now let's
talk a little bit about what that gets
you well if you were to head
to your command line and I can just open
my terminal I use I term however for the
sake of this video I'm just going to
open the standard terminal on OS X and
you don't have to know the command line
for this video however I am going to be
making another fundamentals video on
just basic usage of the command line
it's something you're going to want to
learn and so we have our terminal here
and we can just type node - V this is
going to show that we've installed the
current version of node on our computer
so it's at a two point two point one
currently and if we were to simply type
node without the V here in hit enter
we'd actually have access to real
JavaScript so you could type console dot
log hi
and you could see its output hi now this
isn't necessarily super useful but if
you want to try out some code you can do
so in a node environment here now what
is node j/s well you could get a lot of
descriptions about the technical aspect
of what makes node node but the most
important part of understanding nodejs
is really just that it's JavaScript that
runs on the server and what that means
if you're not familiar with that
terminology is have you ever built a set
in WordPress or Drupal or any of these
systems well you have your front-end
code which is your HTML your CSS that
sort of stuff but you have your back-end
code as well which in WordPress or
Drupal is the PHP that codes run on the
server and generates the HTML that you
view when you visit a page now nodejs
allows you to use JavaScript on the
server at the same way you would with
PHP Python or Ruby now there's some
technical reasons why this is really
cool however personally the killer
feature for me is being able to write
the same language on your server side as
your client side as in you can write a
JavaScript in both places and you no
longer have to learn the idiosyncrasies
of two languages right you no longer
have to keep track of the weird things
about PHP and the weird things about
JavaScript just the weird things about
JavaScript
so this is how and why we would install
nodejs now keep in mind I mentioned
before we also now have access to the
package manager
NPM we can access that with NPM you can
even do NPM - V to see the current
version of NPM now I'm not going to talk
too much about downloading packages with
NPM right now but I will have another
foundational video that goes over all of
the different options and reasons why
you would use NPM as your package
manager and we'll even talked quite a
bit about package files and what's up
with the node modules folder so in 2017
here and getting into the future node
Jas is no longer just sort of a no too
skilled right you don't learn node.js
just to learn it having basic node
understanding especially with this
low-level stuff like NPM and getting an
installed and basic usage of JavaScript
here is going to be absolutely required
in the future for being a well rounded
developer so don't miss out and if
JavaScript scares you this stuff is not
too scary
you run a couple of commands and you are
good to go so in further essential
skills and JavaScript videos we are
going to be talking about the node
packages ecosystem I'm also going to be
going into various techniques for code
modules such as importing and exporting
and we'll be going into absolute
fundamental skills for JavaScript
these aren't your standard JavaScript
tutorials but more or less things you
need to know to be working in other
platforms so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials if you would
like premium content in terms of how to
build real life applications head to
level up tutorials dot-com forward slash
Pro and you can become a level of pro
get access to a whole bunch of premium
exclusive content that we're gonna show
you how to build both just client-side
applications as well as client and
server-side applications doing real time
stuff we're going to be building
Instagram clones we're going to be
building a movie databases all sorts of
cool stuff so check it out and thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
