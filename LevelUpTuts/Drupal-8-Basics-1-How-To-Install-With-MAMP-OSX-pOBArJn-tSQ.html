tutorials and in this video I'm gonna be
showing you how you can install Drupal 8
on your local host using MAMP
now this site is only going to be
accessed from your own personal computer
and it many times you want to develop on
a local machine to then move to an
actual production environment later so
in this video going to be installing
Drupal 8 on OS X using a vamp let's get
started right now so to get started we
want to drupal.org and install the
latest version of Drupal now at the time
of recording this video Drupal 8 dad 0.2
was released so we now have a Drupal 8
as an available option let's just go
ahead and come to downloaded and extend
at the top of the page where we can
download the latest version of Drupal
now there's a green button here we can
click download Drupal now that's going
to take us through the individual
project page this is the type of page
that you're going to find on any
particular module within a Drupal so we
have core 7 or core 8 now since this
video series is on Drupal 8 you're gonna
want to make sure you select Drupal core
8 now that once again is going to take
you to another page where you can
download different versions we have a
zipped version or you can have a tarde
easy version or you can even try a
hosted drupal demo now for this we're
going to be installing this on our local
machine and using MAMP on OS X so we're
going to be selecting this tar.gz now
keep in mind simply by installing this
on your localhost it's not going to be
available to anyone on the internet
however it is recommended that you
develop your website locally and move
those updates online rather than
developing your website online itself so
here we have a folder Drupal 8.0 - and
since we're using a MAMP which we have
open right here you'll want to make sure
that you've downloaded MAMP if not you
can head to mam plus website nanp and
download the free version of mam here
now when you download this what it gives
you is basically an application folder
if we come down here you'll see our
application map if we enter this folder
you'll see an htdocs folder now inside
of htdocs folder
maybe some documents but there shouldn't
be anything so now because there's some
hidden files in this Drupal folder that
we want to make sure that we grab by
default OSX is I'm going to show you
deep hidden files let's actually just
delete htdocs as a folder there's
nothing in there that you should need
now let's drag Drupal 8 into your mam
folder and let's rename this folder to
HT Docs like so so now our htdocs folder
should contain all of the Drupal
installation files that we need let's
head over to mam pier where we can start
our servers so let's just go ahead and
click start servers and from here that
automatically opens up this page now
let's go ahead and come to our
installation now to do that we just want
to go to my website so here we have this
link my website it's going to link you
to the localhost colon 8080 8 8 so I'm
gonna open that up in a new tab and as
you can see you should be seeing your
Drupal installation if you aren't seeing
this that means that your folder isn't
correctly named htdocs or it's not in
the correct location which is
applications MAMP and then htdocs inside
of that you should see for example
index.php that sort of stuff ok so now
that we have this ready let's go ahead
and start our installation process we're
going to choose english and right off
the bat you're already going to notice
that the drupal 8 installation looks a
lot better than Drupal 7 and that's
something that you might see repeated
throughout the experience in Drupal 8
let's go ahead and click standard for
our installation profile here we have
requirements you can see that we have
our requirements should be all good
there's this PHP opcode caching this is
is highly recommended for performance
reasons however since this was just a
quick install we don't need to worry
about that right now now it's saying
that we can continue anyway so let's can
click the continue button now it's
asking for us for our database
information we need a database name
username and password since we don't
actually have
this information it doesn't exist quite
yet let's go ahead and come to back to
our MAMP page here and let's come to
tools PHP myadmin
from here let's go ahead and create a
new database so we can select databases
and let's add a new database here simply
by just saying Drupal 8 so that's the
name of this database let's click create
and now under database configuration we
can just say Drupal 8 now if you're
creating a database somewhere else you
want to make sure you have a username
and password however with MAMP here MAMP
simply just has root and root for the
username and password so we can simply
just say so we can just simply say root
and then root now I'm going to click
Save and continue you should see that we
should be able to proceed just fine so
now that we have correctly entered
everything I'm gonna get rid of this
Chrome notification here but as you can
see Drupal 8 is installing and as long
as everything goes alright this
installation progress bar should reach
100 and we should be able to hit the
configure site options now that the
installation is configured we can select
a name for our site we'll just say
level up and this site email address can
be whatever email address you'd like now
keep in mind your site will send you
email so make sure that this is an email
that you're gonna want now for username
I'll just have it something like admin
password I'm going to make a password
it's going to be week you should not
have yours be week mine is going to be
very weak just for the ease of these
videos you should want to make sure that
your password follows all of the things
that make a strong password that it it
suggests here email address default
country I'm going to put in United
States and for timezone it looks like
it's set up through continent here in
Denver so I'll select Denver now we can
check notifications automatically now we
can set to check for updates
automatically or receive email
notifications I want to keep both of
those checks I'll click Save and
continue
at this point we should have a site once
this completes and just like that we've
been redirected to our page here it's
asking us if it wants to save our
password and Karim I'm gonna say no on
the side of this password memorized but
as you can see we have a welcome to
level up and we have our first Drupal 8
site installed awesome now as long as
you get to this point we'll continue
talking about Drupal 8 if you'd like to
see other methods of installation I'll
be covering those in other videos and
you can always come back to the next
video where we start to talk about the
admin the front-end and the backend
interface of Drupal so as always this is
