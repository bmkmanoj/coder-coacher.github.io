of tutorials and in this video we're
going to be covering offset and move in
the lost grid now we have covered pretty
much everything I wanted to go over in
the last grid so this was going to be
our last lost grid video for right now
however it's going to be a good one
we're going to show you the difference
between move and offset and how you can
position your columns exactly where you
want them to so let's get started right
now so to get started we're going to
just target the very first grid item and
we're going to do so by moving it over
so we can come in here and I'm going to
just say i want to say grid 1 and we
have this lost row we don't want this in
here grid 1 is now going to say lost
hyphen move now lost move is going to
show you exactly what's going on here we
can say we want us to move over well
since we're doing one fourth right now
we can say it will move it over
one-fourth however we're going to want
to target the very first child so we can
say div first hyphen child okay so now
with this grid one should be giving a
lost move of one-fourth so let's
actually come down here and see what
that compile to if we scroll down we can
see it gives the first child a position
of relative and then it moves it over
one-fourth positioned so you'll notice
when we head to our HTML page and
refresh you'll notice we no longer see
the first item now we don't see the
first item because it's actually being
hidden behind this second element here
via z-index right now but because of
we're moving in over one it's
essentially just moving it over one
whole space for instance if we were to
say the last item here instead of first
child we could say last child this might
be a little bit more obvious because
it's not going to be hidden anymore we
can come down here and refresh and now
we have one you can see that the tenth
item is actually is supposed to be
positioned for right here but because
it's at to possess
relative and being pushed over the left
we now have it over here now what's
interesting about this is it is
technically still in this left position
because it's positioned relative and
moved over with the left it's not
actually getting in the way of anything
here and if we were to add an 11th
element you would see something very
similar happened to what we saw when the
one went behind the two there would be
an 11 here and the 10 would be hit be
behind the 11 just for the index reason
now let's say we wanted to actually move
something over to the left rather than
to be right well it's nice and easy we
can actually just say negative 14 so
from here we can just add a hyphen
inside of here and wonder you're fresh
you can see it's moved over same column
same gutter everything it's just moved
over one column space to the left now
instead of to the right so this is lost
move lost move essentially moves your
elements left and right or up and down
based on their current position and it
moves them relatively over now what this
doesn't do is it doesn't shift the
entire grid or anything like that it's
essentially just moving them so if we
were to say something like first child
first child okay let's move first child
over one-fourth and let's copy this it's
pasted down here and let's go and say
and child we're going to say the second
child we're going to do so with
parenthesis instead of brackets are we
go sec second child and then we're going
to want to say negative one-fourth here
now if we come back to our page and
refresh you'll see something really
interesting we now have two and then one
but if we come to our dumb what's really
nice is that it's still in the order of
positions here we have one and then two
however displayed wise they're shown two
and then one so what's cool about that
is you can have like a left sidebar here
and then a main content area
and let's say your main content area can
be pushed over the fraction at which it
is and the left sidebar can be negative
pushed over and that way they can still
maintain their order and the dumb of
importance that way your main content
area is coming before here a side
content area it's things like that just
so that the DOM is structured the way
that your information is important ok
cool so let's move but let's actually
try these same examples with offset
instead and I'm going to go ahead and
get rid of this and child move and the
first tab we're going to lost offset by
one fourth now lost offset provides a
margin right you'll notice the last ones
done via position else has done via
margin right so what might you think
would happen here if we refresh you can
see things get a little crazy so it's
essentially just adding one grids worth
of margin to the right here so now this
isn't something that you're going to
want to do with the type of grid that
has this sort of row column situation
here you can see it's sort of messing
everything up it still sees number four
is the fourth element here and since the
cycle is on the fourth it's going to go
ahead and cause some issues here by
getting rid of the margin right here now
what happens if we throw a negative
one-fourth on here it's going to be
fairly similar except so as you can see
lost offset is pushing things over and
lost move is using position and relative
to sort of make sure that they don't
affect the rest of the grid so offset is
affecting the rest of the grid items and
move is not so with these two properties
we've lost you can really put your grid
items anywhere that you want based on
the type of grid you're working with
they're trying to build so as always
this is scott what level of tutorials if
you have any questions or comments if
you come in the video hit me up at
twitter or facebook at level up
tutorials i love to hear from you thanks
for watching and I'll see in the next
one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
