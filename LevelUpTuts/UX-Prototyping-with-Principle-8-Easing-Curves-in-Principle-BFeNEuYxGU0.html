up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be showing you easing curves
within principle I'm gonna be talking a
little bit about what exactly an easing
curve does I'm also going to be talking
about how you can create your own custom
ones as well as use the built-in
amazing easing functions directly in
principle so let's get going on that
right now okay so in the last video we
talked a bunch about the animation
timeline here and we were able to tweak
our animation in different ways let's go
ahead and check out easing snow I'm
gonna move this keyframe back to the 1
second or the 0.3 seconds and now what
we can do is we can actually click on
this default and what this is going to
do is open up our easing now you might
be wondering well what's up with this
easing now we have this graph here and
for somebody who doesn't maybe know
exactly what's going on in this graph it
might be a little bit confusing so I'm
just going to mention that what we have
here is we have an animation essentially
over time so as we go from right to left
that's the time and as we go up and down
that's sort of the process of the
animation so at the very beginning we're
at 0 0
there's no time is passed and none of
the animation is passed with this
default easing it comes up and in the
initial part of the animation quite a
bit happens right you can see the rate
at which the animation is happening is
greater than what would just be a flat
linear line now as this goes up the
animation starts to slow down and then
it slows into its final position so when
we click this it might not be entirely
obvious but the animation goes bit
slower towards the end of it no this
isn't a dramatic easing curve now I want
to affect all of these at once if I'm
going to change it so
click and drag all of these then select
the easing now you'll notice when we
select ease in what this means is
essentially you're easing into the
animation its fastest point is going to
be towards the end however the fastest
point even with this is still just
barely above linear a linear animation
here as you can see is just this
straight line now you'll most never want
to use linear animations it just feels
entirely unnatural that's why there's
this little frowny emoji next to it
because it exists but I can't imagine a
situation where I would really want to
do that and if you get into animating
for the web with CSS and stuff like that
learning about it using this is gonna be
really nice because what you're gonna do
is you're gonna be able to actually
enter your own easing curves with these
values so if we select ease in you'll
notice that we have this very basic ease
in if we want to check this out let's
see that again you can see it starts off
slower than it ends it slowly speeds up
over time and you know what these are
gonna be easier to see if we do extend
this so let's go ahead and extend this
time to one second
and let's go ahead and see this again
okay so you can see it just barely
starts off slower and then gets faster
let's go ahead and check that out in a
modified version what we can do is
actually grab this little handle here
and we can drag it to the right and what
you'll notice with this particular
animation and if we drag it further and
further right what you'll notice is that
this is still an easing you're easing in
and then it's really speeding up so this
time what we're going to see is a
dramatic slow to big slow to big cool
now let's go ahead and check out the
ease out is literally the exact same
thing except for reversed the start is
linear and then as we go it gets slower
so let's pull this here and as you can
see it's gonna go really fast in the
start and then slow down so really fast
slow down now some of the principles of
animation is that when you have an
object that's entering the screen it
should be at its fastest point when it's
entering the screen and then with it's
leaving the screen it should be at its
fastest point when it's leaving the
screen so if you're having a block fly
on right from out of screen on the
screen you're going to want to use an
ease out because the ease out is going
to slow it down at the end and as
fastest point is going to be when it
arrives again if you're taking a block
and you're throwing it out of your
canvas you're gonna be using an ease in
so it's almost opposite right if
something's animating out you're gonna
use an ease in if something's animating
in you're gonna use an ease out it's
important to visualize these curves now
if we select ease both you'll notice we
get what is essentially an s-curve if we
modify this it's gonna be slow at the
start and at the end but in the middle
it's gonna be really fast now this is a
more useful type of easing if you're
doing something like this where the
object is always on the screen and it
fits the sort of style or feel that
you're going for a lot of times with
easing patterns you're looking to
replicate some sort of physics based
animation now lastly we have spring and
you'll notice spring is totally
different in this case because a spring
isn't using a linear curve like this
it's using what is essentially a tension
and a friction now that's interesting
because you still could do a spring in a
bounce with a a with a more complex
easing curve but principle has taken a
bit of a way that the weight of the iOS
or you're defining animations and native
where you're saying hey there's a
tension and a friction okay so let's go
ahead and check some of the stuff out we
have like a 20 friction and we select
this and you see it bounces up like
crazy let's go ahead and
modify them in greatly increased the
friction and one thing you'll notice
with this line here is as this goes this
is the bounce essentially of the
animation so if we increase this
friction we're gonna have way less
bounce but if we decrease this to the
point of something like this this is
gonna be sort of bananas right that's
just freaking out
that's essentially what the animation is
doing so if we let's bump this back up
something more practical and see that's
like a pretty solid balance it's still
going a few times and if we decrease the
tension right now which is sky high
right this is a large tension then we're
gonna get a little bit smoother of
affair so there we go now it's coming in
it just bounces a couple of times so the
spring animation is definitely gonna be
one that's going to be sort of trial and
error you're gonna want to play with the
values and see what works for you but as
you can imagine tension is sort of how
much pent-up energy this thing has and
in friction is gonna be the amount of
resistance so these are easing curves
you have access to change the easing
curve on every single property of every
single animation you're doing both
individually or you can do it as a group
if we want to only bounce let's go ahead
and only bounce the let's do the height
so we can have a spring on the height
and now only the height is going to
bounce so as you can see again just like
we had before you have total control
over your animations using both easing
and timing functions so as always this
is Scott Wood level up tutorials if you
want to help support the creation of
these free tutorials had to store that
level up tutorials calm and you can
purchase this series gaining access to
extra videos where I show you how to
recreate some of my favorite principle
documents so as always this is Scott
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
