of huts and today we're gonna show you
how to compress your images
automatically engulfed by building a
compressed task that you can maybe just
run once or maybe run every time that
you get new images or maybe you're using
images a lot and you want to have this
running all the time so we're gonna show
you how you can compress and remove
metadata from your images using gulp
so what we need to do is first get the
image min package for gulp and the one
we're gonna be using is gulp image min
i'll leave the package and this page in
the description for you and what you
could do is just go ahead and copy this
npm install command directly and we're
just going to install this the same way
we've install everything else i of
course have to use sudo because of my
environment but you can try it without
sudo first if you get permissions errors
then go ahead and use sudo so i'm going
to head in installing this gulp image
min okay so we now have gulp image min
now what we can do is add this to our go
file the same way we have before by just
requiring it and we're gonna require
this as just image min equals require
and then it's out of here gulp image min
just like that now let's go ahead and
make a new task I'm just going to make
it right here under our Styles task and
this is going to be our image task and
what it's going to do is it's just going
to compress great so now we need to give
it a name it's just going to be image
and we're going to be looking at the
source know the source is just going to
be directly in our IMG folder our image
folder so we can just say IMG and then
the type of files we're looking for is
anything in our images folder we're just
going to assume if it's in our images
folder it's an image now let's go ahead
and get rid of this stuff in here be
because obviously it's s related and now
let's go ahead and just period pipe and
then inside of here we can just run the
image min function just like that and
now after that we can pipe in a
destination so just like we have before
we're going to inside of the pipe we're
going to do
gulp period test and in the parenthesis
now we're going to put in the
destination the folder that I want these
to show up is going to be in build and
then /img so just like that this is
where we want them to end up and then
we're gonna finish it off at the
semicolon cool so that that works let's
go ahead and just run this task actually
better yet let's go ahead and throw an
image into this image folder it looks
like I just have that SVG in there now
so we might want to have at least
another image in there that we can see
this in action and I'll grab some images
of different types we have this image of
sketch app okay that's a PNG and then
I'll grab a jpg as well just so we can
see multiple file types in action okay
so I now have several different file
types in the air I have a ping I have an
SVG and the ping is 127 kilobytes the
SVG is one kilobyte and this is a big
image it's a wallpaper it's giant
it's 1.6 megabytes so we're gonna see
how this image compression effects all
of these images so let's go ahead and
run our gulp image task so we're just
type gulp space image enter and it looks
like after 5 milliseconds it has
completed our task now if we open up our
build folder you'll see we have an image
folder and you can see we have our home
here our logo dot SVG and our wallpaper
let's go and see what these sizes ended
up being you'll notice that even this
SVG the white space has been removed
that's pretty cool
so let's come and go too so let's check
it out it looks like our wallpaper
started at a 1.6 it is now
a size of 1.4 so that's point two
megabytes has been removed our local
data SVG is now only 589 bytes which is
awesome it used to be one kilobyte so
it's it's pretty much half that and then
we have this home hero which was 127
kilobytes and is still 127 kilobytes
it's very possible that that image had
already been compressed I did pull it
from their website so most likely they
have compressed it let's go into the
head and see if I can find an image I
know has not been compressed here's a
screenshot that I've taken for my
computer so this one I know will not be
compressed already we can say it's an
image here we go this screenshot starts
out at 260 kilobytes will once again run
that task this time it took just one
millisecond longer and let's check this
out so let's go to our build and instead
of two 60 kilobytes this image is now
189 kilobytes so you can see that's a
considerable difference so compressing
and optimizing your images couldn't be
any easier you write this task once and
then every single time you add a new
image to your folder you can have it
compress it and if you wanted to you
could just have the destination be your
image folder like so now when I run our
task
gulp image it's actually just
overwriting the current images so no we
don't have this extra build folder but
inside we have our image folder and
you'll notice that our compressed images
are now living exactly where they were
before so this is excellent
we've now just thrown this task in and
anytime after we've added images or
anything like that I mean you could set
up a watch task to watch for images to
be added and then run this I mean the
possibilities are really just at your
command because that's really what gulp
is all about so check it out
compress your images get those things
smaller and smaller because that's going
to make your page load faster a hundred
kilobytes is a hundred kilobytes that
you don't have to load so check it out
gulp image min and that's how you
compress your images with gold you can
