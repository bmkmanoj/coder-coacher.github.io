now we're going to continue the video
from the previous video where we are
getting used to and an introduction to
functions that PHP in this video we're
going to be writing our first function
we're going to be writing our first hook
and we're going to be in queueing a
script so let's get started what we want
to do first for this video is we want to
what's called in QA script and in
queueing a script is basically adding
some JavaScript to be loaded dynamically
into our site so let's go ahead and the
first thing we need to do is write a
function and now keep in mind that this
function is not called until we call it
a function is really like an action
that's just sort of waiting to be done
and then when we call the function
that's going to run and do everything we
want it to do so the function to do that
we want to type function just like that
and you'll notice that because I'm
sublime thinks this is a PHP file I have
nice syntax highlighting okay
and now we want to give this a name now
for this functions name you give it your
theme name so we can say 2014 underscore
a child underscore script now this
function name isn't really that
important and I say that as in if you
make this function name something
totally different than this it's still
it still can work so nothing
specifically is looking for this this
this but what this does is it's a
convention that you should definitely
absolutely follow so that anybody coming
into your site understands what's going
on so and also this 2014 underscored
child basically is making sure that this
function is not going to exist anywhere
else in your program so you're not
accidentally perhaps breaking anything
so definitely follow that child name or
your theme name and then underscore
scripts for this particular function
because what we're doing is adding
scripts now we need some curly brackets
and inside of here
we're going to be using a function
that's predefined for us called WP
underscore n well en queu e so in Q and
then underscore script so this is a
function that already exists you can
read about it in the WordPress codex
simply by googling WP underscore and Q
underscore script and we need to pass it
an argument so inside of some
parentheses we need to give it the name
of the script and this can just be um
extra J s right so this is nothing in
particular maybe if you're using a
plug-in this could be the plugins name
it's it's not super important here and
then we can say comma and now you want
to have the location of the script so to
get our themes location we're going to
use another function called get
underscore template underscore directory
so uh and then we need to tie underscore
URL and then parentheses so get template
directory URL is going to do exactly
what it says it's going to get the
templates directory and the path to it
so that would be the our WordPress
content themes 2014 child um and then
we're going to have a dot a period
because what the period does is it adds
this to and it's going to add this to a
path that we're going to say exists
within our theme now this doesn't exist
yet so let's create
it under 2014 child I'm going to right
click and say new folder type Jas as the
folder name and now we have a folder for
our JavaScript now I'm going to have a
new file in here and this is just going
to be called extra J s an extra dot J s
is just simply going to alert a yo just
like that all it's going to do is when
this loads it's just going to send an
alert ok so now we need to give it that
path remember this is the templates
directory now we can say /j s slash
extra dot J s and we can save this okay
notice how this is in quotes here it
could be single or double quotes the
singular double quotes just mean that
it's a string this concatenate or adds
to this path in front of it and so this
is going to be one long URL that points
directly to the file we just created now
we just need to end this line with a
semicolon and we can save this ok so we
have our function our function when it
runs it's going to load up this script
and like I said before if we come to our
website we refresh and let's check out
the source if I search for eggs extra
Jas it's not going to be here and that's
because of a few problems one of which
is we haven't actually called this
function so therefore it's not even
running therefore it's not going to even
in queue our script we also are using a
wrong function somewhere and so in the
next video
we are going to add a hook so that we
can run this function and then we're
going to be using the Codex the
WordPress codex to find out what
function we should be using and how to
correctly spell that function
and what exactly it does so as always
this is Scott with level up Tut's you
can reach us at Facebook or Twitter or
on the level up forum pretty much
anywhere so check it out in the next
video we're going to continue this up
and finish this out and by the end of it
we're going to have a working function
so thanks for watching and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
