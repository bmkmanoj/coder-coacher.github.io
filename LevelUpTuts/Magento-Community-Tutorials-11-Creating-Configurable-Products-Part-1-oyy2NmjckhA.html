level of Tut's and today I'm going to
show you how to create a configurable
product using Magento so in the last
lesson we created a simple product here
it is my product we go back to it it's
the format of MOV and here's one
tutorial well let's say you had the same
tutorial but you were offering it in
several different formats this might
come in handy let's say if you had
t-shirts right and you had different
sizes small medium large or even
different colors and let's say you
wanted those all to show up on one
product and then you want to like a
drop-down to be able to select that
option I mean that comes particularly
handy with sizes in particular so let's
check this out let's see how we can do
it if you call them the last time we
went to manage products and then we
clicked crab new product and there was
an option for a configurable product
well looks like this let's select
tutorials and let's see what happens it
actually is going to come up with an
error it says um the attribute set does
not have an attribute which can be used
for a configurable product well that's
because we didn't set up our attribute
type and our attribute to say that it
could be used as a configurable product
it says here it needs to be set to input
type drop-down scope global and
configurable product yes so let's go
back to attributes manage attributes
let's find our format okay so input type
drop-down perfect okay and let's see
scope is set to it needed to be set to
global so now it's up to global if
you'll notice we have a couple more
options used to create a configurable
product yes
okay so let's save this and let's go
back and let's try to add a configurable
product now manage products add product
okay and let's go to tutorials for our
attribute set configurable product
continue okay so here it's saying which
configurable attribute do you want this
to use and if you
more let's say you had color size and
you only wanted to use one of those you
would just check them so each one you
want to use to check it we just have
this format so we'll check it click
continue ok here we can fill in our
information just like before so let's
say new Tut - I'm actually just going to
copy this and put it almost everywhere
this will just be a series of ones
status enabled tax class none URL key
like I said before gets generated
visibility we want this product to be
shown up in our catalog and search ok
and all the stuff we're just going to
fill in the required things we're going
to say this one's $10 ok nothing else
required here again meta information
it's not required but might as well just
throw this in here ok and now let's
upload another image I'm just going to
take another screenshot just something
different let's browse let's grab it ok
upload ok I'm going to set this to be
the same image for all of these and
actually let's upload another image I'm
just going to take another screenshot
here that's something completely
different and this way you can see what
happens when you have multiple images
here and this one I'm not going to have
it selected to be anything it's just
going to be the second image description
let's ask them for something so I got to
give it something designed we're not
having a custom design none of this gift
message stuff manage stock and ok so if
you remember last time we had to put in
helmet how many items were in here
because this configurable product that
we're creating right now isn't the
actual product that somebody's going to
purchase it's sort of different how
these configurable products work you
must create this shell which is your
configurable product and then you create
smaller simple products that get grouped
under this and that's where you're going
to manage the stock so which makes sense
because you wouldn't have the same
amount of stock for small medium large
it's all going to be determined
separately so you can think of this it's
just sort of the general
Rochelle here so we're going to select
in stock and then we're going to have
this be in the main store categories
we're going to have this being tutorials
Magento tutorials and then I'm sure
we'll throw some of these in here too
doesn't matter just for fun
okay custom options and then assorted
product or associated products so
associated products is where we're going
to associate our simple products that
are going to show up here so let's just
click Save this isn't required but as
you can see if we save this we have our
new Tut it's enabled and everything's
good and like we said we told them to
show up in tutorials and we rush it
doesn't show up let's say we check
Magento tutorials we show up it doesn't
show up either so this is because we
have not created the individual products
yet okay well that's how you create a
configurable product in the next lesson
I'm going to show you how to create the
simple products that gets associated
with this configurable product once
again this is Scott with level up tuts
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
