Tut's and today we're going to get into
some string interpolation some black
strings and some block comments then to
the last lesson i mentioned that we'd be
getting into splats however i had
forgotten that we haven't even got over
you know going up do like a for loop or
anything like that so we're going to
hold off on splats for a couple more
lessons and i'm going to show you some
stuff first okay so string interpolation
is actually really handy it's a thing
that I really like about CoffeeScript
and it's just a really quick little time
saver okay so if you recall whenever
you're let's say let's do this give it
an example here so let's say you had a
variable and its name is name so here's
your name Scott okay right up top here
your name can be different whatever
let's say you want to alert this let's
do alert and then just like we would
normally do an alert you could put
quotes here and you could say and java
script you would write my name is in the
new space space plus and then the
variable name which is named so that's
how you typically write this note alert
my name is Scott however what's really
great about CoffeeScript is you don't
have to get out of your quote here to
print this name character or this name
variable so to do that all you have to
do is do pound bracket and then the
variable name so in this case name and
then bracket so now when CoffeeScript
sees this it's going to know to write
fill this in with the variable name so
let's save this and see what happens if
we come over here you can see it's
actually I wrote exactly what I just had
alert my name is plus name well that's
really great what if you could say let's
do this and my age is and I mean we
could just put an h right we could do
age but let's do something a little bit
more fun okay since I'm 26 we actually
just want to say let's do um 20 + 66
okay so what this is actually going to
do is instead of finding this variable
here it's actually going to do this math
for us and otherwise if you were doing
Matthew would have to do the same thing
unquote and then well of course we'll
see the results once we save this okay
you can see it's now my name is name and
my ages and then it's going to do it's
going to concatenate this 20 plus six
and it's going to add it onto the end
there so this is string interpolation I
find it extremely useful you never have
to get out of your quotes here to
declare your variables inside of your
strings I just found that saves a lot of
time another thing you can do is you
could do multiple line strings okay so
you could just do hello and then hello
can be equal to and then you could just
start typing hi hi hi hi and you can
enter you know I've just filling this up
enter or whatever and if we save this
see what it saves it as it puts it all
into one line for us so this way you can
maybe write your code so it's a little
bit more like how it's being output in
your content or something if that helps
you organize it a certain way if you
have paragraphs maybe I'll break it up a
little bit instead of having just one
really long line and having to have your
text editor do word wrapping or
something and you can also do block
strings so that you don't have to worry
about escape quotes or anything like
that so let's try this out if we have
this here let's actually delete all
these and we're going to do is we're
going to do three quotes there were
negative enter and then tab over and
then in here we're going to write some
HTML we're going to do H 1 and then
hello this is the H one that's going to
be inside of these h1 tags and then
outside here we're going to just do
three quotes again we'll save this and
we'll see what this did now as you can
see this escaped our quotes here and we
have hello that's awesome cool it's all
good okay so let's do one more thing
let's do a block comment okay actually
just notice I didn't have the code
coloring on so I just turned it on but
so the next thing we're going to do is
commenting and just like it in
JavaScript you can comment your code
CoffeeScript has a little bit different
way of commenting your code you're going
to do with the pound sign so if you use
the pound it's going to come
your code out one thing you can do is
you could do a block comment so if we do
a pound sorry if we do three pounds and
then it enter anything we right in here
is going to be commented out okay and
you can even write a bunch of lines okay
and then that we can do three more
pounds and we're right back with our
coffee script okay well that's string
interpolation and some black quote and
some black strings it's just some tools
to have in your tool belt to make your
coffee script even more efficient and I
mean just look at this line compared to
this line over here I mean it's a lot
easier to write and a lot more clean i
believe so if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment on the
video hit us up at twitter level up
Todd's let us know what you're thinking
once again this is scott with level of
Tut's and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
