sure but it's gonna be a really good one
now one thing we haven't talked about in
this at all is a stateless functional
component now these our since react
version 14 have been good to go now we
want to make sure if you haven't updated
your project yet make sure your package
that JSON looks like this if not there
is a video in this series about getting
our package and everything up to version
15 now what's cool about stateless
functional components is basically these
things are going to have no state and
they're going to be almost pretty
shallow as far as components go but
they're gonna offer us a lot of
performance improvements in the future
so the coolest thing about these
stateless components are so people have
called them pure or dumb components is
is that really they're react agnostic
right so the perfect example would be
this contact item all were doing is
outputting a list item with this type
props a contact name and this type props
that contact phone we're not doing
anything and a lot of this markup seems
really extraneous and unnecessary so
what's cool about these is like I said
in the future they're gonna be offering
a ton of performance enhancements but
right now if you were to use JSX and
another thing that wasn't react your
pure components would work so let's go
ahead and change this contact dot j s to
be a pure or a functional stainless
component okay let's go ahead and the
first thing we want to do is let's
modify this so class no longer will be
here in fact neither will extends react
component okay
let's just get rid of everything leave
contact here and now contact is going to
become a Const or a constant variable
and it's going to be equal to and we can
equal to a function here now this
function is just going to be an arrow
function
now what we don't need in here anymore
is we don't need a render and we don't
even need a return because we're not
doing anything else so let's go ahead
and get rid of all this stuff check this
out I mean we just vanquished a ton of
lines of this project I'm gonna get my
indentation correct here and as you can
see we now have a constant contact
that's equal to an arrow function we're
all we're doing is outputting a list
item with the step props so if I save
this let's see if this actually works
I'm gonna tell you right now it's not
but as you can see we carried props of
undefined so how do we get props in here
well this is where we want to pass some
things into this arrow function this is
going to be so cool we're going to say
these brackets here and now we have
access to all of our props now we can do
so easily by just saying contact like
this now if you followed along in the
meteor and react for everyone series if
you did that one then you would have
seen us using these pure dumb components
as layouts and while they weren't
necessarily and now they weren't totally
explained as such this is the
explanation to why you would use this
syntax now we have access to contact as
simply as contact and we don't need this
dot props and we don't need this props
so let's save this and we can use
contact name contact dot phone so let's
head back here and refresh and as you
could see Lucy moon can be added no
problem everything's working the exact
same way it was a minute ago so let's go
ahead and add a new prop here which
would just be will just say item will
just say item now item this is just
gonna be equal to a string of hello this
is totally stupid example but I want to
show you how you can add more than one
prop in here so how do we output hello
in here or the
string which was item we can head to up
here in our object and we could say
comma item like this and if all went
well if we refresh this you should see
we're not getting any errors just yet
so we can now come down here and simply
just say item now item should exist as
the string of hello and as you can see
we have hello showing up every single
time so that's how you pass in more than
one prop into this stateless functional
component so what's great about these
little components here is that we could
have had this component this whole
constant contact here let's go ahead we
could have had this in the same file as
the contacts list like just down here
and then we wouldn't have had to export
and import it if it wasn't something
that was going to show up anywhere else
and you can have this sort of concept of
these micro components these really
small components that don't necessarily
do a whole lot but it explains a little
bit more about what it's about so we
have a contact item or something down
here so this is something that you're
going to feel out a little bit as you go
and really at the end of the day the
more components that you can have that
our our function our functional and
stateless then really the better because
obviously having them be react agnostic
is something that's pretty sweet
for the future of your application if
you ever need to move to another
platform but really the performance
benefits that you're going to gain at
later versions of react are going to be
really nice so obviously any time you
can have a stateless functional
component go ahead and do so awesome so
as always this is Scotland level up
tutorial so if have any questions or
comments about this please hit me up on
Twitter Facebook or leave a comment
pretty much anything
and if you like react head over to store
dot level up tutorials comm and check
out the next level react native series
for iOS and Android
it's a premium video series it's nearly
nine hours long of look pretty much
everything you need to know to get
started building real native
applications using just react
awesome thanks so much for watching and
I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
