of tutorials and in this video we are
going to be taking at those items that
we just put in our menu and we're going
to be adding some visual touches to the
web application to make it a little bit
more usable in that regard but we're
also going to be creating our menu page
itself where we can filter and only show
the items that are explicitly stated to
be in the menu so let's get going on
that right now okay so in the last video
we had this toggle menu working it now
says true or false but what we're not
doing is sort of letting the user know
that something's being added to the menu
and we have these two buttons here and
we don't actually have anything showing
up in our menu because there is no path
for menu okay so let's come here first
and let's work on the individual recipe
and what we're gonna do is simply add a
class that basically lets you know when
something is in the menu or not now
because we're working with billions with
this in menu value this should be really
easy what we can do is come to our
recipe HTML and in our class where we
have a recipe here we can also add in
just some brackets here in an if
statement we can say if in the menu then
we want the class of in - menu this is
so easy so very easy and now we can say
if okay so now basically whenever this
value is set to true this class in menu
is going to be here now if you pull up
your stylus or CSS we can scroll down
here and we can find in menu I'm just
gonna search for it in - menu you could
see recipe and menu now has background a
teal and the color of white and nh3 now
what's interesting here is I had this
add to menu and remove from menu class
and they were sort of extraneous so now
what we want to do is actually use the
BTN primary
in BTM deny now this is only going to
work because we have no other buttons
within this you wouldn't want to go
adding BT and primary buttons all over
this place right now especially because
we're showing and hiding them so you can
go ahead and change this remove from
menu - BTN deny now again we'll also
need to change this if you scroll up the
remove from menu right here needs to be
BTN deny display:none so by default the
deny button is going to be displayed
none and the BTN primary is going to be
displayed block now when we have in menu
we're going to have a display block and
a display:none
so with that done we should be able to
come in here and our items that are in
the menu of course are teal here if we
click remove from menu they're gone
now one more thing I need to do is
because we're displaying block here
let's go ahead and just say BTN primary
display block here as well just so that
they're both display block instead of
inline block whenever they're being
shown and now this is going to refresh
our page and you will see we have our
add to menu we click it it now says
remove from menu and they're separate
buttons like so when it's added to our
menu we have this teal color letting us
know that it is in effect selected into
the menu okay so we now have this
ability this is a bit better we have a
visual indicator we have the buttons
correctly working as expected now let's
go ahead and actually create our menu to
do so let's first head to routing and we
can simply just add a new route here so
I'm gonna head to my routes and down
here at the bottom I'm going to add a
new route which is just going to be menu
and so we can say flow router dot route
and we can pass this in forward slash
menu now we're going to go ahead and
have a calm
now we can have a bracket just like
we've had before okay so this should all
be looking very familiar at this point
and we can give this a name of simply
just menu
we never comma now we need an action my
reaction could be defined like this with
parentheses immediately after it and
then brackets like so now we can simply
just tell blaze layout to render and
then what we're going to want to be
rendering is the main layout and we're
going to be one two rendering inside of
the main section of that we can say main
colon and then we're gonna want to add
our new template in here which is going
to be menu now this template doesn't
exist yet so we won't be finding
anything if we browse to this URL so
let's go ahead and actually create a new
one I'm just going to inside of the
client directory new file save this as
menu dot HTML template and we have a new
template with a name of menu okay
now inside of menu we're gonna be
wanting an h1 with a class of page -
title and this is going to be my current
menu okay and we're going to want to be
returning menu items at some point
however we don't need to actually be
doing anything just yet we just want to
make sure this routes working so let's
head back to our page here
when we select menu you see my current
menu okay so now I'm gonna be needing to
make a new menu dot jas file but first
I'm gonna essentially gonna copy this
stuff from recipes digest this is gonna
come in handy in a second so we in the
inside of our client here we can do a
new file and we can have a B menu dot J
s I'm gonna just paste this stuff in
here now what we can say is on template
menu on created we want to subscribe to
recipes and in addition we want our menu
helpers we want this to be able to grab
the recipes here and we want them to
essentially iterate over this however we
only want to find the recipes with an in
menu value of true so we want these
recipes to be returned right we want to
find our recipes but we can find it the
only ones we want the in menu one simply
by saying in menu : true so with this
statement the recipes that are going to
be returned to us inside of this cursor
here are going to be the in menu items
so let's head to our menu dot HTML and
now we can iterate over those menu items
so we can simply say bracket bracket
each and then it's going to be recipes
each recipes and close this each off /e
CH sometimes auto-completion is a little
bit of a pain here but inside of here we
can simply just say name and instead of
a P tag
we can say desk for description here I'm
actually going to be putting this name
inside of an h3 so it looks out right
here looks a little bit better now okay
and we now should be able to see the
items that are in our menu currently
listed so we can see we have fish tacos
and tuna and fortunately I made the
descriptions almost the exact same as
the title so it almost looks like these
are two separate things but as you can
see we have our current page here now
let's check this out when I close this
I'm going to open this up over here
let's make a new window with this same
page
okay now let's go ahead and watch this
current menu as we add an item to it
we're gonna add the salad boom it shows
up boom there it is man and this is just
meteor out of the box right so we didn't
really have to do anything to get this
real-time stuff going that's really my
favorite part about meteor is it just
makes these really nice little real-time
things just simply simply easy okay so
we now have the ability to add things to
our current menu our current menus being
populated you can see it here our recipe
book is working this could be looking
better and we need our shopping list so
in the next few videos we are going to
be just improving and iterating upon
this we're gonna be building on a menu
item template we're going to be building
out our shopping list page and then
we're gonna be talking a little bit
about performance and subscriptions and
things like that to make sure we're only
subscribing to the data we need so this
