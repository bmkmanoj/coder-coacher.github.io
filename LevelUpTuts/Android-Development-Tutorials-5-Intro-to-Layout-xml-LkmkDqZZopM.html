of Tubbs and today we're going to
continue our Android tutorials by going
into this activity main.xml file we've
been in here already however it's just
been in the graphical layout view you
can also see it as the XML file itself
and this might be really helpful
especially to those of you who are
familiar with the XML so if we click on
this right down here at this activity
main.xml it's going to open up this file
like any other text file you'd be used
to and just like any other XML file you
see opening tags closing tags and just
general XML stuff however inside of here
you're also getting these Android
attributes here this Android colon and
then ID equals and then you're giving
this an ID so this and I act plus ID
slash button 1 is basically say you're
registering this button number 1 and
you'll notice some of the other text
here are layout underscore width layout
underscore height layout underscore
below and so you could imagine what some
of these mean to the point where you
could experiment and change some of
these so layout underscore height is set
to wrap content so this is going to wrap
the content that it is surrounds and
that is in this case the text the text
that says press me so let's say we
wanted to leave delete this and we
wanted to have this be something else
one of the things we could say here is
we could say layout with fill parent and
now this is going to fill the entire
space that's the parent if we click back
to our graphical layout you can see our
button now spans the entire width
instead of just wrapping the words press
P we'll get into a little bit more about
all of these options that we can have in
here for everything else in the future
right now just know that this is the
kind of attributes you pass into these
different elements here and you can
control them that way in fact we even
have a layout margin top with a 24 DP so
that's the space above this button and
if you see the text here that says press
me well if you remember when we're
looking at our graphical layout from the
last video and you can even see it here
these are underlined with yellow dots
and it has a little exclamation point
and you feel hover over this it says
hard-coded string well what does that
mean
well the hard-coded string is that in
our XML we're physically writing our
string here there's a weight you want to
do this so to do this I'm going to cut
this out and then I'm going to go to our
document structure and then you'll
notice inside of your res file is this
values folder and then strings I'm going
to click on strings to open this folder
and you'll see this there's also this
menu which is the resources menu and you
can also view this as an XML file as
well so if you're always more
comfortable with XML you can have this
just edit index and Allen it's going to
be perfect so we want to have the string
and I'm just going to write this in XML
and we're going to have the name the
name is going to equal what we wanted to
reference by it and keep in mind this is
lowercase no spaces so you're going to
use underscores whenever you have a
space keep everything lowercase and
we're just going to call this level
greeting and I'm going to close this out
and then inside of here I'm going to
paste our hello level up tuts and so I'm
going to make sure I save this document
you'll know it's saved when the asterisk
has gone up here and now let's click
back into our tivity main so right here
where we had our Android text what you
can do is you can do the @ sign and then
you're going to type string and then
you're going to do a forward slash and
then that we want the name of the string
that we just had so we set level
underscore greeting we save this notice
how not only this error goes away but if
we go back to our graphical layout it
still says hello will level up tuts
which is exactly what we had before so
what this is doing is this is
referencing the strings saved in our our
preset string file and so this is a
better way to do this
then to just have your strings in your
XML so it's a best practice in Android
that when you have strings that you're
using you'd have them saved into the
strings.xml because if you want to use
them more than once or you're going to
use them again you don't want to have to
have a change multiple times you're
going to want to use this variable so
here you can do string and then this is
your variable name well now in the next
video we're going to do some basic Java
stuff and like I said we're not going to
be really in-depth really high-level
Java training in this course but I will
be going over the basics for anyone not
familiar with Java and when ever get to
one of those videos if you know Java
already just feel free to skip it
because I'm going to make sure that the
videos I do with just Java training are
going to be pretty much just Java and
and then you know in later videos we'll
bring it into the Android world so uh
let's get this press me and we're going
to change this to be another string as
well so we're going to add string and
here I'm just going to make a name
actually I'm going to shorten that BTN
underscore one I'm going to save this
and if you come to our graphical layout
you see it says add string BTN one it's
because it could not resolve this
resource it's giving you this error so
that's because we haven't defined the
string end let's create the string
through the resources menu this time and
I'm going to click Add right here and
it's going to ask what I want to add
there's all sorts of stuff but we're
going to pick string click OK and my
mouse is being weird right now
okay and then here we have a name and a
value value is going to be press mean
and the name is going to be BTN
underscore one now we just save this
file come back to here and we see that
our button now again says press me
perfect so now we've gotten a little bit
into the XML you have a graphical layout
here and you have what is the makings of
your first app in fact if you were to
click this play button right here it's
going to run your app inside of your
emulator like you were before
um if we just give it a second here I
think I yep okay this is launching level
up Tut's here in the bottom right if it
doesn't appear to be doing anything or
something make sure that at in this
bottom right that you see some sort of
activity so I see this launching level
up and then this council stuff comes up
so here we now have our button this is
press me it's full full whip perfect so
this is our app in the making cool well
as always if you have any questions feel
free to hit us up my level up Tut's on
Twitter or in the comments or on
Facebook or just anything let us know
what you're thinking thanks a lot for
watching and this is Scott bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
