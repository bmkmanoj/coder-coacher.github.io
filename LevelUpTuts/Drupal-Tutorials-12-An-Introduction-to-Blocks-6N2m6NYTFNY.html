level of Tut's and today we're going to
be going over blocks in Drupal and this
might not be the definitive tutorial on
blocks but it's going to get you started
because blocks are something that you
will be saying all the time there's
something that takes up a ton of Drupal
so a block is a block of content so in
Drupal 7 if you hover over some items
you'll notice that they have this little
gear with an arrow and they get this
data line when you hover over that this
sort of signifies a block you'll notice
this is a block this is a block this is
a block this might not be a block but
yeah so these things
take up all sorts of real estate on
Drupal and they can be configured moved
around and generally put anywhere you
want so first off let's get into our
blocks screen this is under structure
blocks and while I'm here I'm going to
add this to my shortcuts because I'm
going to use this all the time okay here
you can see you can add a block here if
you just want to add a block and put
some content in you can just do that
also you'll notice that we have
different regions and these regions are
different sections of our site in the
structure of it so there's the header
the help whatever different themes are
going to have different regions you'll
notice then the content is our main page
content sidebar first is that search
form actually let's bring up our site in
another tab localhost okay okay so
here's the search bar and it says search
form is in the sidebar first if we move
it down one underneath our navigation
and our user login we'll just leave it
there and we'll click Save blocks we do
that we refresh this page you'll notice
this is now below it let's say you don't
want the search bar at all you say well
I don't want I just don't want it
showing up also I don't want this user
login showing up you couldn't click the
region set it to none
set this to well actually let's move
this somewhere it's sort of funny we'll
move this to the header and then as you
recall there's is a little powered by
Drupal I don't want that on my set
either as much as I love Drupal I'm
going to click this and I'm going to set
this to none I'm going to save this okay
refresh our page and see what's happened
powered by Drupal is gone our search bar
is now up here in the header block and
our navigation is the only one left
standing well let's say you only want
this navigation to show up on the front
page here let's click into our article
this navigation still here you don't
want it here ok well that's really easy
so if we go to our navigation block
right here you'll see this configure we
can click configure and this gives us
our different themes that we have
installed and it's positioned in our
different themes and you can add this
from here if you know where these
regions are you can also give it a block
title if you put a title in here it's
going to show up on the page so this
navigation this is the block title if we
don't want that to show up we can do
less than none greater than and then
it's not going to have a title at all it
will just be add content so we don't
want this to show up on a certain page
we just want this to only show up on the
front page so if you come down here show
block on specific pages all pages except
those listed or only the listed pages
since we only want this to show up on
the front page we're just going to click
only little listed pages and if you
notice here it says front is the front
page but it has it surrounded by less
than front greater than okay now if we
save this block refresh our page that
block will no longer be there if you
notice the region the entire sidebar
doesn't even get created because there's
no content in that sidebar however if we
go to this page our block is still here
and since we put none for the title
there's no title ok
well that's good but let's say we want
the OP
so we want this search bar to show up on
only let's say only the project's page
exclusively the project's page will only
have search I don't know why you want to
do that but it's an example let's just
use it so where is it so we have our
search form in our header word and click
configure and under here we wanted to
well actually let's say this we only we
don't want it to show up on the
project's page so and here you can just
type projects and it's going to be
looking at this URL path so it's going
to be saying if projects is here then
don't show it and if we don't want it to
show in any of these sub pages of
product projects like projects slash
whatever projects we're making we're
going to need to do projects slash and
then the star and the star signifies
pretty much anything beyond they say
it's a wild card so any sub file of
projects is not going to show up either
so this is going to show up on all pages
except projects and sub pages of
projects to click Save will refresh
projects and we should see the search
bar go away ok if we browse to our home
page there's a search bar and if your
brows too out about our search bars
there as well however no longer for
projects so we're going to be dealing
with blocks a lot if once we get into
views we're going to be creating blocks
there we're going to be creating menu
blocks we're going to be creating all
sorts of content and putting them in
blocks and then telling where those
blocks to go on our site but for now
this is a good introduction of blocks
and it should give you a little bit more
tools to play around with your site and
get it looking how like you want it to
look once again this is Scott with level
up tuts and thanks for watching if you
have any questions please leave a
