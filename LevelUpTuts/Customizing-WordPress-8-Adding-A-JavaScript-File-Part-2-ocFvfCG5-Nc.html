love huts and today we're going to
finish off our function where we're in
queueing a script and today we're going
to be adding a hook and we're going to
be fixing a typo looking up a new
function in the Codex and getting this
thing working well this is something
where we learn about hooks and what a
hook does is it basically looks for some
other action that's going on in the
loading of WordPress and it adds your
function to it so we're going to type
add underscore action and a keep in mind
that that might have been a very broad
explanation of hooks we're going to talk
about them more for this particular
instance that's all you need to know
though add underscore action is a
function here that's going to hook into
another action so when I hit uh in
quotes here keep in mind this has to be
a string so we're putting it in quotes
its WP underscore and Q script I'm going
to make sure I'm spelling in cue right
because that's sometimes a tough one
okay and then I'm going to say comma and
now we want to give it the name of our
function to pass it also in a string so
I'm going to copy and paste this 2014
paste it right in here and now we can
finish this line up with a semicolon so
what this is doing is saying when
WordPress is loading up the scripts then
run this function this function says hey
you're loading up the scripts add extra
js2 you're loading process okay now
let's come back to our page and when i
refresh you'll notice that our alert
didn't pop up and if we refresh this
extra j/s is still not here and that is
actually because of a typo if we come
back to this add action you'll notice
that I had WP and Q script here and
while this is the same as this function
the hook is not actually WP and Q script
it's actually WP and Q scripts so this
function is still correct but this one
needs an S and another typo get template
directory I quickly decided that this
was URL it's actually you are I my
apologies for that as well so get
template directory URI now uh now if we
save this refresh our page okay let's
check out the source search for extra
Jas you'll now look we actually have our
extra dot j s in the code however it's
clearly not the right file because it's
looking in themes 2014 J s extra so of
course if we've tried to open this it
would not find it okay so uh further
going down our troubleshooting what we
can do as a next step perhaps you know
how do you troubleshoot these things
right so what you can do is it's going
to be a very valuable skill to have so
if we Google get template directory URI
and the first hit is going to be the
WordPress codex now this codex is going
to become something that you visit very
frequently if we click here now we see
some function reference stuff what this
says is that in the event of a child
theme is being used the parent theme
directory URI will be returned so
obviously this is not the functionality
that we want now directly below that it
says uh use get stylesheet directory URI
to include resources that are intended
or to be included in over invited child
theme so we want the child theme so we
can click this right here it'll give us
some more reading about this function
and that's really how this codex works
is that it's a explanation about all of
these functions exist and how you can
use them what sort of arguments
parameters they take so even though this
says stylesheets it's getting the
stylesheet directory which ends up being
the child theme so we want to use this
function get stylesheet directory URI
okay
now let's come back to our sublime text
and we can just paste this right in here
just like that and let's come back to
our code now when i refresh this we
should see our alert which says yo and
of course when we refresh this we now
have our proper JavaScript file in here
so you have now added a function a
functions PHP you've in queued a script
you've written a function you've used a
hook and you use the WordPress codex all
in one fell swoop here so that's a lot
of information to take in go around the
WordPress codex read a bunch of stuff
check it out if you have white a white
screen loading or something you probably
maybe missed a semicolon or didn't close
something correctly so go ahead and make
sure that your functions and everything
is written correctly so as always this
is Scott with level up Tut's if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment in the video or hit us up at
Twitter or Facebook at level up Tut's
we'd love to hear from you thanks for
watching and i'll see in the next one
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
