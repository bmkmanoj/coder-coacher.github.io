up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be giving you an interface
overview of figma so if you've never
opened it you open and you're kind of
scared where is this where is that
you're gonna learn all of that stuff in
this video as we basically drill down
the foundations of figma okay so here we
have our file browser and this is sort
of sort of like home base for figma
right so to everywhere you're going to
go sort of starts from here for instance
if you wanted to import a file whether
it's a dot fi G which is a figma file or
a sketch file you would come here and
select this import file or you could
simply just drag it onto the canvas
now in addition we also have our recent
files that we have here we also have our
drafts deleted files in search where you
can find new files all here we have a
menu button which you can get to pretty
much all of this menu button stuff from
your actual OSX or Mac OS file menu up
top like normal if you don't have that
this is a great way to access all of the
sort of stuff anyways and you can see we
have access to a lot of the stuff we
have already new file import file new
project and help in tutorials is a great
place to head if you want to hear a
familiar voice I do a couple of the
videos over there so if you'd like to
check out and get some more help on
different concepts of Figment click help
and tutorials you can see their official
videos which I must say are very very
nice next we can do things like sign out
account settings that sort of stuff now
you of course will have some onboarding
windows here we're gonna simply ignore
most of that I'm going to click through
it's going to tell you about that
anyways you can see we can also create a
team down here in the bottom left and
we'll talk about team management stuff
ok so this is just your file browser
let's actually get into a real figma
file here and check it out now one of
the files you're given by default at the
time of recording this is this Google
material design file let's go ahead and
open this one if you have any other
particular files in here and you don't
have this one just open any of them it's
more about getting to the canvas and
interface itself rather than anything
else
and here we have the main figma sort of
design window now this window is
basically very familiar or at least it
should be in some respects because it's
gonna be a lot like other design
applications you've worked in and if you
coming from sketch things are gonna
probably feel a little bit familiar
although different for instance on the
Left we have all of our layers which is
basically where you'd find your layers
and many other design applications we
have the eye in the lock where we can
turn off visibility on layers or we can
click the lock to lock layers see we'll
be talking more about sort of using this
stuff as you can see we can open up our
layers and our groups and get down to it
so over here is your layers where
probably you would expect them to be now
next we have this toolbar right here
we're gonna have access to all of our
tools for instance the first tool
selected is the move tool which is a
standard cursor right I'm going to zoom
in here so we can actually see a little
bit more of this stuff as you can see I
can click in and move this around right
so that's the move tool now if we click
this drop-down we actually have access
to the scale tool which is also a
keyboard shortcut of K it allows you to
scale things in a way that are
proportionate now next we have the frame
tool which is where you create frames
and sketches are called artboards and
illustrator I'm not exactly sure what
they're called but they're basically a
little miniature canvas within your
larger canvas that contains your design
we're gonna be talking a lot about
frames as we go because they're a major
concept and something that you use all
the time in addition in the drop-down
menu you can see that the frame tool
shortcut is F and the slice tool which
is hidden in here shortcut is just
simply the S key now slices work the
same way you'd expect as any other
design application where you can click
and drag and create an area to be
exported right so this slice is
something that you would then export
although I must say that the exporting
features in figma are really great that
you don't necessarily use the slice tool
that often but it's there if you'd like
it now next we have our shapes you can
see this drop down we have our four
rectangles
to ll4 line tool we have shift l for the
arrow tool we have an ellipse tool with
the the O key the polygon tool which is
triangles and all sorts of other
polygons the star tool and the place
image tool we're gonna be going over
these and more specifics when we talk
about just creating shapes in general
next we have the vector tool which is a
really nice vector tool it's a basically
a pen tool from Illustrator where you
can create your own vector shapes and
there are some excellent features with
this pen tool that really make it stand
out above the others but we'll be
dedicating a whole video to those the
next we have the text tool where the
keyboard shortcut is T and you can click
and drag and create text boxes next we
have the team library which will open up
all of these shared components with your
team you'll notice that you have to have
a professional team to be able to use
the team library but it is definitely a
great feature for all of you teams we're
gonna be going over at the specifics of
that to in a team section of this now
the next we have comments is a way that
you can leave comments on your design
for other editors or viewers to check
out and see your comments maybe comment
on them tell them give them your
thoughts which actually makes figma a
really nice tool for design reviews
there's some other features involving
designer reviews too that we're going to
talk about that just really set figma
apart from its competition okay next we
have the title of our file which you can
see version history and I believe you
don't get version history with the free
account or at least not a major one you
can see I get a 30-day history and if
you have the professional account you'll
get unlimited version history now let's
actually select something here I'm just
going to select the layer at random and
you can see we get a whole host of other
tools that pop up in the middle now
these tools are tools for the selected
items specifically you can see edit
object reset instance which is useful
when we're talking about components we
have create component which we're going
to go over at length because it's a key
feature in figma we have it users mask
which allows us to do some masking stuff
we have union selection which is sort of
our operators for working with multiple
shapes and then we have a crop image
tool okay next we have how many users
are viewing the document right now I'm
the only viewer using this documents of
my faces right here if there were others
they would be popping up along here as
well share is where you can share access
to your document like you can give
someone access to a document via a link
to edit or maybe you can add someone via
email to edit all sorts of different
stuff here we'll be going over this
stuff at length because document sharing
and figma is something that's one of the
key features again is this collaboration
now next we have this presentation view
which is basically going to show off our
frames and sort of a shareable different
view here that you can actually click
through and go through like a
presentation and there's also some
really excellent prototyping features
that go along with this where you can
actually create hotspots on these and
then maybe drive a client presentation
again these are all things that are
going to be covered at length in their
own videos because they are really
really excellent features so you can
basically do all your design work in
figma create these hotspots that click
through them and then your entire
audience can browse to this file on the
live web version and they can basically
let you drive and show off your design
so I mean it's a great way for not only
design presentations but also design
reviews internally next we have view
settings where you can see a pixel
preview show pixel grid snap to pixel
grid show layout grids multiplayer
cursors so if you have multiple people
on this if you see multiple cursors like
a Google Doc and then we have our
default zoom level our current zoom
level and then we have this sort of
export publish tool which I don't use
much but I'll be showing you how to use
it now next in the right column here is
basically where we have all of our info
if you view sketch you'd be familiar
with this very same concept basically
you select anything let me just select
an item here and we get a whole bunch of
information about it
the fill color the layer properties the
position coordinates the alignment tools
we have things like stroke and we can
add a drop shadow and we can do actually
a lot more than that once we start
getting into some of these features
about where we're using things like
constraints to pin an object to
different positions so when you're
modifying things like let's say we want
to make something like this color a
different color we'll just select this
the fill and you can see this is where
we're going to be going to modify
whatever we have selected you also
notice we have a couple other tabs here
prototype in code prototype mode is for
connecting frames together to build
interactive prototypes we talked about
that briefly in the presentation view
where you can create hotspots
we're gonna be going over that at length
and then we also have the code tab where
you can actually collect real CSS code
if we click this code tab here you could
copy this background color directly from
figma saving you a little bit of time
they're super cool okay and lastly we
just have our general campus which is
right here in this canvas like other
design applications can get sort of as
big or as small as you want it to and as
you can see because this is a vector app
we can keep zooming out or in and our
lines are going to redraw nice and crisp
so your canvas is basically a giant
blank canvas and your frames are
essentially the areas in which you're
going to be working on but that doesn't
mean you can't work on the canvas
directly as you can see some of these
groups up here are just sitting on the
canvas and not within a frame however
typically most of the time you're
probably going to be working within
frames
cool so this is the interface of figma I
believe I've covered everything here and
things should be exactly where you'd
expect the tools in your tool bar up top
layers on the Left information and
modification stuff on the right and your
canvas smack in the middle so over the
next course we're gonna be diving into
all of figmas main features we're gonna
be creating some real web application
designs here I'm gonna be showing you
everything you need to know in terms of
where things are or if you're coming
from Illustrator or sketch you know the
stuff that you'd be used to existing in
applications where they are in figma
because like I said things are the same
but they're a little bit different and a
lot of the times you're going to really
like how they're different if you would
like to get this entire series master
figma become the master of figma you
want a head to store that level of
tutorials and purchase this entire
series or become a level up pro as a
level of pro you get access to stream
all of the content on the site and
there's a whole bunch of free exclusive
series and there's going to be more
exclusive series every single month on
all sorts of design and development
topics so as always thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
