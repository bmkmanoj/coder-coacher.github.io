Louisville of Tut's and today we're
gonna continue our promotions tutorials
and we're gonna get into a little bit
more complicated but not too much more
because there's lots to show in here in
promotions I want to make sure I cover
enough stuff that you get the idea and
you can sort of build into making more
and more complex promotions so this
particular promotion is we're going to
be adding 10% to the entire order with a
certain coupon code in the last tutorial
we just added free shipping with the
coupon code so this is different because
it's a coupon on our products however
it's still going to be a shopping cart
price rule so we'll click that shopping
cart price rule you can see our free 99
coupon that we made here for the last
tutorial and now in here for our rule
name we're just gonna call this 10% off
and we're gonna have it be for anybody
and we're gonna have it's the specific
coupon and the coupon code I'm not gonna
have a generate one because I like to
come up with clever coupon names so this
is not really even clever it's just
let's just say the 10th spot that's our
our coupon code for 10% off so here we
have our coupon code just like before
customer groups the same rule name we
went over all this stuff last time
however we're gonna say it uses per
customer we're gonna say the customer
can only use this coupon ever once once
they use it with their account they're
no longer allowed to use this anymore
that way they can't spam 10% off and use
it a whole bunch of time this is a
one-time only thing and the from date
we're just gonna leave these blank but
the to date we're gonna say this coupon
is only active until March 1st and we
don't have to worry about priority
because I don't really care about at
which order this gets put on and public
feed RSS is fine conditions we want to
say you know if all these conditions are
true yeah we like just like last time we
don't have to touch these conditions
however next time we're going to be
getting into some of these conditions
a little bit more so this one just leave
the conditions blank just like last time
and the discount of the amount is a
percent of the product price discount so
that's what we're going to use this time
and we're going to say it's ten percent
okay and then now we don't have to do
anything else it's not free shipping we
don't have to apply shipping amount or
anything all right and it's all good
okay so let's save this and let's go to
our home page and let's add something to
our cart if we don't have something in
there already
yeah it looks like we don't I'm gonna go
to electronics up phones okay I'm just
gonna add this Nokia phone to my cart
and let's apply our coupon with rows of
10 spot and I'm gonna apply coupon here
supply this thing and we now have our
10% discount as you can see it rounds up
so it's you know 14 9999 that's running
this up to $15 and it's taking this off
before tax and here's our text and it
looks like this coupon is working
correctly
okay now this isn't too crazy compared
to what we did last time in fact it's
pretty much very similar except we're
using a percent discount instead of a
shipping but it's it's just one more
tool in your arsenal in the next
tutorial we're going to use some of
those conditions we're still going to
keep it within the shopping cart price
rules like we're doing right now if
we're going to make something nice and
cool okay there's always this is Scott
with level of Tut's if you have any
questions blues it would come in the
video or hit us up on Twitter level up
Tut's thanks for watching
