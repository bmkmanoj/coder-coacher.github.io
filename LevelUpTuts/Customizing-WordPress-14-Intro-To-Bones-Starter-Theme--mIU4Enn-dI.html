of touch and today we are going to be
talking about bones and bones is another
WordPress starter theme now this is an
html5 mobile first starter theme for
rapid WordPress development so in the
last video we talked about underscores
but what's the difference between
underscores and bones well they both
assume very little however bones might
assume just a little bit more it comes
with sass built in instead of having to
edit yourself if you use sass which I do
so I like it uses html5 boilerplate and
it has some really nice things like
custom post types and custom dashboard
functions pre-loaded and it basically
gives you custom post types with a well
documented example so that you can write
your own or use it if you want and not
have to look up that code so I find
bones to be a really great theme not to
mention its mobile first and responsive
out-of-the-box here so we're going to go
ahead and download and get this
installed and up and running on our site
now after we do that we're going to talk
about the process of modifying this
theme with sass if you haven't used sass
before I would recommend checking out
our sass videos on this channel they'll
show you at least how to get a sass
installed and we'll show you what the
workflow for using this theme is like so
let's go ahead and unzip this and I'm
going to put this into my themes folder
right in here where we move it over here
and I'm going to rename it to just be
owns there we go now let's come to our
wordpress site remember it might look
kind of blank in the last video we are
showing you underscores i'm gonna log in
and we're going to go to appearance and
then you'll see that we have bones right
here of course it's telling you to
change this image because this is
obviously not an image of your theme but
let's go ahead and activate it okay we
now have bones installed and activated
okay so let's check out what actually
happened on the front end of our site
here we can open this in the new tab and
we can see this is what bones looks like
out of the box and in fact if we shrink
this page you're going to see that we
are mobile first and well not even just
mobile first but just that it's
responsive the fact that it's mobile
first is I mean unrelated here but we
have this a nice responsive theme and
it's clearly not trying to do too much
for you but there is more being done
than what was being done in underscores
so that's the intro to bones here we
have a downloaded we have it installed
in the next video we're going to paw
through some of its files and you're
going to get up and going with sass and
CSS if you haven't done any sass before
please check out the status videos on
our channel it might open your mind up a
little bit but we're going to go over
everything you need to do here so check
it out next video we're going to dive
into some code as always this is Scott
would love a lot of tuts if you have any
questions please leave a comment the
video will hit us up at Twitter or
Facebook let us know what you're
thinking we'd love to hear from you
thanks for watching I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
