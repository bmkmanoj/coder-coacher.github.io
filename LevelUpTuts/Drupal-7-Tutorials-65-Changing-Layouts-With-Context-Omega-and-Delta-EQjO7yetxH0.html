loved huts and today I'm gonna show you
how you can really change the layout
using a module called Delta with context
and an Omega theme so these are three
separate things
your theme has to be based off of Omega
you have to have the Delta module and
you have to have context but it's
incredibly powerful and its really great
so we're gonna get into it here so make
sure you have Delta if you have an Omega
theme then you should be all ready to go
enable it your Delta modules I just have
Delta blocks Delta UI and built an API
I'm not using the color module so I'm
not gonna worry about that
and to do this we want to come to we
want to come to appearance and then
Delta from there we can add a new Delta
so what is this doing what do we want to
do here well let's say on our journal
page here we have our block set up we
have this content block and may of this
sidebar we want to change up some of the
widths of these we actually want the
content in the sidebar to let's say
maybe split this 50/50 like these two
are and this is really just an
experiment
so it doesn't it's not super practical
but let's say we had you know equal
sized with content that we wanted in
this sidebar and we only wanted that on
the journal page but no other pages and
typically using Omega there's no real
way you can do that so by adding a new
Delta we're just going to call this the
journal journals Delta and by adding
this it's gonna allow us to have a
completely separate layout for this
particular page so the theme is going to
be an ST theme and because that's my
parent theme and we can have this be a
parent template portfolios one I made
earlier typically apart just say none
otherwise you can have Delta templates
that have a parent and then you can
override different values and stuff like
that which is really great but it's a
little bit out of the scope of this
video so the description will just be
changes sidebar
and content on journals and we're going
to only override the different values if
you have it over and all values then
that's going to be completely overriding
everything I'm just gonna have it
override the different values you know
of course you can make that
determination by what you need to do
exactly so now we have this Delta what
can we do with it well now we need to
click configure and it configure takes
us to a screen like you've seen before
and in fact it looks exactly the same as
your appearance your your main theme and
it looks you know so exactly similar
that they have to tell you right up here
your l2 editing the Delta for journals
just so you don't think that you are in
your theme settings so here on this page
you'll notice that your theme everything
here your zones are all in the same spot
they were in if we click on this content
zone we can go to our regions and see
our sidebar second and our content which
of course is set to nine and three
columns now since we have these are
twelve columns we can put this at six
and six and let's just save that this is
a real minor change let's say you can
change anything that you can change with
the theme just you know based on however
you have it
so we're i'm the journal page let's
refresh and you'll notice no dice we
don't have anything yet we'd have our
same sidebar and even though we said
this is journals there's no way that we
attach this particular page to that
layout so let's go to structure and then
context and add and let's say this will
be journals keep in mind you need a
lowercase title for this it's a huge
pain but uh say journals and the
description changes sidebar content of
journals and so for our condition once
what we're going to use path
so I'm gonna say this is going to be on
the journal or journals page I suppose
the journal page even though I've been
calling it journals on the journal page
we want our sidebar to use a delta so
let's go to add reactions and pick Delta
now you'll see the deltas that we've
already created and we can have one that
one that we made was journals so let's
check that and click Save now if we
refresh our journals page you're gonna
see our content has shifted over if we
look at our blocks you can see these
sidebar is the same width and this is
now officially using this Delta which is
awesome and it leaves total
possibilities for all sorts of stuff you
can completely transform your pages with
these combinations of contexts and so if
you go to projects you notice I've done
a delta on this page I've removed the
sidebar effectively now my let's see my
portfolio here takes up the entire page
instead of just half you know I don't
have a sidebar for the portfolio like I
want on some other pages so Delta is
really powerful go check it out try to
use it add different layouts and you can
totally change things up with the
responsiveness and just your omega theme
in general so as always if family
questions or comments leave a comment
the video hit us up at Twitter or level
up tuts let us know what you're thinking
we always love to hear from you and as
always this is Scott Olinsky with the
LevelUp tuts and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
