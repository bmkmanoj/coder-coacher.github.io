up tubs and today we're gonna work on
our product grid for our Magento LevelUp
site and if you notice before this page
is looking kind of sad look at these
nice default form styles that are
looking pretty good but some of the
stuff is just totally weird we have all
the products are in a straight line here
and they have like really no styling so
I think what we should do is use
skeleton to our advantage and add each
of these items to the grid so the thing
is is our main column width here is if
you remember we gave it a 13 columns so
this area is 13 columns wide and we did
that by giving it a class of 13 and
columns so what we want to do now is
give each of these list items in our
product grid right here we want to give
each of these a grid number and so you
know 3 divide up or 13 divided by 4
because maybe we could fit 4 crosses
three-point-something each so really
what we could do is have four items wide
and then each each item only takes up
three grid columns so what we need to
open is in our template to catalog
product is our list P HTML and this is
the code that's generating the products
and you can see this come in right here
so this is the list mode that's not what
we want to edit we want to enter the
grid mode so I'm going to come down here
and here's a grid boat and here is our
list items so in here we have the class
and what we're going to do is actually
just add a space before this because
this right here is generating some of
the other classes so we don't want to
get rid of that but we want to give this
a class of columns and then we want to
say 3 so let's come back to our site
let's check it out see what's happened
so let's see what we have here we have 3
1 2 3 1 2 3 it's good because it's in a
grid however something's still sort of
weird so let's check it out and as you
can see what it's doing is it's putting
one two
three items and then it's been doing a
new UL so this is sort of not right we
actually also want this first one to
have a class of alpha if it's the first
and Omega if it's the last and we also
want to throw this into a grid that
would also be considered the since we're
doing three three column sections here
we're gonna want that to be nine columns
wide or I'm sorry we did four so we want
that to be twelve columns wide
so let's come back here and on the UL
I'm gonna give this a class of columns
and then we're gonna say twelve and if
you can see where it's saying item first
we can also add in space alpha here and
then where it says last we can add in
the space and type Omega and so what
would it what's going on here it's
really just outputting three instead of
the instead of the four that we want
wide and we could sort of see why but
let's scroll through this and you see
this variable column count so let's
first do this and the not right way and
then in the next video we're going to
come back to this okay so first I'm
gonna comment this line out I'm just
gonna do two dashes right here there are
two forward slashes I'm sorry and I'm
gonna copy this line and I'm gonna paste
it down here I'm gonna get rid of this
and I'm gonna set this column count
variable directly to the number four so
there it is and let's do a semicolon and
let's come back to our site here let's
refresh and their columns are now in a4
if we check this out we have four list
items per ul cool and you see the six
jumping up here it's actually just part
of this I don't know six items for some
reason something doesn't have a clear
fix around it so we'll take care of that
too but
so we have our
or items here and per once and it's
gonna be responsive check it out cool
however it's not quite the right way we
want to be able to do this using this
get column count video so in the next
video I'm gonna show you the real way to
do this using the get common count and
it's gonna be perfect as always this is
Scott with love-love Tut's if you have
any questions leave a comment on this
video or hit us up at Twitter at level
up Tut's or we're on Facebook we're all
