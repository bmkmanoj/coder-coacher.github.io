up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be kicking off the new meteor topic
series by covering the blaze base that
we're going to be using for the
remainder of this series so this video
is just gonna be talking about a little
bit about what comes with that code and
how to get it and how to get started now
keep in mind if blaze isn't your thing
I'm also going to be doing the same
content using react and angular so the
react base and the angular base for
meteor are coming very soon so keep your
eyes open for that so let's get started
with these new topics in meteor so to
get started we're gonna want to go ahead
and grab the blaze base from the level
up tuts
github page I can link to this in the
description of the video
now this blaze base is really just going
to be used as a base for all sorts of
these meteor topics videos the idea with
any of these is is that we'll have a
nice base to work off of to add various
features but the features won't be
dependent on one of another through all
these different meteor topics since this
is the first meteor topics video though
however this base file is likely to
change over time and maybe evolve a
little bit so you can always grab a new
version and see what's new so let's go
ahead and grab at this URL here the SSH
and just let's clone this into wherever
you keep your sites so then come to
terminal so now we just need to get
clone and then clone at the blaze base
now you'll see it's going to grab that
project and if we change into that
particular project which is blaze base
now from inside of this blaze base all
we need to do is type meteor now this is
going to get our app up and running as
you can see we now have our app up and
running after it's grabbed all of the
dependencies let's head to our localhost
now and as you can see we should be
greeted with this landing page we have a
couple of fake example ones we have a
fake billboard and the level up
tutorials logo up here we also have
links to a home and a dashboard now
these things aren't really doing a whole
lot right now we just have some basic
dashboard
content but none of these links are
actually active yet these are sort of
things that we're going to build into
the shell keep in mind that this is a
shell that we're going to be adding in
functionality as we go using various
meteor topics and don't worry if a
particular topic doesn't interest you
you can always use this blaze base to
work with the next topic that comes up
okay so let's go ahead and drag this
into our text editor I'm going to be
using sublime text for these videos if
you're wondering I'm using the material
dark theme so before we get started
let's run down exactly what's going on
in this blaze base now you can see we
have a basic styles s CSS now as you can
see is starting at the bottom up we have
a Styles scss which is importing just a
basic normalized CSS and a base file now
we just have some real basic CSS in here
this is this of which is likely to get
changed and updated as this series
progresses so we have more and more of a
complete thing I'll be making sure that
any sort of updates to this are noted in
the video now we're also using a flow
router and an addition to flow router
we're using flow router layouts so if we
head to routes ejs you can see we have a
flow router and we only have two routes
set up we have a basic home route and a
basic dashboard route you can see we're
using the blaze layout render and we're
passing in different layouts we have the
home layout which is going to be used
for anything that we have basically like
a home page layout and then we have the
app layout now the difference being in
the two is that the home page layout has
this billboard it basically just has a
header and the dashboard the application
layout has this sidebar menu is typical
to what you'd see if you had your
account logged in and you were managing
something right now there's no
permission setup to allow anyone not to
see this so we would want to add that
later down the road once we add user
accounts and eventually rolled so let's
head back to the code you can see that
inside of home layout we're just
rendering home and inside of a playout
we're just rendering dashboard let's
actually come up and check out the
index.html all we're doing is importing
open sans' which is just the font that
we're using here
other than that nothing crazy going on
now in our SAS folder we have the base
file which contains some mix-ins and we
have a normalized which is just a basic
normalize now instead of public as just
our static assets such as the level up
logo and let's head to client in client
I have three folders this is going to
change based on which particular project
were working on for the first meteor
topics which is going to be on accounts
we're going to build up everything
essentially in these accounts folder if
you'll notice we have layouts which
includes our app layout our home layout
and we also have a main layout which
right now is identical to the home
layout just with a different name in
class and in pages we have dashboard and
home now there's not too much of a
difference here this just includes our
billboard and and dashboard it just
includes the page shell that says
dashboard instead of our partials is
where we include things that are going
to be used on multiple pages such as the
app navigation the app nav is this
navigation that's featured in the
left-hand bar right here we'll be adding
and subtracting and just modifying this
based on which topic we're talking about
the header includes the main navigation
also an h1 with the level up tuts logo
now inside of main nav we have a list
item which has home and dashboard this
again is going to be changing based on
the topics that we're working on we also
have a main nav guess which is at this
point blank so as you can see this is
the Blaz base file for our meteor topics
now keep in mind if you're not working
in blaze that's no problem because I'm
gonna be doing these same videos for
react and angular so every single one of
these topics I'm going to cover I'm
gonna have a blaze base a react base in
an angular base so you can work with
whatever your front-end language is of
choice now the blaze videos will be
coming first but the others will follow
soon after so keep checking the channel
that's something you're interested in so
now that you're familiar with the blaze
base we're ready to get started on our
meteor topic first topic we're going to
be covering is is going to be user
accounts and meteor so over the next few
videos we're gonna be building a more
customized user account system and we're
gonna be building up to that by just
showing you sort of
what customization options exist for you
how we can get deeper and deeper into
building a custom authentication system
and like I said if user accounts aren't
something you're interested right now
check back later and there's going to be
more meteor topics using this same blaze
base many of these topics will be
announced very soon so there's well
something you'd like to see in
particular leave a comment in this video
and I will do my best to add it to the
list of topics coming in this gigantic
meteor topics tutorial series so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you'd like to help support
the creation of these free tutorials
head over to store that level up
tutorials calm and help support I've
done over 800 free tutorials on YouTube
now and I'm hoping to push that at least
200 more this year maybe more than that
so thanks for watching and I'll see you
in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
