up tutorials and I hope you've enjoyed
this series so far there's so much more
to go we've only just scratched the
surface and with redux it's one of those
things that it's really sort of just
tough and abstract if you're not used to
working in it so along in this series
we're going to be making this stuff a
lot more practical we're going to be
diving into some of the the things that
you would commonly do with Redux and
we're bringing it in to react where
we're going to be able to set our store
we're gonna be able to pull data from
our store we're gonna be able to run
actions with an API do stuff
asynchronously save things to a
persistent stored and local storage and
even get some really excellent dev tools
set up along the way so if you want to
learn all of the stuff and more with
redux and react head on over to level up
tutorials comm forward slash store just
level up tutorials comm become a pro or
purchase a series to get full access to
all the videos code and everything that
comes along with redux and react for
everyone thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
