up tuts and today I'm going to show you
how to use autoprefixer in gulp now what
this does is it allows you to just type
your CSS as is without worrying about
browser prefixes then when you save and
you can run your task it's actually
going to automatically add these browser
prefixes where your CSS needs it now
this makes things a lot easier because
you don't remember what uses a browser
prefix and you don't have to use things
like mix-ins or compass to actually take
care of your prefixes for you so let's
get going we're going to use
autoprefixer now so we're going to be
adding a new gulp plugin like we have
already and this is going to be gulp
autoprefixer now you can come to this
package page or you can just install it
with NPM install gulp - autoprefixer or
if you're using a package file you can
just enter your package file that way
now let's go ahead and install this so
I'm just going to type sudo and NPM
install gulp - autoprefixer now we've
done this probably a hundred times so
you're probably used to installing NPM
packages and you're probably already
using a package file and you could just
add it there but if not you can just
install it this way and it'll be fine
we're just going to have a variable
prefix that is equal to require and then
gulp autoprefixer so that way we can
have access to autoprefixer let's go
ahead and just add it to our list of
requires okay let's get rid of the VAR
statement here and as you can see we
have each of these after a comma less
than as a semicolon okay so we now have
access to gulp autoprefixer now you can
pass autoprefixer all sorts of options
if you come to the github page for
autoprefixer itself you can scroll down
here and see what sort of browsers you
can use bypassing this options so you'll
notice that you can say autoprefixer
give me the last one version you know
greater than 1% Internet Explorer 7 so
there's all sorts of options you can
have here and all we have to do is pass
these into the autoprefixer function
just as the strings are here so let's go
ahead and just copy this last two
versions you can see that it targets the
last two versions of each browser now
that seems like all I need to support
what browsers you need to support in
your code well that's up to you but I'm
going to use last two versions now let's
come back to our code here and then in
our Styles task before we save our code
into a specific destination we can pass
in another pipe and within that pipe and
now we want to use the prefix function
so we can just say prefix because that's
what we have a brought in our
autoprefixer as and then inside of
parenthesis because this is a function
we can pass this a string that string
being the last two versions that we
copied off of the autoprefixer page so
what this is saying is okay compile your
sass make sure there's no errors and
then prefix to the last two versions and
then output it CSS now for the sake of
this example I want to go ahead and
change this to expanded that way we can
see exactly what happened instead of
with compressed it might be a little bit
difficult to see those actual prefixes
when we look at our CSS so let's go
ahead and run this a gulp task now we
can run this gulp task simply by running
gulp styles just like that in an enter
ok you can see that our CSS has been
compiled and reloaded so let's go ahead
and check it out let's open up our CSS
and then our main CSS and you'll notice
we have nothing crazy going on well
let's check our sass to make sure that
there is some properties that would be
getting some browser prefixes now
obviously we need a css3 property that
needs to be prefixed for this to work so
let's go ahead and add one here we can
just do a transition so we can say
transition and then we can have this be
all 0.2 seconds and ease just like that
not a big deal okay now let's go ahead
and run our gulp test once more no you
can just hit up on your keyboard to
rerun that same command and you'll see
it's compiled your sass code once again
now if we browse to our CSS file you'll
see that this has automatically brought
in WebKit transition so it's bringing
that WebKit transition for the last two
versions of browsers that don't support
WebKit transitions so check it out this
is autoprefixer if you want to use
something other than the last two
versions which I imagine you would check
out the autoprefixer github page which
I'll post in the description and you can
see exactly all of the options you can
then pass in to autoprefixer it's pretty
great and it'll cover anything you need
so as always this is Scott with LevelUp
