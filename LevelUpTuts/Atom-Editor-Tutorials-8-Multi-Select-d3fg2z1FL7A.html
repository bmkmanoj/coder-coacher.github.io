up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you the multi select
functionality in atom now this is a way
to have multiple cursors to be able to
type things in multiple different places
at once and is exceedingly handy so
let's check it out right now
if you've used other modern text editors
multi-select is maybe a feature you've
come across now multi-select is really
one of the most useful type of features
that exists in the modern text editor
allows you to essentially have multiple
cursors all over your document now you
might be wondering why this is important
well we could do a find and replace on
these P tags to get rid of them
you could do a find and replace in this
selection to get rid of them if there's
multiple P tags on your page however it
might be sometimes occasionally just
quicker to do a multi selector and let's
change us to a div so what I did there
let's head back as I click the cursor
into a spot then while holding the
command key I selected in front of
another spot and you'll notice we now
have two cursors now these cursors both
function exactly like one cursor would
it we can hit delete is just going to
keep deleting and we could wreak total
havoc on our website you'll see we have
these multiple cursors and there go nuts
now let's say in addition we had a whole
bunch of list items here and you forgot
to put anchor tags in them so all of a
sudden you want all these anchor tags
now the bummer here is that in sublime
text you could alt click and drag down
you'll notice that's not the case in
atom so what we all have to do is simply
just click in all of these spots here
and from here we can say
anchor tag
like so and you let
you can type a whole lot here we can set
this all up we can hit enter or whatever
but weak either way we can set this all
up so that all we need to do is add in
the text where needed so multi cursor
works really well in atom however it is
certainly missing the sublime text style
column selectors and if you look in
packages you may just find a package
that does that for you
so what's the extent of cursors well you
can just keep clicking and placing
cursors as your heart desires and as you
can see any action that we make on those
cursors will happen on all of them at
once
this is a productivity tool that you may
find yourself using all the time as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you want to get these
videos early head to store that level up
tutorials comm and purchase the entire
series for download or you can see them
streaming as a LevelUp pro member as
always this is Scott Olinsky thanks for
watching and I'll see you the next one
