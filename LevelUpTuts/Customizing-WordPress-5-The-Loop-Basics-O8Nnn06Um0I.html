up Tut's and today we're going to be
talking about the loop in WordPress and
to give you an idea about what the loop
actually is is really all you have to do
is take a look at any of your template
files and you'll see a comment that says
the loop right actually if we come into
one of them let's come into the even the
most one we we touched most recently
start the loop here we are
and this is a comment that you're going
to see in most templates that are
producing your content well I should say
yet most of all templates that are
producing your content so the templates
that are producing and so the loop
actually is what's outputting all of
your posts on the home page here it's
also what outputs an individual post on
a posts page and it's what outputs the
content on a page so what is the loop
well the loop is really just a PHP while
that's grabbing all of the posts that
it's supposed to display and then it
displays what it needs to display so it
goes through and it says all right got
the first one do is there a second one
okay god the second one is there a
second one and it keeps grabbing your
posts so on and so forth you'll notice
that we have one two three posts here
right and they're all being output and
then it would get at the end of this
third post to be like you have another
post no ok stop outputting posts so to
see what is actually making this
homepage work we're going to want to go
to the index page now let's come to our
finder and I'm going to copy the
index.php template right here from our
base theme into our child theme and
right here now we have that now let's
open that up in sublime text and here we
have our main template file and we'll
scroll down we have our main content and
you'll see some PHP stuff but really
what's important here is we're talking
about the
and it's starting the loop so the first
thing you'll notice it says if we have
posts then do the loop if there's no
post it's not even going to bother
running the code to check to see if you
have or how many posts you have and help
put this okay so here on line 34 it's
saying while we still have posts output
the post now
well this code this line right here
isn't what's actually outputting the
post but it's grabbing the post to
output now in here it's saying it gets
template part and we're basically right
inside of here is where it's grabbing
the post template to actually output all
of that stuff now after it's found and
output all of our posts so after it's
gotten the title the body and the tags
and all that stuff that's output on our
home page then it's going to output a
paging navigation this is a comment that
says a previous next post navigation and
you'll notice that's only if we need
additional post right and then it's
going to say we have an else statement
here so it's saying if we have posts if
there's no posts then how put this no
posts found template and then the loop
ends right at this end if so now you'll
notice this is all wrapped inside of
these PHP tags anytime you have a PHP
statement it needs to be wrapped inside
of PHP tags the opening tag is a less
than a question mark than PHP and the
ending tag is just a question mark
greater than you also notice that many
of our lines in PHP end with a semicolon
there's a reason why this else doesn't
it's because it's in the middle of this
if statement but other than that we have
our endings ending with a semicolon now
one way you can visually understand this
a bit more is if we do our
what we've been doing and just echoing a
test right we've just been putting tests
somewhere on the page so to illustrate
how this is looping and since if we're
on the home page only let's echo a test
so in PHP if you want to print something
there's a couple ways to do it but if
you're just printing a string here we
can type echo space and then quotes and
now I'm just going to put in test and
then after that I'm going to follow it
up with a semicolon now it's important
to note that inside of these quotes you
could also do something like h1 test
right and this is actually going to
output this as an h1 in your code so
let's come to our page now you can see
when i refresh we now have a test above
every single post content and that's
because this echo test is being put
above the get template so if we go ahead
and cut this out and put it below the
get template but still within the while
statement the test is now below every
single post well you might be wondering
how do I get inside of this well this is
actually a another template I'm going to
go ahead and delete this h1 test because
we know where we're at already with that
and let's check out our theme files
again now I'm in the parent theme and
you'll notice we have these different
content right we have content page dot
PHP and the one we're going to want is
just content so let's go ahead and move
content dot PHP into our child theme
now within content that PHP what you're
going to see is an HTML structure that
is the exact same as what we would see
if we were to inspect our page if we
come to our page right click inspect
this we're going to see an article with
an ID of the post number a header with
entry header h1 with the entry title and
so on if we come to our sublime text
page it's going to you'll see that we
have our article with an idea of our
post and then it's grabbing the ID with
this PHP function here then we have a
header we have our entry title and stuff
like that well this is awesome because
now what we can do is we can absolutely
modify anything we want to change the
output of how these things are
outputting on the page let's say we
wanted the categories which you see is
uncatted up here we want this appear
below the title well you can see that we
have this entry meta and it's saying
it's saying category links right so we
can just grab this whole div let's cut
this out of here and I'm going to paste
it just below this next PHP thing that
is just grabbing the title here and now
that we save this refresh
you'll see we now have the title and
then our meta in fact if we didn't even
want category links here at all we could
just delete them deleted refreshed
they're gone we don't have to ever see
them again and remember if we didn't
like this change or we messed something
up you can always go ahead and just
delete this or compare it to the other
content that PHP and the parent theme
and see what you did wrong and chances
are if you mess something up in the PHP
it could be you know quote here missing
bracket here a semicolon here there is
but if you're not modifying the PHP yet
or you're comfortable modifying PHP you
should be totally fine okay so this is
the content right and you'll notice that
when we made one modification to this
template it made it to every single one
because that's what the loops doing it's
saying hit this all right it's saying
okay here do we have a post okay let's
get the template and in the template
it's going to help put everything for
one post okay now it's going to go to
the next post now it's going to go back
to this template I'll put all this stuff
for the next post and it's going to keep
doing that until all your posts are done
now the same thing happens when we want
to output a page even if there's just
one page if you'll come to our page no
sidebar which we made before you'll see
that we still have this loop and only
this time it's saying get the page
template and it's going to say well we
have posts but the whole thing is it's
only going to return one post so it's
only going to return one thing so you
can see the loop is used all over this
site and this is just scratching the
surface of basic concepts about the loop
so visualize a loop it just goes around
and around and round finds your posts
and outputs them and it uses you know
the various templates that you need to
output that data via a page or a post or
whatever so this is the loop basics
trust me if it doesn't make a ton of
sense right now it's going to get
cleared up
as we get deeper and deeper and you
truly start to understand the format in
the structure of these documents so as
always this is Scott with level of Tut's
