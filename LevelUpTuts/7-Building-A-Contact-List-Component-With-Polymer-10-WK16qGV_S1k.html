up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna continue our polymer series
however we're gonna be entering into a
little bit more practical territory here
by creating our first real sort of
useful element so we're gonna be
creating a context list that allows you
to have like a photo an email and name
that sort of thing and we're gonna be
building this out into all sorts of
modular ways we're gonna show you how to
loop over data all sorts of cool stuff
so let's get going on creating our first
really useful practical element right
now so over the next few videos we're
gonna be building sort of a contacts
list style application where we just
have basically a list of people's names
essentially and what this is going to do
is illustrate we're going to have a sort
of complex element and we're going to
have an element that contains other
elements now we're gonna sort of take
this one step at a time so the first
thing we want to do is go ahead and
create a new element now we had our
hello world which I actually want to
just take in sort of rework so we're
going to rename hello world and this is
going to be renamed to contact list so
like so contact list is hello world is
now contact list now every single place
we want to say hello world before we can
now say contact list for instance Dom
module ID is no contact list and is is
no longer hello world
it is contact list okay and as you can
see everything else sort of can be the
same and let's go ahead and come to our
index page and let's change this hello
world that we're no longer looking for
that we're looking for contact list at
HTML and we're going to be changing this
element as well so contact - list and
one last place now the reason I'm doing
this instead of just creating it from
scratch because we already have some
nice boilerplate code that you know we
might not need to necessarily rewrite
so now that we have this going here
let's go ahead and open up this in the
browser and make sure everything is
working as it was before okay so as you
can see here we have this loaded up and
we have this basic data binding example
working before and so you can see that
we changed the hello world to contact
list and all of the right places so now
let's go ahead and let's start writing
this contact list I'm gonna go ahead
first and get rid of these attributes
here first name and last name and I'm
gonna go ahead and come into our contact
list I'm also going to get rid of any
sort of style that we had in here and
I'm just gonna give this some space so
it's nice and easy to read and now in
our template tag we're gonna go ahead
and get rid of this input and this h1
and h2 and we're gonna go ahead and
throw in an unordered list like so okay
so now that we have an unordered list we
can add some list items in case you're
wondering I'm using Emmet here to get a
little you know just to get a shortcut
here going and so for each of these list
items actually want to open these up a
little bit and inside of these I'm going
to have just an h3 which is going to be
this person's name so this is going to
be this is gonna be Scott this is going
to be Tim this is going to be Ben okay
so we have three names here now let's go
ahead and just check our HTML to make
sure everything's loading correctly okay
it looks pretty good so far let's just
come in here to our I'm gonna throw in
an image here so I'm going to say image
and the source is actually going to be
from these these random user photos so
this is not a photo of me or anybody I
know so we can come in here and just say
change the number here and let's change
the number here
okay so we now should get three photos
okay we have three different photos and
we have three different names and now
let's go ahead and add some sort of
contact and I'm just gonna use the span
tag and I'm going to say Scott at level
up tuts comm and these aren't
necessarily going to be selectable with
a mailto or something like that but uh
just to just to be here it's good enough
right now okay and I'm going to change
this to be Tim and then try to use any
of these emails by the way they won't
work so we're gonna come here and you
can now see we have some decent sort of
contact list going it's it's really
basic but we have a few names we have a
few images and we have just a basic list
here so let's go ahead and add some
styles in our Styles I'm going to just
say any unordered list here is going to
have a the style none the items within
each list item are gonna be display flex
okay looking pretty good and let's see
we have list item and we're gonna have
images inside of each list item are
going to have a border radius and that's
going to be just 50% and they're going
to have a margin right of 10 pixels and
and just like that we can also say the
h3 in here is going to have a margin
right of 10 pixels as well I mean we
could do this a little bit differently
with flexbox but this is this is good
enough for me right now so since each of
these are 80 pixels we can say this is
I'm gonna have a line height of 80
pixels margin of none and I'm going to
change this margin right actually from
10 pixels I'm just going to change it to
zero
and then 0-0 like so okay and one last
thing we're going to want to have the
span we're just going to say any list
item span is going to also have a line
height of 80 pixels now keep in mind the
CSS is just really sort of quick and
dirty to get this going but as you can
see everything's getting lined up and
let's go ahead and add some more space
here we need to like something like 40
pixels of space we got a lot of room to
work with okay and once more let's go
ahead and add some more styles of
margin-bottom we'll give each of these
margin-bottom
40 pixels and we're going to say each
list item list item plus a list item is
going to have a boarder top solid one
pixel of let's say something like 666
okay so if you aren't familiar with this
it's essentially saying any list item
that's next to a list item so basically
any list item except for the first one
is going to get a boarder top okay so it
looks like since we had a margin bottom
on there I actually want to maybe do
something different than that and we
could just say 20 pixels padding all the
way around okay so really quickly we now
have this a nice sort of contact list
and in fact we could come in here to our
HTML and if we wanted to reuse this
contact list in other places of our site
we could sort of throw this in here
let's say we actually had an aside right
and we put this contacts list in the
aside now what's interesting here is
that if we were to come and say main dot
CSS let's just add an aside here notice
I'm not using a class or anything this
is just for an example and if we say
with 50% and let's come back to our
browser and refresh you'll know
something pretty cool so here we're
using this component and we didn't
define any sort of width
but it's deciding to take up the entire
I don't know why this thinks I've been
Romanian by the way okay so we use this
component once and it's taking up the
entire parent right and then we come
down here we use this exact same
component but because we're putting it
in a aside with a different container
you can see that is in fact taking the
shape of the container so you can see
how pretty powerful these things are we
can really build sort of reusable
components that you can throw in
different environments and it's going to
be able to modify it so as you can see
this is a really sort of dry way of
doing things anytime we wanted to use
this context list we could simply just
drop it in okay let me get rid of that
we actually don't need this context list
in here twice just like so okay so now
we have our contacts list we have our
data and we're ready to start getting
into a little bit more complex stuff
using this polymer application that we
have going here so what we're going to
be doing in the next couple of videos is
we're gonna transform this list of
contacts and we're gonna start using
data from a JavaScript object to
populate this instead of having to
repeat all of this HTML because right
now this is not super dry and then after
that we're going to get into making this
a little bit more modular so that we can
reuse components in all sorts of
different ways so as always this is
Scoville level of tutorials if you have
any questions or comments leave it come
in the video or heard us up at Twitter
or Facebook ad level of tutorials we'd
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
