up tutorials and today we're gonna
continue to talk about things you can do
in your templates and in this case we're
gonna be getting into some built-in
directives for this video we're gonna
cover ng class which allows you to set
classes of conditionally so that way you
can have classes that are being assigned
via variables or may be checking if a
variables true or not now you can create
toggles and things of that nature so
let's get started right now so to start
off I'm actually gonna delete this limit
to stuff that we had in here before and
I'll leave the filter search because
that's just fine and I'm going to go
ahead and put this all back on one line
even though it's wrapping it just looks
a little bit nicer and I'm gonna get rid
of this class person dot item name
business that we were doing before
because it's not super relevant from
here on out and you need to finish that
up with a quote just like that and I'm
gonna get rid of this currency filter
that we added in the last video as well
because as you know age is not really a
currency so okay let's save that and
let's check out our page okay it looks
just like how we remember it from a
couple of videos ago now what we want to
have it is a class that gets applied to
each one of these items based on the
person's age okay so if there are over
30 they're gonna get a class that's over
- 30 and if they're under 30 they're
going to get a class that's under - 30
so to do this we need to use the ng
class directive and we'll be using it on
the list item itself now I don't have a
CSS file or anything associated with
this but I wanted it give this some
style just so we don't have to
immediately inspect the element just to
see that it is in fact working so in our
head here I'm going to add a style tag
keep in mind that I normally wouldn't do
this but since I'm just adding two
classes here it's gonna be just fine so
we're gonna say over 30 and over 30 is
going to get a
ground of red and the color of white
okay and we're just gonna copy this and
we're gonna have another class that's
under 30 and it's going to be just that
disgusting basic default blue color so
it's gonna be under 30 and it's going to
be blue blue with a color of white as
well okay so now we should instantly be
able to see when this is working so we
have over 30 and under 30 now on our
list item I'm gonna come down here I'm
gonna hit enter just before the closing
tag here I'm gonna put this on a
separate line just so you can see it
nice and easy it depends on how you have
your word wrapping set up in your
document if you have it however you like
to code you can certainly do this for
this example I'm just gonna show you in
a way that is easy to see so we're gonna
say hen G - class okay now over ng -
class we can say equals and then we need
quotes now this is where it gets a
little confusing because mg classes a
little bit different than a lot of
directives you can't just pass it a
conditional and have it completely work
what we need to do is we need to say
something like curly brackets open and
close and then single quotes because
we're within double quotes here and now
this is going to be the name of the
class you want to apply now here we can
say over - 30
just like that and now we can have a
colon after the quote and now we want to
have our actual conditional statement so
we can say item
age and that's going to be as long as
there over greater than 30 and it's
going to be greater than 30 so what this
is saying is if item got age is greater
than 30 then get the class over 30 okay
now if we come to our page and refresh
you'll notice that we have two of our
list items now have a background of red
and a color of white if we inspect not
only do we see that we have this ng
class expression but you see in the
actual HTML
we have classes ng binding ng scope and
over 30 where the other ones don't
actually have that over 30 you can see
the class just doesn't exist in this ng
class that's actually the angular system
is adding it to your actual HTML class
okay so what happens if we want to add
our under 30 now well inside of our
curly brackets we can add a comma and
then another one so we can say single
quotes under - 30
now again outside of the single quotes a
colon and then our expression which is
going to be item that age is less than
30 okay now if we save this and refresh
you'll see that two of our items are
getting the blue class and two of our
items are getting the red class if we
add somebody new and have them set us 30
they're not going to get either because
we don't have anything for that okay so
after a refresh okay we're back to just
these four people but what say a more
concise way we can write this right
let's say we want to include
three-year-olds this time we're gonna
rewrite this in a little bit more
concise weight using ternary operators
so if you're not familiar with ternary
operators in JavaScript you can use them
in a bit of a shorthand to write if
statements so let's get rid of all this
stuff including the brackets I'm
actually just gonna delete everything
and start fresh now what we can say is
our expression first so item dot age if
the item age is greater than 29 keep in
mind because we're gonna be including 30
in the over 30 category this time if
item dot age is greater than 29 then you
put a question mark which means here are
the results okay the first result is the
true result so if the item edge is
greater than 29 we want them to have the
/ - 30 class and then outside of that
single quote we then have a colon and
then another set of single quotes and
inside of here we have our false our
false condition so they're going to be
under
thirty okay so the way this works is
hits this conditional it's saying is
this true if it's true give me this one
otherwise and give me this one and save
that I'm sure that maybe we put this
closing bracket on the same line okay
there we go now let's head to our HTML
here and refresh and as you can see we
have the exact same result so and if you
look in our code here we have our
ternary operator in this ng class here
so if you need an either-or sort of
situation let's say we're toggling
something then you could possibly use
this ternary operator now what's another
example perhaps you want to show and
hide something for instance we may not
want to have these names available all
at once I don't know why you would want
to do that but let's just let's just say
that you don't want to see these names
unless you request them so we can have a
I'm just gonna make a button and it's
going to be show names okay so now let's
head to our JavaScript on my JavaScript
I'm going to add just a variable and
it's just gonna be der list dot toggle
and this is going to be equal to false
because we want these names to be hidden
first okay Durell estat toggle equals
false now let's head here I'm gonna add
a CSS class here and it's going to be
hidden and hidden is just going to be
getting a display:none okay so now let's
head over to our unordered list here and
we can have ng class equals and then
inside of here we can go ahead and use
our single brackets and inside of our
single breck our curly brackets we have
single quotes which can have the class
of hidden and so outside of that we have
the colon like we had before and here we
can add our expression so before we
actually have a conditional if this is
greater than this sort of thing and this
time since we're just checking true or
false all we have to have is the
variable name so we can say der list dot
okay Durrell is toggle is going to give
us a true or false value if this is true
then we're going to get this class of
hidden and if it's false we're not going
to get that class of hidden however
that's not really what we want we wanted
to just sort of be in in terms of when
the toggle is toggled that means we're
going to be showing the names not hiding
them so what we can do is simply add an
exclamation point here and now this is
saying and now what this is saying is if
this value is false then show the class
of hidden if this value is true then do
not show the class so when we come here
you can see because this is set to false
none of the names are showing
however our name show names button isn't
rigged up yet so let's go ahead and add
that logic what we can do on our button
is say ng - and click and then in here
we can simply set dur list dot toggle we
can set it equal to true so we've seen
ng click before on this click we're
gonna set this variable that's on our
controller to true therefore this is
going to be evaluating to false and
therefore our classes not going to be
shown okay
come here refresh now click show names
and sure enough our names are here I
keep clicking show names and nothing
else happens because it's keep setting
this to true well in the next video
we're gonna show you we can swap this
show names button with a high names
button whenever we click this making
this a little bit more of a toggle
rather than just a turn on and never be
able to turn off sort of situation so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorial so if you have any questions or
comments have it come in the video or
