level up Tut's
today we're going to show you how to add
an article using a Drupal's predefined
article content type so just like last
time we're going to go to add content
here and you'll notice articles one of
our options we're just going to select
that if you notice this is the exact
same except for it has tags and it has
an option to add an image so we're going
to title this my first Drupal article of
course you can you know take it or title
it whatever you want we can just give it
tags of article test these so these are
comma separated so this will just add
one tag this is an article actually
notice I forget the t here okay so we
can also add an image
let's click Choose file I don't even
know if I have any images on here
actually let's go to my downloads I have
to have something here is our wallpaper
which is actually a gigantic image might
not take that now it looks like we're
just below the 128 megabytes limit that
it has okay so we're going to not
provide a menu link for this revision
options not going to use a revision
comments we'll leave open because it's a
blog post or an article so people might
want to leave comments and we're also
going to keep this promoted to the front
page so you can see what happens when
you promote an article to the front page
here and we're going to leave it
published so let's click Save okay your
your first group article has been
created here's our image it'll say
submitted by admin on so this is all
default information built in the display
of the content type in the next couple
of tutorials we're going to be showing
you how to customize your content types
and it's going to be involving changing
the display the output so we can do all
sorts of things from
changing the default size of this image
to what is actually output in what order
so you're not just stuck with this in
this order so as you can see here and
you can add a new comment these are your
comment settings everything should be
good
so this is our article last time it
added our page to this main navigation
we told it not to do that so it's not
there if we go to our home page you'll
notice that before this said there was
no content you know click here to add
Drupal content now because this has been
selected to promote to the front page
here it is on our front page our first
blog post so out of the box
Drupal offers really basic tools to get
you going to creating a basic page and a
blog if you know CSS and this is all you
need to do then that's pretty much it
of course there's tons more to learn in
Drupal Drupal is so robust we're going
to be going over all sorts of things and
like I said just keep watching there's
going to be a lot to learn in the next
tutorial we're going to show you how to
create your own content type since this
is my site I'm going to have a section
where I'm going to show off projects
that I'm working on so in the next
lesson we're going to show you how to
create something like that where I can
upload whatever I need whether it's a
video or an image or you know anything
however I want it and you can set that
all up so what will happen is instead of
uploading a page or an article you have
your own unique type so that's what's
coming up
once again this is Scott with level up
tuts if you have any comments or
questions please leave a comment hit us
at that Twitter or LevelUp tuts thanks
