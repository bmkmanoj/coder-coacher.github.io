up Tut's and today I'll be continuing
our theming series in Magento and we're
just going to get familiar with the
little things see it we printed our
theme here in the last lesson we just
gave it a purple background because it's
the color I wanted to give it and we
have nothing else here there's no real
structure to our site you can see the
contents coming in the same way it was
before
there's just no stylings whatsoever
we're getting a lot of broken images all
sorts of crazy stuff going on so the
first thing I want to draw attention to
is this logo area this header up here
I'm going to take you know maybe like a
top-down approach here we're going to
fix stuff starting up here and then I'm
going to get into a how we're going to
customize layout files and stuff like
that but for this first lesson I'm just
going to show you what we can do with
this header and image stuff up here and
in fact I'm going to change what this up
with this file is the logo that we're
looking at and then I'm going to get rid
of this this text here because I don't
need this I don't need this here okay
so let's actually check this out I don't
know if anybody's level of familiarity
with things like inspect element but in
Chrome or Safari and now in Firefox by
default there's an inspect element so if
you right select something you can see
this inspect element I think it's called
something else in Firefox but it used to
be only done through a plug-in called
Firebug but for here we're just going to
be inspecting this it might opens on the
side here I'm not going to get into the
configuration of that right now but you
should probably open up on the bottom
and as you can see here here's our HTML
for our page and here's our CSS we can
sort of look through and see what Styles
everything's getting but if you'll
notice we have this image and the image
it's looking for is in skin front end
base default images logo jiff and we
actually don't want it to be pointing at
this image because we don't have that
image existing so what can we do to add
a new image here well we could just add
this logo dot
to this file for this folder actually
let's pull up that file structure so you
can see that so as you can see how I'm
going skin front-end base default images
and there's nothing here that says logo
and the reason why there's nothing here
is because in the other files let's go
to the default and then we're going to
go to default you'll notice in here
there is probably going to be in fact a
logo Jeff here it is and this is what
you're seeing when you had your other
theme loaded so if we were to grab this
file and throw it into our theme it
would work and we would have our image
there because as we explained in the
past couple of tutorials Magento uses
some fallback methods where if it
doesn't find things that it's looking
for and your theme it's going to go look
in the base default so I'm gonna
actually copy this image into our theme
here now if i refresh this page we
should see that the logo comes in right
here but I don't want this logo I want
the level up tuts logo and more
importantly this level up tuts logo
where is it it's a painting it doesn't
look anything like it it's not a Jif
it's not the the image that it is
looking for here so where can we find
that if we go into configuration under
header it's going to ask what image
you're looking for we're looking for
under images and then logo slash Jim
well what if we just change us to a list
with PNG so it's now going to be looking
for the logo ping and the alt text is
going to be level up that's and the
Welcome type welcome message is what do
you want to buy I don't know what just
came up with that off down my head so
okay this is going to say but we'll
refresh our page it's not going to be
able to find this anymore
this is level up Tut's here I still
don't actually want anything to say
anything here and I could do that a
couple of ways one of which I'll show
you in a second so I'm going to grab our
ping
well that I have of our logo and I'm
going to throw it into our file
structure and then the logo is going to
be back and working so let's drop this
in here and they get rid of this other
one so we don't need it
okay let's refresh cool so here's this
level of Tut's it's a logo comes in fine
we can change that no problem now what
happens if you don't you want to get rid
of this text I don't I don't really want
this here well you could come in here
and I could just delete this let's save
this refresh our page once this is done
and it's gone and that's fine but if
you'll notice in our code here we still
have this HTML and it's a strong tag
within an h1 that says logo I mean
really we don't need this code in here
so I'm actually going to eliminate this
code all together because why I have
extraneous HTML if you don't need it so
going into our file structure I'm going
to actually go to the base theme because
right now we don't have any layout files
in our site we don't have any template
files so let's go to all the way back
here we can go to app and then design
I'm actually going to open up one of
these right here so in front-end I'm
going to go to level up default and then
over here I'm going to go to base
default and we're going to go to
template so these template files these
are sort of the HDR that PHP templates
that are generating the content of your
site and we'll get into how you can find
exactly what content gets generated by
what template in a second but for right
now we're going to go to page and open
this one up and then under HTML I'm
going to grab this header ok and so in
my um see in my template file my
template folder right here we're going
to make a new folder and it's going to
be paid
and then inside of page we're going to
make a do file that says HTML and then
the side of that we're going to put this
header file just going to copy it and
paste it because I want to modify their
existing what I don't want to have to
rewrite this myself
and I'm going to open this up in my text
editor sublime text okay so here's our
file and if you'll notice one thing you
can always do to just make sure that
you're editing the right file and that
your site is seeing this right file you
could come in here and just somewhere
you just write tests this is something I
just do a lot to make sure that
Magento's and seeing the right template
that I'm editing myself right fresh this
you know this test comes in right here
if you don't see any sort of test or
anything whatever you wrote first make
sure you didn't put it inside of any if
statement that maybe isn't getting
executed second make sure that your
folder structure is the exact same as
the folder structure you pulled it from
so here like I said we did template page
HTML here I recreated those folders
template page HTML so this one is going
to override this one however magenta is
still going to be grabbing the rest of
these other templates from the default
theme okay so let's make some
modifications if you remember I didn't
like that that strong tag was there for
no reason when we weren't using it if
you'll notice it was inside of our aged
one with a class of logo I'm going to go
in here and see this strong it's going
to be asking to get the logo alt strong
so who needs it
I don't I'm going to save this come back
out here and I'm going to refresh our
page and you'll notice of course that
text still isn't there but more
importantly if we inspect this the
strong tag isn't there and even if we
add something here into our logo image
alt text where we headed before we just
took out that line of PHP that was
generating that on the page so if you
refresh you still won't see it doesn't
matter it's gone we don't need it I
never wanted it okay so this is how we
can start getting to editing some
template files okay we can just copy and
paste them
from the base default theme and then we
can throw them into our own as long as
the fault filter structure is the same
Magento will see your new one and use
that one instead of the default one okay
well this is Scott with envelope Tut's
if you have any questions please leave a
comment the video in the next lesson I'm
going to show you some cool developer
tools that show you exactly what
template belongs to what section of the
page so you can get in and knowing
exactly what files you can edit or
change yourself as always thanks for
watching and feel free to hit us up on
Twitter level up Tut's
know on Facebook the link for that is in
our subscription page on our YouTube
account so just let us know what you're
thinking and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
