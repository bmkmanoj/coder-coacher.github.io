up Hut's and today we're going to take
this front page a little one step
further and we're going to complete our
look that we have going with this image
and we're just going to do a little bit
more at our XML to control the way this
layout so if you're the type of person
that likes a visual approach you can
always come to this graphic editor click
and drag and start moving stuff around
to position it or if you're the more the
type that likes to go into the code you
could always come into this XML and
change the margin top here for your text
view of your image view any of that
stuff well we want to have this entire
relative layout we want to give it a
color for its background so that
everything sits nicely with the purple
so I have the purple color locate
already loaded up in my clipboard I'm
just going to be able to paste it in I'm
going to go into this relative layout
here I'm going to hit enter at the next
line and here I'm going to start typing
I'm going to have Android and then we're
going to do :
and if you'll notice you get all these
sort of options here these are all the
things that you can put here and you
could scroll through them and see all
the awesome
different selections you have here and
maybe you can get an idea about what you
can do and what you can't do well if
you're like me I know that I want to
change the background here so I found
this one that says background in fact if
we were to start typing background it
would show you that the only one that is
likely to be background is going to show
up and even gives you a little tip that
says a drawable to use as the background
color so I'm going to enter and I'm
going to paste in my hex value for the
level of Tut's purple here I'm going to
save this and let's click over to our
graphical layout and you can see it's
pretty close and you can see it's it
looks pretty good but the color is not
quite matching up and you might be
wondering is that something that's
actually true or if this maybe is
androids way of showing you this image
well I've gone ahead and I've clicked
run on this and I have this booted up in
my Android virtual device and as you can
see it is in fact the same color
although I did use a sort of crappy
compressed version JPEG version of the
image which I wouldn't want to do for an
actual production app but this is just a
for my personal for these tutorials here
and if you'll notice this image isn't
quite lining up it's it's looks like
it's hugging this left side so the color
is good and that much of it we like but
this isn't quite right here we want to
have this image be centered so let's
come back to our app here so if we come
here we can click on this and there's
actually a centering button a center
horizontal link button and if we click
this you'll see it has this green line
through it and if we go to our main
activity you can see exactly what that
did so what it did is it added this line
here to our XML and you could have very
well just type this line yourself
however if there's a button that does it
I mean it might save you some time
depends on what kind of programmer you
are this is Android layout Center
horizontal equals true so to me clicking
about clicking the image and then
clicking that button is a lot faster
than typing that however if you're quick
type or whatever you could certainly do
it either way so if we save this and now
let's run it again I'm going to go back
to my emulator and once this is done
saying launching we'll see it a reshoe
up here in our app and now our image is
centered perfect only one small problem
now we have this hello love up touch
when we press it it says changed you
can't read it it's it's unreadable
so let's come back to our XML here and
we can do this one in the XML itself
because I like going back and forth just
to show you you know there's both ways
of doing it and so we can come to
Android and we're going to hit colon and
we know this is the text and as you can
see it knows it's a text view already so
it's giving us our options and you can
see all these different different items
here so like we said before text color
tells you it's the text color and
ferger's new pound FF and just success
for white and it's the hex value for
white if you're not familiar and we
don't like the size of the font so I'm
going to enter and I'm going to say
Android and we want a text size so we
can say this text size
and let's just try 26 DP just to see
where that goes and if you'll notice
we've been using DP this whole time this
whole time but when we try to use DP
here it says you should use SP so the
best part about these little tools are
is that they're going to help you out
let's say if you're in a something
situation like this there you let's say
you're in a situation like this where
you're new to this and you're coming in
here you see DP everywhere so you type
DP well SP stands for scalable pixel
it's basically a pixel that is scaling
to the device size it's you know not
quite a true pixel so let's save this at
26 white and let's come to here with
this nice big beautiful level up tuts
and I'm going to click run one more time
and we're going to see this app load up
here and it's now going to be totally
readable okay so here's our app we press
it changed beautiful so this is looking
good I mean this is a much nicer looking
app than we had a second ago so this is
just skimming the basics of what you can
do with this XML layout there's all
sorts of stuff and we're going to get
into all of it so as always leave a
comment on the video if you have any
questions I'll do my best to get to them
this is not my full-time job I just do
these videos for fun so as always you
know we accept donations but we're
really just doing this to spread the
knowledge and stuff like that so if you
have any questions hopefully somebody
else can get to you if I can't get to
help you but I will do my best to answer
your questions when I can okay as always
this is Scott with LevelUp tuts and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
