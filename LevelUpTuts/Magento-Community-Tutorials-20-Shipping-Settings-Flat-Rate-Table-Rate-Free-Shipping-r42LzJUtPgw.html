level of Tut's and today I'm going to
show you how to adjust the shipping
settings in your Magento site okay so
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to go to system and then
configuration this is where the shipping
settings are for your store so under
configuration there's a right down here
under sales they're shipping settings
and shipping methods first we're going
to check out shipping settings shipping
settings basically just sets up where
your store stuff is so the origin is
going to be where your store is located
I'm located in Maschine so just say
Michigan I'm just going to use a fake
zip code here I'm just going to say Ann
Arbor and okay yeah so you get the idea
this is your origin and the options and
if you want to allow to ship to multiple
addresses to me that doesn't sound like
a lot of fun as somebody owning a store
however if your company is allowed to
ship to multiple addresses in one order
um you want to select that to be yes so
I'm going to select that to be no
because I personally don't I don't want
that for my store
okay so save this and then next we're
going to go to down here we're going to
go to shipping methods and here I'm
going to show you how to do table rate
shipping if you see they have all these
options a flat rate table rates free
shipping UPS USPS FedEx DHL so the only
ones I'm going to go over I'll go over
flat rate table rates in this video and
then free shipping and then in the next
video I'm going to show you how to set
up UPS USPS and FedEx and DHL are pretty
similar but you have to have a count
there I don't have an account so I'm not
going to have to get into that but it's
pretty self-explanatory after you see
how these other ones are set up okay so
flight rate it's exactly how you'd
expect it and they if it's enabled it's
just going to the title be flat right
this is whatever your client will see
when they're checking out in fact let's
actually throw something in the cart
here and let's actually check out with
something proceed to checkout and I
don't know if it's going to let me ask
not going to I'll check it out
guest and okay I'm going to ship to this
address if you select Center ship to
different address it's going to let you
fill in another address so basically
because the only one we have enabled
right now it says flat rate fixed it's
at five dollars come in here fixed flat
rate five dollars if you wanted to
change that as you can see those words
are exact same as here if you were to
change this just standard shipping or
just to say shipping method name
shipping whatever and then you change
the price and that would be reflected
here in your checkout you can also have
a handling fee to be added on as well
however you might as well just put it in
shipping and then you could have your
own displayed error message let's say if
it's not working for in allowed
countries let's say you're only shipping
to the United States you could say
specific countries and then you could
come down here and United States or if
you're only a shipping the UK UK so if
you don't want to ship the entire world
up which you might now want to I would
be on here and check this you can hold
option and select other ones so you're
going to want to make sure that that's
all correct and then show method if not
applicable no you probably won't because
why would you want me to select it if
it's not applicable and if you have
multiple different shipping types
available you could you have a sort
order here to see which one is the most
important which one should be at the top
of the list so this is flat right it's
just going to apply a flat right every
single person that buys something from
your store will get it be the same price
alternatively we have free shipping
which is free right now it's not enabled
if we enable it another option here will
be free shipping you could choose
between it and it's going to charge the
person nothing so maybe you're having a
special or something you want to put on
free shipping then go right ahead choose
free shipping and that will give your
clients free shipping if you go to table
rates here you're going to see some
stuff this is waiters destination price
averse destination office stuff but no
actual table you might be wondering how
you can actually set the table rates so
we're going to say let's see number of
items verse destination because we want
to say that well everybody will do price
versus destination if they
up to $50 they'll get a certain shipping
price if they spend up $5,200 they'll
get another certain shipping price but
how can we actually see what that table
rate is well where the first thing we
have to do I just saved this always
going to lose into these other settings
is we want to go to this default config
here if we change this to our main
website you now see this export CSV so
if I export this what it's going to do
is it's going to download this the CSV
file and me open it in a Google Doc that
way you can exactly see as a spreadsheet
what it would look like okay so now you
can see that the spreadsheet that it
created the CSV is a country region
state postal zip order subtotal and
shipping price what's really cool here
is you can say that because we're doing
a subtotal verse location you could say
whatever the code here is for United
States let's say we're on the shipping
to United States here you would just say
USA and then Regents date since we're
not going to care about Regents date
it's going to be the same for all of
them and then again for zip and postal
code I'm putting a stresses in here and
this is sort of wildcard it can mean
anything and then so we're going to say
if your order is anywhere from $0 to $20
the shipping price will just be $5 and
then here we can have a second line I'm
just going to copy and paste
oops I'm just going to copy and paste
all of this stuff onto a couple more
lines here and so now we can say if
you're so let's say the other one is
from 0 to 1999 that will be $5 if it's
$20 to $50 it's going to be something
else and it's just over $50 to just
under $100 it's going to be 2015
and ten okay so now let's say the the
person spent $1,000 in your store the
shipping price would be twenty dollars
so you're going to want this to go up as
much as you could account for somebody
buying so this is nice way to do it if
you don't want to have anything super
complex or anything table rate shipping
is nice and easy you can just have a
table rate set up and depending on what
kind of items you're selling if they're
all pretty very similar this might be
the way for you to go so the next thing
you need to do would be to save your CSV
as it is here and then just like we
exported this if you choose this import
Choose file you can upload your table
rate shipping and then the rest of the
things are pretty much the same as the
flight rate you can change the title say
if we go back to our default
configuration you can change the title
all this stuff you can even say that you
know selected countries in the stroke
sort order handling fee so it's pretty
much the same other than you can upload
this CSV file to dictate sort of price
or location vers destination okay well
that's it for setting a table rate flat
rate and free shipping the next lesson
I'm just ready to set up UPS once again
this is Scott with level up Tut's and
