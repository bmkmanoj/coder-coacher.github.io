of tots and today we're going to kick
off our html5 series and this first
video isn't going to die
to any code so if you just want to jump
into code and get going feel free to go
onto the next one
but first I really just wanted to give
an overview of what html5 really is and
you know people might be thinking html5
is this big thing it's you know scary or
whatever it might just be mysterious
because it has this name html5 but
really html5 is just the next version of
HTML and using html5 is really no
different than using HTML so learning it
is really not a you know a big deal
however you should be using html5
because you can and you could have
before but now especially I haven't
started a project that's not html5 in a
few years now and you shouldn't really
be using anything other than html5 at
this point anyways so what is what is it
exactly I mean it's an incident the next
increment in the version of HTML you
could just say it's HTML in fact many
people are pushing for to not even be
called HTML to just call it HTML there
it is because that's really what it is
but what can it what does it offer you
that's different from html5 or HTML 4.1
or HTML in general well it gets rid of a
few elements that aren't being used and
people aren't going to really care about
anyways like frame and stuff like that
and it adds some new elements like
section and header and footer these
sticks are going to make your code more
semantic so that's just really semantics
it's just going to be changing the way
you write some of your codes it's not
going to be presentational at all but it
also offers things like video tag audio
tag which use your browsers built-in
functionality to render you know video
controls and audio controls so that
you're really taking advantage of
whatever device you're on and whatever
browser you're using it's going to be
using their controls not whatever ones
you are built and therefore it doesn't
have to rely on flash or plugins or
anything like that so what else does it
offer I mean it also offers something
called the canvas which canvas is just
an HTML tag
and campus is a little mysterious
because it's so many cool things you can
do with it but HTML canvas tag is just
an element just like any other element
it just allows as a canvas for
JavaScript so you can write some really
complex JavaScript to make some really
complex interactions 3d 2d using you
know WebGL and all sorts of stuff and
you can make some really awesome stuff
with canvas in html5 but canvas is not
html5 it's just an element just like any
of these other elements so what this
series is going to do is we're going to
teach you how to build sites in html5
we're going to go over the new the new
elements the new tags what exactly they
mean when to use them
what sort of the semantic benefits of
them are which ones are still maybe in
flux because you know the the html5 as a
whole is is a little bit you know it's
changing for instance the age group tag
has been in and out of the specification
you know for a couple years now I
believe it's out currently so people
have various opinions on things like
that and we're going to you're going to
give you a little bit of insight into
all of that we're also going to teach
you how to use video and audio using
those new tags and what cool stuff you
can do with that and we're going to get
into some canvas stuff we're not going
to go canvas crazy you might not be
building 3d games in canvas with this
series but you will learn the basics of
getting around canvas and some cool
stuff you can do with it so how can you
use html5 right now what we're going to
get starting the next video with your
first html5 site and how compatible is
it going to be will can be compatible
with pretty much any modern browser that
people are using and even back to IE 7
and so with something called the html5
Shiv or shim depending on which can't be
run on the name of that but we're we're
going to get your site working just like
it would if it was not html5 so follow
along with the series check it out we
got a lot of stuff coming and I hope you
like it as always this is Scott with
