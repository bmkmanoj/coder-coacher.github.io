tutorials and in this video we're gonna
be talking about props and react now
props are a very important concept in
react and definitely something you're
going to want a good foundation on so
this video is going to cover all of your
foundational skills for using props okay
so in our last video we get started
writing our very first react component
and it added absolutely nothing of
anything to our site other than this
text that says welcome to react which
was already there in the first place so
we're basically at a net zero here we
haven't really done a whole lot so in
this video I can't promise that we will
have anything even more exciting than
this but we are going to learn about one
of the basic principles with and react
and we're gonna learn a little bit about
some nice new JavaScript stuff as well
so let's get talking about props and
react now a prop is a property on a
component and the basic way that
components talk to one another
now components talk in sort of a one-way
manner and that's not to say that there
aren't ways around that but things drill
down from the top to the bottom so for
instance welcome right here is a sub
component of app right it's a child of
the app component and because of that
the data it needs to flow downwards from
an app into welcome through what's
called props now you can pass in props
into any component just simply by giving
it a prop so let's just say this is the
text right this is our welcome text and
this is now a prop and we can assign
this to something by saying equals and
then I'll have some string here now you
could actually assign this to things
like brackets here as well you could
pass anything as a prop you could pass
in a string you could pass in an object
you could pass in a function anything
that's in JavaScript can be passed into
a prop and it often will be used a lot
of that stuff right you can occasionally
pass in pretty much
anything you want so before we define
this constant variable welcome and we
were using it down in our welcome let's
actually go ahead and take the string
welcome to react and let's remove this
entirely and let's paste it in here as
our text prop so our welcome component
now has a prop of text and we can access
this prop and our child component simply
by coming down to our child now keep in
mind here if we head to our command line
or our app here this thing's gonna be
broken but one of the things I really
love about create react app is that they
add in this nice little error finding so
because of this we can see our error
being displayed right here and so check
it out you can see this is one of the
things I love about this and often times
I'll get messages about how do I fix how
do I fix that and the best way to fix
things is to well read the errors so you
can see this area says on line 24
welcome is not defined and if we head
down here you can see we're using this
variable welcome on line 24 and we never
defined welcome anymore because I
deleted it so obviously this is where we
want to start changing things but like I
mentioned before just follow the errors
they're going to tell you what's wrong
so here we have our text and we have our
h1 and inside of here we would like it
to output the text from our prop well we
can access props and react simply with
this dot props so if I change welcome to
this dot props and then dot text okay
remember because the name of the prop is
text so save this and now if we head
back to our app you can see we have
welcome to react and we can change
welcome to react welcome to using props
and now you can see this has been
updated so what we've done is we've
passed data from a parent to a child to
know in the last example we just had a
global string that was this constant
that we were just outputting that isn't
something you're gonna do super often
interact what's more common is that that
data whether it's an array of things or
an object or a string a function lives
in a parent and gets passed down into
the children well a common example let's
say if you're building out a movie list
like we will be doing you have an array
of movies and then you iterate over that
array and output each movie as its own
item so in that case you would have an
array of movies you would iterate over
it and you would have a child component
which would be an individual movie and
you could pass in that entire individual
movie into that individual movie
component and that component would know
what to do with the data now this is
something you're gonna be doing later in
this series and it's gonna be super easy
so as you can see here we are using
props and the only props that exist on
that this component are the ones that we
define it and since we've only defined
text and the text is equal to welcome to
using props that's all that we can
output out here so this is something
that's very common you're going to be
doing this all the time however let's
talk about a way that we can make this
text a little bit better let's say
you're outputting this a whole bunch of
times and now obviously it makes no
sense to output the step preps that text
a whole bunch of times but can you
imagine having to write this not perhaps
every single time doesn't that just seem
laborious right that seems totally
unnecessary so what we can do is this
object assignment deconstructing where
we come in here into our render function
but before our return function this is
also something that is going to be a
common technique in react is actually
doing some JavaScript before your return
and keep in mind this is just a method
here if you were to say let's say
counsel log hi right here rect isn't
gonna complain because this is an area
for just JavaScript right so let's go
ahead and assign a variable by
deconstructing an object and that seems
scary because it's a bunch of jargony
words but it's really just being able to
pull out the text variable from
this object so we don't have to write
the stop props every time so we can do
that by saying Const and the syntax for
this is curly brackets and then the name
of your new variable which is simply
text and we're going to be pulling out
text from this dot props so this syntax
is something you will see very very
frequently we're defining text is equal
to well the object property inside of
this stop props that matches this text
so this doesn't make a ton of sense
right now because we just have one
property but let's say you had several
properties you could do comma prop 2 or
prop 1 prop 2 whatever and pull all of
these variables out and then you never
have to write the step props ever again
it's just a time-saver it doesn't
necessarily make your code any better
but it does make it easier to read
because now down here where we have app
that title we can change this text to
simply just text because this variable
is defined right here so now inside of
our h1 we can simply see it just as text
rather than the step props dot text
taking up all that space and here we can
come to our component and see obviously
that everything's still working we're
not getting any big flashing errors so
let's take a look at that syntax one
more time it's Const brackets text
brackets is equal to this dot props
semicolon and if you are getting an
error remember follow the error message
and fix your error okay so these are
props in react it's a core concept it's
an absolute basic building block of
using react and that's something that
you're going to be doing even in this
series over and over and over and over
and over again so in this example it
seems kind of basic but once we like I
said start iterating over things and
start being able to reduce code by
making things drier and not repeating
ourselves you're gonna see the true
power of stuff like this as well as the
overall component based workflow of
react so these are props in react now
this isn't the only
we're going to be talking about props
now there's a lot of different things
that are important to know about props
such as prop types and default props
that sort of stuff but these are things
that we're going to be covering once our
example is a little bit more fleshed out
than just text you know so check it out
this is props and react in the next
video or can be talking about state
state is another core concept of a react
component and anytime we have a
component that is a component or a peer
component which we haven't talked about
yet you will have access to state so
fire up the next video and learn a bit
about state within react as always if
you want to learn more head to store dot
level up tutorials calm and purchase
this series outright or you can become a
pro at level up Vittorio's comm forward
slash Pro and you can get access to all
