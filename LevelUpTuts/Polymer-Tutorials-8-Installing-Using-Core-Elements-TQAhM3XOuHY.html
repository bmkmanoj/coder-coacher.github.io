of tutorials and today I'm going to show
you how you can drop in core elements
created for you by the polymer team that
take care of little functionality for
you and the example that we're going to
be using today is the core tool tip so
it's basically going to be a tool tip
where you don't have to code any
JavaScript any CSS or anything like that
we simply pass it a couple of parameters
put in our text and it's going to create
a tooltip for us so let's check it out
we're going to get into that right now
so to get started the first thing we
want to do is grab the core elements now
the core elements include all sorts of
different elements that we can show you
within the polymer documentation here
and we'll do that in just a second after
we install them into our project if you
come to the polymer projects website
polymer - project org and then we go to
slash Doc's
slash elements slash core - elements
you'll see we're greeted with this page
that says get the polymer core elements
with a nice large button here you can
also get here by going elements and then
element guides and then using elements
that will also get you to a place where
you can find this button so once we have
this get the polymer core elements we
can click this button now what this does
is essentially tells us several ways we
can install polymer but since we've been
using Bower already we're going to go
ahead and install with Bower
now this command says bower install
polymer core elements I'm going to copy
this exactly like this however I'm also
going to use the hyphen - save that we
used before because that's going to save
it in our Bower config file so from the
root of our project I'm just going to
paste this in at this bower install
polymer slash core - elements however
but before the polymer part I'm going to
do - - and save and then a space so just
like that now we can hit enter that's
going to install the polymer core
elements into our project and save this
information into our Bower config now
because we already had the core
component page installed from when we
installed polymer in the first place
it's asking us which version we would
want to use
it says version for point or 0.4 or 0.5
point zero
I'm going to pick the latest version and
just say number two zero point five
point zero now again it's asking me the
same for which version of polymer I'm
just going to go ahead and select the
latest which is zero point five zero
okay now we have all of our core
components installed now what this
doesn't mean is it doesn't mean we're
using any of these core components yet
so let's come back to our code and as
you can see nothing's really change in
our code of course because we're really
just installing these components into
this Bower components folder and you can
see what used to only be one or two
folders in here is now a whole ton of
folders so what we have are things like
the core drop-down core Docs core
collapse core animation there are a lot
of elements here and each of these sort
of do different things in fact if we
want to learn more about these elements
we can go directly to polymers
documentation and then under core
elements here under the elements tab
it's going to list out all of these
elements so here we can scroll through
and sort of see what exists and let's
check these out so let's actually check
out the core tooltip so what we have
here is we can get the core tooltip
individually by clicking this and it's
going to tell us how we can install just
the core tooltip by itself so we don't
have to install every component like we
just did so that's great if there's a
particular component or a set of
components you want to use it's going to
be smarter to grab just the components
you need instead of all of them but for
this example we're just playing around
with it it's no harm in downloading all
of them now we also want to see how this
thing works
so let's see the demo I'm just going to
open up this core tooltip demo in a new
tab and you can see we have a nice demo
here where you can toggle some
functionality here so we have a position
left position top position bottom
position right when you hover over this
it's a fancy effect you can
it just sort of fades in rich tooltip
with HTML and it's not just text larger
tooltips for mobile and then this one is
it completely disabled so as you can see
this element basically just allows us to
have what you're used to when using a
standard tooltip let's go ahead and take
some of their example code directly this
core tooltip on the tool tip and just
drop it directly into our code so I'm
coming to my HTML here and just below
our hello world element actually let's
just remove our hello world an element
entirely I'm going to paste this in and
you can see this is a little bit
different already from our previous
elements that we've built so what's
great about using these core elements is
that not only do you get experience
using these pre-made elements that you
don't have to remake yourself but you
also get to see some of the techniques
that have been made by the polymer team
themselves so that you can build better
elements yourselves so we have this core
tool tip and then inside of it's going
to be a span okay so let's go ahead and
go back to our browser and refresh and
we have this hover over me and nothing
happens well sure we use this element
we've installed the bower core
components but as you can see we're not
actually loading up those elements at
all so we can just have another script
tag and the source for this is going to
be within bower components as well so
it's Bower underscore components and
then you'll notice that we have down
here we have web component Jas folder
and inside of here we have a web
components min Jas so let's go ahead and
just paste that in there so let's go
ahead and just paste it in there this is
just going to give us some additional
browser support okay
so that's good we're loading up web
components duh Jas now like we imported
our hello world HTML we're also going
want to import this core tooltip so
actually let's get rid of our hello
world for now and we actually don't even
need this platform j/s so let's go ahead
and modify this hello world dot import
that we have here to actually be the
element that we want to be using so if
you'll go in your Bower components
folder you should be able to find the
core tooltip which we have right here
and then inside of here we have core
tooltip HTML so just like we called our
elements hello world we can do the same
thing and I'm going to copy this bower
components so there's no spelling
mistakes and then we'll call core
- tooltip and then inside of that we
want the core tooltip HTML so as you can
see instead of importing some sort of
hello world or custom element that we've
created all we're doing is directing our
link to the component that we actually
want to use okay so we now have this
core tooltip file loaded up we're using
our core tooltip let's go ahead and
refresh our page now let's hover over
this guy and you can see that we have
this I'm a tooltip showing up and we
didn't have to do any CSS we didn't have
to do any JavaScript we just added a
couple files and all the sudden we have
this tooltip and you can see it's
getting the I'm a tooltip text directly
from this label obviously we can edit
this save it
refresh and see our text is changing
here as well now let's head that towards
the polymer documentation here and you
can see we have some more options we can
pass in things like position right so
let's go ahead and pass in this
attribute here and just like this just
like any attribute in an HTML element
we're just calling position right and
like we've seen when we were creating
our own custom elements
it just works right passing in these
attributes they know what to do with it
and looking more at the polymer
documentation here you can see that it's
really clear what you should be doing
right to disable the tooltip you simply
add disabled no arrow add no arrow
configuration options like this that you
can just drop into your project and it
just works so this has been a basic
introduction on using the core elements
what we're going to do in the next video
is going to be showing you layout
elements they're going to be elements
that you can lay out your project with
and those are going to be super helpful
and quickly getting started with a
layout for your page and then after that
we're actually going to start pulling
through some of these elements see what
makes them tick and then build some even
cooler things based on what we've
learned as always this is Scott would
love love tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video or hit us up at twitter or
facebook at LevelUp tuts we love to hear
from you thanks for watching and we'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
