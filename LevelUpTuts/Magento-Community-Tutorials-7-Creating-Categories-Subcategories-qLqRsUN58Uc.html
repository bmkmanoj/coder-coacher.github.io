up tuts and today I'm going to show you
how to create your very first category
using Magento Community Edition so as
you can see the categories on the site
are sort of how you can think of the
navigation that the categories appear up
top here in the navigation by default
and so far we have furniture electronics
and apparel which are the ones that came
with the sample data below in a
subcategory of furniture we have a
living room and bedroom under
electronics we have cell phones cameras
computers that each have their own
subcategories as well and then apparel
that has some subcategories as well so
we're going to create a couple of new
categories we're going to create a route
one in the Run will create a subcategory
just so you can see how that's going so
let's go to our dashboard and if you
remember if you need help getting there
it's just your URL slash admin and then
you can log in with your information
it'll take you here right here to your
admin panel so we're going to click on
catalog and then manage categories ok so
we're going to add a root category so
we'll click Add root category and this
is going to bring up this information
we're going to just call this you could
name it whatever you like based on what
your store is we're just going to call
this right now
level up products okay so this can be
any sort of category actually will
actually will name this tutorials
because they'll be a little bit more
fitting let's say we're selling
tutorials here and you could just say
did use a digital tutorial videos and
yeah ok this type okay so this
description this can show up on the page
if you'd like it to I'm just going to
keep the short and simple right now we
can always come back to this once we see
how this works
page title this is just going to be I'll
leave it as tutorials because that's
what I would like it to be and then
we're not going to upload an image for
this one just yet we'll do that in a
second I'll show you how that works and
the thumbnail image
no not right now and then we don't have
to follow these meta keywords we can
always come back and do that later it's
not something that's really important
specifically for this is it active
yes it's active you want to make sure
you select this checkbox here or else
it's not going to show up this is a nice
way of hiding and showing categories
without deleting them let's say one of
the categories on your site you know you
no longer selling this product so maybe
you don't want to delete it you just
want to take it offline for a little bit
that's a good way to do that and then
you can actually say not to include in
the navigation but we wanted to show up
so we will and then you don't have to
put anything in this for this URL key
it's going to generate automatically if
you don't and it's probably just going
to name it lowercase tutorials and
that's perfectly fine with me so I'm
going to leave it like that
so let's click under this display
settings tab under here it's going to
display products only testing if I want
to display a CMS block I don't as an
anchor nope I don't want to do anything
really special here I just want to
display the products and that's it okay
so custom design no we don't have a
custom design for this category we'll
get over to that in the more advanced
tutorials but for right now you don't
have to worry about this because we're
just going to let it use the same design
that the other categories are having and
then the products this is an easy way to
add products into your category since we
don't have any tutorial products let's
just add a computer and then a gaming
computer and let's see what else we'll
just add a couple of stuff here we can
take these off later once we're actually
have tutorials in our catalog but since
we don't you know no biggie we'll just
add these here just so you can see it in
action and let's save this category now
that we've saved it you can see that it
actually appears under our root category
right here root catalog whatever if
you're not happy with this position we
actually wanted to be under this root
catalog
it was my mistake actually by clicking
this root category button you're
creating an actual root here at the very
base so to get this to be exactly where
we want it to be we actually have to
have this
under our root catalog if you would have
selected add subcategory from the first
it would have worked however we're not
all hope is not last year we're not
losing this information you can actually
click and drag and we can put this right
up here under right underneath apparel
not over because if we like add it on
top of it it's going to make it into the
folder a subcategory as you can see it's
sort of doing that now let's pull it out
of here and let's put it right here
below so this is really nice and easy
you can just drag and drop it whatever
and it's going to take that into effect
and okay let's just click Save again I
should don't know if you have to click
Save but it's never hurts so let's
refresh this page and as you can see our
catalog is now showing up in the main
navigation our category that is is now
showing up in our main navigation here
it is tutorials if we give this a click
it's going to show the products that we
added to it here's our four products
it's using the same basic layout if we
would add an image
Oda popped up up here ok well let's add
a subcategory of this now and then we'll
put an image on that one just for fun ok
ok so to add a new subcategory we're
just going to go ahead and click on
tutorials here which is the what we want
the parent to be so then after we've
selected tutorials we can click add
subcategory and we're going to name this
let's see even the Gento to toriel's
cool and then I'm going to pick an image
here it's just a screenshot nothing
crazy can save that and then the only
thing that's really that you have to
select is name is active which yes we
want it to be and whether or not you
want to include it in your navigation
menu which we do we don't have any
custom designs or anything so we'll just
click Save and if you notice it's
automatically added this Magento
tutorials underneath our parent
tutorials and if we wanted to move this
to anywhere it's as simple as dragging
and dropping so let's check out our our
page here
so let's check out our page here so if
you'll notice here we now have
underneath tutorials in the gentle
tutorial subcategory under shop by it's
automatically added this to this menu
and it even tells you how many products
we have under Magento tutorials which at
this point we selected 0 so there is
none let's navigate to this magenta
tutorial so you can see how the page
layout worked with the image it's the
same image or it's the same layout but
since this image is huge
obviously this may not have been a great
choice for an image but it shows up
right here and then your products show
up below it so you're going to want to
pick an image that fits the space
adequately to what you want it to be of
course we didn't do that here this looks
awesome but just so you know this image
just comes in right underneath the title
and right above your products by default
of course once we get into template
editing you'll be able to change all
that stuff and make your own templates
and layouts but right now
that's pretty much the layout that
you're given with Magento so that's how
you create a category and a sub category
in the next couple of tutorials we're
going to be going over attributes after
we create our own attributes we can
create our new product types which are
Magento tutorials or we're just going to
treat these as physical products and
then maybe we'll make some digital
products along the way to to show you
how that works
