up tuts and today we're gonna continue
our html5 video with even more
awesomeness and this awesomeness is
going to be in the form of html5 or just
HTML attributes and if show you some of
the cool things that html5 video can do
without a whole lot of anything so we're
gonna get started and the first thing
we're going to show you is tabindex and
so we can set a tab index of 0 on this
video notice how we already have the
attribute of controls in here so that's
1 if we have this attribute tabindex
equals 0 I'll save this now let's come
to our code and refresh
so what tabindex does is velocity to
take control of video controls by
hitting tab and highlighting D video so
in this case tab and you can see they
highlight around it however Chrome is
sort of weird with this so it might be
better to see the effects of this on
Firefox in fact it doesn't really allow
you to do a whole lot right now in
chrome and what that might change it's
really something that shines better in
something like Firefox so let's
highlight the video here it's
highlighting now you can use a spacebar
to start and stop the video so that's
just one little accessibility thing
allows you to you know control your
video with the keyboard hitting forward
and back jumps the video forward and
back so that's really nice like I said
the chroma implementation of it right
now is currently a little weird but it's
just something that you know doesn't
take a whole lot extra to add and it
just makes the experience a nicer for
some people the next we want to have is
autoplay so let's type autoplay just
like you would expect and let's refresh
the page here you notice the video plays
immediately and on Chrome it plays
immediately as well what's really nice
about that is sometimes you don't want a
video to just be a controlled video
maybe you wanted to have a certain
effect and instead of just being like a
video with audio sort of thing so in
this particular instance when you
refresh the page the video is just going
to
start and the support for this is it's
pretty well supported autoplay supported
in pretty much every browser that
supports html5 video except for iOS and
Android now this is for actually a
decision they made with mobile browsers
because clearly a lot of people are on
mobile plans that are limited the amount
of data they can use so you don't want a
video that just starts playing and
downloading the video eating up some of
your mobile data that might make certain
users upset with your website and when
users get upset they don't come back so
that is a deliberate decision to not
make that available in those browsers so
next we have is let's go back to our
HTML we also have one called loop and if
we just type loop just like this if he
is gonna loop it exactly like what you'd
expect let me turn off the volume let's
refresh the page here and I'll get to
the very end of this video and you can
just see it in action there it goes
perfect perfect loop just starts off
immediately the only reason there's a
little fade is because there's a fade in
the video so that's great I have this
nice looping video okay so this video is
looping it's infinitely looping and it's
Auto playing which kind of gives a
little obnoxious so I want to do two
things first I want to take away the
controls simply because I want this
video to be more just a feature that
exists and I want to have it being muted
so just like that i refresh no more
controls and Pelt this html5 video is
really just like a moving image so
that's pretty cool and let's go for one
more attribute here and this one is
similar to autoplay in that it doesn't
work on mobile browsers because again
this has to do with the data usage so
this attribute is called preload so if
we do preload just like that it's gonna
start downloading the video right when
the page opens and now if autoplay
wasn't on and we saw our controls it
would start to download that video so
when your users played it it wouldn't
have to go and download it then which
could be nice
however again on mobile browsers that
doesn't work because they don't want you
to
the users data so let's see this and
let's come back here and then we have
this nice video feature and notice it
works just the same on Firefox it's just
basically a moving image and you might
be wondering why we might want to do
something like that well let's take a
look at an example and just so you know
I had nothing to do with the creation of
this site this is a site built for the
New York Times called snowfall and it
that looks awesome I mean look at this
so this giant billboard right here is
really an html5 video if we inspect this
let's pull up our inspector let's go
into this div you can see all the stuff
here actually it might be in this one
inside here we have our html5 video tag
and notice this is just like normal we
have our preload equals none option we
have let's see what other video options
were used to well there's a poster in
here which we didn't go over just yet
but I'll briefly mention and so this is
pretty cool cuz they're using this html5
video and you would never know it's an
html5 video I guess this sort of thing
just couldn't exist on the web like this
in the past so let's scroll down and
let's see some other cool things they do
with html5 video on this side this is
also an html5 video and look at how much
it adds to the site there's just some
really great usage of video all over
this so check this New York Times out
snowfall I believe is the es stuff
snowfall but great examples of html5
video all the way around so you could do
really cool stuff with this and I
briefly mentioned the poster tag while
looking at that poster is just going to
be a poster image so if you had your
controls on if you had your controls on
and it wasn't set to be autoplay we
could have a let's say a poster image
and all you have to do to define the
poster image is type poster equals and
then inside quotes have a path to an
image in this case I'm going to grow
one of these animal images just for fun
here just so you can see this in action
save this now let's check out our page
refresh and you'll notice the videos not
started we have this animal image and
it's a poster frame so now when we start
playing there's the video cool so these
are the attributes you have access to in
html5 video and they can really do a lot
to make your video a different
experience so check it out try all these
options just play around with html5
video in the next video we're going to
go over something called video for
everyone that has a flash fallback and
is really nice to support the browsers
that won't necessarily be able to be
using your html5 video so as always this
is Scott with level up cuts if you have
any questions or comments please leave a
come in the video or hit us up at
Twitter our level of Tut's let us know
what you're thinking we love to hear
from you as always thanks for watching
