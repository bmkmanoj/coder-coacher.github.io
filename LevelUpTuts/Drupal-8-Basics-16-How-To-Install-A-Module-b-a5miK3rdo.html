up tutorials and in this video we're
going to install some modules now
modules are key component about how you
can expand the functionality of Drupal
if you've used anything like WordPress
before where they call them plugins it's
a very similar concept module really
just adds extra functionality to your
site so let's get going by installing
some modules that we're going to be
using in another video so now we want to
add a module to our site and the past
this has been sort of a cumbersome
procedure you have to go to Drupal site
you have to click a download button and
then you have to physically drag that
file into that folder into another
folder making sure you've got everything
right before you can enable the module
in Drupal 8 adding modules is easier we
can come to extend from extent we can
click install new module what we can do
is grab the archive from the website or
we can install from a URL so it's
certainly no WordPress where you can
just search directly from within the
website but it makes it much easier
let's open modules in a new tab come
here and let's go ahead and look for one
so in the search bar we want to search
for path Auto all one word and what
we'll find here if we scroll down or if
we do a command F you'll see that path
Auto exists here
now it should be at the top but that's
alright I'm going to open path Auto in a
new tab now from path autos module page
I can actually click let's right-click
on the tar.gz copy link address now if I
paste this in here you should see
something like FTP drupal.org forward
slash files for slash project then we
have the actual name of the project and
the version followed by tardy tar.gz we
can click install from here and as you
can see path auto was installed
correctly so this is awesome now this is
something that we couldn't necessarily
this easily do in the old version of
Drupal we can now add another module if
we would like to or we can enable the
newly added
jool let's come to enable and let's
search for path and we can see path auto
now you'll notice something we're not
able to click this and you might be
wondering why if we click this drop down
you'll see it's missing some requires we
have some big red missings it's missing
see tools and it's missing token let's
head back to the module and you can see
that it is requiring token we can click
token and open that up in a new tab in
addition tokens going to be requiring C
tools so let's come and search for C
tools so you'll see it most installed
right here on the right hand side we
have Kaos tools with C tools and
parentheses let's go ahead and grab both
of these I'm going to find the Drupal 8
version nose has there 7 X 6 TEDx now we
have other releases where there's a
development release and an alpha release
typically you're always going to want to
grab the green one
however because there is no green one
available we're going to be having to
use a development release we're gonna go
and have to use this other release so
until there is a green one that we can
update to let's right-click on this 8
point X 3.0 alpha 23 we can copy the
link address we can add new module once
more paste in the link install this will
install chaos tools ok now let's click
add install another module and let's
install token and we can come here we
can simply copy this link address once
more notice how I'm grabbing the target
GZ instead of the zip I don't know if it
matters for this particular process but
the tar.gz is always going to be a
smaller file it's a another level of
compression there so I would always pick
the tar.gz whenever you can let's go
ahead and paste this in here once more
and install the last of our modules so
now we can have everything up and
running let's go ahead and click enable
newly installed modules and from now
because we have chaos tools we can just
select chaos tools here we'll leave the
other two unchecked however we may want
to check them later and let's comment
down to token and now with token we can
also check paths Auto let's install
so by downloading the plug-in to your
site it's simply just putting the
plug-in into a folder in a file in your
filesystem by clicking this install or
enable these plugins what it's actually
doing is telling Drupal to use them so
simply by into your site it's not making
them work we need to enable them before
they'll work cool so we've now just
installed three modules we went from
having no modules to three modules you
can come to Drupal site you can come to
modules so drupal.org slash project
slash project underscore module just
come to the site and find modules and
here you can search and find all sorts
of modules from slideshows to tabs to
all sorts of stuff so check out modules
you can see there's 33,000 modules on
here so there's a lot you can do to
extend to drupal like I said it's no
WordPress for the interface but it's not
bad and it's certainly better than it
used to be so now that we have path Auto
installed along with chaos tools and
token we can get started creating our
automatic path aliases as always this is
