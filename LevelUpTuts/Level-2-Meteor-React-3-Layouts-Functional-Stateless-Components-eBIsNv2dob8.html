tutorials and in this video we're going
to be taking our react router skills up
a little bit by working on functional
stateless components and building a
layout now we're gonna use this
functional stateless component as a
layout and we're going to be why and
when you would do that within react so
let's get started right now okay so now
we should see a little bit more of the
benefit in using a router like react
router here in fact what we're gonna do
in this video is basically grate a
layout and have that layout be the
wrapper for our application where we can
actually change the route so let's go
ahead and what we're gonna do is we're
gonna add a new folder and our client
folder and we're going to say we're just
gonna say new folder we're gonna this is
a folder a name of layouts and that this
is going to be let's add a new file
he'll just be the capitalize this main
layout dot J s okay now so inside of
main layout we're simply just going to
import react from react you might want
to put this in your keychain or
something because we're gonna be typing
this a lot and then when you don't make
any mistakes and now what we want to do
is we want to have a new constant
variable here this is going to be an
example of a stateless functional
component of which we'll go into a
little bit more as we go but what you
need to know about these are it's it's
not really super tied to react
we don't have a we're not extending a
component or something like that so
we're just having a constant variable so
a Const and this is going to be main
layout and main layout is going to be
equal to and the arrow function so we're
gonna have parentheses here then we're
going to have equals greater than make
our arrow and then brackets so what a
stateless functional component does is
it doesn't have a state and it doesn't
have a render function it's not
something like that it's simply a
function itself which is going to return
whatever you would like and this
case is just going to be JSX but let's
go ahead and the inside of here we have
a gate return okay and inside of here we
can have a div with a class name of main
layout now if you aren't familiar with
react and you didn't watch the beginner
series we need class name and not class
because this is JSX here there will be a
great day when that is gone out of react
if that ever happens although i've heard
that that is something that's in the
pipeline now inside of here we have our
main layout let's simply just output the
children now you might be wondering well
what's up with this where did the
children coming from well in react if
you encapsulate a component within
another component you can get the intent
the inside one right you can get that
inside component as this step props dot
children so in the past we would just
say this dot props dot children and
ideally what would happen is anything
passed into main layout would just
output well but this is a functional
stateless component and what we don't
have access to is anything right we
don't this this dot props that children
is going to throw an error it's gonna
throw an error of right away so what we
want to do is we want to import
essentially props into our function here
then this is even though I said the word
import we're not importing it here
we're executive essentially accepting
props into this as an argument and now
we can have access to props simply with
this so we can now access props dot
children passed in through this main
layout now last but not least we want to
export default main layout okay so this
is our layout right here all we're
simply doing is having a wrapper with a
main layout class name let's go ahead
and in our routes file
we also want to import in addition to
app we want to import main layout from
and we can look inside and we can look
inside of the layouts folder and then we
want to grab the main layout file like
this cool so now we get to see a little
bit about where this encapsulation that
we were talking about with the react
props that children even comes from
we're essentially going to be wrapping
our app in the main layout an app will
get rendered as the stop props children
so let's check it out what we're gonna
do is we're going to modify this route a
little bit basically we're going to
leave this path forward slash as is and
instead of component equals app though
this component is now going to be equal
to main layout in addition this self
closing tag here is no longer going to
be a self closing tag but a normal
closing tag like we have with our router
so closing like that and I'm gonna copy
this right here paste it down and what
we're gonna do inside of here is have a
route with also a path of forward slash
and then a component of app so the way
react router works here is that we can
actually wrap a component within a
component and give it this path now
what's cool here is that we'll show you
in a second that this can actually be a
default route but we can have multiple
things in here let's say we had multiple
components and this was going to be the
high route or let's say the ape type
correctly about route and then we could
necessarily pass them an about component
and in this instance right check it out
it'd be using the same layout but
forward slash normal would have an app
and forward slash about would have about
let's go ahead and comment this out
because we're actually going to be using
this in a minute so what we have here is
route forward slash path
is going to be grabbing the app inside
of the main layout so back to our app
and caught up on that high route height
did not match any routes
oh I'm navigated to high let's get out
of here okay
and as you can see what we have as a
white screen here but we do have our
class of main layout so what's going on
we are actually obviously we're getting
our main layout and we have props in
here and we have props that children I
mean technically this should be working
let's go ahead and actually instead of
here we can above our return we can give
this a little counsel log props that
children now there's a better way to go
about this I'll show you later on in
this series but what we want to do right
now as you can see that we're getting
this weird null we're getting null let's
see if we can change that what we want
to do is in our routes we want our route
path forward slash we want to change
this let's get rid of paths here and
instead of route let's come up here and
let's grab our index route so this is no
longer going to be a route it's going to
be an index route now an index route
doesn't take a path it essentially gets
its path from the component above it
right so path forward slash so index
route is going to be the default route
of this particular one I mean you would
still have if we had an about path you
would have it like this you wouldn't
have an index route more than one or
anything like that okay so what we're
doing now is we have an index route with
the component let's see if that actually
fixed our problem and you bet it did we
head back and here is our application
everything's all back to normal really
nice right I mean we have our layout we
have their HTML open here you can see
that we're clearly getting main layout
and inside of that we have our actual
component now the header is probably
something we want to have all over the
place right let's go ahead and head it
to our main layout and inside
our app that j/s we said just threw
everything in here let's go ahead and
cut header out of here like that and cut
it right out and let's head into main
layout and inside of main layout I'm
going to paste in my header now we had
this show all I'm actually gonna get rid
of this show all and bring this back
into app dot J s we can put this
directly above the main like that and
then the main layout we can leave the
header up here and this should be all
nice right check it out we have our
header we have our login buttons which
probably want to import let's cut the
import out of here like that and paste
it up top here because we're using it
but as you can see a functional
stateless component functions very much
like a normal component we just don't
have state and we don't have access to
things like this dot props we want to
bring them in with props now in the case
where you only have a couple of props
being used you can actually use
something like this you can use this new
fancy es 2017 or 2016 syntax yes
six or whatever the versions or whatever
where we can use an object and
essentially grab individual properties
from that object so we could grab
children as the object and then we don't
need the word props here and we can just
say hey give us the children right we're
bringing in children give us the
children right here see how everything
works right now the show button show all
button you can see is below our header
now but our header if we inspect this in
the HTML we have our main layout header
and then our other component so what
you're going to notice is that as we
grow we can pull things out of here that
are going to be used across all of our
pages such as the header put them into
our layouts you can have several layouts
and even design those layouts in here
with a separate row right let's say we
had a client base layout or something
like that or let's say an admin base
layout and we wanted every single admin
path to be in admin layout right this is
exactly how your routes files going to
end up looking do to just keep that
nesting up if you want to you can just
you can that's pretty deep if you'd like
that's the flexibility of react router
it keeps things nice and easy okay so
now we have officially our router up and
running we have a layout going and we
introduced a new concept called
functional stateless components now a
functional stateless component is going
to get you some performance benefits
down the line and not to mention this is
really just a function this is a
function that's using JSX here to you
know compile our stuff so this isn't
tied to react if we wanted to switch to
pre-act or inferno or some of these
other ones this should work right if
we're using JSX so super cool this is a
really nice technique to learn but
either way we have our layout and we
have our routing ready to go now in the
next video we're actually gonna do some
routing we're gonna create another page
that uses this main layout and we're
gonna show you how you can link between
pages and why you don't necessarily want
to do it with a standard anchor tag
which might be one of those things that
you just have to live with in red if you
