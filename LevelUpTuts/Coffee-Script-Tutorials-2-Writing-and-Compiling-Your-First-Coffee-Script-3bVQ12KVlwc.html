level up Tut's and today we're going to
be not only compiling our first
CoffeeScript document but we're also
going to be writing our first
CoffeeScript so it's really cool you're
gonna be really excited you're gonna be
hooked from the moment that you start so
I would recommend that you do have
JavaScript experience before starting
this because of course you you want to
have a good handle on JavaScript before
trying something like this out although
this does make JavaScript easier to
write the still core components are all
there and it does really help
just knowing JavaScript first okay so
you know take some JavaScript lessons go
to code Academy and do their JavaScript
read maintainable JavaScript JavaScript
the good parts any of that stuff and get
a good handle on it first okay but if
you got that let's uh let's get into
CoffeeScript here so what I'm gonna do
is I'm actually going to create a
document really quick and with your
CoffeeScript documents I'm just going to
save this in a folder called coffee that
I created you actually gonna use the dot
coffee file extension so we're going to
say script the coffee okay and we'll
just go save this and as you can see
here's my script coffee and now let's
come back here and if you look at the
usage commands for CoffeeScript on their
website you'll see there's all sorts of
stuff here you can type in - c4 compile
or - - fir compile or - I think up I'll
I mean you also that's actually going to
compile your file once what we actually
want to do is we want to set this up -
watch for changes in the future I'm just
going to be using an application like
code kit which is going to be watching
and compiling my CoffeeScript for me but
for right now we're gonna do it the
terminal way okay so first you want to
navigate to wherever your file is
located so let's see I just need to get
in my desktop and then a coffee okay as
you can see the only file we have in
here is script coffee okay
so let's type this command if you look
at their examples they actually have a
watch and compiled for changes recompile
every time your file is saved that
sounds like exactly what we want so
we're going to say coffee and then - -
watch - - compile and then you're just
going to have your document so our
document is script dot coffee okay now
when we hit enter it's going to say path
exists is now called FS exists compiled
CoffeeScript cool okay so really quick
let's go back to our sublime text if we
save this and then come to our terminal
it's going to say compiled CoffeeScript
every time you save this document it's
going to recompile it okay let's
actually go to my finder here and as you
can see before all we had was a coffee
file and now we have a script JS file
that it created for us both of them are
empty that's cool actually this one just
says a function call this whatever let's
really quick write your first line of
CoffeeScript so if you're familiar with
JavaScript any variable declarations
you're gonna have to say var and then
your variable name equals and then the
value well with CoffeeScript it's easy
you just have to do your variable name
equals value and what's even great is
you don't have to have a semicolon at
the end you know semicolons are great in
JavaScript and using them is very
important because if you don't use them
correctly you know you could have some
odd odd things happening in your code
but this makes it really easy cuz you
don't even have to worry about that
anymore you just just don't put
semicolons it also really helps because
a lot of times you don't use brackets or
parentheses things are done with
indentation
okay so let's type our first variable
declaration and it's just going to be
name is equal and then string Scott okay
you can put your own name whatever and
I'll just do let's say person is equal
to true okay
so let's save this
I'm gonna open up my coffee file or my
script file and we're gonna just have
them side by side here real quick it's
view layout columns - okay cool
so as you can see it's created this
forest of our name I'm a person named
Eagle Scott person equals true awesome
okay so this is your first CoffeeScript
look how nice and clean this is it
already I mean even though we just did
two variable declarations you had two
lines of code here and this output nine
lines of code well technically eight
lines of code but really cool and as we
get on further and further into
CoffeeScript you're just going to be
amazed at some of the stuff that this
outputs with such little code in
CoffeeScript once again this is Scott
with level up Tut's if you have any
questions as always leave a comment on
the video hit us up at Twitter level up
Tut's Liz know what you're thinking of
course like I said all these videos are
just done in our free time supported
just by ad revenue or donations so if
you want to make a donation head over to
level up tux comm which by the way is in
no way finished we you know we want to
focus on the tutorials here so we're
just you know a little bit at a time
with the web site but when you when you
get to level up Tufts comm there's a
donation button you can donate if you'd
like okay once again this is Scott level
of Tut's thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
