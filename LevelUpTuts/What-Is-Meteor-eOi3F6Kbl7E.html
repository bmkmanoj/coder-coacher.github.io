up tutorials and in this video I'm going
to be doing a what is Wednesday on what
is meteor now this is something that I
think there is a little misconception
around about what is meteor exactly and
meteor has changed free substantially
over the years with all of these
improvements being for the absolute best
I'm going to explain some of how it's
changed over the years and why it's
better however to give a broad overview
of what meteor is a platform for
building applications using node J s
with whatever front-end framework that
you choose whether it's angular react or
even a meteor zone front-end framework
called blaze the database is MongoDB by
default which is something that is
difficult to change so if you're not
into Mongo then meteor sort of out of
the question for you in terms of what
you should be focusing your time on and
it uses node in NPM and all this sort of
stuff so it's essentially just a
platform for building node apps now
there's some killer features like the
zero configuration builds tool that
offers a ton of really excellent build
tool things like code splitting and
dynamic imports with seriously zero
configuration as well as well there's
some real-time features that come with
meteor and part of meteor called tracker
now these real-time things are awesome
and honestly building a real-time
application is couldn't be any faster I
use it if you were gonna build a
real-time app somewhere else
I just don't think anything could
compare to the speed at which your get
up and running to which you could with
meteor so while meteor is primarily
known for its real-time features it's
not necessarily its best features in my
opinion I mean not to say that those
features aren't good because they're
certainly excellent however some of the
really excellent things in meteor is
just how nicely integrated the front end
is with the back end now what I mean is
that well instead of having to write an
API and hit an API and really have a
separate front ended back
and you can use things like meteor
methods where you define your
server-side functionality on the server
and then call your methods directly from
the client side and and not have to
interact and not have to hit an API
somewhere this is what I really like
about this is that the the client and
the server well they start to merge
together and if you're doing server-side
rendering and stuff like that it's even
better because you just end up having
this application where the client and
server are working together in such a
way that is just super nice and not only
that but the accounts and user
authentication system that comes with in
meteor as excellent as well it takes all
of the guesswork out of one of the least
fun aspects of any project which is
getting authentication up and running
and in terms of meteor you add a couple
of packages such as accounts and maybe
some service packages like accounts
Facebook or accounts Google or something
like that and well you have access to
nice secure logins and something you
don't have to worry about ever again so
the thing I like most about meteor all
said and done is just how fast it is to
get up and running and in fact you can
if you're if you're not worried about
security and you're just doing like
hacking project and you just want to
test an idea you can get up and running
in like no time and even do really
insecure client-side writes to your
database I mean you can write directly
from the client-side to your database if
you want now obviously this isn't
something you're gonna want to keep in
your site when you go to production or
anything like that but it makes testing
out ideas and getting started just
instantly fast and some of the real-time
stuff definitely Wow's people upon
starting for instance if you were to
follow this basic tutorial and you were
to add a to-do to your database that to
do is also going to get added to the
front-end of your site and it would be
just like I don't know if you remember
that angular one example that came out
where everyone was obsessing over
two-way data-binding being so easy this
is like that same thing but it adds it
to that database and well like I said
I'm not using the real time features
like crazy and my work it's definitely
sort of a WoW thing and something that
can get you just really excited about
the platform
for all so when meteor first came out
part of the criticisms were that well
there was no import system you couldn't
use npm there were a lot of things it
was just sort of like a fancy real-time
app thing that was sort of stuck in its
own
however since they've added NPM support
they've added a standard import system
and their build tool is just absolutely
top-notch meteors become an excellent
platform for building just standard
react or angular or vue sites I use this
with react on the level up tutorial site
and have really really enjoyed just how
easy it made everything work I didn't
have to code a separate back-end it's
all a part of one code base that
communicates really smoothly and like
many people have noticed the level of
touch site is actually really super fast
and this has to do with the code
splitting and stuff like that that I'm
getting from meteors build tool so again
what is meteor it's a platform for
building node j/s apps that are
client-side and server-side and include
database it uses all of the standard
node stuff that you're used to so you
can quickly get up and running building
some really excellent applications using
whatever front-end framework of your
choice now who knows where the future of
meteor lies as sort of tools get better
and transformed it meteor is essentially
becoming more of a build tool with some
packages that connect the client side
and server side but the great thing
about it is is it's also becoming way
more flexible where you can sort of pick
and choose what you want
when meteor first launched you were tied
into their own front-end language which
was called blaze and now blaze was great
however I prefer to use react and it's
so easy now to get up and running with
react if you want to use graph QL it's
easy to use graph QL if you want to use
Redux it's easy to use Redux basically
all of this stuff is making it into a
more flexible platform not only that but
the guide meteor comm is an excellent
excellent source of documentation one of
the things I've always loved about
meteor is just how seriously they've
taken their documentation if you want to
find out anything
about this platform it's right in here
now some of the criticisms of meteor is
that you're stuck to MongoDB and that's
totally valid as not everyone loves
MongoDB I personally like Mongo and I
have no issues building applications in
it a lot of the concerns about it are
totally overblown other critiques are
that well a scaling a meteor application
is difficult and that's actually really
not so true scaling a meteor application
can be difficult if you have a ton of
collections that are all real time and
you're having to deal with all this
real-time collections you're not using
indexes and you're not essentially
writing excellent code however if you
follow best practices a meteor app is as
scalable as anything else now I
obviously don't work for meteor anything
I just happen to really enjoy working on
this platform and who knows how long
meteor will continue to exist in its
current state as it sort of moves closer
and closer to a grouping of various
packages that work together to produce
something that's this easy to build
sites and if you're familiar with graph
QL the team behind Apollo is the same
team that was behind meteor and
eventually meteor might sort of merge
with graph QL in some sort of way I'm
not exactly sure what that would even
look like or if that even makes any sort
of sense but if you're looking to build
an application on nodejs
and you plan on using MongoDB meteor is
a great option and I found it extremely
easy to get up and running and extremely
easy to code in so check it out if
you're not familiar with meteor already
you know to just meteor comm I believe
yeah meteor comm check out some of this
stuff just install it do the basic to do
tutorial and you're gonna see pretty
instantly how nice and easy it is to get
started so as always this is Scott
talansky with LevelUp tutorials and this
is what is Wednesday if you have any
other topics you want to see covered on
what is Wednesday where I cover a basic
definition of various web technologies
let me know what you want to see
upcoming I'm gonna be doing one that is
what is Redux because I'm actually
working on a reactant Redux series for
everyone right now which is going to be
just absolute redux for beginner
Redux for people who have been
frustrated with every other redux
learning resource I plan on making it as
English and as basic as possible I'm
going to be teaching you exactly what
everything means and why you're going to
be doing it but I'm doing so in a way
that makes sense
so if you want to see other topics
covered on what is Wednesday leave a
comment on this video and let me know
what you want to see as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials thanks so
much for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
