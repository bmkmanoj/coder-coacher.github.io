up Tut's and today I'm going to be
taking you through the process of
getting Drupal commerce up and running
on your Drupal site now this tutorial
assumes that you already have Drupal
installed somewhere and that you're
familiar with installing modules on
Drupal if you're not familiar with those
things please check out our videos on
the level up tuts youtube channel on how
to install Drupal and how to install
module now we're on drupal.org slash
project slash commerce and if you scroll
down here you'll see installation
instructions go ahead and open this and
also come down here and download the
latest version this gzip file if you
have not already and in the installation
and uninstallation page here it's going
to give you a little bit of information
about dependencies so this module is
required to have address field CTools
entity rules and views for the sake of
this video I already have these modules
installed so you shouldn't have to worry
about that however if your site does not
have any of these modules please
download and install them now and if you
look down here it actually gives you a
really handy drush command that you can
run while several drush commands that
you can run to enable all of the modules
that you need to unable to get commerce
running since we're doing this in a
little bit more descriptive way we're
going to do that manually however if you
have Josh and you're used to jarash by
all means you can use drush to download
install and enable all of these commerce
modules relatively easily and run these
commands to enable them right here cool
so there's just some other stuff here
you might its my worth checking out
however the installation process is
pretty smooth so I have my Drupal
modules open here and you can see here
my Finder window that this is what's
included within that commerce module we
have the basic we have the UI module we
have the commerce
jool itself and then we have a whole
bunch of other modules that are needed
we have cart checkout customer line item
order payment price product pricing and
product reference what's great about
commerce is that it breaks all this
stuff up individually however as you can
see compared to most Drupal modules this
module is considerably larger so to
install I'm going to drag over the
commerce folder like normal to our
modules in sites all modules like I said
if you need instructions on how to do
that check out our video and now I'm
going to actually looks like it didn't
make it quite in there there we go I'm
going to refresh your page here and we
should start seeing Commerce now I'm
using a module called that module filter
to have this nice interface for modules
but if you don't have it it's just going
to be in the grouping of commerce and as
you can see there are 21 modules here
now which of these do need to enable
well we're actually going to enable all
of them because as you can see they all
have pretty critical components we have
our cart our checkout Drupal commerce as
a whole
as you can see pretty much all of these
require commerce commerce UI of course
customer customer UI line item line item
UI and like I said you could run that
drush command if you have drush
installed to to have all of these
enabled we actually don't need payment
method example installed but we're going
to install or enabled but we're going to
enable it anyways just so we can see
that example in fact it's really helpful
to see how they've done things to know
exactly what's going on also if you want
to install commerce kickstart as a
separate separate Drupal account or
separate Drupal site it's also really
interesting to see how they have it
configured so you certainly know where
things are in a pre-configured setting
let's click Save configuration here and
it's going to enable these modules great
so we now have these modules enabled
if you'll notice I mean not a whole Lots
change but we do have this brand new
store link in our main navigation
selecting store is going to give you
some options customer profiles orders
products and configuration now this is
going to be where all of your store
configuration administration that sort
of stuff is taking place and that's good
that they keep it all together you don't
have to go through several configuration
menus or anything to find anything so
let's check out customer profiles you
can see there isn't a customer profile
yet of course we're going to create one
and there are different types of profile
types as well now let's actually come
back to store inside of orders this is
going to be where all of the orders are
obviously if somebody is placing an
order it's going to get filled in here
as well as an administrator you can
create an order yourself you can also
view the shopping carts that people have
you know put things in and that exists
on the system that way you can sort of
monitor what people have in their card
and things like that
and that could be really helpful for any
sort of store owner now we also have
products and now products are going to
be an interesting subject because they
don't work the same way they do on some
other platforms now if you're coming
from something like Magento products
might be a little bit confusing but
we're going to clear that up and explain
exactly how that exists in in this
system now we also have configuration
and here we have a lot of stuff checkout
settings currency settings line item
types order settings payment methods
product pricing rules and taxes so as
you can see here there's a whole host of
things that come with the base commerce
install and you know while it is missing
some things which we'll find out sooner
or later it's probably for the best that
those things aren't included and our
add-ons so we now have Drupal commerce
installed on our site and we have this
up and running
that's excellent in the next video we're
going to be
creating our first product and
explaining how a product in Drupal
Commerce exists and what that means for
your store so as always this is Scott
with love-love Tut's if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
