up tutorials and in this free series I'm
going to be teaching you how to make a
full stack graph QL apps now for this
series we're going to be using meteor
we're going to be using Apollo we're
going to be using a react and we're
gonna be using MongoDB now before you
have a whole bunch of questions about
why I'm using these things this video is
gonna take care of all of those we're
gonna be talking a little that well what
we're building and why I'm using these
technologies and if you're not if you
don't want to learn Apollo with meteor
or react I will be doing a lot more
Apollo and granule tutorials this year
on all sorts of different topics so just
keep your eyes open but if you want a
nice introduction into using Apollo and
not have to write your own server or
your own accounts or you have to worry
about a database then this is the
perfect way to get started so let's get
going on this right now while I talk a
little bit about why we're using the
things we're using and how to how they
all fit in together so let's get started
right now hey what's up this is Scott
would love love tutorials and I've kind
of decided to do with impromptu tutorial
on so I think I've been working on a lot
lately which is meteor and Apollo with
graph QL and reactant oh this is kind of
specific stack here but I'm gonna go
into a little bit about why I chose the
stack and if you've never worked with
meteor don't worry we're actually not
gonna be using too much of meteors
meteor stuff so you might be wondering
why we're even using it at all no I'll
get into that as well but what we're
gonna be doing is running an app with
meteor and graph QL and react okay so
let's actually answer some of those
questions before we get into any sort of
code okay now I should mention if you're
only interested in the Apollo stuff and
you don't want to learn how to set up
meteor and react and you just want to
have the app up and running go ahead and
zoom to I think video number three no
video number four where we talked about
getting setup with our API because from
that point forward it's gonna be pretty
much all Apollo and react stuff the
first couple of videos are setting up
installing meteor going over the file
structure and then getting react
up and running so if you already know
how to do all that stuff and you just
want to clone the repo go ahead and
start on video number four okay but the
goal of this series will be to build a
sort of modern full stack application
where we can save things to a database
and query that database and display that
information in our front-end framework
of choice of course in this version
that's going to be react but you could
seriously use anything and we're gonna
be using graph QL to do that rather than
well an Express API or rather than
having to set up your own database and
rather than having to use meteors oh I
shouldn't say having to but rather than
using meteors tracker system and I'm
gonna explain a little bit about why so
let's check this out some of the reasons
why we're using these technologies of a
first question why meteor why used
meteor at all
the answer to that is well it makes
getting started really fast we don't
have to set up a database we don't have
to set up a server we don't to set up an
API we just install meteor and I don't
all that we get a free account system
too so we're gonna be using meteors
accounts system we're going to be using
the database which is MongoDB that comes
pre-configured within meteor and we're
going to be using all of the nice server
stuff that comes pre-configured with
meteor and we're going to be using
meteors awesome zero config build tool
that gives us things like code splitting
and dynamic modules and stuff like that
okay so that's why we're using meteor
we're essentially using as a build tool
that includes a server a database and
user accounts it's basically just a way
to save time and not have to set all of
that stuff up with any other sort of
node platform okay so that's why meteor
I also got asked this today on Twitter
which is meteor verse Apollo which one
well I like using them both together as
meteor for the server stuff and Apollo
to pull the data from the server now in
the future I could see a future where
you're not using meteor at all you're
using webpack and Express and all that
sort of stuff to use Apollo but I think
they work really nicely together so I
don't think it needs to be a meteor
verse Apollo question but meteor and
Apollo or Apollo separately either way
the Apollo system for querying data is
super excellent
so if you're asking about the front end
sort of stuff like querying data if
we're talking about tracker versus
Apollo you're gonna see some of the
Apollo benefits or they're actually
pretty much graph QL benefits but Apollo
benefits with graph QL pretty much
immediately okay so I've got over a
couple of those things let's talk a
little bit more you're saying meteor
well I don't want to include a whole
bunch of stuff with my site right I want
it to be small and that's why I'm not
going to use meteor honestly our code
base is going to be very small we're
gonna be using a bear a version of
meteor so the amount of stuff that is
meteor specific that it's going to get
loaded into your app is really minimal
and not going to affect your your build
size very much at all I mean it we're
gonna keep it pretty lightweight here in
fact I'm using the same stuff on level
up tutorials calm not on the production
version yet but the build times the
build sizes and the loading times are
absolutely blazing fast so no worries
there next I want to talk about a why
Apollo I mean there's other graph QL
systems right you could use a relay
which is another system for using graph
QL in JavaScript now I chose Apollo
because it's built by the people who
built meteor and it's excellent you can
see it's being used by quite a few
people from what I have heard I haven't
actually dove too much into relay I've
heard relays a little bit tougher to
pick up a little bit more opinionated a
little bit more code
Apollo you know since I do like the way
the meteor team is handled meteor I I
figured I would like Apollo more an
Apollo also includes some really cool
stuff like Apollo engine it makes it
just really super easy to take it up and
running with graph QL and if you don't
know what Apollo is you'll sort of
understand as we go next
why graph QL over meteor tracker now
this is an answer that's going to get
answered as we start writing our queries
and our data but basically it makes
things like relational queries really
SuperDuper easy but it also just makes
your your querying and your API overall
just so much better just so much more
seamless
and self documenting and all sorts of
great great things so I think the very
first time you write anything relational
in Apollo you're gonna be like oh this
is awesome okay and I'm using graph QL
for all sorts of excellent excellent
things on the level up site that I can
go into later as well okay and if you're
if you want to learn a little bit more
about graph QL like what it is and why
you want to use it you'll want to head
over to syntax dot FM and they load that
up and if you don't know about syntax
it's a podcast I do with West vos and
our very next episode is going to be on
graph QL I guess it's maybe not the next
episode but the next one will record
episode number 27 is going to be on
graph QL so if you want to learn a
little bit about that head to syntax dot
FM or subscribe in your favorite podcast
player and West boss and I are gonna go
over the wet-sand wise and house and
whatever of graph QL how it relates to
Apollo how it relates to relay all that
good stuff so if you want to learn how
to build full stack apps with Apollo
this is a great place to learn it
because we're going to essentially not
have to worry about the little stuff
that maybe you already know how to do
like an express server or whatever maybe
you don't know how to do them and you
don't want to learn how to do them
either way we're gonna get eight awesome
full stack Apollo app going and we're
gonna get started in the very next video
so as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments you could come in the video hit
me up at twitter or facebook if i did
not address one of your concerns here or
if you just want to tell me you hate one
of the technologies you I picked in here
go ahead and leave a comment on the
video and I should mention this is not
going to be the only graph QL or Apollo
series I'm doing I'm gonna be doing some
premium ones as well for level of pros
I'm gonna be doing some ones talking
about graph CMS about graph cool all
sorts of the stuff with graph QL I
believe very strongly graph QL is the
future so so no worries if you don't
care about meteor and react either way
if you just want to learn Apollo this is
a great place to do so because honestly
we're not going to be using a ton ton
ton of meteor specific stuff okay so
with that all said let's get started
fire up the next video and let's get
coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
