tutorials and in this video I'm gonna be
giving you a what is Wednesday and the
topic I'm covering in this video is
react native as in what is react native
now the reason why I wanted to do this
video is because the last time I
released a react native course there
were several comments saying react
native is not native application
building right this is JavaScript apps
they're not native apps and that's
totally false that's totally wrong so I
wanted to take a video and talk a little
bit about what react native actually
does and why it's so exciting and why
it's maybe not what you'd expect if you
don't have any experience in it now
before I get started I'm going to do a
one person commented that was an ad in
the last video and talked a little bit
about the new react native series that
I'm releasing today on level up
tutorials for subscribers and for
purchase which is leveled to react
native with graph QL basically I teach
you react to native intermediate
concepts we make a really nice-looking
app which you can see here it's a fully
native application you get swipe
gestures we can create a journal post we
can have this all underneath
authentication so all of these posts are
for this particular user so we do user
authentication we add it we update and
we do all this using a graph QL backend
it's a super cool course check it out on
level up tutorials a.com and or you can
head to the level up tutorials store and
check out the level to react and native
with graph QL or if you don't have
either of those series you can get a
package deal with react native for
everyone with level up level to react
native with graph QL and save a bunch of
money by apologies if that was too much
of an add ok so let's get to the
question what is react native and react
native their website does a great job of
it where a lot of these websites we've
gone over so far maybe don't do a great
job bill
native mobile apps using JavaScript and
react yeah that's what it does
you type react code that's very very
similar to the react code you write for
the web now it's not the same it's very
similar it's very similar code that you
write for the web now the react
parts of it are all the same the parts
that are different are some of the stuff
in your render function that kind of
thing
and although some people maybe are a
little confused about this this actually
is giving you a full native app for both
iOS and Android when you are done this
is not a cordova solution where you're
using what's called a webview and just
simply outputting a website what we do
here in react native is use real native
components and real native api's to
interact with our code again this is not
just HTML being rendered inside of a
webview we're using actual things like
the iOS navigator or the just the native
buttons or things like that we use alert
and toast messages like you do exactly
within native programming now part of
the confusion is is that people somewhat
see react native as a write-once build
everywhere kind of tool as and you write
your application and react and then it
just you get a native app you get a
website you get all that stuff and
that's not true
because the code for react native if I
head to some real react native code here
and you can see it is very similar it's
basically the exact same the big
differences come from some of the
components there's no such thing as a
div or a paragraph in react native in
fact if you try to use those things
react native will be very angry with you
there's things like a view and a text
the reason being is because these all
map one to one with real components
within native development whether that's
Swift or Android which is Java but I
think they just changed it recently so
either way what's cool about react
native is that because these things are
one-to-one if you
our experienced Swift developer or
experienced native developer overall and
do all of the sudden are like I'm done
with react I'm not into it whatever you
don't have to start over you can eject
your application out of react native and
you can throw it into Xcode or Android
studio and pick it up from there so you
can actually go from a react native app
to a real live native app and that just
proves right there that this isn't a
webview this is an HTML this is real
native code and the cool thing about
react native is you don't have to learn
any sort of the native stuff for
instance this application that we're
building in our series here is fully
material design and fully with the iOS
design guidelines and I did so using
some packages but check it out it's all
using the same code so we can actually
you know write once and builds for
multiple platforms the only differences
is that well this isn't exactly going to
a web because this is an HTML and we're
not getting any sort of HTML out of it
now some things here is that react
native has a introductory sort of
getting started called create react
native app and create react native app
actually kind of build your project in
something called Expo and you'll notice
in our project here there isn't a whole
lot of extra stuff but we do have an
expo folder and that's because expo is
taking care of a lot of the more complex
react native stuff for us but if we ever
wanted a fully react native project we
could eject from expo and maybe expo is
large enough that there needs to be a
what is expo video at all
but either way the point here is that
react native builds you actual native
apps and if you comment on this video
saying it's not real native apps then
I'm going to tell you you're wrong
because you are wrong these are native
apps these are HTML this is not a
webview this is how it is so check it
out this is a react native allows you to
write native app code in react j/s and
the standard JavaScript syntax that you
know and it's
going to compile it down to Swift or
Java and allow you to pick it up where
you left off in your native platforms or
you can actually publish to the App
Store straight from react native you
don't need to touch Swift if you don't
understand Swift or or Java right you
can do it all within react native so
that is what is react native it allows
you to build native applications using
javascript and react as always this is
Scout with level up tutorials again I'm
gonna advertise here so if you don't
want to listen to this you can shut the
video off now but if you'd like to learn
react native I have two series I have a
react native for everyone
I have level 2 react native with graph
QL and both of them are available for
purchase right now should we head to
tutorials on the store you can see react
native for everyone you have level 2
react native you can buy them together
in a package deal and save some money if
you want or buy whichever one seems more
exciting to you or you could become a
level up Pro and stream both of them for
free so yeah well I'm not for free but
for the cost of a subscription so as
always thank you so much for watching
and I will see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
