of Tut's in the last video we left off
by creating this really basic html5
document and now we're going to start
filling it with some of the new elements
the new tags though we can now use with
html5 and some of these tags really
don't have a whole lot of meaning other
than just semantic meaning where we're
going to be using them where we would
normally use a div or something but a
div doesn't have any sort of semantic
meaning it's just a you know it's just
denoting some sort of you know content
there's no meaning there so where html5
really succeeds is having a lot of
options for tags with semantic meaning
that you know is going to help us out so
first one is the header tag and now
we're going to wrap our h1 and this is
going to be the header of our page we're
going to wrap this and just a tag that
just says header and this isn't going to
do too much it's going to be just like a
div except for it's going to let you
know the browser know that this is the
header right so you may be asking
yourself so you just use this tag once
in this the header well no not exactly
we'll go over the specifics more and you
know an entire video review know about
header itself but header can be used as
the just header of content so maybe your
blog post title has a header on it
itself but for an entire document we're
using this header tag the next one is
section and section is also just like a
div tag and the thing about section is
is it's really just grouping content
together and it's saying that this
content is related this is a section of
the site and we're going to have this be
the section and it's going to be class
equals main content and I'm just doing
this because this section is going to be
the main content section so that's
really what it is so that's no you know
it's nice and easy and fat
I'm going to grab some hipster ipsum
text just to throw in here just one
paragraph just so we have some stuff and
just like that okay let's check out our
pages see how it's doing okay you'll
notice nothing's really changing
nothing's crazy here we have our header
we have our section cool so these two
new tags are really that exciting so far
and in fact the third one is going to be
this same level excitement it's going to
be footer and just like the header and
the section footer really doesn't have
any stylistic purpose or anything its
meaning is purely semantic and that's a
great news for us because now your
browser knows what content is in your
footer and this maybe is going to allow
it to prioritize that information
whether it's for SEO purposes or
accessibility that kind of thing so if
we just had an unordered list with five
list items in it and I'm actually just
going to fill these in with just some
tests just so we have something here
that's a little bit like what we would
have on a normal site
okay so let's check out our page once
more and you'll be unsurprised to see
nothing's changed you know we don't have
to have anything crazy going on and just
like the header element the footer
element does not just mean the footer of
your page
it means the footer of the area of
content so maybe you have a footer to
your blog post that has meta information
or something like that that would also
be included in this and we have another
tag it's called a side and a side is
going to be used for content that isn't
your main content if your aside content
aside content doesn't mean that it's a
sidebar or something like that it just
means that it's not your main content
it's sort of secondary to your main
content it's just you know it's a side
so we're going to say yes side right
here and we're going to have I'm not
just throw a little bit of this
paragraph in here and here we go okay
and notice nothing really changes it's
just another block level element as
usual but it does let your browser know
that this content isn't as important as
the stuff in your main content section
or other places on your site and it
could give it an insight as to what
could possibly be there okay so here
we've showed you four new tags all of
which are purely semantic but that's
sort of the great things about html5 is
that it's offering that possibility
where before every single one of these
would have been a div with a class of
something and looking at the HTML
wouldn't really have told you a ton
about what that content is in the
structure of your site it says hTML is
all about structure this is absolutely
perfect in some of the greatest things
about html5 so check it out play around
with them and we're going to be building
a more complex example like a blog in
some of the later videos and you can see
how these tags are used in other
contexts so check it out as always if
you have any questions or comments leave
a comment of the video or hit us up at
Twitter or LevelUp
or on Facebook or just anything as
always this is Scott to let ski with
level of Tut's and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
