up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you the Drupal 8 tool bar
we're going to be talking about how it's
different from the previous iterations
of the tool bar how you can move it
configure it and how you can add things
to it so let's get started right now now
let's get on to the admin toolbar now
this admin toolbar can be replaced
through different modules however the
tool bar here is big step forward from
Drupal 8 now you'll notice that we have
this icon in the far right that allows
us to move this to a vertical
orientation if that's more of what
you're looking for in Lotus it actually
pushes your site content over and
doesn't overlap on top of your content
now the only real problem with this is
that it's just very wide and so you'll
need a bit wider of a monitor if you're
working on your site in this way if we
click manage you'll see it does go away
entirely and if we were to click
shortcuts you would see we have some
shortcuts now by default we only have ad
content and all content as shortcuts
now you'll see in a minute once we get
through the admin section of your site
but you can quickly and easily add
shortcuts to this menu for just about
any page as well you can click Edit
shortcuts to edit this yourself now we
would also click admin right up top here
just to see some of your user stuff so
we have you profile edit profile and
logout so most of our time is probably
going to be spent in the manage tab or
once you setup your shortcuts it's maybe
or once you setup your shortcuts maybe
set up in the shortcuts tab now you'll
notice that with some of these items
have blue arrows underneath them we can
click those to toggle these accordions
you'll know so you can only have one
Gordian open at a moment except for when
it's nested you'll see we have content
structure appearance extended
configuration people reports and help
now content is obviously where you're
going to be going to modify your content
you'll notice that when I clicked on the
label content rather than the arrow it
actually took me to an admin page for
content we're going to go over a little
bit more this page in the future here in
addition to content we also have
comments now if we click this arrow once
structure this is where you're going to
be spending a lot of time modifying what
actually shows up on your site we have
block layout just about everything on
your site is a block we have comment
types we have contact forms which you'll
see we already have one created we have
content types which is where you're
going to be creating different types of
content for instance if you have a blog
then maybe you'll have a blog post
content type if you have something like
a news story maybe a news story content
type now content types are a big part of
Drupal and something we're going to be
covering in a lot more detail now
display modes you'll see we have forum
modes and the view mode which will go
for more in depth we have menus which is
obviously if we select this you'll see
that it's all of our menus such as the
admin menu the footer main navigation
tools and it allows you to add your own
menus right here we also have taxonomy
which you can think of as something like
tags we have views which is where you'll
be spending a lot of time constructing
the custom elements of your site now
views can be a little bit daunting to
learn but don't worry we're going to be
covering a ton of you stuff and there's
going to be a view Pro series that
allows you to really get the most out of
Drupal views alright let's close this
and under appearance is where you're
going to be modifying your themes now
this is going to be admin themes or user
interface themes we're going to be going
over themes a lot more extend is where
you're going to be extending your site
through the use of modules now in
WordPress you had something called
plugins and Drupal its modules now the
Drupal module system still isn't as
awesome as the wordpress plugin system
simply from an ease of use however it is
pretty simple and once you get the hang
of it you won't notice a difference
however for people coming directly from
WordPress you might be a little bit
confused as to why it's not as simple
in fact personally I'm still confused as
to why it's not as simple and next we
have configuration which is where you'd
expect all of your configuration options
to go content authoring system people
media so Drupal is a large Beast here
there are a lot of things you can modify
and that's part of Drupal strength is
that everything that you need to modify
is here now in addition we have people
which is where you're going to see the
you
of your site and reports which is where
you can manage things like error logs
available updates status reports and
things like that
so as you can see from this toolbar
alone there's a lot of content here and
if any of these pages are something that
you feel like you're going to be
visiting very frequently such as this
extend page we have a star here at the
top of this page and you can click Add
to shortcuts when you click this star
it's going to make this a shortcut if we
come to shortcuts we now see extend at
our list you want to modify the order of
these shortcuts you can always click
Edit shortcuts and we can actually click
drag and save our changes here so as you
can see add content is now above extend
so this is the new Drupal admin toolbar
and it's where you're going to be going
to basically get around your site if
you've used WordPress or used other
content management systems or even
Drupal you should be familiar with the
concept of having an administrative
toolbar so now you should know how you
can get around your site to navigate to
modify things you may not know exactly
where to go yet so in the next few
videos we're going to be covering
exactly these different types of things
we're going to be creating new content
types we're going to be creating new
menus we're going to be modifying
content we're gonna be creating a blog
