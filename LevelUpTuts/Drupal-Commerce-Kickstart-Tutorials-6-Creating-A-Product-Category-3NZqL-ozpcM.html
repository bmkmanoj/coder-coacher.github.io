loved huts and today I'm gonna show you
how to create a product category
in commerce kickstart product category
he's just sort of an attribute so if you
were used to using Magento or another
ecommerce solution maybe the word
attribute might sound a little bit more
familiar to you so in the last lesson we
created a variation type called classes
and what happens you know we want a type
of glasses like a glasses style and we
want like the styling of that glasses
whether it's an aviator like a plastic
frame or something I guess we just want
those those options to always be the
same just like shoe size or something
like that so we're gonna make a new
category by going into products and then
categories clicking on the big blue
button add categories okay so for our
category name we're just gonna be it's
gonna be styles or let's say classes
style okay just so we know that this is
really particularly two glasses styles
or glasses okay so if we want it to be
in the menu we can have it appear in the
menu but we still want this to be in the
menu we just want this to be on a
product right so it's going to be a menu
path to our path type of kickstart X on
it even though we're not putting in the
menu if we were though however we would
leave it there so we don't really need
to change any of this stuff but there is
lots of options here so just to go
through each time a term is editor
deleted or modified the corresponding
menu link will be altered to yeah okay
so this is all many related stuff I
would suggest just reading through these
things if you want to have it being a
menu but it's really handy because
that's gonna build your menu based on
your your category type and we can
definitely do that in a later tutorial
but for this one I just want to get it
set up so we have our our new category
which was glass
styles and I'm going to add some terms
and we'll have the first one it can be
square save may be retro save and um
just let's use aviator as a type or a
style I suppose and that way we could
just have different glasses with that
type so let's now go to our variation
types and add this to our different very
actually I take that back we're going to
go to content content types and we're
going to add this to the product display
instead of the product itself manage
feels on glasses and we're going to add
a new field and a style field type is
going to be a term reference and it's
going to be radio boxes and let's click
Save and now we're gonna get to select
which category in which we're going to
pick glasses style save this setting
perfect and we're not gonna have a
default we're gonna have it so you can
only select one and that's all good so
let's save this and then when we edit
our previous pair of glasses that we
have made we will see that that is an
option as a radio button on the product
display so let's quick edit this
apologize let's actually edit edit this
and let's see we now have style down
here we can say they're aviator and
let's save this and it will show up on a
profit page and we have just created a
category cool so in the next video we're
gonna show you how to create menus with
categories like they've done here and
that will be a bit more advanced but not
too much more difficult so as always
this is Scott one level up Tut's if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video or hit us up on
Twitter alright thanks for thanks for
watching and see you in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
