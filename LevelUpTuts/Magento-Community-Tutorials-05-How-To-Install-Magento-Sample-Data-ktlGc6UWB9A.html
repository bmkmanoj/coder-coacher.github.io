level of Tut's and today we're going to
start a new screencast series on the
gentle community and the Magento
community edition of their e-commerce
platform is really a great thing it's an
open-source ecommerce platform that is
very heavily used
so Magento offers just really great
out-of-the-box feature is that a lot of
other content management systems or even
ecommerce specific ones you're going to
have to build in yourself not to mention
they just do it in a really elegant way
and it allows for all sorts of
customization there's plenty of themes
plenty of extensions online and there's
lots to learn so if you have interest in
learning the Gentle ecommerce I suggest
you watch this series we're going to get
started in this first lesson and this
isn't technically the first lesson this
is going to be a point five lesson and
what this is going to show you how to do
is how to install the sample data that
comes with Magento and we're going to
have this sample data installed so that
we can really pull through you know
Magento with data that they've given you
instead of having to create a whole
bunch of stuff just to show you what
Magento is like and I would suggest if
you're new to Magento to even installing
this sample data just to be able to see
how things are done on your own so to
get started just go ahead and click on
this download and then community edition
and it's going to take you to this page
right here and here's where you can
download the Gento you want to select
your format you can just grab any of
these and click download and then just a
little ways down here there's sample
data and you're going to want to go
ahead and download that as well I've
already downloaded both of those and
just so you know I'm going to be running
map pro and I don't know if you're
familiar with the map or zamp or
whatever it's all pretty much the same
or even if you're working off of a
server I'm working off my localhost I
have a folder that I have in my
documents just called Magento and that's
where all these files are going to live
so if you need any help with map or
anything like that you know
let us know maybe we can do a tutorial
series on map or zamp or any of those
okay so take some time and download
those files and then come back and we'll
get started okay so now that you have
the files navigate to wherever they're
downloaded and you'll see that they have
them here inside of this sample data
folder we have an SQL file and we have a
media folder we're going to go ahead and
we're going to upload that SQL file to a
database that we need to create so the
first thing we want to do is we want to
create a new database if you get to your
PHP myadmin you can just create a new
database here and we're going to call
this level Magento or level underscore
match so then you can call this whatever
you want whatever you're maybe naming or
your store as or something just to let
you know what database this is going to
be click create okay so now we have our
our new database and we want to import
that SQL file into our database so we're
going to click import here we're going
to choose our file and we're going to
browse to wherever that download was and
then find this SQL file we'll click open
and we're going to click go and that's
going to import these tables into our
database okay so now that you have your
database installed you should see this
import has successfully finished so that
means your tables have been correctly
added so the last step in this whole
process is moving the sample media file
into your Magento folder we're going to
cover that in the next video because
we'll show you how to move your Magento
folder to where it needs to go and
finish the installation process so in
the next video I'm going to show you
would have actually installed Magento
and then we can get going once again
this is Scott with the level of Tut's if
you have any questions or comments
please leave a comment on the videos let
us know what you're thinking
let me know what you want to see since
this is a new series I'm totally open to
anything that people want to learn ok
once again thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
