Tut's
and today I'm going to be showing you
how to install a theme on Drupal 7 so
what we're going to need to do first is
we're going to download that theme from
drupal.org if you go to drupal.org one
of the categories here is themes
actually let's browse to Drupal homepage
you can get there by clicking themes
here or you can search for themes the
first ones listed here are the most
popular ones so a lot of people use then
because it's a great starter theme and
its really great to build off of same
with Fusion adaptive theme is a really
nice adaptive responsive web theme that
uses html5 to adjust to whatever your
browser sizes whether it's a phone
tablet or computer for this tutorial
however I'm going to be using Omega
because it is one that I have grown very
accustomed to as of lately and I really
enjoy some of the features so on my
personal site I'm going to be wanting to
use Omega so Omega is also a responsive
theme it's based off of the 960 grid
framework you can really easily change
how many columns you have and spanning
regions over columns is very easy Omega
itself has a ton of features and
settings that you can tweak that really
make it stand out as being a really
great platform to develop on so this is
sort of you know Omega is a pretty big
thing so it has its own handbook it has
its own microsite if we open this in a
new tab you can see there's lots here
for now we're just going to browse so
down here in downloads there are the
recommended releases you can see this is
7 point X that means it's for Drupal 7
you're not going to want to download
anything that ever says 6 point X for
Drupal 7 because it will not work it is
for Drupal 6 only so you also don't
necessarily want to download the
development release unless say there is
a bug in the current release that's
fixed in the development release
basically these recommended releases are
recommended for a reason so we're going
to click the zip to download it as you
can see it has downloaded to my
downloads folder and open that up
okay so I have browse to my website
folder and these are the these are the
files that are in your folder so
everything that you're going to want to
edit is going to be in sites if you're
changing your CSS it's going to be in
sites if you're installing modules it's
going to be in sites so we go here and
then sites all and then inside sites all
there's modules or themes so this seems
like a good time to drop Omega into
themes so omega has some different
things in it and in the next lesson
we're going to go go over how to create
your own sub theme of Omega because
you're not going to want to edit Omega
itself you're going to want to create
your own sub theme and edit that that's
just sort of how the way you do things
in Drupal that way if they release an
update to Omega and you go to update it
it's not going to break your whole site
it's just going to update Omega and it's
not going to touch your files okay so
now that we have Omega in to the site's
themes folder we're going to go back to
our Drupal site and now we're going to
want to go to appearance if we go down
here you'll now see that Omega and alpha
show up so if we enable Omega it now
shows up as being one of our teams if we
set it to default it's going to override
Bartok and Bartok will no longer be our
default since we're not using Bartok
anymore let's go ahead and disable it
so also you'll see here that this is
installed another thing called alpha in
what alpha is is it's really just a
framework to do sub-themes for Omega on
and you're going to be basing your
sub-themes off of alpha or omega and
you're not actually using omega or alpha
by itself ever so we're just going to
leave this as being disabled and now you
can see omega is enabled we can just
click out of this and now you can see
this is omega and since we're in
development mode it's going to turn on
the grid and it's going to turn on these
regions so if well they're actually the
the block the region block areas but so
let's turn those off and turn the grid
off and this is omega as a theme as you
can see it has this resized me arrow
that shows you if you're resizing your
browser it's going to adjust for
different browser sizes well we'll take
care all of that in CSS
I'm not going to go over media queries
or anything in this Drupal tutorial I
would suggest looking into that or level
up touch will do CSS tutorials and then
those will go over media queries but for
now just note that Drupal allows for or
Omega has built in media query support
and with Omega you don't really even
have to get into the CSS to set a lot of
that up it's mostly going to be for
tweaking things to get to look the way
you want with the media queries so
that's it for Omega in the next tutorial
we're going to show you how to install a
sub theme for Omega and then that sub
theme that's where I'm going to edit my
CSS and get my site looking like how I
want it to and then we can change
settings and everything like that so
this is how you install a theme in
Drupal but to install it you just
basically drop your folder into the
themes folder and then go to appearance
and enable it as always if you have any
questions feel free to leave a comment
or hit us up on Twitter at level up tuts
if you want to let us know that we're
doing a good job that we're doing a
terrible job or whatever you know just
let us know
and
once again this is Scott with level up
huts and thanks for watching
