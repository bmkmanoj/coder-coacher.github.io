level up Tut's and today I'm going to
give you a brief overview of views so
that we can jump in and get started Nutt
in the next lesson creating your own
view and then from there getting into
more advanced features so to understand
views I kind of wanted to show you just
some examples of what views have been
created and just sort of give you an
idea of the total flexibility that views
gives you so really views as a way to
control displaying your content and then
you can set up various filters or
relationships to have that content
output the way you want it to based on
what page you're on or however what
content you just need to display at that
moment so so I've already created in
here as I have a two featured project
ones one in which has featured projects
here has a large image that's linking to
the content and then there's the title
of the content that's also linking to
the content and this is very similar
it's just a small image and a title
linking to the content so these are both
two separate views that what are saved
as our blocks so you create the view in
views and then you place it on your
website using blocks in another instance
if we see here this is a view right here
this media this is also a title and an
image and linking to the content however
this time the view is saying pull out
two pieces of content the latest to
actually so it's saying look for the
most recent two pieces of media that
have been saved and this blog role is
actually a view as well and this is also
saying look for the most recent pieces
of content first display the title then
the body and then a continue reading
afterwards and then this will I you can
set this to be like what like as many as
you want but let's say we have ten here
and then they'll put a pager just like
your sort of standard blog role so this
is also a view so there's one view here
and then another view here and then
let's check out a couple more so this is
the Kresge Foundation website
if you look here this block of these
these color boxes this is a view so each
one of these things is a piece of
content so there's 15 pieces of content
here this recent news is also view this
brings in the 4 most recent pieces of
news and just displays their title see
this right here this slider here this is
also a view that's bringing in an image
title and a summary body text along with
a link to the content so as you can see
views can do a lot it does it's pretty
much limited by you know what you need
it to do if you need to display your
content in some sort of different way
than Drupal's defaults and you want it
to be very configurable views for the
most part is the way to go you can also
create a views page that takes an
argument from the URL to display that
particular content so as you can
probably guess by now views are very
complicated but at the same time it's
worth taking the time to really
understanding the just views in general
because once you understand it it's not
hard and it's really not it at all but
it can be a little bit daunting to start
so what I'm going to do is start at the
very basics and we're going to work
through views all over so you can have
its advanced features its basic features
whatever you need so in the next lesson
we're going to get started with creating
our first view and it's going to be real
basic but it's going to be perfect so if
you have any questions you know feel
free to leave a comment or hit us up at
Twitter or LevelUp tuts once again this
is Scott with level up tuts and thanks
