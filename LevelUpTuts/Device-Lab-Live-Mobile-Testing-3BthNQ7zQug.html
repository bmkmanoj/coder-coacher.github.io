up tutorials I've been getting a lot of
questions about how I personally work
how I actually am building and testing
websites so in this series I really
wanted to go in and examine some of the
process that I have when working this
video is going to be about the device
lab that you see behind me that is in
most of my video intros so this device
lab is something that I have that allows
me to test on a whole bunch of different
mobile devices at once all sorts of
different sides of tablets and phones
just to make sure that things are
working as expected so let's get started
so I can show you how I work and test on
mobile devices and actually feel and use
them so the first step in my process
really is just to have my website
running on a server like I normally do
so this is a site for the new level up
tutorials that it's built in meteor so
it's running on just a localhost port
3000 now this is pretty standard
especially if you're using meteor and as
you can see the site just functions
totally normally in the development
environment but what I want to do is I
want to be able to access this site on
every single device on my wall and
unique pretty much any device on my
local network that I use a software
called ghost lab now ghost lab is a paid
software and I should state that this
video is not sponsored by them I'm not
receiving any kickbacks or anything like
that this is just exactly the process
and the software that I do use
personally now the nice thing about
ghost lab is that essentially just
broadcasts this website or this
particular URL onto your local network
and it doesn't require you to install an
application on any of you devices like
some other mobile testing software does
you can even inspect the devices
directly in ghost lab to using the
WebKit inspector that we're all familiar
with so let's go ahead and I have this
site it's just localhost 3000 loaded it
says b-boy tools up here but that's just
a cache name from when I added this site
originally since most of my meteor sites
run on port 3000
if I click the play button here what it
does is it broadcasts on this new URL
and what you can do is click this launch
button or you can just simply copy this
URL and you can open it up in a new tab
which already actually have right here
you can see that at if i refresh its
just to make sure you can see that at
this address which is 1002 1.4 colon
8005 you can see that this address is
now available so using a ghost lab which
is the software here it's broadcasting
my local host on to this new URL this
new local URL now what's cool about this
is that any computer on that network
that is then using that URL will have
access to this website so let me change
the camera up and I can show you my
desktop so as you can see here the
desktop is getting the same URL and
what's nice about this is that I'm not
having to run this website on this
computer to see it and use it as I would
and if you'll notice something really
cool is that when I scroll on the
desktop its scrolling on the laptop as
well now this can get a little buggy
with some JavaScript stuff and that's
one thing that you're going to want to
test some JavaScript events may not fire
correctly between the two but what's
nice here is that what I'm looking at
here is genuinely what I'm looking at
here and there are some things that you
are going to want to test the same way
that you normally would by setting up a
staging environment and then just
browsing it that way now you can see
that if I change URL it still will
maintain the sort of one-to-one thing
now I have noticed some bugginess
occasionally with this app and it's
usually nothing that a nice refresh
won't take care of but what this does is
it allows me to right now it allows me
to see this on a laptop it allows me to
see it on a desktop immediately together
side by side
and I can see that maybe the space
between this image and this text right
here is a little too much on the laptop
it looks fine but on the desktop I might
want to consider crunching this in just
a little bit so now let's actually talk
about mobile and the device lab because
that's mainly the purpose of this video
so as you can see I have this a pretty
sweet wall of devices here a lot of
these phones and tablets are just things
that I've acquired over a long period of
time in fact one of the the iPhone here
was even donate to me by a family member
other devices are just sort of old
phones I've come across and
unfortunately because of that I am
missing some things so I primarily have
Android devices while I do have this
iPhone 4s I am missing an iPad so there
are some things still that I do not have
for this device lab but it's honestly
better than nothing and you might be
wondering why you would want to even
test on these devices rather than just
using the chrome inspector well the
really reason is is that it really makes
a difference to actually feel your
website on these devices so let's go
ahead and I'm gonna load this website up
on all of these different devices really
all you have to do is make sure you're
on the network browse to that URL and
you will be fun so as you can see now
that the URLs been entering all these
sites we now have them available to be
used and even inspected through ghost
lab now this is really cool because I
can come in here and I can physically
manipulate this site now I've turned off
the actual syncing so the syncing can
get a little crazy especially with the
meteor set like this that's doing you
know hot reloads and stuff like that so
I didn't want all of these devices to be
automatically linked to what every
single other one is doing but I can come
in here and say okay this is how the
menu feels to use and here I've selected
tutorials and one thing you got to keep
in mind is that the load times are not
going to be totally one-to-one in fact
that took a really long time to load but
in the real world it's very very quick
now even one thing you can tell
instantly is just the color difference
between all of these devices the purple
looks entirely different with beat color
of some
Green's and I can come in here and I can
just feel this this tiny little iPhone
screen this text feels way too big it
doesn't doesn't work the same way it
might work on a larger device or even a
tablet here and if I pull this open the
homepage and every single device you can
see that looks like there's something
wrong with the touch here of the
homepage we're on one of the other
devices a work just fine now as you can
see I even have my own personal device
here which I can use to really feel out
this website and you can see it's
obvious that I've been doing a lot more
testing on my own device because it
looks better than some of these smaller
devices that I've been having here so
while this is really nice to have this
available it's important that you are
testing on a whole bunch of different
screens because otherwise you might end
up with something like you see in the
iPhone let's actually do a closer zoom
in on that you can see exactly the
difference there as you can see with the
iPhone when you have the top bar here
and you have this big old header I mean
this just takes so much room you don't
even get to any of the copy the the
margin there is a little too much even
when I scroll all the too far sometimes
there's a weird white line when I go to
menu let's select a menu here you can
see that the options are too big they're
too big this sign in goes all the way
here and since this is all position
fixed and not able to really scroll here
when I select something yeah the loading
is going to take a bit of a time but
that's more of a go slab issue than
anything else
and even there the loading icon' was not
a well-placed for this kind of screen
here and now we see that in this small
of a screen this two column is
definitely not working these icons are
way too small the text just doesn't sort
of work if I click to show topics now
when I click show topics it looked like
something was weird at the hit zone
because what it did is it actually
filtered my videos here and you'll
notice that the filtered version is in
one column and this looks great so on
this sort of little device here we
really want to make sure that it's
always going to one column whenever
there is in fact these thumbnails now
let's actually check out some of the
tablet versions down here I have a nexus
9 and a Galaxy Tab 10 inch now you can
see that the vertical with these is both
going to essentially be more of a one
column thing and it's gonna look less
like the desktop and a little bit more
like the phones if you scroll here you
can see exactly how it's going to feel
and if we click menu you can see that
that menu looks and feels really nice
but tutorials here we're gonna get this
loading like I said again a ghost lab is
really the issue with the loading here
now in addition let's click start
learning on the 10-inch tablet so as you
can see here there's clearly something
wrong with this 10-inch tablet now I'm
using Chrome on both of these so I know
it's probably not a browser thing but
maybe a breakpoint thing having to do
with the device itself this is something
I would want to explore further
obviously this isn't manifesting itself
on the actual desktop version so that's
one reason that device testing
specifically can be helpful you might
run into an issue like this where it's
not taking up the full width here and
that doesn't make itself known on the
actual desktop now what's nice about
having a device lab like this or just
simply having your devices open with
ghost lab is that pretty much anytime
you're working on something if you have
them synced or even if you don't you can
just head to the device itself
click on it and sort of see how it feels
without having to do any actual pushing
do any sort of tests or
so I can feel their that on the tablet
here that hits zone for this particular
video
it didn't feel big enough it just didn't
feel I wasn't confident that when I
click that that I was clicking the right
one now in addition this actually looks
really nice for the or the tablet size
so I know that this breakpoint is doing
good things now let's say I wanted to
see this all in landscape let's check
out how I managed to do that I actually
cut a Ridge in the piece of wood here
that allows it to be turned completely
on its side and if you'll notice every
single one of these devices has a piece
of wood right there on the side of it to
hold it up for when this is turned
sideways so I'm gonna zoom down here and
I'm gonna show you what this looks like
on its side
me
so as you can see now I have every
single device in landscape and one thing
you'll notice is that the difference
between the 10 inch tablet and the 9
inch tablet actually becomes a little
bit more pronounced here well we both
have the filtering no longer hidden
behind some sort of toggled navigation
the 9 inch tablet has 2 columns up and
the 10 inch tablet has 3 columns up and
let them look really good the sizing is
nice on there and everything just sort
of works however one thing that's not
working is if you come to let's say this
galaxy s6 here and it's on its side this
homepage it doesn't feel great so we
have this headline takes up most of the
space but we have this navigation bar
that's maybe a little bit too much and
we're not getting enough of the picture
when we scroll here this might actually
be a little bit better with more of the
desktop style layout where we're maybe
going to two columns or something even
worse when we go to menu there's no way
that I can get to all of our options
here so as you can see testing on all of
these devices is really something that's
going to be totally necessary for you to
understand exactly how your users are
experiencing your website now you don't
necessarily need a big board of devices
like this like I said just simply having
these devices available and using your
website on the device itself rather than
just within chrome dev tools is
endlessly useful so I did build this
device lab myself unfortunately there
are no plans for I just sort of made it
up as I went cut some pieces some some
not just here and there drilled some
holes for USB cables and then I just
have a USB hub mounted to the back of
it's all these USB s can be powered at
once making sure that all of the devices
are always fully charged so I hope you
enjoyed that look at how I actually use
my device lab in practice to help me
develop and understand my websites
better on mobile devices and upcoming
inside LevelUp tutorials videos I'm
going to be diving a bit more into my
personal setup or how I use my text
editors and IDs
I'm going to be diving into how I record
these videos and I want to be diving
into what I do for actual work in
staying on my websites and hopefully can
give you a better insight about how
these tools are used in a real working
environment so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments about this comment
