we're gonna pick up where we left off
and we're gonna show you how you can
animate things in angular so that not
only when we have this enter and leave
state like we had when we were toggling
whether these names are gonna be shown
or hidden but we're gonna modify this so
it's not when the names are shown or
hidden because really this isn't
necessarily that much of a real-world
example maybe you're toggling something
and you want it to fade in or anything
like that but I think maybe a more
important or maybe a more frequently
used way will be when you're adding
content or something like that basically
just to let you know how flexible this
animation stuff really is in angular so
let's go ahead and make some small
modifications to what we were doing we
had these SVG Twitter icons the logo
here I'm just gonna totally nuke those
out of here and get rid of them because
we really don't need them and we have
that in person at HTML so I'm going to
come into here and just give her this
ng-include
there we go now we just have a span with
the item the person name and age just
like so
okay now still hiding and showing does
this animation so that now that we have
that cleared up we can come to our index
dot HTML let's actually head to our
Styles here I'm gonna have to put these
in there an actual stylesheet at some
point it's just going to get way too
huge here so one thing to notice is that
we had this ng and turn ng Li ng
interactive ng leave active we had those
classes in the last video you saw that
the class is applied to when something
is either shown or hidden and at that
point the ng active the ng interactive
class is applied and therefore the
transition happens over the course of
time that is specified in the transition
so we had our animations here they're
changing opacity from 0 to 1 they are
translating from negative 100 to zero
and this is something you well this is
on the unordered list here just this way
these transitions we add them to this Li
if we just change these you ELLs here to
L eyes
like so now we come back to our page and
refresh now you'll notice it when I
refreshed when all of them came in they
all slid to the left
they'll slid from the left let's see
what happens when we add a new name
we'll just add another Scot there we go
and let's keep adding names as you can
see they keep sliding in now this is
something that you might be used to
seeing more this sort of animation when
things are added it's a video visual
indication that something is happening
maybe we even do something where instead
of having it translate negative 100x we
can translate why now and let's
translate why when we'll just have this
be simply ten pixels and we'll translate
it why just like so I can copy these
whole lines and and put them here okay
now when we come here let's refresh
let's add another name there we go and
that's a nice little animation so you
you don't necessarily need to have it be
outrageous or anything like that but
that is way more interesting to look at
than something that's just an abrupt
change of the name just popping in there
yeah so that's really nice now in
addition to animating just by simply
having the ng enter and then the ng
interactive classes we can also animate
using CSS animations let's get rid of
everything except for just the ng n term
who's going to come at these out and now
we just have the ng enter and now let's
go ahead and get rid of some of this
stuff I'm really just going to have
animation and now the animation will
just be
we'll just be Faden and it's going to be
over the course of 0.2 seconds and it's
going to be linear okay now let's go
ahead and define that animation and we
can define a CSS animation with the @
sign and we can say keyframes and now we
can just say fade in so it's the name of
our animation and then we have some
brackets now since we don't have
multiple steps in this animation we can
just say from inside of from we can give
it an opacity of zero and if we're gonna
have this a two and the two is going to
have an opacity of so from zero to one
just like so okay now let's head back to
our HTML and as you can see I'm actually
running a later version of Chrome so I
don't need any of the CSS prefixes but
make sure you have your prefixes in here
for whatever browsers you need to
support for or I would actually suggest
using an autoprefixer if you have any
sort of post-processing going on okay so
with that another way you can see when
we refresh the names fade in we have a
new one and it fades in like so so as
you can see we took this code that had
the enter leave enter leave active that
gives us complete control of every
single step and we've moved it down into
something a little bit more succinct
here however it doesn't give you the
total control that the other one did
obviously you could have the same ng
leave and then your keyframes would then
be from one to zero instead of zero from
one or you could do the same animation
on ng leave and just have it be reversed
by the CSS animation property reverse so
now you can animate your objects
entering and leaving using either
animations or transitions so what other
things can you animate in angular so the
directives that allow you to animate
with ng in turn leave our ng repeat
ng-view ng include ng switch ng
if ng class ng-show and ng-hide so check
it out get animating remember it's
important that the animation is really
an expression of what's happening with
the content rather than necessarily just
going crazy animating everything make
sure your animations make sense within
the context of what you're using them in
but go essentially go nuts experimenting
animating with angular so as always this
is Scott one level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments you can
come into the video artists up at
twitter or facebook at level up
tutorials we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next one
