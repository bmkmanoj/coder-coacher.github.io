huts and today i'm going to continue the
last video pick up right where we left
off i'm going to talk about this theme
specific CSS file that we need to
include for this layout so that we can
have theme specific styles for this
layout that aren't going to get included
in the overall bundle of this layout and
now we also have this sidebar layout
that s CSS which we've totally neglected
right so I want to use this I want to
show you how this is used so let's come
to our TPL and let's give something a
background let's give l branding a
background actually let's give something
that's already in the layout i'll pay
jor-el me whatever will get the sidebar
first a background because that way it's
easier to see so we can say this is
going to have a background of let's just
say it's going to be 999 and that's all
good so keep in mind this is compiling
but we still haven't told our theme to
use this file and also we're going to
want to add in our variables at least or
else we want to bring in compass and
break point that sort of stuff and
actually we should at least bring
compass in here most likely to use
compass on this but either way sidebar
first only on this particular theme
version of this layout is getting this
background color it's getting compiled
to our CSS now we just need to tell our
theme yo look at this file cool so let's
come into our themes info file this is
level up underscore omega dot info and
just like we have all these other style
sheets being loaded and these scripts
being loaded here is where we can tell
our theme to check out this layout
specific layout specific style sheet
right so you could really do this
anywhere in this file you might want to
just do it underneath everything so we
could say layout styles whatever you
want to call that
and we can say layout and then we're
going to pass in the layout name which
is going to be sidebar and then we're
going to say style sheets again all so
the reason we're putting it here is
because we don't want this CSS to travel
with the theme or with the layout if
we're moving in somewhere we want this
to be site layouts or theme specific
like I said before so that's why we're
defining it here layouts and this is of
course just the path to our CSS file
which is level sidebar that layout that
s start at CSS ok that's long and I'm
pretty sure there's no typos there so
now we should be able to clear our cash
again and come back to our page refresh
and we see our sidebar has that color
that we wanted to have and now if we
were to change the layout to something
else this color would go away this
layout would go away and we now have a
portable theme but still have the
ability to make modifications do it
great so in the next video we're going
to show you how you can actually take
this layout and we're going to create
another one by duplicating this layout
and then we're going to modify it even
more we're going to add regions and
stuff like that modify the TPL file a
little bit more and the video after that
we're going to show you how i can text
release which between them so as always
this is scott what level of touch if you
have any questions please leave this
comment at twitter or facebook anywhere
in the video just let us know what
you're thinking I always love to read
the comments but we get a ton of
comments a day and a lot of them are
people asking for technical help right
and I can't always give the amount of
time I would love to give helping out
people because of course this is just a
side project for me this is I have a
full-time job right so I'm only answer
the questions that I absolutely can
answer quickly and I promise that I do
read them and I try to get to them so if
you're reading the comments and you know
an answer to somebody's question please
help them out and answer them and I will
do so the same when I can so thanks for
watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
