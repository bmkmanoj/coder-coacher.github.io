love tutorials and in this video I'm
going to be showing you groups now
groups in principle are a little
different than some other applications
because they allow for more than just
organizing your content groups in
principle allow you to do things like
clipping masks they allow you to
actually have specific interactions
scroll windows and stuff like that so
let's get going on that right now so
we've gone over some topics right we've
made rectangles we've imported things
whatever there's a lot of stuff here but
one thing we haven't covered really is
grouping things together in so many
other applications like sketch we have
one object let's say we have another
object and let's say we have some text
let's throw some text in here right you
just say hello world okay just like that
beautiful let's bump up the font size of
this a little bit crease this okay just
so it's nice and visible maybe that was
too much okay beautiful hello world so
we have all this stuff here right and
let's say we want to move or animate
these together in a group now one thing
we can do is select all of our layers on
the side of our layers property and do
command G you can now see it's put
everything into a folder now what's cool
about folders within principle is the
folder itself has animatable properties
as well as dimensions if we open up this
folder you can see each of these
individual items have their own
dimensions but the folder itself also
has dimensions which is interesting it's
something different right we could make
this hit zone for this folder like this
big right and then whatever if you say
tap on this you'd have to tap right here
despite the objects being outside of the
folder now where this comes in a lot of
handy is this fancy clip sub layers
button
it's a checkbox here we select this and
all of the sudden
we have a clipping going on now what's
super cool is that we can animate this
so let's go ahead and do that here now
let's go I'm just going to go ahead and
delete all of this stuff okay so I just
have an image here this is a movie
poster from a Chinese film avenging
eagle okay so here we have this poster
I'm going to put it here you can see
it's clipped off like this now let's say
we wanted to give like a small preview
of this let's go ahead and I'm going to
put this into a group simply by
selecting this layer and hitting command
G now I'm going to select clip sub
layers and I'm going to drag this down
and pull this up you can imagine if we
had several of these right of different
maybe movies you could have them in a
line of different image previews and
then let's say we wanted to tap on so
let's go ahead and first duplicate this
artboard and I had a second one right
here and I'm going to click this and I'm
going to drag tap and taps going to take
me here now in this layer I'm simply
going to select this folder and adjust
the properties here to on the clip it
and likewise I'm going to say on this
folder hey if you tap this go back okay
just so we have that nice little tap
back and forth so as you can see here
even though we just have a single image
in this group we go ahead and have this
here we tap on it it's now clipped
unclipped clipped unclipped super cool
and another interesting thing is if
let's say we pull this down here and now
we tap on it you can see it even
animates its position up to where it was
so if we were to have several different
of these films you could imagine a list
of these like clipped sort of thumbnails
or whatever where you select and you
click on this and then it opens up the
main page so this is pretty sweet you're
going to notice this technique where you
have a folder with clipped sub layers
you're going to notice this being used
all the time so just like that we have
this neat little
animation that is clipped and it's
unclipping essentially by animating up
as the folder gets larger and this to me
is one of the most interesting features
of principle is that the folder or the
group itself has properties that the
items inside of it if you have clipping
set on they have to essentially just
acts as like a so the whole thing is a
mask so you don't have to create a mask
layer the folder itself is the mask now
in addition we can also give the folder
with the folder selected we can give
this a border radius if we want let's go
ahead and select this one right here and
let's give this a giant border radius
I'm just going to hold shift and now we
have it a little bit curved you'll
notice this is also animatable when it
opens up it curves and doesn't uncover
here we can even do something like we
have the group selected here and you'll
notice when I pull this shut it's just
clipping it okay and let's go ahead and
just make this a straight circle by
typing in 150 by 150 okay so we now have
this guy's head we can actually scale
this whole thing and I grab it like this
perfect now this is maybe where the
scale property will come in handy for
instance you'll notice if I drag this
it's going to change the folder itself
I want this guy whose head to be a
little bit smaller here let's go ahead
and set this to be something like point
5 you can see he's now smaller and the
whole thing is smaller and when we click
it in our inspector it's awesome right
so just that alone we now have this
really powerful animation where let's
say we have like a chat head or
something that you've seen in other
interface abs maybe it's like a snapchat
thing when you select it and it opens up
full screen I mean this is just really
really super easy you almost how long
that took just by having a clipping mask
there that couldn't be any cooler right
there
now the only bummer is having to tell
your web developers that they have to
make this particular interface and have
it work that smoothly and nicely cool so
this is folders and groups within a
principle it's also important to note
that in addition to doing command G
there's also this group button here if
we click this you can see it put our
folder within a folder so if you have
your layers let's say you click and drag
selected you can always click this group
button up here the command G thing is
just a nice little shortcut so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
you want have access to all of these
principle files along with all of these
videos before they're released you can
purchase the series on store dot level
up tutorials com there's a whole bunch
of extra videos that are only available
through purchase where I go through and
build some really complex some of my
favorite principle examples that I've
pulled off of Facebook or other
inspiration sites and I go through and
just show you exactly how they were made
so check it out as always this is Scott
with level of tutorials had to start out
level up tutorials calm and help support
creation of these free tutorials thanks
so much for watching and I'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
