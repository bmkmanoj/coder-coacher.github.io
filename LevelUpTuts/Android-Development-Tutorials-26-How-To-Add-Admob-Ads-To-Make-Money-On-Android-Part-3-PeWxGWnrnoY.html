of Tut's and today we're going to be
talking about ads and in the past couple
of videos we did some work and we edit
and add to our page with AdMob and now
we want to make it a little bit better
so if you remember in the last video our
ad was hanging out down here at the
bottom but it wasn't always Evan it
wasn't really at the bottom I was just
directly belief beneath the press mean
button and that's you know I mean it's
okay but if you're familiar with most
apps that use ads you see it either pin
to the top at the bottom or somewhere
and we want to do that with our ad and
we're going to do that with a scrollable
view here and we're going to wrap this
content up in the top with a scroll
above you so if somebody's device is too
short even you'll be able to still
scroll and use the content without
having the ad overlay something and then
the ad is going to be pinned to the
bottom here so you're going to learn two
things in this video you're going to
learn how to use a scrollable view and
and how to have this ad at the bottom
what's important to note is that we
won't be taking full advantage of the
scrollable view here it's just sort of a
security point but in future videos we
will see the scrollable view coming to
handy bore so just know that if you need
content to be able to to scroll up or
down once it's over filling the page or
something like that you can always wrap
it in the scroll view and that will take
care of it for you so what we're going
to do here is we're going to wrap all of
our content that's not our ad in a
scroll view and then we're going to wrap
that again in a relative layout now
we're going to do this because the
scroll view can only actually have one
thing in it and that thing is going to
be the relative layout which is then
going to contain everything
so let's come up to the top here
directly under this original relative
layout we can get started by just typing
scroll view and then I can have it
autocomplete here I'm going to cut this
and paste it down below here
cool and for our options for our scroll
view
we want to say well first we need to
give it an ID so of course we're going
to say Android ID is equal to and then
ID plus and this will just be a scroll
layout and that's fine and then next
thing we're going to have is the layout
height so I'm actually just going to
copy and paste this from this image view
right here however we're not going to
keep wrapped content we're going to have
this be fill layout or fill parent I'm
sorry fill underscore parent and then
this one's also going to be fill parent
cool cool cool and now we just need one
more thing we need a somewhere that
tells this scroll view that it needs to
be positioning itself above the ad and
so we're going to have its Android and
then layout above and you may have seen
this before already and here we're going
to do at and then now we can do plus ID
/add view because this is the first time
this ad view is getting declared so down
here in our actual ad whereas it down
here we don't have to have this plus
anymore can just be like that cool
scroll back up okay so now let's give me
a whole bunch of stuff it's give me a
bunch of yellow here because scroll view
cannot contain all of this stuff so it's
telling me you have to rep something
else around this content and what better
to do that than another relative layout
so let's wrap this in another relative
layout here and again I'm just going to
cut this and paste this down here so
keep in mind that this relative layout
goes within the scroll view and now I
should be able to fix all this alignment
but I'll have to do that afterwards come
back up here it's getting a little
sloppy okay
and sorry I'm just cleaning this up just
a hair so it's not so ugly okay so now
in this relative layout we can say
things like ah I'm sorry let's wrap the
content here Android layout width and
height wrap the content cool okay so we
just have one more thing to do down here
I had our ad we actually need to tell it
to basically sit on the bottom so we're
going to add just one more line here to
our ad view and it's just going to say
Android layout and then this is going to
say underscore align the hip two O's
line parent bottom and this is going to
equal to true so this is going to say
aligned at the bottom we're good and now
let's run our app here so that this
should be aligned at the bottom then the
scroll layout is going to be sitting on
top of it and we're going to have a
relative layout inside of that that's
taking care of everything else
so granted that there's no typos in here
and I didn't mess anything up this
should be running totally fine so let's
go ahead and click run okay and now you
can see we have our app booted up and
like I said the layout isn't tall enough
to really make a difference here but we
have our are all of our content here we
have our button and then now we have
some space below it and then our ad and
that's because the screen has this size
that can afford to do that so we now
have our ad laid out at the bottom of
our app which is what we wanted so this
app might not be perfect there's lots to
do in fact we're going to go over tons
more stuff but I think now we're ready
to learn how to put something on the
Android Market so in the next couple of
videos we're going to be publishing this
application to the Android Market so as
always this is Scott with level up tuts
if you have any questions or comments
leave a comment the video or hit us up
at Twitter or level up tuts let us know
what you're thinking promise more videos
are on their way
