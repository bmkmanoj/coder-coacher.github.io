love tutorials and in this video working
continued the react for everyone series
by building our app component for our
new application so we have everything
all set up now we're going to build the
app component that's going to render
into our Dom and we're going to be using
a sort of a shell to drill down further
into more components so let's get going
on that right now okay so now that we
have our set up pretty much done let's
get started building our app if you
remember we had our web pack config file
now I actually the typo I had loader
typed in here despite I may have said
loaders we need this to have an S here
or else you this won't work so make sure
that web pack config line 10 says
loaders loaders with an S at the end
okay cool so now that we have loaders
here you might want to restart your
server I'm not exactly sure if that
makes a difference but typically if I'm
changing configuration stuff I stop and
start my server you can stop by hitting
ctrl C and then restart by typing in
that same node modules forward slash
that bin webpack dev server command that
we had before right here you see
highlighted on my screen okay you should
get a bundle is now valid and we should
be able to see basically where we left
off a blank screen no errors okay so
this is great but let's go ahead and
start writing our component I'm gonna
head to app dot J s and this app dot J s
we're actually gonna be writing in an
es2015 syntax or es6 syntax instead of
what we showed in the first couple of
videos so this is going to be a more
modern way of doing things and what we
first need to do is import react so we
could say import react from and then in
quotes react and then finish it off with
the semicolon so notice how the first
react is uppercase and the second react
is a string and in lower case so we now
should be able to have access to react
and what we're actually going to be
using as rect dot component
so now to actually create our component
before we used correct dot create class
now we're going to be saying class and
then class app extends and then react
notice how to say capitalized react and
then a capitalized component okay now
here we can have curly brackets like so
and inside of our component if you
remember we have things like our render
function so we can say render we can
just do two parentheses and then two
curly braces like that and inside of
here let's just return an h1 that's
going to just simply say contacts list
first I'm gonna have a div and next I
have a div inside of there and inside of
here we can say h1 contacts list now
keep in mind we're doing this sort of
like a top-down approach to components
so we're gonna be passing information
from one component to another through
props like we showed a couple of earlier
videos and it's really nice to think
about your application as sort of a
series of nested components for instance
in a context list you have your sort of
whole application shell which is what
we're calling app here then you might
necessarily have a list and then you
will have a list item those can be
separate components and then think about
it we'll also probably want to have a
list form for adding new components and
maybe even something like a detailed
item or something with details if you've
selected a particular contact so as you
can see here through this new syntax
class app extends react dot component we
are now using all of this information
simply just an output a div with an h1
in it and if you head to your terminal
you should see you're not getting any
errors okay if you're getting any errors
then there is a typo somewhere probably
okay so let's actually head to our
browser and you might expect an h1 to
appear here but not yet we're actually
having real
I told this component to render anywhere
all we've done has simply defined this
component so now at the bottom here
let's do a couple of things if you
remember from our index.html we had an
ID app on this empty div right here
we're gonna want to remember that
because what we need to do is tell react
dot render and then inside of this
function we'll be passing in our app and
we can pass it in just like so so now
we're using this component we're saying
hey react render the app component and
to determine where we're doing that we
need to do a document get element by ID
which is something that is very vanilla
JavaScript so we can say document dot
get element by ID and now we're going to
put an app in quotes just here so we're
saying react render app this app
component which exists right here and
we're gonna say render it in to get
element by ID app okay so let's head to
our browser and you can see upon refresh
we now have an h1 with the word contacts
list here so we have our app which is
the base component here and soon we're
gonna be dropping in a component and
then a component inside of a component
and so on and so forth until we have a
full-on contacts list so by now you
should have this context list HTML if
you don't check your code let me bump it
up a font size or two here just so you
could make sure everything is exact here
is the app dot J S here is index.html
and here is web pack config dot J s cool
so we're now ready to go and in the next
video what we're gonna be doing is
building out our contact list component
which will further be drilling down to
our actual contacts so as always this is
Scott without love tutorials if you have
any questions or comments if you come in
the video hit me up a Twitter or
Facebook a level up tutorials thanks for
watching and I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
