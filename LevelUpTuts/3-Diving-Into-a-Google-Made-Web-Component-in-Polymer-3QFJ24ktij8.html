tutorials and in this video we're going
to dive in to the component that we used
in the last video and we're going to
pick apart the code and sort of see what
makes it work so that you can have a
better understanding of what's going on
behind the scenes with web components
and polymer so check it out let's get
started so in the last video we dropped
in this google map and we used a
latitude and longitude and we came to
our browser and sure enough we had a
google map now this is probably the
easiest way to add and modify a map that
we've ever had on the web considering
before you'd have to go to google maps
or hit their API and grab some embed
code so this is just a really nice way
of doing it and for the complete list of
properties and things like that that you
can use you can always come back to this
google map documentation page within the
catalog it shows you all of the
different properties what they expect
and what they do so like a zoom level
things like that so now let's actually
head to our browser and before we go to
sublime text where most of this video is
going to be spent minus inspect this
element I'm going to open up HTML up an
up the body and you'll notice that we
have this google map element here what
we can do is we can open it up now when
we open it up you can see quite a bit in
here we have a Google Maps API element
so instantly you've seen not only a
custom web component but we've seen a
component inside of component one that
we didn't even know was there and we
have a div with a map we have another
div another div some of the stuff is
hitting the Google API and it's what's
giving us our actual map itself along
with the controls here so as you can see
this is where everything comes from
within our new custom element for
instance we have is Google logo here and
is position absolutely with the margin
left and right and you can see that
those positionings are what makes it
show up so this is very familiar this is
HTML like we've always seen it however
it's just been imported using these
custom web components so cool so now
that we've seen
the sort of guts are of this inside of
our inspect element in chrome let's
actually head to sublime text and check
out what is going on here so we're
importing web components jas which is
really what makes the whole of polymer
work so we're not going to be diving
into that however the google map element
itself is being imported simply by this
google map HTML so let's come to our
folder where we got this which was
google map and then google map dot HTML
and so this is going to really tell you
all you need to know about this element
you can see first we're bringing in
polymer which is referenced from the
path in our bower components this book
polymer folder here and polymer dot HTML
and then we're importing the google api
google maps api HTML so it's another
custom element that we're importing here
then we're bringing an iron resizable
behavior which is a custom google
element in fact you can find a that
element on google's own listing if we
come back to the catalog and go to iron
elements and you can see that iron
resizable behavior is right here the
iron elements are set of visual and non
visual utility elements so just give you
some idea of what that's doing there and
then we have to google map marker HTML
because we have this google map marker
being brought and we can actually go
ahead and use this google map marker
element as well in addition to our map
so let's head back to index dot HTML and
inside of this element let's go ahead
and add some space in here and lets you
use this google map marker so just like
we had before we can have a new element
and except for this one is just type in
marker close that off and this needs to
be closed out as well and what we can do
is we can give this now some latitude
i'm going to give it the exact same
levity longitude as our map itself that
way it's going to be just a point on the
map and we can say whether this is going
to be draggable or not we can give this
a title so we can say title
welcome to denver here okay so now that
I've saved this let's check out this
google map marker by refreshing our
document and as you can see we now have
this marker thrown on here and when we
hover over it it gives us this welcome
to Denver so that's just a little bit of
what's going on here simply by including
another custom element you're able to
bundle elements within elements and
therefore make these components truly
moldable and modular in a really nice
sort of ways was also great here is
inside of the commented out code it
gives you examples so it's showing you
to give your google maps and sort of
height then some latitude and longitude
values then shows you using google map
marker these values are for san
francisco and if we come down here it
even gives you some examples of how to
set the variable attributes with
javascript itself so we can use a
document query selector on the google
map and then give it a longitude and
latitude that way and give us an alert
once the map is loaded so we can even
get an event listener once the map is
ready and again we have one that gets a
google map directions so this is just
really super great now let's scroll down
here a little bit and you'll see we have
this dumb mob module and it has an idea
of google map so the dom module is
really what's defining your component
here as you can see it's ID google map
is what's going to be used when we
actually use the component itself now if
we scroll down you can see it has some
styles so for instance the host is
getting a position relative display and
block the map idea itself is getting a
position absolute top left right bottom
zero sort of putting it in all four
corners and then that's the end of the
styles now within the template code is
what the actual HTML Dom stuff is going
to be happening so you'll notice that we
have this google maps api element and if
we head back to our HTML you remember
when we open up this google map the very
first thing is this google maps api
element so as you can see what's inside
of template matches one to one what
what's actually inside of our down here
okay so now in addition to that we have
this div ID with a map and we have this
content ID markers select google map
marker and you'll notice below our ID
map we have our google map marker cool
so we're going to dive into the
specifics although this quite a bit more
once we start really building our own
custom components now let's actually
check out what's going on outside of the
Dom module outside of the Don module is
a script tag where we then get to define
some things for instance polymer we have
is google map which is defining our
element and then you can see we have
some documentation letting you know
exactly what's going on for instance we
have properties which allows you to
input a an API key client ID and
latitude which you saw as using so these
properties map to the attributes here so
latitude was looking for a value and
that value is a number so here we have
latitude 330 9.73 is going to be
overriding what they have as the default
value which is set via this value key so
we have notify and reflect to attribute
which we're going to be going over a
little bit more once we start writing
some of this ourselves then we have map
and let's check out some more we have
libraries which is looking for a string
and it gives you a place to check out a
little bit more about the maps libraries
longitude zoom level audio auto tilt
something for a boolean these are all
the same properties you're going to find
on Google's page here what's back to
Google Maps component if you notice
we'll see all of those latitude
libraries longitude map map min zune
maksoon Mouse events no auto tilt we're
going to find all of those inside of
this object here so let's come down here
and as you can see a lot of this is
really just defining things that can be
used in this element next we have
behaviors which is where we added the
other polymer behavior the iron
resizable behavior that we loaded up top
and we have listeners for iron or resize
which has to do with the iron resizable
behavior and we have some other stuff
which obviously we're going to have to
dive into a little bit more before we
can fully explain so let's scroll all
the way down and as you can see we have
various functions that are going to be
defining the characteristics and the
abilities of this particular element for
instance this resize so this is going to
be making sure the map resizes correctly
with the longitude that we've set before
and so as you can see there is a lot of
stuff going on on this element now
things like the Google Maps element has
a lot to do so it's going to be a bit
more complex than your run-of-the-mill
element but what's great about this is
that it just shows you exactly how much
is possible to cram essentially into one
web component you can make components
that do a whole lot of stuff or you can
make components that do a whole little
bit of stuff and in fact in the next
video we're going to be making a
component that does pretty much nothing
but it's going to be our component so
try to find some components in the
catalog that you want to check out throw
them into your document and then just
pau through them and see what kind of
code is in there that's building up the
functionality of those components as
always this is scott what level of
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments have it come in the video
artists up at twitter or facebook at
level up tons thanks for watching and
we'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
