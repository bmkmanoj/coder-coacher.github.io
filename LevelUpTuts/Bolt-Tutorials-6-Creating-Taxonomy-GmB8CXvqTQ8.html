love-love Tut's and today we're going to
create texana me for our site and it's
going to be an entirely new taxonomy and
going to then add it to our pages
content type and I'll show you how to do
all that just now so we're going to go
to sublime text - we have our whole Bolt
site loaded up here and before I showed
you this inside of the apps and then our
app and then config folders we have
where we had our menu jmo file we also
have content types
taxonomy and our config file so let's
check out our text on a V file so inside
of our taxonomy file you'll see the
created a taxonomy and you'll notice
that there's some options already in
here for us and that's really cool
because it gives us an idea about what
we can do so you see these behaves like
so behaves like tags behaves like
grouping and that we have behaves like
category so let's talk about these three
different types and tags are according
to their documentation sort of a
free-form labeling so every time you
type one and it gets add it to the list
of taxonomy that will you know will
autocomplete when you type it in that's
what you'd expect when using a tag for a
blog post or something like that
there's also categories which it's name
is pretty good representation of what it
is categories are predefined
categorizations of your content so we
have categories which could be
considered like if we were making a site
for art tutorials the categories could
be video tutorials or it could be web
web tutorials or Android like mobile
device tutorials it's not it's a little
bit looser than something like grouping
which is the other type so a grouping is
more strict and it really keeps your
records apart from one another if you
remember in the back end here on our
pages we had main meta and other if you
see that in their taxonomy those are our
groupings so we want to have
a new type of taxonomy and we're just
going to call this series and we're
gonna have a series I'm gonna have a
colon here and it's going to be named
and then where this is gonna be
capitalized so this is just the way you
did
Wow that wanted autocomplete that this
is just the way you want it to show up
on your site and slug would be its URL
friendly sort of name so lowercase
letters underscores that kind of thing
or hyphens so and we don't have to give
this a singular name or a singular slug
because it's just a series and we're
going to say it behaves like and we want
this to behave like grouping because in
the backend when I have a new drupal
tutorial whatever I want to keep it away
from all the other ones so we're gonna
say it doesn't allow multiples but we're
gonna say options and then inside of an
array here we're gonna say Drupal we're
gonna say bolt and let's also have
Magento okay so this is the series that
I'm working on currently
might as well plug them right here so
leave safe bed and now we just need to
edit to our content type so we're gonna
click content types and we wanted to add
this to our pages so we'll scroll down
here until we see pages and we're just
gonna copy this text on amiright here
because we want this to be the exact
same thing and we want this to say
series so now this is going to have the
taxonomy chapters as well as series and
we're going to keep it like this we'll
go over how you create content types and
how you edit them more in other
tutorials but for now let's just refresh
this page and let's check out our first
real page we're gonna edit it scroll
down here and I want you can see that
now under texana me we have this series
so let's say this is going to be a bolt
type video so you maybe notice that we
don't have our chapters text on them you
only have this series well what gives we
were in our content type and you see
that chapters is here why isn't it
showing up well the thing is is that a a
content type can only have one taxonomy
with the type of grouping and this is
because you can't group by multiple
different types of taxonomy so maybe you
should consider using a different one
like category or tag based on of what
your needs are but for this for us it
makes more sense to group these pages by
the series than it does by the chapters
so I'm gonna go ahead and delete the
chapters because it's not showing up
anyways refresh the page here we're
gonna add this to Drupal videos and
we're gonna save the page and you can
now see that the overview here shows
that we have a group of drupal and these
ones are all confused because they
already had another content of content
so this is why you're not not want to do
this changing that around after you have
your content type but since this is all
dummy content anyways it doesn't matter
for us right now
but just a heads up when you're creating
your text out of me so this is how you
create a taxonomy and bolt and add it to
our page in future tutorials we might go
over a little bit more advanced use of
text out of me and once we get into
templates we're gonna put those texts
out of me to work so as always this is
