of Tut's and today I'm going to give a
basic introduction to layouts in Magento
so layout files might be a little bit
different from anything you've seen so
far what they are is their form of an
XML file that allows you to modify the
layout because you're able to move
blocks of content around structural
blocks of your site and we sort of went
over what content blocks and structural
blocks were in a previous video for
instance the header would be a
structural block the content would be a
structural block left column would be
structural block content blocks would be
more like something like this product
tags actually let's go to the home page
there's a by default we have this
popular tags this would be a Content
block and if we actually check out our
HTML here by inspecting this you can see
that this block tag block it's an a div
called block tags that's within a div
that is within the column left side
column so the content block here is the
block tags the structural block is the
column left side column and because this
isn't really CSS at all this might not
look like it's a left column any sorts
but the structurally in your HTML this
is the left column
we'll get into more CSS so if you're not
familiar with CSS I recommend you do the
level up top CSS and go from the very
beginning very basics all the way up to
css3 some cool new stuff you can do and
that that series is actually still going
right now so you can learn CSS CSS is
not hard you just have to spend the time
learn the basics and it'll all make a
ton of sense and then you'll be able to
modify your site in all sorts of ways so
here we have this column left right and
this is what we were saying when we say
we have a Content block okay and the
layout files are is the file that's
assigning content blocks to structural
blocks so let's say we wanted to modify
this
a cloud that we had here as our block
tag Club well you notice we turn on
these developer debug tools in the last
one so to actually find out what layout
layout file we need we actually need to
look over here to it what template it's
using so before we saw this and this was
the path to the template however what
we're looking for is a clue to what
layout file it's using and this is going
to go front end base default template
and then tag if you notice tag is the
first folder that's outside of the
template file the template folder so
this title right here it should be where
we're looking so let's go to our site
here and just like before we went to app
and then now we're going to go to design
and then front-end and then instead of
template this time we're going to go to
layout you can see there's all these XML
files in here well hopefully there's one
name tag keep scrolling down and here it
is tag just like we would have expected
because this is right inside of template
is tag just like if we're looking for a
certain one let's look at template page
or template page so let's try to find
any one template pole so it for this one
we'd be looking for pull XML pull xml's
right here just like we said page before
page X and all is right here so this is
where these layout files go and these
things are really complex and it's
really sort of different so I'm going to
take a couple of tutorials to talk about
them this is just going to be very very
basic so let's actually check out our
tag XML file and we'll see what it looks
like yes we're going to open it as
always okay and if you've ever seen XML
this should look pretty familiar because
it's pretty standard however it's a
little bit different in terms of what
you're doing with Magento it's not
always super intuitive so the thing to
notice is the default is going to load
on most the pages and read the comments
here they can help you out a lot
customer account pages render for all
tabs and dashboard so this is really
going to
you know let you know exactly what's
going on here well I don't want this to
show up I don't want this popular tags
to show up on in the left right I want
to show up on the right well let's
actually change that okay so the same
way we did with our template files I'm
going to come back in here and this is
our as you remember this is our theme
itself and if you remember we created a
layout file when we created our theme
and just like we did before we want to
replicate this structure so layout we
just need this file so let's grab this
tag XML file and I'm going to drop it
into my theme on a copy it so we don't
modify the Magento's and then now I'm
going to open this one in sublime text
so we're just going to change this text
too right I'm going to save this I'm
going to come back to our page and
refresh and if we look in the right
column scroll all the way down here
where the right column stuff is you'll
see our tags are now showing up in the
right column well if you look back up
here you'll notice that the tags are
also still showing up in the left column
well this actually has to do with that
weird default change layout that is done
for the home page if we go to CMS pages
and then homepage where it's not
actually a two column page and the
content is actually you can see that the
content has been changed here so this is
actually adding in this block tag
popular in the template itself and so we
can get rid of this and now I'm going to
go ahead and save this page and come
back and it's going to be fine we won't
see it there anymore so this might be an
exception here so it's no longer here
now and it's showing up in the right
like we want it and likewise if you
didn't want to show up at all we could
actually just get rid of this just like
that I'm going to save this come back
and it's gone so
for however there is another way to
remove these which we'll be going over
in the next tutorial so don't go crazy
and just removing start removing all
this reference blocks because I'm going
to show you a different way to do it
using a local XML file
okay so just you don't have to know a
ton about this right now however like I
said we're gonna have to dive into a
whole bunch more topics with these
layout files to truly understand them
but this for right now is the reference
name and the reference is used to
reference another block in this case
it's referencing the the content block
that's right and before it was
referencing the content block left so if
this is confusing don't worry it's going
to give out less confusing we're going
to be by the end of this able to create
not only our own layouts we're going to
be able to create our own template files
and then reference them in layouts get
them to show up wherever we want and
completely take control over the content
of your site and then after that we're
going to get into some more advanced
stuff using PHP to totally modify how
your site's looking as always please

LevelUp Tut's let us know what you're
thinking once again this is Scott and
