of Tut's and today we're going to be
starting a new series on sketch three
now sketch three is a really powerful
lightweight professional design
application and this is what many people
are hailing as a perfect alternative to
the bloated slow old versions of
Illustrator or Photoshop which are also
extremely expensive uh in fact what's
wonderful about sketch 3 is that it's so
useful
I have not opened a Photoshop or
illustrator since I've been using sketch
2 and then now sketch 3 in fact I don't
even have them installed on this
computer because I like this app so much
and there's so many great modern
features in sketch 3 that are not only
just for web development but for all
sorts of design aspects that are just
make it a really perfect package for the
modern workflow basically you'll be able
to accomplish more in sketch 3 faster
than you ever were in Photoshop or
illustrator now that said it is a young
product and there are occasionally bugs
here and there but sketch 3 is pretty
excellent so either download the free
trial or buy it it's not that expensive
in fact for what you're getting its 79
bucks and if you compare that to
Photoshop or whatever I mean it's not
even close so go ahead and download
sketch 3 and check it out keep in mind I
have no affiliation uh with sketch 3 I
have no affiliation with bohemian coding
I I just like this application a lot and
I think that there needs to be more
resources for people who want to learn
the total features and control length
sketch 3 so what are some of those
features basically everything's like
vectors right so working with vectors is
really easy and I have never been a huge
fan of Illustrator myself just because
uh I started on Photoshop and then you
moved to illustrator and some of the the
commands weren't the same and things
like that but with sketch uh the vector
tools just seemed perfect right they
just seemed
nice and easy to work with and
accomplish what you need them to
accomplish now keep in mind I primarily
use this for web design but I do use it
for other types of creation as well now
you can have a folder structure layout
structure you can see a little bit of
the interface here we're going to be
going over more of the interface in the
next video
it snaps to pixels you have this pixel
zoom feature where you can zoom in and
you're going to be seeing the fine lines
of a vector or you can basically convert
the zoom to what it'd be like if it was
a raster so you could look into what
what it would look like if you were
zooming in to the the pixels themselves
text rendering is great
there also is like text styles so you
can set up text I'll sort of like CSS
and with that you can reuse these text
Styles throughout your project
so no more adding a you know a text
style changing a textile and having to
change it everywhere now just like
Photoshop which are useful used to
there's also blending modes and
opacities there's easy to add dimensions
with this inspector
there's tons and tons of tools reusable
elements which are fantastic basically
you can create something once reuse it
and have it be referenced throughout
your project symbols textiles like I
said grids and grid tools there's like
web grids there's grids grids there's
all sorts of stuff like how many times
have you maybe had to download a grid or
a starter project for a website in
Illustrator that has like guides setup
to be a a you know a custom grid for
whatever you're using well sketch has a
really awesome grid tools to build web
grids and there's also exporting you can
export your assets and your CSS styles I
don't really use this because I like to
write my own CSS but it exists and
before because sketches for Mac it takes
advantage of the autosave features that
you'd be used to and if you have an iOS
device which I don't you can mirror your
project on that device and see what it's
going to be looking like and even have
swipe to navigate and stuff like that so
check that out
down
sketch three in the next video we're
going to get started we're going to open
it up and we're going to take a look at
the interface and just play around with
it so as always this is Scott level
tuts if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video or
hit us up at Twitter or Facebook pretty
much anywhere we love to hear from you
thanks for watching I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
