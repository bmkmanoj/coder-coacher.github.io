of Tut's and today we're going to be
creating a random number in Java and so
keep in mind I'm doing this a really
simple way there's a more complex way
using for loops that's a best practice
however we haven't gone over loops or
anything like that yet so right now for
our purposes this is going to work fine
we just want to generate a number and in
this particular instance we're going to
generate a random number 1 through 10 so
what we want to do is we want to have a
new int and an integer is a whole number
it could be negative so like negative
100 it could be 0 it could be 1,000 it
could be 20 you know uh so but they
can't be a decimal point or anything
like that it can't be you know 5.2 or
something so we're going to be using it
integer to go 1 through 10 and just like
we declared our string datatype we
declare an int by int and then we give
it a name just like we gave our string a
name before I'm going to give this name
a Rando Rando is a good name for a
random number and it's going to be equal
so let's set Brando equal to math dot
random and we're going to multiply this
value by 10 so I'm going to save this
and you'll notice there's a red line
under here it's going to tell me I need
to add a cast to end so we've seen this
cast before the reason for this is that
this math dot random produces a double
but we want an integer so it's no big
deal here we want to save this as an
integer so we're calling math dot random
and this is going to give us a number
that's between 0 &amp;amp; 1 and and why we're
multiplying it by 10 is let's say this
gives us a number it's 0.5 we then
multiply it by 10 and it's now 5 and
then we have our it turn and then we
turn it into an integer and rando is now
equal to 5
let's say in the same instance we get
0.7 we multiply it by 10 and it's an
integer so then it's 7 so you may be
thinking this is cool but what happens
how do we get if this is if this is zero
through one how do we get to number 10
because if it's zero through one and not
zero including one that heist you're
going to be able to get is 0.99 which
times by 10 is going to be nine point
nine turned into an integer it's going
to be nine well the way we're going to
be getting ten is we're going to be
getting ten through adding one to this
number so we have all this in
parentheses banana and another set of
parentheses here and then I'm going to
add one start of math that random and so
here we have our number random number
zero through one times ten plus one is
going to give us numbers one through ten
so we now have a random number that's
being generated zero through one in the
next video we're going to do some
trickery and we're going to have a
randomly output names every single time
that you click that button it's going to
output a different random name so it's
going to be a lot of fun as always if
you have any questions or comments leave
a comment in a video or hit up on
Twitter level up tuts
let's know what you're thinking as
always this is scott mix for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
