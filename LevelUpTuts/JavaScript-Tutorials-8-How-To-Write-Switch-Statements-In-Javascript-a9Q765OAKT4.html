of Tut's and today we're gonna be
talking about switch statements and if
you're new to programming you might
never have heard of a switch statement
oh really what it does this allows you
to have several cases that you check and
then do something based on what that
result is right so in the last example
we said if the value is greater than
zero then do something else if the value
is less than zero and then do something
else do something but what happens if we
wanted to say the value is equal to zero
and do something else if if the value is
equal to one do something different
else if value is equal to two or three
you know to then do something and so on
and so forth for a bunch of different
values well this isn't the most
efficient way to do it and it you know
basically JavaScript provides a better
way um and you know looks less verbose
it's less code and it's made
specifically for this so let's get rid
of all this stuff here and we're gonna
do just that
so a switch statement is really checking
a value right so we just have to type
switch and then we're gonna be checking
valve so we can just check Val here like
this and then now we can have brackets
and inside of our brackets we want to
have our case right case is going to be
the value that you're expecting so case
and then we can have a space and then 0
colon enter and now we're going to tab
over again so for the first case case 0
is going to be when value is equal to 0
we want it to counsel log console.log
and we're gonna have a counsel log
something and it's going to say you have
nothing you have nothing just like that
because the value is equal to 0 now
after this we want to have a break here
and this break just means all right case
is equal to 0 get out of the switch
statement
okay so next we're gonna have case one
and now we can say counsel that log you
have a single well single item and then
we're gonna have a break after this
again that just is you know get out here
and now we're just gonna do three
examples here because any more than that
has just sort of redundant so we can say
console dot log you have a couple of
items brilliant brilliant
okay and we're gonna finish this off
with a break well my typing right now is
not great and now we're gonna have one
more case in this last case is default
and we also have a semicolon after this
and this is what happens basically if
your case does not fit any of these
values so we can also council that log
here and we can say invalid value cool
and then we don't really need to break
here because this is the default is the
last if it's not satisfied here then
we're just gonna be gone so a case is
going to be zero right now
I forgot my semicolon here and let's go
to our browser here I'm gonna refresh
and I'm gonna go to the counsel log and
I'm gonna see exactly what we'd expect
to see here sorry one second counsel log
you have nothing because our value is
equal to zero of course it's catching
this first case and see let's see what
happens if we have the set say two we
can save this very fresh you have a
couple of items now we set this to
something like six refresh in the valid
value so a switch case a switch
statement is really just saying if else
if else if it's equal to zero if it's
equal to one if it's equal to two
otherwise do this cool
so that is a switch statement in
JavaScript check it out play around with
it and see what you can do build some
fun stuff and
in the next video we're gonna start
talking about more data types we're
gonna be introducing arrays and then
once we have arrays we can do some more
fun stuff like loops and all sorts of
cool stuff so there's tons more to learn
Java scripts a great thing
luckily it's not that hard and you just
take it one step at a time and you'll be
writing some really great code in no
time
so as always this is Scott with level up
test if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment in the
video here to submit to it our level of
Tut's let us know what you're thinking
we'd love to hear from you thanks for
watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
