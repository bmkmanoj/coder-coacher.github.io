up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you how you can create pie or
donut charts the differences and how you
can actually transform one into the
other just using symbol options built-in
to charge a s let's get going on that
now okay so now that we've covered
almost all of the major charts we just
have one more to go now this is going to
be a pie and donut chart now a pie chart
is one of the most common types of
charts and the donut chart is literally
just the same thing with a hole in the
center it just adds a little bit more
visual flair and you may have seen them
in places like mint.com if you've ever
used mint so let's talk about how we can
do this the best part about using a pie
chart here is that we largely need the
same amount of stuff I'm gonna get rid
of these options for now and you see we
have our polar area this could just be
pie so P ie just like that and we're
going to really just need as far as data
goes we need inside of our data object
we need the labels so in this case we
have five labels and then we also need
our data sets now in our data sets we
have just one data set where we have our
data which is an array of five numbers
and we have an array of five
background-color so this is going to
work very similarly to the polar area
chart in terms of how the data is
organized because we need a background
color for each individual data item as
well as each label here so if we save
this you'll head to our chart refresh
and you'll see a beautiful pie chart and
we get that rotation animation and now
that's really nice again just like the
last video we can turn that off just by
saying we don't want that to happen with
the rotation animation now with the pie
chart and the donut chart there is an
option for a rotation scale you'll
notice and only rotate it however the
animated scale animation is not on by
default so we can say options and then
inside of options we're looking for an
ax
and probably could have just commented
this out or something is it deleting it
and instead of animation we just need an
animate scale because right now we're
just animating rotation and the default
is set to fall so we can set this to be
true okay so now let's head this
let's refresh and you'll see we get this
growing exploding a pie chart now I can
see that reason why this would be false
because it doesn't exactly give you an
idea of how large the chart is when it's
growing in fact like if with the polar
area chart you sort of had this graph
you had these lines to show you how big
it would be
and this instance it's maybe a little
bit surprising what the final size of
this thing is going to be but all in all
I do like it now let's go ahead and talk
about the donut chart because the pie
and donut charts are really the same
thing all we have to do is say that this
is a dough nut and as far as all of this
goes we don't need to change anything
else and everything is the same here I
mean this chart is really the same thing
but with this white circle I mean the
animation on is quite a bit different
too but it looks really nice so a donut
chart can be a really cool thing if you
want sort of a modern look at a pie
chart maybe you don't want something
that's going to be too heavy and your
user interface this hole in the center
really lightens this up right it it
takes away some of the the weight on the
strength of this thing now what's funny
here is we have this donut right and we
can change the center size of this donut
with an option now inside of our options
above animation we can have this be cut
out percentage okay make sure I'm
spelling everything correctly and this
is just going to be a number from 0 to
100 and it's for a donut its default is
actually going to be 50 so if we set
this to something like 80 make sure we
have a comma there and we can go ahead
and refresh this you can see we get a
way skinnier donut chart and if we were
to take this down to and we were to take
this down
two-twenty you're gonna see we get away
fatter donut but you might be wondering
what's up with this property right does
this property exist just for donut
charts it actually exists for pie charts
as well and we can actually come in here
and say hey pie have a cutout percentage
of 20 and it's gonna look the same as a
donut with cutout percentage of 20 so
the difference between a pie and a donut
is simply just changing the default
number for this cutout percentage can we
make a pie chart that looks just like
the default donut chart by setting this
to 50% absolutely so if you are using
several pie charts and maybe you just
want to keep things nice and simple or
maybe you just don't want to type out
donut you can always set out this cut
out percentage if you'd like but the
donut is a shortcut essentially to just
setting this cut out percentage now
let's say we're not happy with the
rotation of this thing we want the green
to be on the top right for some reason
the green is heavy if we want it to be
on the top we can actually change the
rotation of this thing too simply by
just adding this as a rotation now you
might expect this rotation to be like a
degree right so we were to say rotate
this 180 degrees then you might expect
this to you have the green on top right
but this is actually the starting angle
to draw the arcs from and that is
determined by the and the default for
this is actually negative 0.5 times math
dot pie so if we want to modify this
let's actually use math dot pie here and
as you can see this is how we're going
to be modifying this here if we want
let's say the default which is times
negative 0.5 let's refresh this you can
see this is what it looks like but what
would happen if we were to have this be
positive 0.5 save this as you can see
it's rotated the other way the same
amount of distance and likewise if we
were to do let's say 1
it's going to be the green on the side
so a little bit of math here to
calculate the rotation I probably
preferred this to just be a degree but
but it doesn't really matter in the end
so this is pretty cool we basically no
time created a pie chart we've created a
donut chart we shown how you can
actually make a pie chart into a donut
chart and vice versa now if you've ever
used something like d3 you'll know that
the data needs to be like sort of
transformed and scaled before you do
anything with it
in charka j/s you're going to be
actually passing in the scale options
into your options itself so in the next
video we're gonna talk a little bit
about scale and what you can do with
scales to change your data a little bit
so as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you won't have access to
the level up themes for charge s there's
just a torso theme you can purchase this
series along with getting access to all
of these videos for a digital download
as always thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one
