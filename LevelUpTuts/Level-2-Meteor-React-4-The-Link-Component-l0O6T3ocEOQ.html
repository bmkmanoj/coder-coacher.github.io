up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be talking about some of the react
router specific things you need to know
to actually have your applications
working and functioning like you would
think they would be and we're gonna dive
deep into sort of how react router is
working so let's get started right now
okay so we have some things set up if
you remember from the last video we
basically got this going to where we had
a stateless functional component which
is a really cool shorthand that allows
you to get a little bit of performance
benefits as well as we have our layout
which we're showing off here as our
stateless functional component we're
using that within our routes let's go
ahead and about component here so we can
see this in action and our app component
we really just have a div and then we
have the main area right here
you know this HTML could use some work
technically we should probably take this
button throw it inside of the main area
and then just nuke out this div right
cuz why do we need this extra div in
here there we go and what we want to do
for the about page is really just have a
page right so let's go ahead and in our
client folder let's go make a new folder
new folder named and this can just be
simply pages I'm having it named pages
because really this is going to be for
sort of non dynamic content stuff like
an about page right so inside of pages
will have about j/s okay and let's go
ahead and just copy some stuff from app
digest actually I wanted to capitalize
about digest let me do that and way I
keep things consistent here okay about
j/s oh good now I want to go ahead and
simply just import react I don't even
have to have anything other than react
really in here and because this is just
some non dynamic content let's go ahead
and exercise our functional stateless
component ones
so we can do that simply by having a
constant variable named whatever our
component is going to be named so about
and that's going to equal and we could
just do an arrow function notice how
this time we're not going to be passing
anything in to our arrow function now in
the last one we just had it written like
this now I'm going to show you a nice
little shorthand even for this this
isn't even the shortest this can be
sometimes if you have a functional
stainless component where you're doing
some if-then that's kind of stuff where
you're needing to do a little bit of
conditional work before you're
outputting something then you'll need to
have a return like we did before but
just based on the way that arrow
functions work we don't need a return
and we don't even need brackets if we're
just returning the only thing here now
to do that we can simply just go in a
new line and let's go ahead and have a
main main tag here main main okay and
inside of this we can just simply have
let's have an h1 that is about us now
inside of here we could simply just have
won't be a paragraph tag and grab some
hipster ipsum or something
okay and let's just paste that in here
should actually do this in separate
paragraphs anyway that works for you and
you don't need to even do this I'm just
putting it in here so we have something
but this is really not important right
now
okay beautiful but as you can see this
is a little bit of shorthand here before
we had to have let's compare this to
this we before we had the brackets and
the return parentheses like this and we
had our about and since we don't have to
have those brackets the stuff in the
return statement why even bother with
them right so this is a really nice
concise way we essentially almost even
have an HTML file here even though this
is obviously not HTML but it's pretty
cool right this should work no problem
the only thing is is now that we need to
export default about just like that
super cool and now let's actually modify
our main layout right let's make it so
we don't need this stuff extra syntax
right so let's get rid of that let's get
rid of the return let's get rid of the
bracket and now let's move this up here
and let's tab this over one so keep in
mind this syntax here that we're using
is not possible because of any sort of
react or meteor or anything this is just
es2015 2016 whatever we're basically
this is the arrow function allows us if
we're returning one item in particular
to simply not have the brackets and a
return so this is a really nice concise
syntax that we can use if we need it
okay so things just keep on getting
easier here let's go ahead and now what
we want to do is inside of our routes we
want to import the about so let's import
about from and then we can import that
from
dot /pages about kick now I can
uncomment this line and we shouldn't see
any errors when we fire up our app and
keep in mind that line is simply just a
route with a path of forward slash about
and a component of about which we're now
importing here from about which we're
essentially just returning this main
with an h1 so now that everything is all
good in your council which it looks like
mine is you're not seeing any sort of
errors we can head to our site here I
mean maybe give us a refresh and as you
can see the voting part works fine but
let's say we go to about there it is hip
strip some right there
cool ok so let's talk about something
react router let's head back and let's
come to our main layout inside of our
header I'm simply just going to have a
nav and if you've used react router
before you may instantly sort of know
what's going on here now inside of this
nav I'm not only gonna have one or two
links I'm not gonna do this as an
unordered list right now because it just
seems like an unnecessary structure for
this type of project but what we can do
is simply just have an anchor tag for F
H ref here and we can say forward slash
about we can say have this send us to
the about page in addition I'm actually
gonna wrap our level up voting I'm gonna
wrap this in an anchor as well I'm doing
that because I wanted to just simply
link back to the home page let's get rid
of this so like I said if you've used
react router you're probably gonna see
what's happening here really quickly
what we do is we can head to our app
let's click the about link and what do
we get we had a full page reload right
we get a white it has to reload
everything has to reload all the
JavaScript and this is just not cool
right because obviously
is all client-side right why would we
want a router that has to reload the
page every single time especially if
stuff like this isn't changing its Ollie
negates the benefits of using something
like react router so let's go ahead and
instead of using an anchor tag we're
using this react router tag here if you
remember we imported from react router
we imported route index route all that
stuff this time we want to import link
so in our main layout we're going to be
importing and then inside of brackets
link from rekt router okay and now link
is essentially a react component so we
can replace the a here with link and
instead of href we want to say - we're
gonna link to about now I'm not a huge
fan of this syntax to be honest it seems
weird to have an entirely separate thing
to link I understand why it's here you
know maybe that's something that will
change in the future but here we have
essentially what our links to about now
this actually creates a real H ref for
us so we has an anchor tag in the actual
dumb when we look at the dumb let's
actually go ahead and inspect here and I
can show you in fact you can see there
is an anchor tag in the Dom here however
this time when we click the link none of
this stuff out top here changes and we
don't have a full page refresh I mean
this you can tell it's so much faster
it's not having to reload all that stuff
and this is great so we now have some
actual official routing going on that's
pretty sweet right I mean granted it
took us a few videos but that's because
we were sort of going over a whole bunch
of different concepts while we were
doing it either way we now have a layout
hand we have routing something that gets
us closer to having a real working nice
application here so where do we go from
here in this intermediate series right
now that we have routing even though
it's just sort of a
pretty simple simple route here what we
want to do is we want to add some things
into this a little bit more groundwork
stuff to actually on the meteor side of
things to get this going a little bit
better in terms of allowing the
application some better structure and I
don't necessarily mean file structure
but better security and structure
overall so in the next video we're going
to be going over something called simple
schema now simple schema recently moved
to be a full node package rather than a
meteor specific package this is
brilliant for a lot of reasons mostly
because this package will see a lot more
attention outside of just the meteor
community making it so these skills will
transfer over to other projects
something that I would highly recommend
you do in fact familiarize yourself with
it so in the next video we're gonna be
adding simple schema to our project and
talking a little bit about why something
like simple schema even matters so
thanks so much for watching if you want
to catch the rest of this series head
over to store that level up tutorials
calm and you can purchase this entire
series right now you can purchase it and
get access to streaming or watching or
whatever or you can become a level of
Perl and see all videos right now as
well watch them online or offline thanks
so much for watching and I'll see you in
