up tutorials and today we're going to
talk about using the built-in functions
within stylus now you're gonna learn
what functions do and why they're there
and how they can be totally useful to
you so let's get going on that right now
so once again we're gonna be spending
most of our time in these style sheets
as you can see just like we have for the
rest of the videos I have my CSS on the
right here and my stylus over here on
the left so we can see exactly what's
happening when this compiles so before
we imported some stuff we've been using
mix-ins we've been using variables now
it's time to get into something called
functions now functions function that
very much similar to how you have
functions and things like JavaScript
where you can pass in some arguments and
your function is going to return some
sort of value and if you haven't use a
CSS preprocessor you might be wondering
what the value is to have functions in
CSS well just imagine that you can
modify values so let's say you have a
variable and that variable is a color
and then you want to adopt several other
variables that are going to be various
shades lighter than that perhaps maybe
10% lighter 20% lighter 30% lighter well
you can do that just by using your
continuous variable and then using these
built-in functions to lighten up your
color that way if you change the
variable you don't have to change
anything else in your in your CSS you
don't have to go hunting for all these
other values have you change the value
of your variable these calculations are
still going to be completed on that
value itself so that's just a really
simple example however there are lots of
different interesting things you can do
with functions and many functions can be
built right in to a stylus and if there
is something that's not built-in chances
are you can either write it yourself or
find somebody online who's already
written something for you
for instance one function that I use all
the time is the RGB a function now the
same function exists in sass and is one
of my most used functions there
as well a lot of times you're working
with either variables or hex colors and
you want to make them have opacity right
you want to make them see through and
before really the only way to do that
would be to type your RGB a for instance
let's say we wanted to give this main
section of our page here we want to give
this a background color and we wanted to
give a background color of white so we
might say FFF okay well let's say we
wanted to actually make this white
that's 90% opaque so it has 10%
transparency the way we could do that is
just by using an RGB function an RGB a
function actually so instead of having
to know that this is our value RGB a 255
255 255 , 0.9 like we wanted it we can
actually pass in the hex value itself
and we can say pound FFF now this isn't
going to be valid working CSS but as
being used as a function this is
actually going to convert this line
right here into the line we previously
had words RGB a 255 255 255 0.9 so let's
go ahead and save this and we can see
this compiled right here and that line
like I said has been converted to the
actual usable RGB a value house can be
super useful if we wanted to use any of
our variables or anything like that we
could just simply say yeah this is this
blue color now this RGB value this might
not be super easy to remember in fact
it's not gonna be 255 255 or 0 0 0 we
have this wild RGB value that's all
sorts of these different numbers you're
never gonna memorize something like this
but you know your variable blue which
we've defined in our virus file and then
we can then get the
g/b a value for it right here so this is
one of my favorite time-saving functions
now it's also a good example to see what
kind of stuff you can the general wave
functions are you have your function
name which is our GBA and then it
accepts some arguments so in this case
it accepts a color as a hex value and it
accepts a level of transparency now
passed into those it's going to return
these three values and this one value
and the next video we're gonna show you
how you can actually make your own
functions so you might get a little bit
a better idea about how these things are
working internally now I invite you to
go look at the built in functions page
on the stylus documentation I'll link
that in the description of the video now
there's a lot of these built-in
functions and they give anywhere from
very useful little shortcuts like this
RGB a1 to things that might not be so
obvious and in fact some things might
not be seeming useful at all until
perhaps you think about libraries that
are built for stylus and things on how
they've been used for instance there's a
really great library for stylus called
typographic and it's basically accepting
different ratios different intervals and
those intervals and ratios are going to
completely define every font size on
your page so by passing it one value
it's going to be able to completely
calculate all of your font sizes based
on different percentages and intervals
so the same thing as the RGB a and
having colors and being able to modify
them we can do things like desaturate
and we can desaturate by using something
like
grayscale so this function is just gray
scale and then all we need to do is pass
it a color by saving this it's going to
give us a grayscale version of this blue
color and as you can see this is the end
result is this gray
we can also tint colors and then if
you're haven't taken art classes tinting
is basically mixing the color with the
white so we could say
and let's say we want to tint blue let's
tint this blue 80% we should be getting
a light blue here which is almost a
white if we tend it a little bit less
let's say 50% it'll be a little bit more
about recognizable blue and just like
tint we can also shade things which is
going to be adding black so we can shade
something by 50% in here we have a much
heavier darker blue than what we had
before you can even do things like
invert and let's get rid of this 50%
save it and we're going to get the
inverted color which is this yellow or
in that same realm here we could do a
complement so this is going to give you
the complementary color so if we say
this we now have another yellow that's
the exact complement it's sort of an
orangish yellow of this color of blue
that we're working with you can even
choose to desaturate by a certain amount
so instead of saying give us the
grayscale version we can desaturate a
color entirely using desaturate I mean
not entirely but by a certain amount so
let's say we wanted to saturate this by
50% it's going to give us a version
that's 50% gray and in this case it's
this greyish blue right here we can even
do have functions that are having some
sort of utility for numbers let's say we
wanted an absolute value of something so
let's get off this background entirely
and let's just say margin-top and let's
use the abs function and abs is going to
be passing in a value and keep in mind
we can actually have a unit on this and
it's not going to care so we don't
actually have to think about is this a
number is this a unit or whatever so we
can say margin top is negative 10 pixels
and if we save this the margin top that
we're going to get is actually 10 pixels
we can also do things like a ceiling
function where we could say seal and
let's say if we give this a value
you of let's say 4.3 or 4.6 I'm sorry I
don't know I said three we're getting
the ceiling of five pixels now what
happens if we get rid of the pixels it's
just going to give us four point or it's
just going to give us five even and as
you know margin top of five isn't really
valid CSS so it might be nice to have
some sort of unit you'll notice that if
we add in percent here then the percent
is also output here and just like
ceiling we have the floor function that
will do the exact opposite and around
which we'll round to the nearest digit
we can also have a function that accepts
a value and it's going to give you the
unit so if we say unit save this the
unit that comes out is a string of the
percentage sign and now this might not
be super useful if you need to check
something at any given point once we get
into conditional statements and things
like that it could be totally useful to
say what kind of value am i receiving am
i receiving a pixel value am i receiving
a percentage sign or anything like that
but you can also use this to assign
variables different units so for
instance if we wanted this 4.6% to
actually be 4.6 pixels all we have to do
is comma and then as a string type pixel
and the nature of this function changes
entirely instead of giving us a unit
it's actually giving us our our value
with the new unit now again some of
these features are going to be sort of
abstract and you might be wondering when
am I ever going to be passing in a value
as a percentage and wanting it to be a
pixel these actually these things could
come up in really interesting times for
instance if we wanted to say that the
margin left on the body is going to be
negative ten pixels now let's say we
want the margin right or left
on the main to be the opposite of that
we could say margin left and then just
like we use this at color for a variable
we could use at margin left like this
and let's see what this compiles to
you'll see now that body main has a
margin left and body has a margin left
at both of negative 10 pixels well let's
say you want these to offset and you
always want them to be offset one's
gonna be negative 10 and the other one's
going to be positive 10 in fact some
grid frameworks work like this where
they have a negative margin and than a
positive margin to do that we could use
the absolute value function and we could
just say ABS function like this so now
you'll notice that margin left is 10
pixels bardet body margin left is
negative 10 they're gonna be offsetting
and one is going to be pushing to the
left and one's gonna be pushing negative
to the left so this absolute value is
then expecting a negative value and
returning a positive value now like I
said this is just a very specific
example but it's really interesting to
play around with all of these functions
that exist within stylus and like I said
I want I want you to spend some time in
the docs and just see what exists that
what you know it's possible so when
you're working in your CSS and your
stylus code you could possibly think oh
these two values are attached they're
related when one changes the other one's
gonna be real change and they're not
necessarily the same value how can we
describe that in a way that possibly
keeps them attached so we don't have to
go and modify both values if anything
changes and that's really not just it
once we get into some of these stylus
frameworks and stylus extensions like I
and typographic or some of these grid
frameworks it's gonna be really exciting
for you to be able to pour through the
stylus code that they used to build
these and just see exactly what they did
because there's a lot of useful things
to learn simply by using these functions
and seeing how other people are using
them
so in the next video we're going to show
you how you can create your own
functions using a stylus as always this
