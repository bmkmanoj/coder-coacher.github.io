is basically I want to talk a little bit
about stub components at how I'm using
them on the level up tutorial site so
just a little insight into some of the
stuff I'm building here I've mentioned
on Twitter that I had built this and was
wondering if anyone would be interested
in there seemed to be a lot of people
who wanted to see how I'm using styled
components now two things I'm sick so if
you can hear it in my voice yeah that's
why I sound like this if you can't hear
it and that's cool I will not be sick
into the microphone I promise because
that's a huge pet peeve of mine but
number two this is not going to be a why
or why not to use style components I
don't want to get any sort of arguments
there there will be a time in a place
for the pros and cons of styled
components this is just a how I'm using
it right so what we want to do here is I
want to talk about how I I decided to
use style components and what I'm doing
with them and what I'm not doing with
them in this particular instance first
thing I should point out is that the
majority of the site as in 99% of the
CSS written in the site is not written
as styled components they are written as
standard stylus CSS and then converted
using the meteor built tool ISO pack so
that said the majority of the site is
not running on styled components but
this should highlight a nice thing about
styled components is that you can just
start using them in your project and
slowly convert things over as need be or
not depending on what your level of
interest in is it but if you want to get
started and try it out it's as simple as
just installing the package NPM install
styled - components yarn add style
components whatever you like to do but
basically let's take a look at why style
components work and why they're nice the
component in particular in question here
is the search bar you can see selected
we get that little underline and I can
start typing and it filters as I type
now the filter is a very very basic
filter since I only have a handful of
data points
it's it's just a standard JavaScript
filter I'll show you that in a second
now another thing we'll go over an
example of using style components with
this pro exclusive little badge here I'm
putting on so first thing I'm gonna do
is going to show you how I use styled
components to do this filtered series a
search bar and then I'm going to then
make styled components directly in this
pro exclusive so you can see a creation
of it in a simple example okay so let's
get started let's head to the filter
series and basically let's check it out
in playlists
I'm just importing this search bar now
the search bar is the component in
general right it contains a div that has
the input it contains the icon which is
the magnifying glass and it contains the
underline right which I'm doing is a an
absolutely position div that I'm just
increasing in width so because of that I
have just two properties on this thing
it's centrally just what happens on
change I unchanged it's just setting the
state of the search value and then I'm
using that state down here in a filter
now you might be thinking this is
unsustainable for a large amount of
queries and it probably is but I have
like I don't know 40 tutorial series so
using this kind of JavaScript filter on
that is no big deal I'm not hitting the
database at all everything's already
pulled in in addition I just I'm passing
in the value okay so let's head to the
search bar itself and you'll instantly
see some stub components stuff now keep
in mind this CSS may seem overly complex
for what it's doing it may not it's no
big deal I'll tell you about it in a
second but let's scroll down to actually
check out the actual component which is
a search bar now our search bar has a
few props it has a theme where I can use
it on a light or dark background by
default it's the light background it has
a placeholder so I can change the
placeholder on the input it just
basically sets it down here the value
comes in as a props the on change is a
function
okay I should actually have a theme
right here my prop types let's add that
theme prop types string okay cool
so as you can see here this component
takes four props no big deal and I
simply just have my icon component which
is accepting a name and a color so based
on the theme the icons either going to
be white on two percent white or 100
percent black you can see that here this
is the default light theme so the icon
is black but really this composition is
just we have a wrapper which is a div we
have an icon we have an input and then
we have another div that serves as the
underline notice how I am using a class
name still even though I'm using styled
components now this may or may not be a
good practice I haven't really decided
yet I'm still sort of experimenting with
styled components here so by no means
take this as the end all be all but you
can see how that's being used in action
now what we want here is basically I
want this whole thing to be contained
right I want to be able to drop it
anywhere and I want to have those Styles
go with it and I don't want to have to
have these Styles be affected anywhere
else
now obviously the class name here is
potentially an issue with that right
because yeah this still gets output with
a class of underline however it is
encapsulated here under this other class
this DSW iho
so you know it is encapsulated here so
we'll have to see the I guess that isn't
necessarily a major concern at this
point like I said it's still learning
but as we can see here we have a search
wrapper okay and you might be wondering
well where is the search wrapper
component and this is really the sort of
beauty for styled components for me
because you don't have to go through the
whole create a function to create a
wrapper component if we head up top here
we can see the syntax is really super
simple we're just defining a variable a
constant search wrapper is equal to and
then we get to use this style we get to
use this styled object here and
we get to use this div property which is
actually a function I believe now then
we're calling these back ticks and
everything inside of the back ticks is a
just standard CSS you'll notice instead
of camelcase CSS like you're used to in
react we have the standard CSS syntax
which again is something that I really
like about this so here's this is where
we're defining what search-wrapper is
we're saying search-wrapper is
essentially just a div and here are its
properties it has a margin of this it
has a display of Flex it has a border
bottom of this purple color and it has
position:relative now I can say any SVG
inside of search wrapper is going to
have a position:relative top of 4 and
we're going to have an input we're going
to say any input inside of search
wrapper is going to have a border:none
all this sort of stuff now check this
out this is the most interesting line
here of anything I'm pretty much saying
do we have access to the props right I
want to have access to the theme here
I'm saying
dollar sign brackets so we're using some
string interpolation then we have to use
an arrow function to have access to the
props at that point I have access to
props and I'm using props theme so I'm
using then a ternary operator to say if
the theme is dark then I want the color
to be white now typically my input
colors are all I think a dark purple and
that's what I would want them to be if
the theme is light so as you can see
here this color override is only
happening with this particular theme now
there is theming things within styled
components where you can set up various
themes right however this is just such a
basic example I'm just overriding one
one property it makes sense here that I
can use props just like this instead of
having to do anything additional but as
you can see we also get access to the
ampersand like we would in SAS which is
another great thing about styled
components here so we can say ampersand
focus which as you know from SAS or
stylists is basically if the input as in
the parent is now focused then we can
say outline:none
and then we can say if the parent is in
focus and it's next to an underline then
we want that underline to scale to one
because right now the underline is
scaled to zero by default the underline
is simply just a rectangle that is four
pixels tall hundred pixels wide and
being scaled down to nothing then when
you hover on to it it scales up and
animates on so as you can see here this
is just some basic CSS but this
encapsulates us and it sticks with it
now that's not to say you want to use
stub components everywhere although
there is a lot of great reasons to do so
this goes to show you that you can
really just encapsulate this sort of
stuff into one component I'm never
essentially outside of this this is the
only thing that's going to look like
this for me so this sort of is now
encompassed in that and likewise even
though I defined a class with this
underline we saw earlier that it is
underneath the parent right so all these
styles are still scoped underneath the
parent and if I use a dot underline
somewhere else it's not going to be
affected okay so now that we have that
knowledge right you can see the search
wrapper is a little bit more declarative
than a just a div we don't have to have
a class name on it it generates all that
for us super nice we don't have to worry
about going to a separate file
everything's nice in here and in all in
all it's not too cluttered so let's talk
about this next one we want to do which
is this pro glue Civ badge so I have
this probe and right here and I want to
give this some styles particularly could
pop over to Sigma this is what I have it
looking like right now I said I want to
make people give me a have a lot of
questions about what's included in pro
packages and what's not so I want to
make this look very obvious which series
are included in the pro package so I'm
going to have this little badge so you
can see I've created a component here in
figma this is what I wanted to look like
and let's go ahead and get started with
styling this component you can see I
already have the HTML for it in place
and now that you can sort of see what
we're building towards I'm good at close
figma because my CPU is already running
really hi I'm doing this on my laptop
which I don't typically do which is the
need of an upgrade so it's definitely
not super happy right now while I'm
recording but let's equate let's go
ahead back into our code here you'll see
the first thing we got to do is just
import style from styled components
which under Pro badge I've already done
okay next thing we want to do is we want
to declare a constant variable notice I
already have a div here right this is
why this becomes nice because instead of
having to do div class name assign of
the class name come to your CSS write a
class name we can just define everything
here in a way that makes more sense so
we say constant and we can say now I'll
say a badge okay because that's sort of
gonna define what this wrapper is
constant badge is equal to and then we
can say styled dot and it's going to be
a div and then we're going to have to
back ticks just like this okay and at
this point we don't really have to do a
whole lot but if you check our search
bar one you see we just started adding
style so for instance I could say color
and I want the color to be this purple
so I can grab this now you could have
this hex value be a variable somewhere
I'm going to be doing that eventually
this is only my second one though so I
haven't set a system yet and then next
thing we want is we want this teal color
which I'm using down here to actually be
the background now notice how this isn't
a JavaScript object there's no commas at
the end of the lines here that was
actually really tough for me because you
get used to writing styles and react
you're putting commas everywhere these
need semicolons because this is
essentially just one big string here
okay so let's say this and just like
that we can replace these divs with the
word badge okay because this is a
component even though it's essentially
just this bit of code we've just built a
component and now we can say the badge
has an icon and the word Pro exclusive
and now we'll also want to do maybe like
a font size and the font size will be or
not font size I want to do font weight
font weight 900
and we'll also have a border radius of
five now it depends on how you have
things set up but you can also get some
sweet Auto prefixing going on for you as
well so you don't have to worry about
that stuff either and let's head back to
our duct we can see like I said my CPU
is absolutely drilled right now because
of this screen recording okay and as you
can see things have worked out nicely
here without having to do very much we
now have this badge here it's not
perfect obviously because we're still
sort of figuring out what needs to be
done but if you inspect it you can see
it's been giving some classes to this
thing now what's cool about this is that
this is totally classes you'll never
have to worry about actually writing
it's full of nonsense and the best part
about that is is you won't ever have to
worry about overwriting accidental CSS
that sort of stuff
it definitely encapsulate everything
into this little badge here so for
instance we want to last thing we'll
probably want to have this be
position:absolute where it's gonna make
it in the top I don't know five pixels
from the top I wasn't expecting it to go
up when I said top five five pixels
that's because I guess I don't have a
position:relative on the playlist single
so I'll have a position:relative okay so
obviously this is looking a little bit
better I'm gonna clean this off screen
before it goes live obviously because
this doesn't look like what I have in my
mock as you can see here we're basically
just encompassing our Styles within this
thing and we don't have to worry about
those Styles leaking out and it's as
simple as this so if you say I don't
want to add another thing to make
styling more complicated well the only
thing here is that I want to put these
VARs here but man this these few lines
of code here aren't adding that much
weight and if you're looking at this you
know honestly a div with the class name
of badge or whatever is a lot less
easier to read than the word badge here
like I said I'm not trying to start any
style components verse not this is only
my second style component in this whole
site so I can't
necessarily speak on if it's like a
great great idea yet it seems pretty
cool them but I figured it'd be nice to
just sort of see how people are using it
right so search bar here it is it's a
little bit more complex example where
I'm nesting and referencing elements and
even classes within a search bar within
a single component and here this one is
is way more simple I have nothing going
on in here nothing extra and it works
really well cool so I'm gonna keep
working on this I'm gonna finish up the
extra Styles here add some padding
position it correctly add position
relative to the wrapper and you should
probably see this badge up on the site
later on if you are not a pro subscriber
so check it out this is styled
components this is just a quick vlog you
could say on how I'm doing them in my
site and if you have any thoughts or
ideas on maybe things that you didn't
like that I was doing or you things that
you liked and or whatever post a comment
below let me know what you're thinking I
want to hear your thoughts on styled
components and inside of react now this
is a fiery topic so if like I said if
you're gonna start arguing about it
please be respectful
I know people tend to get really fired
up about inline Styles verse you know
standard styles and whatever so as
always this is Scott with level up

the creation of these free videos head
to level up tutorials comm forward slash
store we're just level up tutorials
