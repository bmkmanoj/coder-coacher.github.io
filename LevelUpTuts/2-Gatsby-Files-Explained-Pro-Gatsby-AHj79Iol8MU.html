tutorials and in this video we're gonna
go through the files that were just
created we're gonna talk a little bit
about the Gatsby system overall and
we're gonna start to take a look at some
of what gets but gives you out of the
box let's get going on that right now
okay so to get started we are going to
load up this application in our text
editor the text editor that we will be
using for the series is going to be the
s code or Visual Studio code so I'm
going to find my level a blog in my
finder and I'm just going to drag it
into V s code and the theme that we are
using for V s code and just in case I
got a lot of questions it is going to be
level up official which is the level of
tutorials theme so let's talk a little
bit about what files are included in
Gatsby first and foremost let me bump up
the font size here temporarily and this
is just for these once we actually get
into the files I'm gonna zoom it back
down because I have a big font size
already you can see we have a dot cache
folder which is going to be well our
cache for every single time that this
site gets built we also have our node
modules folder which is going to be
where all of our packages live if you
haven't worked in a node site before
this is where any sort of library that
we use it gets stored these files do not
typically come with your site when
you're moving it into production they
usually get built into the site itself
you can see that we are using a lot of
different packages here and gets we
mostly handles all that behind the
scenes here for you which is excellent
next we have a public folder which we
see simply has a static folder and
indexed of HTML file and a render - page
J s now we won't need to worry about
these too much but I will be talking
about them a quite a bit as we go now
next we have our source folder which is
where the entire application of yours is
going to live for the most part right
these are the files that you're going to
be editing is the source folder so
because of that we're going to be
talking more about those as we go so I'm
gonna skip that folder now and come back
next we simply just have a git ignore
which is ignoring node modules cache
public D s store files as well as AR and
ignore it's gonna make it so these files
don't get committed to your repo next we
have gatsby browser which is
where you get to configure Gatsby's
browser API so I'm going to make the
font size smaller back to where we want
it for the rest of this series and you
can see here there's a link to talk a
little bit about the browser
api's next we have gatsby config which
actually has some information into it
that's actually relevant it has the site
metadata which is the title gatsby
default starter so the title of your
page should be gets be default starter
now next we also have a plugins property
with a value that's an array now the
only item in this ray is gatsby plugin
react helmet that's because we're
already using react helmet in the
default configuration of this site react
helmet is an awesome package brought to
you by the NFL of all people who have
basically HTML metadata that allows you
to set this metadata on a per component
basis now this is really great for
Gatsby because what it means is we can
set our metadata and a per component
basis and it's not going to be updated
dynamically it's going to be updated
statically every single time the site
gets built we'll be going over quite a
bit about that build process as we go as
well now next we have a Gatsby - no js'
now this file is going to be where you
can connect to the node api's stuff like
working with our data and our graph QL
library is going to be taking place
mostly here next we have gatsby SSR
which is going to allow us to well make
modifications to our application before
the server-side rendering has taken
place again we'll go over more about
this later now next we have our license
which is something that your lawyers
might want to see but you probably don't
need to dive too much into this we have
our package dot JSON as you can see our
version files our gatsby 1 9 - OH - as
well as gatsby link 1 637 if your
version numbers do not look like these
you know that and you're having problems
then maybe you'll want to make sure that
your version numbers look like this do
an NPM install after changing them
however chances are they'll be somewhere
around these and everything will work
just fine okay so this is it these are
the main files that gets be comes with
so let's dive into this source folder in
our source folder we have three folders
the components which is where all of
your individual components will live we
have the layouts which is going to be
like you might guess your layouts and we
have our pages now our pages our files
that actually equate to real pages on
your application and notice how there's
no routing code here involved simply by
putting something into pages is going to
make it into a page for instance if we
clicked on index J s we can see hi
people and if we change this to hello
people and then tap back over to our
browser you'll be able to see it already
updated saying hello people so what this
means here is that we were able to
successfully modify a page without even
knowing this pages URL now let me bump
down my browser here so you can actually
see the URL area and all this stuff here
and what I want to do is let's look at
our other page for instance we have page
- - which is this called just second
page right so there's no routing code
set up how do you get to this page well
the basic way you can get to this page
is simply by the file name which is
forward slash page - - okay
so you can see hi from the second page
welcome to the second page go back to
the home page so as you can see here
simply by having a new file with a
specific file name as such as page - -
that's going to create a new page with
the your URL forward slash that file
name if we were to make a new file named
hello jeaious and simply have it output
hello when we went to localhost port
8000 forward slash hello it would output
that page exactly and we also have our
basic of 404 that's going to pop up
anytime a page does not exist so I
mentioned that we have our pages right
you can see our pages are just simple
divs with simple HTML next we have our
layouts where you'll be able to
recognize some more code we do have our
helmet in here which we've talked a
little bit about we also have a header
component which is stored inside of
components header index and we have some
divs with some style and then the
children now right now anytime we make a
new page it's simply going to use
template wrapper and it's going to
output the pages content within children
so if we were to make modifications
to the header component right that would
make a modification to not only the
index page but also page two okay so the
system likes to do a lot of stuff for
you and that's great because well it
makes it so you don't have to spend a
ton of time at doing that stuff yourself
setting up routing blah blah blah cool
so as you can see here these are the
basic files that come with Gatsby your
components is where all your components
live your layouts is where your layouts
live and your pages is where your pages
live now eventually we're going to have
more than that while we create posts and
things of that nature but what we're
going to be doing in the next video is
simply just creating a new page linking
to that page from our header and having
just a nice little new page here that we
created fresh from ourselves not
something that gets be made for us and
as we go we're going to continue to
build out what looks more and more like
a blog every single video so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
you would like to learn more about the
most exciting static site generator on
the market check out level up tutorials
comm forward slash Pro becoming a pro to
watch all of these videos this entire
series soak up all of that knowledge as
well as all of the basic react series as
well as all of the upcoming and already
released graph QL series available on
level up tutorials thanks so much for
watching and I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
