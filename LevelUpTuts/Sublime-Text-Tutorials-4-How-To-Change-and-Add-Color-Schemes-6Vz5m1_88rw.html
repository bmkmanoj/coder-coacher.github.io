up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
a little bit more about sublime text
today we're going to go over color
schemes so when you load it up your
sublime text - maybe it doesn't look
just like this
that's because I have this color scheme
installed I actually forget the name I
think it's a mono Kai and I really like
it it the colors are really nice it sort
of sticks out I think in any sort of
language I'm writing in whether it's CSS
or whatever it's going to look good so
that's what I like in the color scheme
however everybody has different
preferences and that's why it's great
that sublime text 2 allows you to use
color schemes that were made for text
week so if you have text made installed
chances are you will have all of your
text make color schemes available to you
as well from the start so to find your
color schemes you just click on the
sublime text - in the menu here for
Windows I'm going to go ahead and say
I'm not quite sure exactly how you do
this on windows I've ever used sublime
text - for windows however you're going
to go to preferences and then you'll
just notice this color scheme option and
here's all of the different options that
I have by default many of these I might
have installed myself you know I just
can't remember at this point which ones
came with and which ones did not but
let's pick space-cadet I don't really
know what this one looks like so you can
see it's a little bit darker of a theme
and and some people might really really
enjoy this personally this one's not for
me so I would probably be moving on to
try another one but the great part is is
this really easy to just go through and
try one you can use it for a couple
hours and if you like it you do what if
you don't it's pretty obvious quickly if
you like it or not I like these dark
themes there's also lighter themes with
a light background I'm not exactly sure
which ones I have you know it looks like
this is one of them to me this is a
little too bright for my eyes but so we
have these ones that are built-in you
can change it what happens if you want
to get more well luckily the Internet is
provided with all sorts of opportunities
to get more in fact just by searching
sublime text to color schemes you'll
find horses all sorts of stuff or even
searching textmate color schemes you'll
find a ton
because people have made a bunch well
luckily they're really easy to install
so here I have a github page and that's
github slash da yl e ar e es slash color
schemes and here is a whole bunch of
color schemes and you'll notice check it
out there's some really good ones in
here either way there's all sorts of
different ones it's pretty nice it allow
for a bunch of different opportunities
here in fact one of these I'm using on
my theme at my office pretty much
constantly now and I really have been
getting used to it so how do you get
these into sublime text well it's nice
and easy luckily they have not made it
very difficult for you at all however
Apple has made it not super easy for you
to get to your library folder in later
versions of the OS X operating system as
you can see I see hidden folders and
files so my library folder which has
been hidden by default as of lion and
mountain lion I can get to it however
you might not be able to get to yours if
you go to your finder and your username
so to get there you can go to go go to
folders and you can type in til they
slash and then library go and it's going
to take you to the same spot in fact
let's close this window and have a new
window take me there just so you can see
it in action go to folder and tilde
slash library alright I'm in cool so
here we need to go to application
support and then you'll want to find
sublime text 2 and then packages so
you'll notice there's all these packages
in here all these folders there's some
themes well we don't have to do anything
other than put these themes inside of
this packages folder so let's go ahead
and download these from this github page
you can use it using command line or you
can just click this download zip button
and you'll be getting that downloaded
okay so I have all these color schemes I
have my packages time to put them in
kind of woman okay so I'm just going to
let these I'm going to throw these in
here there's a whole bunch of them
okay and now that these are in here
we're going to go to our sublime text
and now I'm going to check out
preferences color schemes and you could
see all of these different ones in here
and then there's color scheme default
these the ones that we added just now so
let's pick out what I like I think I
like the peacock from their preview turn
that on it looks great in fact here's
what a CSS looks like using this peacock
one looks like highlighting it's nice
and prominent here's HTML there's a JSON
file so yeah so I'd like to I think I
would like to keep this color scheme for
a little bit in fact I really like this
one okay so this is color schemes
changing them getting new ones in
sublime text - as always if you have any
questions please leave a comment the
video or hit us a bit to it our level up
