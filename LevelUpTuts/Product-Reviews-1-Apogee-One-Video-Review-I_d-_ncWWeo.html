Tut's and today i'm going to be giving
you a first video product review and i'm
going to do it on something that i have
been using almost daily since i
purchased and this is the effigy one and
what it is it's a great audio phone and
audio interface for OSX and it plugs in
just through USB and then it has a
built-in microphone directly on the unit
itself it features one large knob to
control your input volume or your output
volume you can plug headphones into the
bottom of it basically it's a really
nice audio interface and the sound
quality is excellent every single one of
these tutorials that I've been doing
almost since the very start has been
using the same microphone so and this is
just really the mic the built-in
microphone that's on the apogee one
right now my voice is being recorded by
that and it's sitting maybe about a foot
and a half away from me I was just
sitting on my desk in between my
monitors and it allows me to just
basically talk like these tutorials and
it sounds really good so I've been very
impressed with the apogee one in a
second I'm going to show you some video
of my apogee one and the audio will
still be recorded through the apogee
even though the video is not a screen
recording so let's actually get that
going right now so like I said here is
the apogee one it's sitting on my desk
this is pretty much where I leave it it
allows me to really just talk into it
like normal you saw I probably dipped
pretty far away from it there when I was
speaking and you can even see it
recording the levels as I go up but yeah
everything's controlled by this one knob
here it comes in this Apple sort of
looking packaging you know plain white
with a you know pretty minimal text
inside the box is really just the HEPA
g1 itself you have a XLR cable that also
plugs in to
now if you can see this end is this
plugs in directly to the HEPA g1 so that
a lousy day use like instruments and
everything if you need to do that I just
use it for voice personally although I i
plan on using it for instruments i just
have not a dove into that yet so so this
is the apogee one here it is and you can
see the unit's about it's like the size
of an old ipod maybe a little bit
thinner than that but it looks nice
sitting on the desk everything's a it
works great sounds excellent so it says
it's 249 on a HEPA geez website and
that's pretty much where you're going to
find it anywhere you can find it on
Amazon 249 but it says for new from 229
so it looks like you can get a little
bit of a deal there there's also like an
optional mic stand if you want to have
it on a stand if you're playing on
recording standing up or doing voice
overs or something like that also I'm
going to touch on the interface really
quick it comes with this epidemiol oft
where which works fine however uh as you
can see the levels pretty much all
frozen um I'm not exactly sure why it
hasn't always been like this to be
honest however i'm on us i'm on OS x
lion and this is currently sort of not
functioning very well however the sly I
mean every everything works everything
works fine as you can see my voice
probably dipped when I did that it just
may be the visual is like totally off so
uh besides other than this the only
other downside i would say to the apogee
one would be that it's only for back no
i did see some people were looking to
get it working on linux but i haven't
done any investigation into that apogee
certainly doesn't support it it's really
just OS x okay well that's the apogee
one if you have any questions about it
leave you no comment on the video and
i'll try to do the best i can to get
back to you as always this is scott with
level up tuts and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
