tuts thanks for coming back and checking
out another free web developer tutorial
before we start want to encourage
everyone to subscribe to us on YouTube
follow us on twitter at level up tots in
this tutorial I'm going to just take a
minute to show you to sort of related
field types one called date in one
called time these are super easy and it
won't take very long but they are very
important types that should have some
explanation alright so just like the
other tutorials in this series I want
you to bring up your page de Hamal file
and your field sets directory we are
going to create a new field for date so
just like the others got to make sure we
get it at the right level here and this
is going to be called a hum posted date
and the type date oops thanks all right
and we are giving it a display name of
posted date we are going to add some
instructions enter the date in which
this video was posted we're going to
make it required because we haven't done
that yet idol night quite true and let's
check it out so we're going to hit save
go back to our control panel I'll
refresh the page good nope posted date
so what happens when I click in here we
get this little no jquery calendar where
I can sort of breeze through the months
pretty easily and you notice that the
label is in red that's because I made it
required I could either change it to
false or just delete it that and oops
we go and if it's not present the
default for required is false so there
you go that is how you create a date
field and time again it's pretty similar
hosted time type is time and it's time
and the display will to say what's your
time and we won't give it anything else
we'll just call good there we go so it's
um you know you can type it anything you
want here it's going to automatically
put it up by 30 minutes but you know it
doesn't have to be a 15-minute intervals
but it doesn't have to be so there you
go that was your introduction to the
date and time field type thanks a lot
