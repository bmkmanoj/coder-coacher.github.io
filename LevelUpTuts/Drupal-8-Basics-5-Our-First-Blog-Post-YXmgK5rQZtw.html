up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be creating our very first blog
post now in the last video we created a
page now we're going to be creating an
article so this is gonna be a little bit
about what's the difference between page
and article and how they function within
Drupal so let's get going right now so
in the last video we created our about
Us page in this video we're gonna create
our first blog post or article as it's
called by default in Drupal so we're
gonna head over to the version of our
site that's logged in and from here we
can just click content or weaken it to
the home page itself and click add
content from here now from here we have
again the option for article or basic
page in the last video we did basic page
in this video we're gonna be doing an
article which we explained is more of
like serial content it's something that
you may be having multiple of it's going
to be more of a blog post than
necessarily a single individual page now
once again I'm just going to paste in
some lorem ipsum text so we don't have
to deal with it and we can say my first
post post spelled correctly okay
there we go we know of a title we have a
body and you'll notice we have some new
options like tags so we can just have
this be intro and we can leave a comma
and have another tag such as test and if
we wanted to we can actually throw an
image in here so let's click Choose file
and I'm just gonna pick this photo of
Shia LaBeouf here and now we have a
photo and you can have an alternate text
and the alternative text can just be
just do it cuz that's I think he's
yelling in this and again we have some
meta information on the right we can
create a new revision we can add this to
the menu if we like but since this is a
blog post I can't really imagine adding
this to the menu if you had a secondary
menu of like featured posts or something
of that you could always provide a menu
link and put it into a different menu
however we don't want to do that now
comment settings can be either open or
closed by default on an article comments
are open so we can leave comments on
posts and that
works just fine again URL path settings
we do not need to mess with right now
we're gonna be doing a little bit more
with URL aliases in another video
authoring information is correct it's
authored by the admin and promoting
options it's promoted to the front page
by default let's go ahead and click
publish okay and now that this is
published we see my first post here it's
inserted our image into the post and it
has our text wrapping around the image
you might be wondering why it's doing
that well that's just part of this
default theme if you wanted to edit this
type of layout that's going to be a
little bit more involved and potentially
using a different theme but as you can
see we have our title submitted by our
meta information our post our tags which
allow you to actually filter and we can
add a new comment with a WYSIWYG and
where you can save and preview that
comment now if we were to click on one
of these tags you would actually see a
listing of all of the posts including a
little bit of a teaser information here
so we have intro as the heading because
that's the tag and you can see we have
my first post where we could then either
read more or select it here and get to
the post in addition from the home page
if we click on the logo you'll see that
my first post now shows up here and then
the additional post that we promote to
the front page is going to show up here
as well so we've now created our first
blog post using an article in Drupal 8
as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you want to purchase the
rest of this series before they're
available on YouTube you can have to
store that level up tutorials calm or
become a level of pro to stream those
videos as always thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
