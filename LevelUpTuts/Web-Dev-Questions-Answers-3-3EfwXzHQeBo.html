tutorials and today I'm joined by Chris
de Mars a web developer from Detroit and
we're going to be doing a little bit of
QA so uh Chris you want to get started
yeah sure so what's it like doing
YouTube two tours full time compared to
a nine-to-five job yeah so um to be
honest it's it's hard to it's it's hard
to do YouTube 24-7 no matter what
there's not a lot of great one like ways
to like support yourself and your family
on youtube so being a web developer I'm
either taking on freelance projects all
the time or I'm working hard to develop
the level of tutorial sites a level of
tutorials store in a way that they bring
it in come so it's it would be awesome
to just make videos full time because
then there would be a lot more videos
but unfortunately it's really hard to
make that happen so I know people who do
YouTube full-time always have side
income and that's like sort of a thing
of these dresses when you're building
your YouTube channel you're building a
brand and your building all this stuff
and you have to think about where the
money is going to come in from cuz right
people might think it's ads but the ads
are like nothing really they had to
bring in very little so you can't really
rely on youtube or ads for your income
and you just have to use it as sort of
like this is going to help and serve the
community and then i have to do other
things that are going to bring in money
right yeah so like definitely need a
psych hustle you need a sinusoid yeah
okay yeah and and youtube was my side
hustle and maybe it still is kind of but
level up tutorials is now full time work
it's just different full time right yeah
and you're learning at the same time
like you got to keep learning you just
can't do youtube you know videos right I
mean you're gonna learn the technology
and then you're gonna make that tutorial
right you're still up in your skill
level regardless constantly yet oh yeah
because yeah I you can't teach anything
without knowing it so there's a lot of
spending time on
Jack's in still in code still cool cool
cool all right question number two at
what point can you assume that you've
crossed the junior front-end developer
border and become an intermediate front
end dev yeah so my understanding of that
border is more formal um because it's
less technical ability and more like
formal I became a senior developer when
the senior developer at my job left and
I got his job so I became a senior
developer it's on my resume I can then
advertise myself that as such right more
like I got a job being a senior
developer but there was nothing that
changed in my ability from becoming a
junior developer to a senior developer
an intermediate develop or anything like
that so it's like focusing on the titles
or whatever right like Junior junior
whatever good level yeah it's like focus
on your abilities getting better and
it's a good gradient and eventually
you'll be so good that whatever job
you're applying for is going to be that
that senior role or just start applying
for senior level role jobs because if
your technical ability is there even if
you don't have the experience as a
senior developer they're going to hire
you for that job obviously having there
was a big difference from when I had
senior developer on my LinkedIn profile
to how many job offers came in and stuff
like that and I've been part of it is
just it's like a made-up title right um
bugger yeah is that what you've noticed
her yeah cuz when I came in to my job
I'm my titles associate software
developer okay right but I'm only
building websites and then you have you
know software and web sites it is yes
the same thing right but I've been in
this industry on and off for 20 years
professional experience for eight and
I'm not gonna get hired in as anything
else but I'm you know jr. sherry um but
everything's I knew right I get all your
new hey you're new you know you don't
know it's like no I dunno yeah
no I've been doing this for us time yeah
I don't want to be you know I don't want
that associate being associated with me
but then I find that's the reason why
I'm not getting new gigs is because
company CEO your aniston associate ya
know maybe you should be a senior
mid-level when I would consider myself a
mid-level developed sure I mean I have
weaknesses just like everybody does but
where I have my weakness as I excel in
other things you know what I mean it's
just getting people to see that I guess
is like the struggle in that progression
from junior to mid-level it's a senior
you know what I mean yeah and for me I
guess a bit of it was just luck and
having an opportunity to move into that
senior role because it was a to
developer agency oh yeah you know so
that was just pure luck and and I think
maybe sometimes that's that's what is
the defining thing because honestly if
you have more than you know 10 years
experience or something in this industry
you should be in this this category but
it's like if you haven't gone through
into their it's you you're right it here
it's going to be harder for you to break
that barrier definitely yeah yeah so I
guess just keep on building billing your
abilities keep on building it and like I
don't know maybe you gotta like present
yourself as a senior developer a little
bit more that's scary man maybe you just
gotta say I'm a mid-level developer like
that's what I am that's when the
imposters and your sons are getting
empty imposter syndrome is is like a
whole nother thing right it's a whole
nother thing that is a huge thing right
yeah it's scary for sure yes especially
when they want you to know everything
you know except the kitchen sink I know
right angular to react redux lmm boots
like yeah I can't I can't do all that I
know exactly you're talking about crazy
all right question number three when we
speak of responsive web design or web
sites that adjust themselves a very
screen sizes what technology is the code
that is responsible for adjusting use is
it simple HTML tags that you the job or
is it JavaScript magic or is it done
using CSS please explain and thank you
yeah so responsive websites are all done
through
media queries which is a property and
CSS that essentially says if the device
port is this with then use this bit of
code so you're able to then through CSS
the HTML isn't changing positions right
you're not having a div pop on top of
another one or something like that so
the HTML is staying the same JavaScript
can't change but largely it's just CSS
saying hey at this point you get this
property and you get this property and
now all of a sudden this is on the left
and this is on the right instead of on
top of each other right so using
something called media queries and in
media queries can do more than just look
for width they can look for your device
like if it's a device or a laptop or
whatever it can look for portrait
landscape sorry Lucy the dog is
grumbling over there Michael Grabner
yeah so uh I mean it can be done through
JavaScript and there are some JavaScript
libraries that will allow you to respond
to browser viewport width via JavaScript
for the most part responsive web design
is more about layout and more about
design so usability UX order stuff so
most of most to all of it it's going to
be done with CSS and the added benefit
is if you're using something like a CSS
preprocessor i use stylus but there's a
lot of like great packages for CSS
preprocessors that make writing media
queries really super easy like the one I
use for stylus you just write plus above
and then either a variable or a number
and then you can throw that in anywhere
you want in the middle of code like in
the middle of a property or wrapping a
property or whatever and it's just
really super easy so media queries is
where it's at read the book responsive
web design by a list apart it's like it
literally the book on responsive web
design DeMarco yeah that's a that's the
book that like coined the term it's it's
the book to read responsive web design
list apart Ethan Burke how do you say
look at Marco yeah she's 24 responsive
was cool yeah he's like The Godfather he
is yeah i know i have such a hard time
pronouncing people's last names but yeah
definitely I've heard it pronounced mark
oh mark hottie yeah ah yeah it's one as
well but I'm so on the topic of
responsive um as far as like frameworks
go like foundation and bootstrap or you
know um what's not a toast yeah toast or
skeleton skeleton which one do you think
I mean what if you had to choose out of
known which one do you like better the
benefits and features of you know yeah I
like the one that um that gets in the
way the least I haven't even seen the
bootstrap um since I think it's in like
version 4 or 5 or something Ivan's 44 I
haven't seen in a little while I like my
my
my grid frameworks and my stuff to be
all in CSS so what I don't like is
having classes are like grid for
whatever but to adjust for media queries
and I so I like to do everything in CSS
but that's just me so whichever one
gives me the better tools with my CSS
preprocessor right now none of them
really supports stylist that long they
do sass I know booster up to sass and
stuff like that so with the newest
version live yeah poured it over the
sass yeah so I mean that's cool I like
SAS a lot um we actually used when we're
developing forward we used bootstrap and
for the most part you would never know
that so uh you know but yeah I like
foundation allowed to i use foundation
for email and constantly the foundation
email and HTML email template is like
that's sweet responsive emails yeah
sweet well god we got that one other way
question for what do you think about
laravel yeah so laravel is a PHP
application framework and it's sort of
done in sort of a way more modern way
than others in the past have it's sort
of more reminiscent of something like a
like a node-based ecosystem or something
and for the most part thing i like most
about laravel isn't the code or how it
works or anything goes I'm not I've done
PHP development through there seeing
mrs. and stuff I haven't done a lot of
laravel development other than just like
experimenting with it but the thing I
like most about layer Bell is the
community behind it and that's like uh
that's something that is really
undervalued I think in this industry is
the community behind a framework or a
tool or something like that really
really makes it everything better for
instance rails rails had the explosion
it did not only because you could
accomplish what you could accomplish
with it but the community was so
inclusive and so like a learn rails it's
oscillating but they were so evangelist
about it and I I remember when I first
learned SAS it was a bit before my
co-workers had and I was doing that I
was like you guys gotta learn SAS go to
like you got it like i wanted i want for
communities i want developer communities
to be inclusive like that i want them to
be like you can do all this cool stuff
and i see that from laravel yeah so like
with a like Jeffrey way has lera castes
and stuff like that so and then those
are really great and he sort of like you
know the Godfather video tutorials for
the web in some regard you know I mean
he's been doing it for a long time so so
that community there is is great it's
great to learn from and for the most
part I really appreciate their
documentation their design all the stuff
that makes me like it the only thing is
I just don't have it I haven't done much
work in PHP so I haven't even touched it
that much other than that I know there's
a october i believe as a CMS written and
laravel it's supposed to be really nice
i checked out their side documentation
looks really good but overall i really
like my role despite never using it for
anything big you know cool yeah also
cool so looks like that's all of the
questions for today do you have anything
else you want to say um shout out to all
the developers or software developers
back at home and Detroit hey hollow um
