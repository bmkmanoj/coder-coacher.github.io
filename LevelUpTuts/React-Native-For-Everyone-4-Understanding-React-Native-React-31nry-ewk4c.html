running I want to talk to you a little
bit about what's going on here so what
we have by default is going to be a
little bit different than if you
followed the official react native
getting started instead of using create
react native app now let's talk a little
about why that is basically with create
react native app we're using something
called Expo which you can see right here
and expose sort of sits between react
native and your code and what it does is
it basically makes it so you don't have
to have all of the project files here
now typically if you were to start a
react native project through react
natives own getting started you would
have both the entire Android project
files as well as the entire iOS project
files now the good thing about having
those is that you could pop open those
iOS files at any given point and start
to go to work if you code and swift or
Java or now Kotlin for Android you could
just pop those open and start working in
those native environments now that's not
entirely possible right now however
there is a command with expo to get us
those folders if we need them so really
what it's doing is it's one and saving
our hard drive a bunch of space because
we don't have to have all those files
but it's also saving us a whole bunch of
headache from having to deal with a
whole bunch of extra stuff and it sort
of sits in between there now I've built
react native apps with and without expo
and the reason why I'm doing Expo for
this series is simply because it's much
easier and there's much less to get in
the way so as you can see here this is
what this Expo is doing now why is react
native different from something like
Cordova or PhoneGap or one of these
solutions well most of those solutions
interact natively with your phone but
are essentially just a webview or a web
browser and the app is still essentially
just HTML and JavaScript and that's not
necessarily the case with react native
when we use something like a view or a
text when this compiles is actually
getting trans
related into real native code so you
aren't running a web app in a shell
you're running a native app which is why
react native is so exciting okay so
that's a little bit of foundational
knowledge about react native now let's
get a little bit of foundational
knowledge about react what we have here
with this project is we don't have any
configuration we have to do we didn't
have to set up you'll notice this babble
IRC we didn't have to set up Watchmen we
didn't have to set up any of the stuff
that compiles our files react native
takes care of all of that so what's good
here is that we get to use a straight-up
JavaScript so when you see something
like import react from react
this is es6 JavaScript and it's really
really nice and we have import
stylesheet text view from react native
and this is how most of your files are
going to look they're going to start off
with some import statements and most
likely importing first and foremost
react and then most likely maybe a view
I think views probably the most used
component you could consider it like a
div and then we also have text which you
could consider like a paragraph tag or a
heading tag or really any sort of text
tag it doesn't denote any sort of
semantics it's just this is text right
and lastly we have style sheet where
we're using a method called create and
style sheet created accepts basically an
object here and that could be considered
a class right even though this isn't CSS
it's you could consider this something
like a class right this container word
sort of defines what this view is and
we're using it with style equals styles
dot container so that of course is going
into this constant variable which is an
object it's grabbing this container and
then it's setting the following property
such as background color line items
justified content and this flex let's
fire this application up in an iOS
situation I'm going to use iOS because
I'm programming on a Mac right now and
it's going to just fire
a little bit quicker the Android
emulators can be a little slow although
they have certainly gotten better so we
can do just like we did before npm run
iOS hit enter and this is going to
normally start our packager which
compiles our code but it's also going to
fire up our simulator and get us started
once more now if you do not have a
working simulator head back to the video
where i show you how to set up the
simulator and the iOS process I think we
just install Xcode and that's pretty
much it okay and you notice we're
getting an error there's a problem
loading try again and we click try again
it's going to crash you'll notice here
that we had a fail to start simulator
exit with a nonzero code 60 you know
what stuff like this happens this is the
nature of this this is really complex
stuff that's going on and sometimes
these things don't always work 100% but
our simulator is already up and running
so now you'll see that this time when I
restarted it works no problem now that's
not to say you have to have the
simulator up and running to get this
going first and foremost it should work
at some times you know it just doesn't
right something went before something
else things weren't talking to each
other but that's just how it goes
you'll notice here we have this finished
building and we're getting our hello
world so let's talk about our code here
I'm going to give some react basics
essentially what we have as we discussed
in the last couple of videos we have a
class which extends react component and
we have a render function and we're
returning something out of that render
function and what we're returning sort
of looks like HTML now what's cool about
react and the sort of the entire way you
think in react is sort of this you can
create components that occur you can
consider as like LEGO pieces that you
can reuse and combine to create
different things right and each one of
these has sort of a parent-child
relationship just sort of like the Dom
structure on the web or anything like
that you drill down and it goes from the
parent component to child component
unless you would pass data from parent
to
filed by use of something called props
so what we want to do right now is we
want to create another component and
just simply have it export this hello
world text now that's not useful at all
and we're going to end up deleting it
but it's going to be showing you
basically how we get going so right now
since this is a small app I'm going to
create a new file at the root of our
project okay I'm going to make sure I've
clicked off of everything here so
nothing selected click the plus new file
click the plus new file and let's name
this hello dot J s and just like Appius
the first thing we're going to want to
do is import react from and then it's
going to be from react notice how it's
not from react native we're importing
the actual framework react now next
we're going to import some things from
react native we're going to import and
this time I'm using curly brackets if
you're not familiar with this syntax
what the curly brackets do is a sort of
non default imports so we have to import
them individually within brackets so we
want to import a view which we explained
it was like a div we want to import a
text and that's it notice how I finish
this off with a comma and we're going to
say from and now these come in from
react native okay so you could have
copied and pasted that almost directly
from the one above but it's nice to
learn how to write it and here we can
say export default
notice how I'm exporting a default and
now we need to say what we're exporting
we're exporting a class a class with the
name of hello not all caps just
capitalizing the first letter and then
we can say it extends react dot
component now notice how component is
capitalized and we're going to wrap this
off with some curly brackets and we now
have our class now in a class like this
you'll have a bunch
methods including some lifecycle methods
and things like that that happened
before but the most important one if you
want to display something is the render
function which we will have to
parenthesis and then a bracket and then
we need to return we'll have some
parentheses and inside of this view I'm
going to have a text okay and this text
is just going to be hello from hello J s
and we can close this text component
okay so just like that
this component does nothing but it's our
first component and so we have this
component here and we can head back to
App where we're going to want to import
it notice how we exported it from hello
we're going to want to import it from
App so we're going to say import hello
from and then we can actually just give
this a instead of quotes we're going to
say dot forward slash because that's
where it's located within the current
directory hello and we can then wrap
this off with a semicolon now it's
always nice after you do something like
this right I imported a bunch of code to
head over to your I term and see if
everything's headed all right you'll
notice I'm not getting any weird errors
here now because of that we can actually
use the Hello component now components
work a lot like HTML tags so just like
this text which I'm deleting I'm gonna
say hello and notice I'm closing it off
with a backslash and then a greater than
cared so if we were to have children
within hello you'd be using it more like
this view tag but instead we're using it
more like a line break tag or something
in HTML where it auto closes so now what
we should see in our app is hello from
hello dot J s now this is really super
nice because we can reuse this anywhere
we want we can just spam this a whole
bunch and now hello from Hello Jess has
been output four times so can just show
you that essentially when you're working
and react you're creating these
components that you'll reuse over and
over again and maybe sometimes you'll
just use them once but it's still nice
to have things separated as their own
component it keeps your code organized
it'll be easier to debug and you'll have
less headaches overall ok so these are
some react in react native basics if you
already know react that I'm sure a lot
of this was just easy stuff that you've
done a hundred times before but if
you've never loaned react this stuff can
be very weird at first right it sort of
looks like HTML sort of doesn't but the
cool thing is is that it's easy to pick
up and it doesn't take very long before
you get it right before it's just like I
understand why why this is so well liked
so here we have our component hello and
fjs now in the next few videos going to
be talking a little bit more about react
native specific stuff we're going to be
dialing into some of the react native
built-in components we're going to be
talking a whole lot about designing and
styling your apps and at the end of it
we have a real live working application
that'll be both native for iOS and
Android so as always this is Scott with
