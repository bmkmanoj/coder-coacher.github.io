of HUD's and today we're going to teach
you
your Android applications with
now you could have your Android app for
a you know a small price if it's worth
the cost or you can have a free version
or you could have with advertising or
you could have both you know maybe a
version that you know pays to get rid of
the ads or something like that
and so you don't want your advertising
to be obnoxious in fact I think the the
least of noxious way to do it is just
the simple banner ad at the bottom of
the application I mean you don't want to
get into notification messages or
fullscreen pop-up messages like some
apps have because that's really
obnoxious for your users so we're going
to be using something called AdMob which
is a service that Google provides to
incorporate advertising so it's sort of
like Adsense which is advertising for
websites but it's for mobile apps and
you can use AdMob on Android or Windows
or Android or iOS or whatever any of the
mobile operating systems so if you go to
google.com slash ads slash AdMob you can
go ahead and sign them with your Google
account and create an account because
you're going to need an account on this
website before you can add these ads to
your your application and now there's
several different ways you can add these
ads we're going to be taking an easy way
out and that easy way out is just adding
it in the XML now you can declare an ad
and added via your activity in Java and
we're going to do that eventually but
right now we've been working a lot on
XML and we haven't been working in town
in Java so let's do this in XML because
it's a lot easier to just wrap your
brain around okay so the first thing you
have to do is you have to download the
SDK from Google's developer site and so
this website here is
developers.google.com
and it's slash mobile ads SDK I'll have
this link in the video comments if you
click downloads here you can go in and
download the appropriate SDK we're using
this Google ad
job right here so for Android this very
first one we downloaded this I
uncompressed the zip file and then I put
it in my D uh you know my folder where I
keep all of my android applications and
we're going to incorporate this SDK into
our app okay so the first thing we need
to do is come to eclipse and we're going
to want to right click onto our project
folder here go all the way down to
properties and from here we're going to
select Java build path and now we're
going to need to add a library so click
the libraries and we're going to add
external jars so let's add an external
jar and let's find where I save this
stuff it's right here and here's the
Google AdMob SDK this is version six
point four point one right here and
we're just going to click open now so we
see our Google AdMob right here let's go
to order and export we're going to want
to make sure that this is checked and
great so we have AdMob checked in our
order and export and we're all good so
now we have the SDK included in our
project which means we can start to use
it so the next thing we need to do is
add a little bit of code to our manifest
file this androidmanifest.xml so let's
open this file up here and we want to
add this activity after the closing of
our other activity in here so it's
nothing crazy here but let's paste this
in here and I'll show you where you can
get this snippet if you want it so let's
take a look at this I'm going to make
this a little bit wider here quote so
this is an activity with the name of com
Google Ads
dot add activity and then we have a
property here this Android config
changes and basically it's just passing
some config so you can get this
a snippet of code directly from the
developer site if you go to getting
started right here after you're on here
click the Android tab scroll down here
and we have this activity line right
here you can copy and paste that in here
perfect we also need to add this little
bit right here for permissions right and
so this goes in as you can see directly
after the application so right when the
application is closed we can paste these
permissions in here right here just like
that and this is basically just saying
our app is going to require the Internet
it's going to require you to use the
internet because it has to pull the ads
from somewhere so when somebody's
downloading your app they're going to
see in the app store that the
permissions require you to access the
Internet and the network state ok let's
save that so great we shouldn't be
seeing any errors and everything should
be good so what's the next step
alright well the next step is to enable
the actual banner ad and to get the
banner ad like I said there's a couple
of different ways you could do it you
could do it with just an ad view in the
Java code or how we're going to do it is
going to just be directly in our XML
because we've been working in XML so as
always we've been going to res and then
layout and then activity main.xml and
here's where the layouts of our app has
been this whole time we have our button
we have our guest number we want to
throw this ad directly under this press
of button
so let's come to the actual XML of this
and let's scroll down here leave all
this relative layout cool cool cool and
I know we have all this relative layout
stuff before where we're telling this
button that it's going to be below but
I'm actually going to move it there
physically because I like my XML
structure to reflect really what I'm
seeing and generally so ok you're not
going to see any difference there but
now we're going to add some XML code
we're going to add a bracket and from
here we can type kombu GLE dot adds that
add view and we can give it some
properties so let's give it an android
ID and this can just equal at plus ID
forward slash and we can just call this
i mean its are going to be our only ad
so we can just call this ad view and
then in the next line here we want it to
with we wanted to fill parents so I'm
just going to straight up copy and paste
this there we go
and we want the height to wrap content
so I'm going to grab this Android layout
wrap content there we go and we need to
add a couple of add specific things now
so they're going to be ads and then ad
unit ID equals and then we're gonna have
to put a unit ID in here so at this
point we need to go to AdMob to get this
unit ID so we're going to stop this
video here while you let your add an
AdMob account get set up and once your
AdMob count is all set up and you're
ready to go
we'll continue we're going to get this
ad ID going and we're going to get your
ad running so as always this is Scott

questions or comments please leave a
