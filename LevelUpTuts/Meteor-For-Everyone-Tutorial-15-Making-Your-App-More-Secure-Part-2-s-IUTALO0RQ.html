up tutorials and today we're going to
pick up where we left off
so in the last video we added back our
methods so that we could once again add
new resolutions now in this video we're
going to take it the next step and be
able to have our methods for updating
and deleting resolutions so that way our
app can be fully functional and once
again let's get started right now so now
let's write the rest of our methods to
make sure every move and our update are
going to be working as well so what I
can simply do is just come down here and
we're gonna have a comma and we're gonna
add another method this method is going
to be what happens when you click delete
so we're going to just copy this
resolutions that remove here and so we
can say delete resolution and again
we're going to have a function here and
this time we're gonna pass it the ID so
I'm gonna paste this in here okay and
see how this says this ID well we're not
actually referencing this anymore so
what we can just do is say ID and then
up here we're going to have ID also
passed into the delete resolutions now
when we use our meteor Collin delete
resolution we're going to pass in this
dot ID so let's change this resolutions
that remove and we can say meteor duck
call and inside of here quotes delete
resolutions of comma and we're passing
it this ID so now when we click delete
it's going to call this function delete
resolution and it's going to work so
we're in here and let's pull the council
up here so we can see if something goes
wrong but we can click delete and it's
gone no errors okay that's good update
however still gonna give us X is tonight
so let's go ahead and it pretty much
duplicate what we've been
doing and let's grab this resolution
step up date and one more we're gonna
just throw it in here and we're gonna
say update a solution it's also going to
be a function and it's also going to get
an ID okay inside of here
we're gonna paste in this update
resolutions code and once again we're
gonna change this ID to just ID now this
is going to be interesting because what
we had was the we want to check to be
equal to the inverse of this checked so
what we want to do is actually do that
bit of logic where we're saying reverse
this dot checked we want to do that
outside of the update resolutions and we
just want to pass it in the value which
is essentially just going to be checked
right so this dot checked is now
becoming checked like that when we call
this update resolutions method we need
to pass in the value that is the
opposite of this dot checked
so let's come back up here and let's
remove our resolutions that update and
we can simply say meteor call again
inside of quotes it's going to be update
resolution and we're gonna be passing in
this ID and then after another comma
will pass in exclamation point this dot
checked let's get rid of these two
brackets just like so so now we're
calling update resolutions we're sending
this ID and we're sending the opposite
of what this checked is it's coming down
here it's going to hit this function
it's going to find the resolution with
the ID we're passing it and set the
value to what it should be
so let's come into our application here
and now we have our read ten bucks we
can click this check box and it looks
like it's persisting and working okay
we're not getting any errors okay so
we've now removed in secure and we're
now basically having control over our
our method calls to add and remove
things from our database update them
what
from here we can actually check to see
if a users logged in if the user is a
specific username and prevent access
from potentially adding or removing
information that shouldn't be done
cool now it's secure has been removed in
our applications just a little bit more
secure in the next video we're gonna be
talking about what happens when you
remove Auto publish so keep watching and
let's get going on that as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials I think
of any questions or comments you could
comment the video rate is up at Twitter
or Facebook ad level up tutorials we'd
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
