accomplishing a whole lot other than
getting us started and getting us set up
now getting everything set up is really
essential for this to go smoothly so
some of the first things first we're
going to make sure we have the latest
recommended version of node J s
installed so if you have node installed
already make sure your version is
somewhere around this six point ten
point three I know that a incorrect a
node version is the cause of some issues
in the setup process so we're going to
go ahead and click install for Mac OS X
if you're on Windows you'll want to get
started the same way okay so after this
downloads we're going to want to keep
this we're going to want to click on
this package and install it now I
already have a node installed on my
computer here but I feel like just
running it through this installation
process is going to make sure that we
have the latest version that we need
okay so just like that node is installed
we can move the Installer to the trash
okay so after you've installed node what
were to be doing here is in this
particular series in this video we're
going to be getting Brack need to set up
with the least possible friction here
right you could follow a lot of
different guides and there's guides that
want you install like homebrew and stuff
like that you can do it that way if
you'd like we're going to be using
create react native app which will
hopefully help streamline some of the
getting started bit and in fact in later
videos we're going to go over maybe a
little bit more a depth version of
installing all of this stuff but as you
can see here after we've installed node
you're going to fire up your terminal
I'm using I term the reason my terminal
looks like this is because I'm using
something called fish shell if you're
using bash or zsh it should all be the
exact same now with node installed we
should be able to type in NPM and we
should be able to have stuff right so we
should be able to see that NPM was
installed so if we want to install this
create react native app we want to do
NPM install - G and then create - react
-
- app just like that it's going to go
ahead and grab a bunch of stuff for us
now the next thing we want to do is
maybe browse to our site's directory so
I have a site's directory set up as just
incites and then a folder level up
tutorials yours can be wherever you sort
of keep your projects so I've changed
directory into my projects directory and
I want to run a command which is going
to be create react native app and the
minim of our application which is create
- react - native - app and then the name
of our application which is just going
to be tip calc ok hit enter
yes okay and what seemed like a long
long time of installing things I can
assure you we now have essentially our
project here where we can CD to change
directory into TIFF calc these NPM
commands is Yarn commands and you can
run yarn start like it's saying here or
you can do so with NPM since we're not
talking about yarn in this video
necessarily we're going to be using NPM
for my examples but I should note in
personal work I'm typically using yarn I
just didn't want an extra step here
right so we have tip calc going and if
we were to do NPM start what this is
going to do is this is going to bundle
up our package now in addition I want to
open up this directory in our text
editor tip calc I'm going to be using
what is Visual Studio code here we can
drop this on Visual Studio code and
let's fire this up here so as you can
see we should have all of these folders
we have an expo vs code node modules
babel RC that sort of stuff we have an
app dot JSON fjs app dot test what we
don't have is we don't have a simulator
up and running but we can do is actually
access our application through this QR
code and the expo app so if you have an
iOS or Android device you can
stall the expo app then you can scan the
zoom out here you can scan this QR code
or your own personal QR code that is and
it will let you load up the application
just like that or we could simply just
enter this address it's also saying your
phone will need to be on the same local
area network now let's talk a bit about
what create react native app did it
essentially started a new project for us
it did all the same sort of stuff that
starting a new project the standard
method of installing react native would
do installing creating a new project
however it's using this technology
called Expo and Expo essentially allows
us to get up and running without all of
the SDKs and stuff like that installed
on our computer so if you have an iOS or
Android device you could just simply
download the expo app and you could get
going with this QR code instead of
having to download all these SDKs and
stuff like that which could just add way
more way more way more pain to the
startup process so this is the fastest
possible way to get started with react
native now not to say that the other way
is incorrect or anything I just wanted
to go over the fastest way in fact in
later videos I'll show you the more
in-depth way but now that we have this
set up what I'm going to do in the next
couple of videos to show you how to get
your environment set up so that we don't
necessarily have to use a real device to
test the Sun we can use simulators and
emulators and that sort of stuff
so I'm going to show you getting setup
with iOS and then we're going to get an
app this hello world app fired up on iOS
and then we're going to do the same
thing for Android that way you can use a
simulator emulator real device whatever
as long as we can go forward actually
building our application then from there
we're going to actually go through sort
of what's up with react native what is
it we're going to dive into some of the
default code we're going to go over some
of these basic examples and then we're
going to start building out our tip
calculator and you're going to see
exactly why rec native is such an
awesome platform to develop on for
native applications so just like that we
have an app up and running you can grab
the app check it out in your
phone and it's going to feel like magic
but we did it and most of the time was
actually just sitting around waiting for
stuff to download so in the next video
we're going to get started and setup
with our iOS environment in react native</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
