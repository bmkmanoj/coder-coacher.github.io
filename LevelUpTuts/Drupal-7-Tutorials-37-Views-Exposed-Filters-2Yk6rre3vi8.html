up tuts and today I'm going to show you
how to use exposed filters in views and
expose filters pretty much allow you a
front-end way to change the filter on
the fly
so we've gone over filters and I have
this view here that's all the projects
so this view is filtering out by
projects and by published so it's only
showing content that's published and
that our projects well we wanted to be
able we want people to be able to select
what type of project it is based on the
taxonomy that we created before if you
recall in the previous tutorial we
created what kind of project it was
whether it was development design or
whatever so we can now expose that
filter from the users and let them
filter themselves so if they want to
only show what you know what they want
to see so let's click Edit this view
let's go into our view here so in the
normal place where we go to our filters
and our filter criteria is the same
place we go to add exposed filters and
keep in mind you can expose any filter
so we're going to add a filter right now
and it's going to be what the project
type is so let's look for our content a
project type where is that a project
type right here and peers in project
we'll just add this to our displays okay
and we want this to be a drop-down so
you could also have this be an
autocomplete but I mean if your users
don't know what they're going to be
typing in here you're probably going to
want to use a drop-down so we'll click
apply and continue so here's a normal
filter and if you'll notice at the very
top here it says expose this filter to
visitors if we click that checkbox it's
going to bring in some more options
which is great because we want some more
options so this operator we're going to
keep this at is one of and we want the
users to be able to select certain
amount of these so we're going to click
and if you see it highlights so to click
others if you guys just click here I'll
go away you need to actually hold option
so I want our main categories so I have
animation tutorials design or
and and I'll probably have some more
categories I've made some Android apps I
want to put up here too but for now it's
just these four and so uh it's choosing
if we want to expose the operator this
is the operator is one of us all of know
we don't want to expose that we just
want them to simply be able to check
which project type they want to look at
allow multiple selections not for this
one we're just going to leave this as a
simple drop down remember the last
selection no I don't think so limit list
to selected items so if you don't check
this it's going to still have all of
these but if we check this the ones that
we selected here are going to be showing
up okay
and display our message I guess that's
if the filter is not correct so this
reduced duplicates it gives little
explanation here this filter can cause
items that have more than one of the
selected options appears duplicate
results yeah I guess it's fine to check
that I'm probably not going to have
duplicate results because each of these
are sort of mutually exclusive except
for maybe design and development and in
that case I guess we'll just check it
and under more here administrative title
filter identifier it's not something we
have to change so if I click add to
apply to all displays you'll see that
this filter pops up right here and here
it is okay and one more thing we have to
do before we're done here we just have
to click on advanced right here and then
we have to go to use Ajax and we're
going to want to select yes we need to
use Ajax for this so we'll click apply
we'll click Save and let's try this out
let's just check a development and then
click apply and here are the site sided
development for that I've put in here so
far tutorials I'll click apply and then
we have the two things I've done so far
full tutorials that I've placed in here
so these are how you do expose filters
if we want to change this to say
something else we can actually do that
right in there let's just click on
project type exposed and then under
label we can have this just be we can
have to say categories because that's
what I wanted to say apply to all
displays save now our label is cur
recked categories select pie perfect
okay
well that's how you do an expose filter
in views in Drupal 7 if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
below or hit up a Twitter level up tuts
once again this is Scott with level up
tubs and thanks for watching
