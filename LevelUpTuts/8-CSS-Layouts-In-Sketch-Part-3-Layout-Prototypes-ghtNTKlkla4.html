tutorials and today we're going to
continue where we left off using the
sketch flex layout plugin for sketch
three and we're going to show you how
you can use your prototypes as layout
indicators for your design that way you
can design things once and then reuse
these patterns and we can see how you
can apply different layouts and patterns
to different visual styles so check it
out let's get started right now last
video we did make our style sheet right
here we had this text that we were using
to define this layout now in this video
i'm going to go ahead and just simply
delete that now you can have the style
sheet as well as this prototype styles
however I want to illustrate to you what
exactly is going on with these
prototypes tiles so here we have the
iphone layout where we have this
artboard here now i'm going to make a
new artboard and this artboard is going
to define the styles for part of this
document okay so what we do is just by
creating an hour borden it can be of
really any size we can go ahead and name
that whatever you would like that lets
you know exactly what the prototype is
what your prototyping see because what
you can do is you can put all of your
styles all of your layout styles for
each of these rows and inside of the row
in the container itself in one prototype
or you can split them up into multiple
so we're actually going to do a little
bit of both we're going to start by
having one or just the container we're
going to have it contain all of the
container styles that we had so let's go
ahead and name this artboard container
nowaday mming a container doesn't really
do anything but now what we're going to
want to do is create a new group with
inside of container and inside of that
we're going to have a rectangle that's
going to determine some properties of
this so let's go ahead and first let's
just make a rectangle I'm not going to
name anything I'm just going to make it
a square and I'm going to do command G
on this to make it into
now i'm going to name this now this is
important it's going to be named
prototype like so and then now is going
to be the class that the prototype is
going to be attached to since we wanted
to be the container we're going to say
period container okay so now anything
within this folder is going to be
modifying the container itself now if we
were to have another group inside of
here with dot Rho these rows because
they're nested within the container
would get picked up without having to do
prototype dot row but we're going to do
that separately so you can see so we
have this rectangle here I'm going to go
ahead and just go to these borders just
so we just have a square here and now
what you can do with these rectangles is
we can rename this now if we rename this
we can use the at sign first and then we
use the name of the property that we
want this rectangle to signify so let's
say we wanted this to be the margins if
remember we made this container before
we made it have a margin of 15 pixels
all the way around so we can just say at
margin like so now for this rectangle
we're going to go ahead and define the
width and height of it as 15 by 15 it's
over here I can give it 15 by 15 and we
have this cube here now you can define
your own way of doing this perhaps your
own styles of things let's say if you
were going to mock up this rectangle as
truly being margins maybe you would want
to have it be some sort of like
transparent red or something so let's
change the fill and let's make this into
a red and then just make it transparent
like so because what we can do there is
that we can actually
some content in here like we can put
another rectangle in here and maybe if
we wanted to see this in action we could
leave this rectangle in here and had
just simply having this rectangle in
this prototype itself doesn't really do
anything because it's it's not being
given an ad sign and then a property so
the way this works is that it's going to
see dot container and it's going to come
up here to this prototype container and
look around for something that has an ad
sign it sees this ad margin it sees the
dimensions are 15 by 15 and it knows to
apply a 15 by 15 margin all the way
around this so now if we were to do ctrl
command l like we had done before you'll
see a lot of things happen you know this
this square pretty much anything that
was supposed to have dimensions no
longer has dimensions anymore because
those dimensions were all defined by our
CSS since it was just a background
rectangle it was needing that CSS to
define truly the width and height of
everything so you'd go through these and
see a lot of things that have a width
and height of zero but one thing that we
do have is that this container has a
margin of 15 pixels so in that aspect
things were working correctly let's do a
command Z here and let's and now let's
move on to prototyping entro what I'm
going to go ahead and do is make another
artboard entirely so we can just do a
and now let's do another artboard I'm
going to just make it a little bit
bigger we're going to name it bro
now keep things easy to remember here
I'm moving it below and let's go ahead
and make a new rectangle in row again
I'm just doing this to do command G on
it and now this time we can type
prototype and then space period bro so
now this is letting us know that we have
another prototype and this time it's
looking at the layers with the row class
now instead of here if you remember we
wanted these to be a certain width we
wanted the road to be 345 pixels wide so
we can take this rectangle right here we
can turn off the borders and we can make
it 345 pixels wide let's make this
entire artboard 400 pixels wide just so
we have some room here and let's move
this over okay so we have this rectangle
it's 345 pixels wide and we could simply
say at with and now upon doing a control
command l we would see that the rows are
infected in that with and if we wanted
this to pass in the actual entire sighs
let's say we wanted these rows to be
only 22 pixels high you could actually
say at size and it's going to take the
size of this rectangle and use that
apply it to the row we're not going to
do that we're just going to simply say
with it yeah with like so and then we
can make another rectangle I'm actually
going to copy this red one here and
since it's 15 by 15 already we can go
ahead and put this underneath it and
maybe say that this let's move this into
the correct folder
go to that folder so inside a prototype
doubt row we have at margin but we want
this to be just a margin bottom so we
can do margin bottom just like we had
camelcase before so now it's going to
use this as the margin bottom and so we
have the width and we have the margin
bottom now what else do we need here now
we can actually add in some style
properties as well to the text layer so
we had the Flex properties before we had
flex direction and we have flex
direction as equal to Rho so you notice
this text layer has to be inside of its
prototype folder and then we can rename
this at styles with an s so we have
styles which is going to look at our
Styles where we have camel case colon
property and then you can wrap it up
with a semicolon too and then we have
margin bottom which is just grabbing
that 15 pixels and we have a width for
each row now we want to give the items
in our prototype here we want to give
them some size so let's go ahead and do
that I'm going to take this red square
i'm going to move it out of the way i'm
going to make this a little bit bigger
now i'm going to start with the circle
here and if you remember the circle was
40 by 40 let's go ahead and just make an
oval you can make it by whatever
dimensions you like right now command G
to make it into a group throw it into
this folder let's rename it as it is in
this prototype so we had it was it's
actually open up one of these folders so
we can make this this name was dot photo
so we could just have this folder simply
named photo like so and now it's going
to know when it encounters this photo to
look into this folder and then check out
the properties in here so we can go
ahead and make a size 1 so this is going
to be sized we're going to select this
and have it be 40 by 40
and I'm just going to make it stand out
a little bit you can of course make
these size things you can make them
match perfectly your object so let's
actually do that
okay so we now have the photo is
grabbing the total size from this and we
can also add in another rectangle here
inside of this photo and we can name
this at margin right and margin right is
going to be equal to just 10 pixels so
let's make this width of 10 pixels so as
you can see here it's a little abstract
it's not as straightforward as just
simply typing these things out but
you'll get the idea when we do control
command L you'll now see it starting to
take shape it's using this information
to know what it should do here so while
we did this abstractly first now let's
actually make it look like our end
result so we have our row here the roast
the correct size but it's not really the
right height in the end these are
probably gonna be around 60 pixels so
even though this is only measuring the
width itself let's go ahead and make
this 60 pixels tall
you
now if you remember the row also had a
padding of 10 pixels all around so
inside of here let's make another
rectangle and let's make it 10 by 10 10
by 10 because this is going to be using
the height and the width and let's go
ahead and make this something like
yellow so we can determine that this is
in fact padding you can pick whatever
colors you'd like and we're going to
rename this is at heading okay and we'll
put that inside of prototype row okay so
you can see how this is going if we
wanted to add more we would have the
name would be a folder with and head
Styles flex to like we had before and
the arrow would have the properties it
had before as well and you can tell when
we do control command L that things are
well on their way obviously we need the
margin here and we need the triangle but
its defining these styles from this
little bit of a prototype we made here
as you can see it is defining the styles
from the prototype you have here what's
cool is that if we were to group this
entire prototype row in another folder
here so we now have prototype row if we
were to have this remove the word
prototype here and we were to use the
word container here knows what we've
already defined the prototype for
container right here it's actually going
to grab the styles that we defined up
here so let's click out of there let's
do command ctrl L and you'll notice that
this container is instantly giving the
Styles you can see it's 15 15 15 away
since this artboard is a little bit
bigger it's not totally the same we can
fix that by making this the same size as
375 width here so let's go ahead and do
that 375 okay we can even make the
background color the same and that
should help give this the same sort of
feel too now when we hit ctrl command L
things just sort of shuffle and how they
that way we can move let's say the
padding where we want it and know we're
getting this containers prototype styles
within the row and you can keep
cascading down with as many granular
prototypes as you like or you can do it
all within one prototype itself simply
just by nesting everything under
something like this prototype container
it's like I said this prototype stuff
isn't nearly as straightforward but it's
really super power focused allows you to
build stuff maybe once and then tweak it
in a design sense you could just totally
tweak this as you see it and then hit
one command and have it applied to your
design throughout your entire rows and
columns whatever you have cool so this
is a sketch flex prototyping I should
also know that when you're duplicating
was adding the word copy you can
actually remove that by coming to
preferences and then we can come two
layers and then rename duplicate layers
if we uncheck that it's not going to add
the word copy that way we can do
something like I'm here to row we can
make a whole bunch of new rows command
then do command ctrl L and you can see
it just adds them without having to
rename them all so that was super
efficient and we now have a prototype
set up as always this is gobble level up

to hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
