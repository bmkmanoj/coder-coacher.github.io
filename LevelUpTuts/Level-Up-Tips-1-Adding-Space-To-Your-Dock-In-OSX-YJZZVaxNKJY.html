heads and today i'm going to show you
one of my favorite workflow secrets and
it's not a huge deal but it makes my
life a little bit better and I for those
of you using OS X it's a nice it's a
nice thing to have so if you'll notice
we have our doc here and our doc has a
bunch of absent well one of my favorite
things to do is add space between some
of the icons in the stock and it's
really easy to do that in fact it's just
one command in terminal that you could
run over and over and over again to add
as many spaces as you'd like after
adding a space you can just drag and
move them around like it was a nap and
then you can group your apps into like
clusters of apps that you would use in
relation to another so that what I have
all my browsers together easily findable
my text editors you know game stuff for
music stuff that way nothing gets in the
way of anything else so the command is
going to be in the comments here or in
the description but i'm going to show
you just typing in its defaults and then
right calm dot make sure i'm spilling
everything right that doc and then space
persistent and then hyphen apps hyphen
array hyphen ad space now single quote
then within brackets tile data equals
and then brackets semicolon space tile
hyphen type equals and then in quotes we
have a spacer hyphen tile now it's
really just easiest to copy this but
it's always nice to ride it out sort of
you know maybe get a little bit of idea
what's going on and then we can have
single quotes and then we can hit enter
now you'll notice nothing really
happened it didn't give us any outputs
or anything like that and if we scroll
down here
still don't how many spaces well I want
a couple of spaces so I may run this
command a few times right so to do that
I'm going to hit the up key on my
keyboard and that's going to have the
last command Iran and I'm just going to
run it five times just like that now I'm
going to restart the dock so to restart
the duck you can type kill all it all
one word space and then uppercase D doc
just like that enter so the doc goes
away and when it comes back here just by
hovering over we see we have a bunch of
space now you can actually click in the
space and move it in between your abs
here that way you have things broken up
into like apps right so I have maybe at
Exeter I have see I don't even have
enough here let me run this a couple
more times I like to have everything
super separated okay I have a couple
more spaces and that's pretty much it so
as always this is scott with level up
tons if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video this
is just a one-off sort of quick tip or
something that I like to do I'm going to
be doing a few of these things i'll show
you a little bit about I term which is
my favorite terminal lab I'm just going
to talk about little things here and
there my workflow that makes makes my
life a little bit easier so as always if
you have any questions or things you
want to see let me know thanks for
watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
