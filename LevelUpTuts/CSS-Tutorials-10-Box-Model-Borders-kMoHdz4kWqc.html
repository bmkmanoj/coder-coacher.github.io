of Tut's and today we're gonna keep the
box model tutorials rolling with the
next thing okay the first we did
heighten with last time we did margin
and this time we're gonna be doing
border so as we mentioned the very first
tutorial it goes the box model goes
margin border padding and then your
content so this border if that we're
going to put on this white box here
where would you expected to end up as
you can see the margin is pushing this
here the border is going to go right up
to this white edge and then once we do
padding that padding is going to go from
that border in and you'll see that more
in action once we get into some padding
and sort of a little bit of why we would
use padding and all that stuff that this
lesson is about border okay so let's go
back to our code and the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to increase
this width and I have this just be he is
smooth 70 percent for the width so let's
go back to our chrome it was refresh
okay now we need to add a border to this
so with the CSS border as in with a lot
of these there's a few different things
that come along with the word border and
that you can write them up individually
or you could write them out all together
but of course you're always gonna want
to write it together if you can so you
can do border width sorry border width
and then you can do border style sorry
it's not liking that I didn't finish
this off okay and then you can also do
border color okay so this color let's
set this to be something really obvious
we'll have this just be yellow and this
is one of the worst colors in CSS okay
so let's say border yet but our color
yellow border style there's several
different border styles and you'll see
them all over the place or at least a
couple of them you will probably see at
least dashed and solid you might see
dotted less much less frequently and
double less frequently and then there's
groove ridge insert outset I would look
these up
but really the only ones I would you
know say that you see on a normal basis
is solid and dashed are pretty common so
we're gonna say solid because that's the
one you use most often I'd say and then
with we're gonna have this be at five
not fifty it will have this be at five
pixel border and now if we come back to
our page we should have some bright
colors okay see now we have this border
and if another thing you noticed was
that this whole white box
well white box with the yellow border is
now a little bit bigger that's because
the border is actually included in the
width and should be immediately apparent
if we changed I'm sorry if we changed
this width from 70 pixels to let's say
four hundred pixels are seventy percent
to four hundred pixels now when we hover
over this you can see that the box
including the border is four hundred and
ten pixels wide and four hundred and ten
pixels tall so this border actually
extends past what the width is so just
something to just notice if you are
laying out something and you you know
you want things to be but you wanted
this whole thing with the border to be
exactly 400 pixels you would have to set
this to be let's see three hundred and
ninety pixels and what that's going to
do is the the box itself will be three
hundred ninety pixels wide but then the
left border will be five pixels the
right border spread pixels evens out to
four hundred even okay so let's try
something else I'm gonna come back here
I'm gonna set this up to be like ten and
I'm gonna set this to be dashed let's
make this something less hideous and I'm
just gonna have this just be a three
three three and refresh and now we have
a dashed like dark gray border around
our object so now that we've written
these individually I'm gonna show you
how you would write them most often and
that's all together you can say border
and then colon and then we're going to
do the width first so we'll do one pixel
we're gonna switch it up a little bit
and then we're gonna do dashed and then
we're going to do the color so the order
here is gonna be with style color we'll
save this refresh we have our - border
all the way around our box and just to
make it a little bit more obvious we'll
make this ten pixels and they'll be nice
and huge there we go nice big border
around the whole box now what if you
just only wanted this border top or
bottom left right well you could
actually say that in your CSS you could
change this to be we want the border top
refresh now just the top again
border bottom save this refresh now just
the bottom okay so this is CSS borders
let's actually get rid of this and make
it be solid just to finish out here for
no reason in particular
okay so now you have a border great in
the next lesson we're gonna go over
padding and the how padding can complete
this box model here and you'll be you
know how full control over these divs
okay so as always you know leave a
