of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to take control of sublime text to
visual appearance in a greater way so
you may have noticed that my sublime
text 2 might look a little different in
fact I have these like tab colors that
are different this is black back here
instead of gray if we do a find and
replace it's going to look a little bit
different than yours it's because I have
a theme installed that's called soda
dark
there's also soda light that's the same
thing just a light version but themes
can really change the way your page or
your sublime text to interface looks and
it could you know be something that you
want to personalize to have however fits
your mood of coding personally I like
the black tabs because I usually have a
dark background so it just goes together
really well so what I want to do is I
want to add a new theme and it's what
I've been using at my office the past
couple of weeks and I've really liked it
so let's get into how we can add a new
theme so what I want to do is I want to
do command shift P to open a package
control and we do package install
package and now here I'm going to look
for I'm just going to have a theme any
of us there's a lot of themes here you
know I would recommend checking out
these pages to see exactly what they'll
look like because it looks like there's
a whole bunch of different ones there's
even a quick theme switcher for sublime
text or a theme color scheme generator
some different color schemes you have a
whole bunch of stuff in here and in fact
if you're looking you'll have soda I
don't actually have it in mind because I
have it installed already so I'm going
to install Nexus is the one I like in
sort of our Android flavored a little
bit it looks pretty good so I'm going to
click it and once this is finished
installing you'll see Nexus is
successfully installed and then we're
going to want to enable that theme so we
want to enable this uh if it's the first
time you install a theme you could
probably just go to that package but
since I already have one installed I'm
going to show you a way to do it
through user settings so we're going to
go to settings
user and you'll notice I have color
scheme in here and preview on click is
true I want to add a theme and my theme
is going to be Nexus so if you're
reformed we wanted to change preferences
we went into settings default to look at
whatever things were in the JSON file
first I've searched for theme it's going
to tell me what theme I'm using actually
I just realized I am using the default
sublime text theme so you can see this
sublime text default I'm going to copy
this and I'm going to paste this into my
user preferences just like we did before
I'm going to paste it right here because
there Eddy has like comma that way I
don't have to worry about that and we
can just delete this word default and
write Nexus in here I'm going to save it
and before I can even get done saving it
you can see it's updated so now I have
these tabs up top here that look sort of
like the Android UI this folders totally
look different and it's been customized
in personally I like this one that when
I make a change to a file say make a
change you can see that underline turns
orange until you say that you say that
it's blue again it to me this is a
better visual cue that something needs
to be saved or hasn't been saved yet
okay so this is how you want to switch
your theme using sublime text too
alternatively if we wanted to use soda
again we could also come back to our
user settings and we could type in where
I had themed Nexus sublime you can type
in soda and then space dark save that
and you can see it sort of looks funky
it's sort of wacky it's because sublime
text - usually will update everything
once you close and reopen it so if
you're getting this sort of weird book
close and reopen it and it will get it
looking nice but personally I'm going to
leave Nexus up because I like the way it
looks and I'll have to restart my
sublime text before everything's totally
back to normal but I got a theme
installed it looks great as always if
you have any questions please leave a
comment in the video a hit us up on
Twitter our level up test let us know
what you're thinking
once again this is Scott with the lobe
tots and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
