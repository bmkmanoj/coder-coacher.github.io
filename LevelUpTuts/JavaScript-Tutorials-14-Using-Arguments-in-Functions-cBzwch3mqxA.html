up Hut's and today we're going to add on
to our first function and we're going to
learn what an argument is and how do
accept an argument into a function so
sometimes you want to be able to have a
function take values and modify them or
I'll put them or do something with them
in fact more often than not your
functions are going to have arguments
and let's do a very most basic example
of an argument so I'm gonna get rid of
everything we had there in our first
function I'm gonna get rid of this
council log as well and I'm going to
have our name Scott right here right and
notice how right now we're just council
logging yoyo now if we refresh here it's
just console logging yoyo our first
argument example what we're gonna do is
we're gonna accept a parameter to this
function and we're simply going to
Council log it now to define an argument
all you have to do is declare it within
these parentheses here we can say arg
I'm just giving this a name of course
you're gonna want your arguments names
to be something that is worthwhile so
for right now we're just as an example
this is your argument now when we count
to log into the council login yo-yo
we're getting the council log arg just
like that and so by having this argument
here it's basically turning it into a
variable that's used in your function
now when we run this it's gonna say
undefined so why is it saying undefined
here well we're saying run first
function and it's council walking arc
but Arg doesn't exist
so we want to pass Arg into this friend
first function and if we can put a
string in here and it's just as yo now
if i refresh this it's gonna say yo now
if we have this first function again and
I want to pass this the name variable
that we defined up here it's now gonna
say yo Scott cool so I you'll notice
that we can pass it anything here and
it's gonna console.log it and
we can keep doing this we can even give
this a number because why not
so three here we go now this function is
pretty much just console logging
whatever we throw in here what happens
we want to have two arguments what if we
want to have a greeting and a name so
let's check this out we can actually say
greeting comma name now the greeting is
going to be the first argument names
going to be the second argument and we
can say greeting now if we do a plus
space and then inside of quotes a space
just like this and then plus name what
this is going to output is gonna help
with the greeting and then a space a
blank space and then name so let's pass
in first function we're gonna pass in yo
comma and then name which of course is
Scott now it's going to say on one line
yo Scott and of course if we change its
name to Bill up top here yo bill or if
we change this to a string Scott again
yo Scott so we're throwing these
arguments into this function and it's
using them here so this is how you use
arguments in a function notice how by
using these arguments it's not affecting
this name variable it's not doing
anything but simply passing these values
into the function and then doing
something with them now this could be
important let's say we have a nama one +
num - and we want to have these just
adding and let's say we can say num 1
plus num2 and now it's going to council
log the addition of these two numbers so
let's go ahead and give it two numbers
so
and two we're going to now see a council
log of five so what's happening here is
it's getting number one is three it's
getting number two is two and it's
council locking them together now what's
another way we can achieve this exact
same thing well you could have this
council log outside of your function and
then it will make your function even
more usable because right now this is
this function is just council logging it
we want this function to simply just
return the addition of two variables so
like I just actually said in English we
wanted to return the addition we use the
keyword return and you'll notice that's
highlighted there so we're returning
num1 plus num2 now if we've run this
function
nothing gets output because we didn't
tell anything the council log even
though it's running this function and
it's returning these two numbers added
together return doesn't really do
anything other than spit something out
here but here we're not telling us to do
anything so of course it's not council
logging so what we can do is say council
that log and rap this first function in
a council log so now it's going to run
this and it's gonna say log the first
function of three and two it's refresh
and of course it's outputting five and
you can obviously see the strength in
this if we do something like three and
eight now it's 11 now of course there
you know our functions and things to do
stuff like this but this should give you
a good example of how to use a return
and what you can do with it now this is
just a very small example and we're
gonna be going over quite a bit more but
this is a basic introduction of
functions so you should have a good idea
about how to use functions how to return
and how to use arguments so please go
ahead and
play with code try a whole bunch of
stuff try to break things then fix it
solvent do whatever you can so as always
this is Scout with level up tons if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment in the video or hit us up at
Twitter at level up tuts let us know
what you're thinking we love to hear
from you thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
