up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be showing you how we you can add
the autoprefixer processor to your post
to CSS so that way you could get started
forgetting that a prefix even ever
existed so let's get going on that right
now so in this video we're finally going
to get to see exactly why post CSS is
pretty amazing so we're gonna do that by
showing you autoprefixer which is a
package I've been using on every single
project I've been starting for the past
year or so I mean it's it's been a long
time for me to think when was the last
time I used a mixin for a css3 property
and needed prefixes or even it just had
to write a prefix myself so it's it's
been amazing to be able to use
autoprefixer so let's come in here and
really what we need to do is add
autoprefixer - core to our project and
we can do that simply by saying npm
install - - save - dev and then
autoprefixer - core ok so now we should
have autoprefixer corner project let's
go ahead and add it to our gulp file
here we can do so just simply by having
autoprefixer is equal to and then
requiring autoprefixer - core just like
you're probably used to doing by now now
the easy thing would be to simply just
add autoprefixer to this array of our
processors we can do so simply just by
saying comma autoprefixer so now let's
run the gulp watch colon styles to run
the watch command that we have and let's
go ahead and add some css3 properties
for instance we can use something like
flexbox so we can say display Flex save
this now if we head to our CSS you'll
see that we get display and then WebKit
box display WebKit - flex m/s flex box
and display flex so as you can see it's
pre fixing our flex box for the various
WebKit and Microsoft
prefixes there now with some of these
packages you can actually throw in
additional options and things like that
for instance if you had to the
autoprefixer - core you can see that
there are options you can pass in so for
browsers you can pass in specific
browsers or a string like last two
versions here so we can say let's come
to our gulp file and we would pass this
in here via an object in a function so
we can have parenthesis then we have
curly brackets now the option is
browsers so we could say browsers : and
then last two versions as a string here
and now this string has to be inside of
an array like so that way we could pass
it multiple options and as you can see
we have autoprefixer looking for only
the last two versions of most of the
recent browsers let's go ahead and
actually take off the CSS ring so we are
going to see our CSS in an uncompressed
manner going to cancel this watch come
in and then rerun it with our new gulp
file now let's head to our Styles we can
save this and as you can see things
didn't change a ton but we just don't we
no longer have that WebKit - box which
was an older syntax for a WebKit flex
box implementation so as you can see
this this prefixed code isn't cluttering
up our CSS it's not being filled with
things like mix-ins we can just type
things like border radius and we can say
50% come back here and you can see
because border radius is not prefixed in
the latest two last two versions of all
major browsers it's not getting any sort
of prefixing going on but if we were to
have something like transform translate
egg x and then give this maybe like just
10 pixels or
something we could come to our styles
and you can see that it is getting the
WebKit transform here so it's really
awesome because we can just type CSS
like this and pretend that these
prefixes don't even exist
now as far as other options go you can
come here to the Auto prefix or cor
github page and as you can see some of
the options are things like should
autoprefixer add prefixes so even though
that is the point of sort of this
example autoprefixer can also remove
outdated prefixes from your CSS so let's
say you had a CSS file that was old that
had a bunch of old prefixes things like
border-radius and it's taking up
additional extra space that you no
longer need in that CSS file you could
be setting remove to true and add to
false and it's going to go through and
remove those prefixes that don't fit
your browser settings so we now have
autoprefixer set up in our gulp file and
as you can see it's already saving us a
bunch of space in our CSS we're not
defining any mix-ins we're not having to
do anything special it's taking care of
all of the prefixes for us and that's
amazing so as always this is scour level
up tutorials if you have any questions
or comments gonna come in the video area
to self at Twitter or Facebook at level
up to Torres we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and I'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
