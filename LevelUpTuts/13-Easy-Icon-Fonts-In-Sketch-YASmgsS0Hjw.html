up tutorials and then this video I'm
gonna be showing you a really cool
plugin for sketch that allows you to
just simply import an icon font quickly
and easily from within sketches own
interface without having to go to any
other website - you know maybe copy and
paste some code into your artboard or
something like that so it's a really
fast way to get font awesome the
material icons or ion icons into your
project so let's get going on that right
now so to get started just like any of
these plugins we're gonna head to our
sketch tool box and we're gonna look up
we can look for icon font I think is the
best way to search for this and you'll
find a sketch icon font now sketch icon
font is really super cool if you've ever
tried to work with icon fonts in any
design application whether it's
Photoshop Illustrator or sketch or just
pretty much anything you know it can
sometimes be a tremendous pain in the
ass and sketch icon font is here to make
that pain a little bit less so let's go
ahead and click install so before we get
going on this one thing is to know we
want to click this view on github
because what you need to do is actually
come down here and make sure you have
all of these fonts installed so we can
grab font awesome
OTF here we can grab the ion-ion icons
and we could grab the material icons all
there font files and we can simply just
install them if you're on OSX just via
the normal font installer install all of
these just so we have them awesome so
now let's go into sketch and let's check
this out okay so I'm just gonna select
this blank web design template zoom in
so you know that if you've ever tried to
use I con fonts you would have to
download the fun install the font then
find some way to copy the entity from I
like something like font awesomes
website paste it in here and then select
the font it's just not the most visual
and you have to leave the application to
do it we want an icon I can just simply
come into plugins and
an icon font icon fonts here it's like -
font awesome and select add an icon with
grid now there's several different ways
where you can scroll through a drop-down
you can add with the grid you can find
it by a name so let's go ahead and just
click Add via grid and you can see we
have this grid here so from here let's
select the music note and you'll notice
you'll be able to select just a
particular icon once we have this icon
in here let's go ahead and just click
add change icon okay so you'll notice
this is drop this sort of in the welcome
artboard I want this in my desktop our
port so I can simply just drag it to my
desktop artboard then I can manually say
hey show up at 0 and 0 I don't know why
just short sort of shows up in random
places on my install but we can come
here and now you can see we have the
icon here and let's bump this up in font
size but as you can see it's bringing in
as a font layer so we have all of the
size and color properties that you're
used to with normal fonts so as for
these other options in the plugin we can
look up a particular icons name with
this music icon selected we can say
what's his icons name and it's going to
say music and they'll give us the the
icon the actual HTML for it and let's go
ahead and exit out that the search by
icon you can actually search you have to
know the name of the icon for it to work
and the by drop-down is also just a
drop-down let's go ahead and add a
material icon via combo box so let's
come in here and we can select a new
icon here I'm just gonna grab this
downloading one add and change icon and
again it's sort of dropping it in the
the welcome and I'm just going to go
ahead and change the size on this and
maybe make this show up in a good
location instead of negative there we go
and you can now see we have dropped this
icon in here no time so even though it's
sort of throwing it off and who knows
where it's really easy
just sort of grab and throw in the
correct location if you want and you
never have to leave sketch unless of
course you wanting to look up of
specific icons name but the grid mode or
the drop-down combo box are good ways to
find the icons that you're looking for
so like I said this is going to make
working with the icon phones
particularly the material icons font
awesome and the ion icons that it's
gonna make working with this much much
easier so as always this is Scott with
