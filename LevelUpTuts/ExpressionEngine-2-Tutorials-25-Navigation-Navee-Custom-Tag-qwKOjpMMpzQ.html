up Tut's today we're going to pick up
where we left off last time we're gonna
cover the expression engine Navi module
and in this video we are going to use
the custom tag so yeah buoyant is the
name of the developer company and you go
ahead and follow them on Twitter at
buoyant or at point alright so we're
going to log into our site here and
create a new nav
so I've already logged in let's go to
the template manager and I'm gonna go
into the snippet I got put my mine
Oh No all right so I'll just take this
out you know what I'll leave it in and
then we'll say like custom nav and then
we'll go in and actually create this cuz
man so this is gonna be pretty similar
to the last one but this is using a
different tag pair
include your template I'm gonna go ahead
and just copy it after the other nav one
just just an example custom new create
an edit and right so oops
alright so in the last in the last
tutorial we used the single tag and in
this one we are going to use the pair
instead so I'm going to leave that up
there for just a second but the tag
looks like this expression engine nav ee
costume and then we're gonna pass it a
couple parameters or attributes title
again we're gonna we want to pull them
this the same nav so it's main now we
can give it an ID and all that type of
stuff if we want but in this case we're
not going to do that I'm gonna talk
about one of the other attributes here
called wrap I think it's yeah wrap type
and so what you can do with wrap type by
default it's going to wrap it as an
unordered list but you could do an
ordered list you could do yeah one order
list or or unordered list but we're
another parameter that you can pass it
as none and that's what we're gonna do
and you could pass it like deft's and
stuff like that so i'm gonna do that
again we say max depth so I'm gonna say
this is like just for my homepage whip
smack step equals one
and then I'm going to be this is
actually like I said previously this is
a tag pair unlike the other one which is
just a single tag so you have to close
it now in between the tags this is
something that's what it's repeated for
each list item that it finds and because
I told it to not have a rap these are
just going to sort of be hanging out
there loose I'm going to show you why I
want to do that in a second so we're
gonna say class and then we're gonna use
this tag to actually output the class
that you are defining in sites inside of
the nav under well normally I would put
it up here I guess I didn't do that but
that's under the modules Navi so class
we need to output the link which is just
link think for sure I guess we'll find
out in a second Nicole close that and
then text and that outputs the text as
defined in Navi and so let's go ahead
and just get rid of this other one here
all right so okay let's just do that and
see where we're at and then I'm gonna
explain it a little bit more so fresh
yeah so it out put it on but I didn't
didn't quite link them so we'll have to
see
Oh href yeah okay it did just they don't
they don't there's something weird going
on oh you know what I didn't I didn't
create a link that's why I was silly so
what was I doing so I really want to do
this page right there we go and now
let's refresh this there we go
so now we have some links let me go
ahead and view source just we're not
looking at dad down low so we're seeing
a lie with the class of nothing's I
didn't actually assign in a class or
anything like that but if I did it would
show up so right we're just saying three
allies sort of hanging out so why why Oh
am I getting this well well what I've
done several occasions what I've came
across is I want to add like a different
ally that's not a part of Navi so say
for example you have your main nav and
if maybe it runs horizontally and like
the last item is actually like a search
box or something like that so I'll just
show you like how I would do that so I
would also do this to you I would wrap
the whole thing in a nav you know the
html5 semantic markup and then we could
wrap this whole thing in a UL to
um I guess I can add some tabs to make
this a little bit easier to read let's
close our UI so the way that I would do
this is something like no form action
equals ever try to just do this really
quick okay
input type days you know text input type
equals yeah all right and so oops this
is from so this is right I'm gonna be
ugly as this hell but it's okay
so there you go so now we have again let
me open this up in my source so now we
have a nav let's do this I mean try to
do this side by side this side by side
view that I'm about to do is using this
little program called cinch check it out
alright so now nav ul he well I could
add an ID or class so we can style this
to heart's content
and then right here are the three links
that are part of our NAB that were
outputting using the na'vi custom and
then here's our new ally right that's
outside of that custom tag pair and
we're closing that with the UL we're
closing that li manually or closing the
UL closing the nav manually and we're
getting this so I mean maybe maybe
you'll come across this maybe you have
some other plans for this or you know
maybe there's a time when you're gonna
need to inject a list item that's really
not part of your of your main systems
nav as defined though add-ons modules
we'll get out of that view
so right so all I'm doing is I'm just
adding a nav item that doesn't belong to
this list so yeah there you go that's
that's one use of the expression engine
na'vi custom tag you know I'm sure
you'll think of some more so have fun
doing that in the next tutorial we're
going to cover how to use Navi to output
your breadcrumbs alright thanks a lot
