Tut's and today i'm going to show you
how to show hidden files in OSX and
we're going to be doing this with
Mavericks here basically we want to see
hidden files and you'll learn that
hidden files on your system for OSX are
any file that has a period in front of
it now this becomes useful because some
folders and some files are meant for
normal users not to be editing them
however we want to edit these files the
easiest way to do it is to have them
available to you in finder or of course
you could open them up and by using
terminal or something but oh we want to
make invisible files available to see so
I'm going to go to terminal and in
terminal I'm just going to type a
command and I'm gonna leave this in the
description and it's going to be
defaults write com dot Apple dot and
then space let's make this a little bit
bigger so you can see it and let's say
all one word this time Apple show all
files yes I'm gonna hit enter okay and
now that should be done let's go in
ahead and open up my drive and now
you'll see that there's all these light
gray files in fact if we go to by user
directory you can see we have all the
stuff that we didn't have before
including like our bash history folder
or file and we have our our user library
folder is now once again available if
you recall an older versions of OS X it
used to be available and then they made
it hidden you know I personally like
having this uh oh you know available to
have access to get into here but that's
a don't go deleting you need that stuff
ok that's it you have
have hidden files are now available to
be seen now what happens if you don't
want them well you really just have to
run the same command and just type no we
can head enter okay and now let's open
it up and they're gone okay let's say
you ran this command and they didn't
show up I'm going to close this let's
say you ran the first command nothing
happened you didn't get any sort of
errors but you open up your folder and
then you don't see any hidden files well
you can come down to your toolbar or
your your app bar or whatever this is
called down here I forget what it's
called the drawer or something and if
you hold down the option key and right
click you'll get this relaunch option so
go ahead and click that little
re-launched finder and now when you open
up your folder you should see your
hidden files so I'm going to paste that
line of terminal command i'm going to
paste that command in the description
just paste it right in there and you now
have hidden files okay this having
hidden files is a small bit of a
prerequisite for this next video about
using zsh and oh my zsh so keep watching
in the next video i'm going to show you
how to do that as always this is scott
with level out Tut's and thanks for
