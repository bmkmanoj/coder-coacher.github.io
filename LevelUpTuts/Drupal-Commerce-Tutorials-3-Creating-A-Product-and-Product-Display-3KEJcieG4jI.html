Tut's and today we're going to be
creating a product with Drupal commerce
on our Drupal site and you'll notice I
have some just a default content in here
and these are just some of our tutorials
this is just default content don't worry
about it other than that we're running
with a pretty standard Bartik theme here
so I'm going to come to store and we're
going to click on products now here we
have the option of actually let me just
boost the size of this in general now
here we have our product screen and once
you have your products or your SKUs in
here they're going to be all listed here
just like your content would be in
Drupal normal content and we can add a
product from here we also have product
types and product types are analogous to
content types right so if we come to
product types we'll see that there's one
and we can manage fields manage display
that sort of stuff and you'll see we
have product SKU title price and status
so these are the default fields that
come in with the default product so
let's go ahead and come back to products
and let's add a product this product
SKUs has to be unique since we're not
having a real store we can just call
this LUT zero zero zero now we can say
product one the price is going to be 899
US dollars and the status is going to be
active now you can have a log message if
you'd like but we're not going to let's
just go ahead and save product okay so
now we have our product and if we come
to this title we can click on it and it
just takes us to our men or our edit
screen right so with any piece of
content that you've created in Drupal
before what happens is you create the
piece of content and then it's a note
living on Drupal right so the note is
just a piece of content and in this
situation you create a node like a basic
page and it would just show up as a note
however we have created this product and
you can see even if we go to our content
no it's not going to show up and even
though this is a view of our content
it's still not going to show up so what
do we do you've created this product and
now it doesn't exist right well till you
have your products show up in Drupal's
interface you need what's called a
product display and for a product
display it's essentially a node that's
referencing a product so let's come to
our structure then we're going to come
to content types and we can add a
content type that is just going to be
named product display now if you had a
particular type of product this might be
a good time to make that product that
type of product make the name a little
bit less generic than product display
right so let's save and add fields I'm
going to want to go ahead and turn like
commenting that stuff off later but
right now it doesn't matter let's just
add a new field and this field is just
going to be product and here we can
scroll down and we see one of our
options for a field is a product
reference now let's have it be a
autocomplete text field so we can just
search for the products name or the SKU
and let's click Save and options limit
list we don't we don't need to have
anything here and we now have a product
perfect so let's save these settings and
let's create one of these products let's
go to add content product display let's
say our new product or whatever this
products called perhaps extra let's just
call it product one and we don't need a
body yet but this could be a description
about maybe the product
and here we can just start typing in our
SKU and you'll see it autocompletes okay
let's save that and let's check out the
page so now we have a node now we have a
display on our site and we have the
stuff that you would normally expect to
see I mean obviously you're not going to
want this and you're not going to want
this add new comment but we have the
product with the name of our product
display and we have the price and we
have this Add to Cart button now how can
we clean this up I'm going to open up a
new tab and check out structure and
content types
we're going to edit this content type
for product display and I'm going to say
don't display author information hide
comments and let's save this refresh
it's actually looking a little bit
better but we need to turn off
commenting here save it okay so now we
have a node with the price and an Add to
Cart but we still have this weird
product label let's come to our our
manage to display again under content
types
for our product display we're going to
now manage the display and there's this
label and we're just going to make that
label hidden now what you'll notice is
that in this product display keep in
mind we're still on the node not the
product itself we have some options here
we have the ability to drag this the
product title in the product status and
the SKU if we wanted to display this SKU
we could just drag that in here and now
it's going to let's actually put it
above the price so now it's going to
have the SKU then the price then the
product itself the Add to Cart so let's
save this come back to our No
we refresh and now we have the skew we
have the price and Add to Cart button so
here we are we have a product we have a
product display and we have an Add to
Cart button let's see what happens if we
click this it adds it to our cart - we
can even view our cart and you'll see
what we have is the beginnings of a very
basic web store of course you could try
to checkout
but we haven't really configured any of
that stuff yet but we'll get to it so
you've now had the ability to see the
difference between a product and a
product display you now know how to add
fields and in the next few videos we're
going to create more complex products so
