up tuts and today we're going to be
talking about plumber for gulp now in
the last couple of videos we set up a
watch script and we compiled our sass
into CSS now you may have noticed that
if you were to mess up the syntax a
little bit and saved your sass code that
your gulp will just stop watching
entirely and the process will end well
luckily we have plumber to save the day
and plumber is going to prevent gulp
from stop running just because there's
an error somewhere in your code so check
it out we're going to get started with
that so in the last video we set up this
sass watch so it's not watching for
changes in our CSS and we have this
running and it's all good
well what happens if you go to save your
CSS or you go to save your sass and
let's say for some reason you forget
something stupid like a semicolon and
you just click save like me I'm
personally almost over saving with my
files I'm always hitting command s
command s it's almost like my fingers
are trained to do that after I type
something and my typing is always super
accurate so sometimes I make mistakes
like this and with gulp if you were to
save this file now let's actually check
out our command our terminal we have
this huge error and it's stopped
watching it's basically saying that
isn't valid syntax I don't know what to
do and because of that gulp has just
stopped running now obviously this is
unacceptable we don't want anything like
this to happen
because this would just be a huge pain
when we're trying to write our code so
let's go ahead and add a gulp package
that takes care of this for us and this
is going to be the Plumber note package
so like we've done before we need to
install a package and to do that we just
need to type in NPM install and then the
package name since I know I have to type
sudo as always I'm going to be typing
sudo npm install - - save - dev and then
we're going to be typing in gulp -
plumber just like that so gulp - plumber
and I'm going to put the link to the
node package in the description so you
can visit this page and have this
command that you can copy and paste if
you'd like okay that's going to ask for
my password and I'm going to let that
install okay that's nice and easy it's
now installed into the project cool so
let's go ahead and use gulp plumber to
do that likewise we need it to define
plumber first as a variable so in our
little variable chain at the top here
I'm going to add another comma at the
end of sass I'm going to say plumber
plumber equals require and then like
we've seen so far it's just the name of
the package so gulp - plumber just like
that now this is the best part of gulp
plumber all we have to do is specify
that we want to use it at any task that
we want to keep going if there's a
problem so let's go ahead and add it to
our scripts first and we can say dot
pipe and then inside of this we need to
say plumber and we're going to run the
plumber function now notice how this is
happening before everything else I'm
actually going to go ahead and indent
these just to make this a little nicer
there okay so now I'm going to copy this
line because we're gonna use the same
exact line with our sass files so right
after the source function or the source
the method here before the sass function
we're going to put our plumber in again
I'm going to indent these just like that
okay so now we're running this plumber
first and it's going to make sure that
nothing gets uh nothing gets gulp
tripped up okay so now let's rerun our
actually let's fix that issue first with
cess
okay now let's rerun our default gulp
just like that okay it's watching
everything now let's go ahead and make a
large syntax error I'm just going to go
ahead and look at I just move some stuff
around we got two semicolons of row none
right here so it's guaranteed to
normally stop gulp down its tracks
I saved it however it gives us a syntax
error it's great because you know it
tells us line four there's a syntax
error so I can go back and say oh okay
what's going on here line four oh yeah
this is just a big mess so let me undo
that and then save it and notice I'm not
going to have to restart gulp here like
last time if you go back over it's
already already compiled our Styles up
on save so gulp plumber is going to make
your life a ton easier and it's going to
function like what you're used to with
something like sass watch so you can now
make sure that dope continues to run
until you tell it to stop now if you
would like to tell gulp to stop all you
have to do is hit control Z so ctrl C is
going to put an end to that process and
now go p-- is no longer running cool so
you now have a working environment that
should be similar to what you are using
with sass watch you're compiling your
sass and add changes it's compiling and
making CSS that's excellent well in the
next few videos we're going to go over
some really awesome things like
autoprefixer that adds in browser
prefixes for you then you don't even
have to worry about things like compass
you can just use sass and it's going to
automatically put the prefixes on your
CSS we're going to do things with live
reload we're going to compress images
we're going to do all sorts of great
stuff so keep watching there's lots more
gulp goodness to come as always this is
Scott with little of Tut's if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment the video here to set that
Twitter or Facebook at level up Tut's we
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
