up tutorials and in previous videos you
sort of seen these interactions that we
have in the very first animation when we
had a tap interaction in this video I'm
gonna be going over all the different
types of interactions or actions that
you have available within your principal
application so let's get going on that
right now okay so now that we've gone
through some of the basic stuff right
the interface folders grouping and then
let's get into some of the good stuff
for instance interactions now these
interactions are going to be things that
you're gonna be using all the time
because obviously that's sort of the
point of principle is to be able to
interact and animate onto this canvas
now let's go ahead and I'm going to
detail essentially what the different
types are just by essentially creating
two squares here let's go ahead and drag
this one up so it's super big covers the
whole artboard beautiful okay so let's
go ahead and select the square and
whatever we have selected gets this
lightning bolt next to it we've seen
this in action a few times and if we
select the air board itself that's going
to be interacting with the artboard so
let's have this rectangle selected and
we can select the lightning bolt and you
can see we have a whole bunch of
different options here now the most
basic of which is Auto so I'm gonna
click and drag Auto under here and you
can see without doing anything over the
course of time this animates directly
now that's super easy if you wanted to
make just essentially an animation that
just took place and sort of did its own
thing Auto is gonna be the way to go now
to delete an interaction here we can
select this artboard auto right here and
click delete now it's gone now let's go
ahead and click this and we can select a
different one we've done tap already
which is essentially just a tap you you
click it right and it works let's go try
to long press so we can click and drag
onto here and now in our window you can
tap this all you want you could notice
I'm tapping nothing's happening one two
there goes so long press is
differentiated from tap just buy a
couple second hold now this is an
interaction that you do have frequently
on mobile the lung press okay let's go
ahead and delete long press and let's go
ahead and select the next one which is
scroll begin now you might be wondering
what's up with scroll beginning and
click and drag and you could see some
interesting stuff going on here at this
shape is now being moving when I'm
clicking and dragging and it can do left
or right but what's not happening is
it's not actually animating to this new
size and you might be wondering what's
what's going on with that we can we can
do this but really what this is doing is
it's not an interaction like we have
with these tap it's not going to go to
this major size now one way we can do
that let's go ahead and delete a scroll
begin I'll talk about that more in a
second and we can have scroll release
and scroll release goes to here now we
can scroll this and when we let go now
it goes big so you might be wondering
hey what's what's going on with that
well reality is that the scroll begin
functionality we're still scrolling and
then the shape is sort of overridden
because we're still scrolling so the
action took place but it's not actually
gonna happen so in this particular
instance it's going to work because we
release and we're no longer manipulating
this therefore it's going to stretch up
the entire way let's go ahead and check
out the next one which is going to be
scroll and now scroll and we scroll and
then it goes up but let's say let's go
ahead and make this a different shape
here I'm gonna make this nice and big
and we'll you'll notice with these
scroll interactions is that we have
these folders these groupings scroll
window actually so if we scroll this
make this a scroll window considerably
larger
what happens is we can drag this up and
it's no longer getting clipped and there
we go so now it's not just upon release
I'm releasing it it's returning to its
normal place and then it's animating so
scroll ends is after it returns to its
normal location unless we still can't
move this right or left now if you
wanted to do a right or left
let's select scroll window too now
you'll notice when we flick scroll
window too in our inspector it now says
horizontal scroll and static is vertical
so this is a group that allows us to now
move this so that's super cool
you'll notice that that inside of scroll
window one that when we do select scroll
window or scroll window here we have
scroll vertical and static horizontal
and scroll window to is scroll
horizontal instead Akande vertical if we
were to set this to be static you can
see that we can no longer move this
right to left at all and it's only up
and down cool
so that's scroll window ends let's go
ahead and delete that now let's go ahead
and remove these groups here because it
keeps on adding these groups for us we
don't want those anymore let's go ahead
and now select the lightning bolts and
let's do drag begin now drag begin you
might have the similar instance but we
go to drag this and hey it automatically
just animates so any sort of dragging on
this at all is going to cause this to
animate you'll also notice that when we
selected that and in the inspector our
shape now has the horizontal and
vertical properties of drag which it
didn't have before
well the drag layer begins is animating
this directly when it begins so let's go
ahead and remove that and let's change
us to be drag end which is going to be
just like scroll end the moment we let
go of this it actually grows from the
space that it is dropped at so that's
actually really really super cool if we
bring this down here let go
animates from that new position
it's not like he goes back to the old
position and animates so this is
something that's really super powerful
for interactions here okay let's get rid
of that one and we still have a few more
we have touch down so touch down is
going to be sort of like tap right the
moment we click it it opens up where
touch up is going to be the sort of the
opposite of that right the moment that
we let go of the mouse click so let's go
ahead and touch up and clicking this and
you'll notice it's not doing anything
the moment I let go there goes cool okay
let's go ahead and get rid of that one
as we're almost done here we have hover
inside let's click this and let's check
out hover inside now whenever my cursor
hits inside of the square
it grows hover outside is the exact
opposite right it whenever you are
hovering outside of your shape it's
going to animate for instance we hover
out here and it grows let's go ahead and
move this up here so we can actually
show this in action I'm hovering inside
of the shape the moment my mouse cursor
goes outside there goes super cool so as
you can see principle is insanely
full-featured it can encounter a ton of
these different interactions you're
building this essentially interactive
little demo that can really give people
a great idea of these user interfaces
and now that we have so many different
things like long press press up that
sort of thing click and drag scroll
whatever to illustrate what exactly you
want to see as a designer or developer
or anything is getting tougher and
tougher you'd say whoa Kay when I press
and click down I want this mask to come
in like a circle
I mean describing that to someone maybe
a potential investor or anything just
anybody looking at this is gonna be
difficult but if you can show them an
actual interactive thing and say here
click on this do this that's so much
better and that's so much better
even than a series of images or anything
like that this is sort of really next
level
prototyping here awesome super cool so
this is how we interact with our
canvases via different interactions as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you'd like to help support
the creation of these free tutorials
more importantly if you want some stuff
in the process you can head over to
store that level up tutorials dot-com if
you become a subscriber you could access
to all of these videos right now before
they're released on YouTube you get
access to all of these principle files
you get access to a whole bunch of extra
videos that show you some of my favorite
interface and design things that I found
on the web and we're gonna be pawing
through them and seeing exactly how they
were made so you can make really
insanely complex awesome stuff yourself
so as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments if the comment the video hit me
up at Twitter or Facebook and level up
tutorials I'd love to hear from you
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
