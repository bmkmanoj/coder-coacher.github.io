up tuts and today I'm going to show you
how to change your output style in
terminal using SAS so if you remember
before anytime by default when we were
to watch one of our s CSS files it
always outputs our CSS like this and
this is Sasa's default output wishes
it's nested output SAS also offers
different types of outputs such as
expanded compact and compressed so I'm
gonna show you how to use those and real
quick and we can take a look at what
that does so the first thing I'm going
to do is stop my current SAS watch by
just doing ctrl C and to change your
style here it's just a flag that you
type in in the command line so we're
gonna do SAS and then before we used to
do - - watch you can do a hyphen W for
short if you'd like and then we're going
to do style dot s CSS colon style that
CSS just like before
but now we're gonna do - - style and
then a space and then we're going to
type with and then we're gonna write
what type we would like so let's try
expand it just to see what that looks
like ok you can see SAS is watching will
save our s CSS and now let's check out
our CSS as you can see every single
declarations on its own line now it
looks like it's really just pulled this
out as much as it possibly can so that
is expanded it's just a little bit more
like the typical CSS that you would
write yourself so let's try another one
we can do ctrl c sass - w style s CSS :
style that CSS - - style and then space
and now we're going to do compact ok
it's watching let's look at our s CSS
let's check out our CSS and now puts
pretty much all of your declarations on
one line this is if you were just
writing your CSS in a straight line for
every single class or anything any
single property here okay so that's
compact now let's look at compressed
what compressed is going to do is it's
going to put all of your styles
one line okay now we're just gonna say
this and you can check it out
so here is your compressed
production-ready minified CSS
everything's on one line good to go
got rid of all of the spaces in your
document so that's how to change the
output style with sass using terminal in
the next lesson I'm gonna go over a
couple more things such as while loops
and for loops once again this is Scott
with level up tuts if you have any
questions or comments hit us up at
Twitter at level up Tubbs leave a
comment on the video you know we love
hearing from you so once again thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
