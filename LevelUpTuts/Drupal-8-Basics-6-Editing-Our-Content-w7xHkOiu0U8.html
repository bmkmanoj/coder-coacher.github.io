love-love tutorials in this video we're
going to talk about editing your content
in Drupal and this is how editing has
really come a long way from Drupal 7 to
Drupal 8 there's a lot of new features
and a lot of cool stuff so let's get
started now that we have our pages here
you might be wondering how we can go
about modifying these after they've been
posted well you'll notice on any given
page you're on as long as we're logged
in let's go essentially to our post here
you'll notice on the home page we don't
necessarily have these edit options you
see edit up here but this isn't the edit
that we're looking for what we want is
to click this my first post and now we
have the option to click Edit from here
it takes you to the admin section where
you can edit your post however let's hit
back to the main page here and you'll
notice some things that we have whenever
we hover over we've seen these before
these pencil marks and you'll see that
when we hover over something we get an
outline for instance the title if we
select this we can say configure block
now configuring this block it's going to
allow us to change the actual page title
so that's one thing to be aware of
you see these pencils all over the place
you see this pencil here and you think
well maybe I can edit this well the only
options occasionally are configure block
however if we check out the pencil on
the body post here we have quick edit
edit and delete now edit is going to do
maybe what you would expect and take you
to the Edit Page however what is quick
edit do if we come to this let's select
quick edit and you can see we now have
this interesting inline editing tool we
can click on this and say my edited post
and we can either save this or click off
and
type in here okay now we can save this
and you'll notice it not only saved your
text here but it also saved the title
itself so we have some quick editing
options if you're just coming in here
and you see a title for instance I put
too many OHS here on hello select quick
edit I'm gonna come in here I can now
click this and save and I fixed my typo
now that's the quickest and easiest way
to edit a given post now that works for
posts does that also work for pages
let's head to about us as you can see we
have the Edit tab this time as like we
did before and we have this configure
block here but we also have the quick
edit options that we had for our
individual page let's head to home and
check out the individual listing here
you'll see that we have this listing and
if we select this year we can also quick
edit this however it's only really
giving us the option to quick edit the
title the body here however it does when
we select it it opens up this hovering
WYSIWYG that allows us to really get in
here and make some changes to the entire
body copy and click out of that
so the way you'll most often be editing
post is most likely through the post and
then edit and then from here you can
make your modifications this way you can
do things like creating a new revision
adding tags like you would expect or
having a more overall robust editing
experience now let's say you have tons
of articles and you don't want to
necessarily find the article to get to
the edit screen well another way you can
find content is by selecting content
from your admin bar and we can search
here if we searched for about it's
finding us our about page we can select
edit here you can also filter by
published unpublished or any given
content type so this is how you edit
posts with Drupal
make sure that after you made your
changes you select save and keep
published so now what we can do is just
click save and keep published and our
post will be fully edited you can see
it's taking us back to wherever we just
came from and to visit our post we can
just click this about us title here and
it'll take us to the front end so this
is your typical workflow for editing a
post in Drupal 8 as always this is Scott
would level up tutorials if you want to
see the rest of these videos before the
release done YouTube had to store that
level up tutorials comm and purchase
them for download or you can scribe
subscribe to level up pro and get all of
these videos streaming before they're
released has an early access so as
always thanks for watching and I'll see
in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
