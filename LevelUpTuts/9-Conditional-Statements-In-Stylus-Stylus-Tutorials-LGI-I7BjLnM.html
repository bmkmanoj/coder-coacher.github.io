web tutorials and today we're going to
talk about operators and conditional
statements within stylist now these have
great use and functions and vixens to
just add a little bit more customization
to what you're doing already so maybe
it's not perhaps taking a value and just
spitting out something but it's actually
taking a value and intelligently able to
change what is being displayed based on
that value that the mix inner function
is receiving so check it out we're going
to get into those right now so
conditionals can be really useful with
in stylish mix-ins let's say we want to
have a mixin that accepts an argument
and if the argument is true it's going
to output one thing and if the argument
is false it's going to output something
else well we can use if statements and L
else if and else statements to actually
define what's going to be output from
our mixin so let's go to a mixin and
let's just name it test this is going to
be testing a variable okay now we can
say if bar and this if this equates to
true it's going to execute and return
the properties below so if VAR is true
then it's going to let's say output
background red now if the variable is
false we want to help put background
blue so we could say else I don't know
why it's just trying to autocomplete but
we can say background blue so what this
mix it is saying is whatever the value
of this variable is is going to
determine what gets output so now in our
CSS if we come in here and we can pass
an a mix in here and we can say test and
let's give it a value of true simply
like that you can see that our
background is being output to bread okay
so let's come to our mixin and just like
we said if the variable is true the back
brown's going to be red now likewise if
we pass in false like so we're getting
blue as the value that's being returned
now there are all sorts of ways that you
can use conditionals in your mix-ins to
do other things now let's say we have a
value and based on what that value is is
going to determine what's output so for
this test mixin that let's pass it a
value of 10 so within our mixin we can
now say if variable is greater than 5
then the background will be red
otherwise make the background blue so as
you can see once I say that our
backgrounds now read our variables 10
however if we were to say if the
variable is greater than 10 then make
the background otherwise blue it's now
blue so these if statements are working
in very much the way you'd be used to in
any sort of programming language and
they can do some really powerful stuff
so let's say we want this to actually
output that this test mixin is going to
be assigning a margin top of I'm going
to use the unit pre built in function
here and we can say unit and it's
accepting the bar and then giving it a
unit of pixels okay so no matter what
whatever variable we're going to pass in
here is going to be set as the margin
top you can see that's output right here
as margin top 10 pixels however we want
to say if the variable is greater than
10 we also want the margin bottom to be
set so we can say margin bottom is also
going to be unit bar and pics okay and
if it's not greater than 10 we just want
nothing
okay let me add some space in here below
here cool so what this mixin is now
saying is if our variable that's getting
passed in here is greater than 10 then
we also wanted to have a margin bottom
otherwise don't worry about the margin
bottom it just give it a margin top so
let's come in here and you can see we're
saving this and we're just getting a
margin top but the moment we go to 11
we're also getting the margin bottom so
as you can see these conditional
statements can be really super useful in
building out sort of interesting
functionality now there's just too many
possibilities to go over in this video
but once you have a basic idea of that
you can write if statements that are
checking values there they can do
comparative they can do greater than
less than your world sort of opens up as
to what you can do with these things now
what sort of operators do you have the
ability to use so let's check out the
stylus documentation page and as you can
see we can use these operators we can
use is equal to is not equal to is is
not isn't in less than or equal to we
can use plus minus we can multiply it is
defined all sorts of stuff here and
there's even some nice words like not if
unless and you can see here what they're
going to equate to so not zero equals
true not not zero equals false not one
equals false not not five pixels equals
true negative 5 pixels equals negative 5
pixels and negative negative 5 pixels
equals 5 and so on so i think it's worth
taking the time to go through these
examples and check out the operator
section of the stylus documentation to
really see what kind of cool stuff you
can do with these operators and there's
I mean there's even the range which is
giving you both inclusive and exclusive
ranges so stylus just offers so many
great features built-in that you can
build some extremely complex functions
now complex functions creatively used a
king
create some really really interesting
packages so i would suggest
experimenting with conditional
statements in your mix ins and functions
and throughout your CSS and see what
kind of cool stuff you can come up with
and then share with the community as

to hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
