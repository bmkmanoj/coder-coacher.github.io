past we're going to go to appearance and
then settings on the theme that you're
using we're using this level up Omega
theme and we're going click settings
here and this might look a little
familiar but then it's going to get
really unfamiliar quickly because in
omega 3 we had various regions you've
got to set your breakpoints and
basically you assigned your regions to a
grid within this appearance menu and
that is now gone from Omega 4 and now
everything having to do with your grid
is going to be through your CSS
particularly through sass extensions
called singularity which is a grid
framework and break points which
determines your break points so those
two combined are going to be determining
your grid and of course we're going to
be going over all there is to know about
those within this series as well so
don't freak out if you don't know how to
do any of that stuff because we're going
to show you and it's really not hard
it's it's very logical in the way that
it's set up and you just need an
introduction once you have that you'll
be flying so the first thing you're
going to notice about this appearance
screen is that we start off with the
layouts tab and now layouts are new to
Omega for and what layouts are is there
a way to create predefined templates and
layouts with in PHP and CSS that you
define and you can even say what regions
are showing up and blah blah blah and
then you can enable them / a particular
page or your entire site so right now we
have layouts turned completely off but
if we enable this layouts extension and
picked one of the default layouts here
let's pick the hero and let's save this
now let's go to our site here and you
can see we automatically have this
layout and it's going to be responsive
and everything because that of course is
how this particular layout was built you
can see it responds down to mobile comes
back up and we
have you no spaces for navigation header
and this is a layout that's cooked in
out of the box and you may be thinking
well that's cool but I don't want to use
you know this hero er this simple or
that's divine or off-campus layouts I
don't want to use any of these right
well luckily it's really easy to build
your own layouts and usually i want to
say nearly all of the time that's what i
end up doing mostly because i like to
control my coat that way but if you
don't and you just want to have these
layouts in here your design fits these
layouts and these are great options and
you can take these use the layout and
then just start styling on top of that
and if you're wondering you know what
happens if my page has a different
layout on a different page then you're
in luck because there's a context omega
module that is used in coordination with
omega for and you can actually change
the layout based on certain parameters
like perhaps maybe on pages of a certain
content type or pages of a certain path
are going to be getting a particular
layout and we're going to go over those
new dedicated layout tutorials along
with that context module and how to use
that so for now I'm going to uncheck
this enable layouts just so we can have
it off that way when we come back to
this later we're going to be starting
fresh now the next tab is development
and this development extension can add a
bunch of things for you and so it gives
you some options here right so if you
check this it's going to rebuild the
theme registry on every single load now
that's good for development you're going
to want to make sure this is unchecked
if you're in production in fact you
probably want to just uncheck this
development extensions entirely for when
you're in production because whether
it's going to do is add a bunch of stuff
that's just going to slow your site down
so this is going to rebuild your theme
registry and every reload which is
highly performative are highly non
performative so just to be aware of that
this is also rebuilding the CSS and JS
aggregate
on every page load as well and this is
just so if you have aggregation
activated while you're in development is
going to rebuild them without having to
clear the cache which is a really nice
thing for anybody who has used Drupal
with those things aggregated because you
end up clearing the cache all the time
to see your changes now this browser
with indicator this adds a small box to
the bottom that basically just tells you
the current width of your browser and
that's really nice for evaluating your
breakpoints although if you have your
chrome developers tools the docked to
the right and you're resizing your page
that way depending on what version of
chrome iran it might tell you that page
with anyways so usually i just use a
Chrome's version of that I know it says
that in Canary I'm not sure about the
other versions of chrome but however
this is very useful if you do not have
that option now enable live reload is
checked and live reload essentially
monitors your site for changes so when
you save a file it compiles your CSS it
reloads your page automatically so it
triggers live reload ejs and it's going
to update your site instantly with the
new changes and refresh it with with
whatever CSS changes you made so that's
a really nice thing to have when you're
developing because you can come to CSS
save your files come back to your page
and the changes are already made which
is you know it just adds time off of
your or cuts off time off of your
development process and now these live
reload settings you shouldn't really
have to touch these too much in fact
we'll go over that if we even need to
later on once we get live reloading and
this region demo mode I usually check
this if i'm working on a particular
layout or something like that but most
of the time when i'm in development i
leave this unchecked now what this does
is it adds these gray boxes with the
region name right here if you were to
uncheck this box they would go away and
it would be just your theme as it
be presented to users on your site now
it is helpful to see when you're making
your site responsive to see where these
boxes these content areas are going so
of course check that out and you can
even leave some of them on than some of
them off so you could go through and
just check which ones you want to leave
on or maybe you've you're working on the
header so you're going to uncheck this
and leave the rest of a mom now let's
grow back up here next we have the
compatibility menu which really just has
some compatibility extensions it gives
you conditional classes for internet
explorer it gives you things like Apple
touch icons which also work on Android
so when you create the bookmark as a
shortcut on your home page it has a nice
looking icon now one thing to note is
that the default is going to be an Omega
logo so if you want to have your logo or
whatever icon you're going to be using
here you want to make sure that you adit
that icon and will go for that as well
and how and where you can do that and
what sizes you need because you need
several different sizes of images now
you the clear type support for Windows
handheld friendly mobile optimized view
port view port settings you know to be
honest I'm going to say that unless you
have a special circumstance you're
probably going to leave most of these
things checked because they're usually
just going to be helping you out in fact
default scale user scalable yes you know
I feel like you're going to want all of
these things so that your website looks
best on mobile devices and it's going to
be looking its most accurate to what you
think it should look like and now chrome
frame is pretty cool basically it allows
you to harness the power of chromes
engine with internet explorer by
prompting the user to install some
software in the computer this gets
around basically the situation where
people can't upgrade their browser and
maybe they had a little extension on
that makes the website look a little bit
better now you can come down here and
click this enable chrome
pop-up that's going to pop up and say
hey install chrome frame or you can have
it display a warning for users that
don't have chrome frame installed you
know some of these things can be a
little bit annoying for users so it's up
to you it depends on how many Internet
Explorer users you have now the next
thing we have here is the assets and now
the assets extension keep in mind you
can uncheck any of these things globally
here so if you're not using this just
uncheck it right then it doesn't have to
you know process this stuff so I hear
what we can do is move JS files to the
footer we can exclude CSS files we can
exclude JS files and you'll see here
that it basically says one file per line
the astris is a wild card each path is
relative to a module theme profile or
theme engine or the misc folder so then
um the best way to illustrate this is is
I have created a basic web form okay in
the last video I said I didn't install
any modules will I haven't but in the
meantime I just quickly installed web
form and created a text box here and
you'll notice that this has some inline
styles right I mean not inline styles
and has some styles telling it to be in
line and this style comes from this web
form container in line come from web
form dot CSS now this particular CSS
file isn't really toxic I'm just using
this as a in example here but some
modules come with CSS files that are
just getting in the way and you really
rather not have their CSS so you could
come into your theme here and say using
this wildcard character any CSS file in
the webform module don't load now when
we save this let's go ahead and actually
save this right now I'm sorry let's say
this now let's refresh this and you'll
see no not only this not in line but if
we inspect this look at it it's not
getting any class
or any CSS from web part because it's
not loading that CSS file its excluding
it okay so back to assets let's scroll
down here I'm going to get rid of this
too and you can do the same with
JavaScript files that you don't want
loaded as well now let's go down to
these polyfills I really like the that
these polyfills are included because I
usually add most of these polyfills to
my projects anyways it adds respond
which basically allows for media queries
to work in IE six through eight and it
basically it basically it removes a lot
of the headaches involved with trying to
make your site not only responsive but
built for responsive and still work on
older browsers css3 pie by kenneth clark
makes I six through nine capable of
rendering several of CSS threes
decoration features it's just going to
make your site look nicer in IE six
through nine if you're using css3 which
you probably are and a select divisor is
basically a JavaScript utility that
emulates css3 pseudo classes and
attribute selectors six through eight
all you do is include the script so like
usually if you're using this stuff just
check the box it's really not adding
that much weight and of course because
this is built in html5 if you want this
site to look anything like a website in
older versions of Internet Explorer
Safari for older versions of the iphone
browser or older versions of firefox you
want this html5 shiv you check this and
it basically lets those browsers read
the elements that exist in html5 that
didn't exist in older versions of HTML
so that it renders correctly now under
options you can have it be the default
variant or from source and it might be
useful it says to include the source
files instead of the minified versions
but to be honest I never need to go
inside of these files to look at
anything anyways so just including them
as the default production version
minified version is good enough for me
and now down here you're going to see
the normal theme stuff toggle display
you can turn off any of this stuff your
logo site name site slogan user pictures
and comments I usually check these off
because I don't have user pictures use
your verification status shortcut icon
would be the favicon and a menu
secondary menu I'm going to turn off the
secondary menu I usually like to build
my own menus and then front page content
you could also turn this off now logo
image settings it's going to be using
the default logo but if we wanted to
upload a logo we could do that so let's
click this and I'm going to choose a
file and upload the level of tubs logo
okay I have the level of tussilago all I
have to do is choose the file and it
will be uploaded and the shortcut icon
is going to be your favicon and you
could go ahead and use the default or
uncheck this and upload a new one and
i'm gonna click Save configuration I
don't have a favicon ready so I'm not
going to worry about it so here we have
our logo and not too much else has
changed because we didn't change a whole
lot but you learned a lot about the
appearance settings for Omega 4 and you
are probably less shocked now that
you've seen it and sort of know where
things are so in the next couple of
videos we're going to talk about the
files that came with Omega and we're
going to discuss what they do and why
they're there so as always this is scott
without love Hut's if you have any
questions or comments please leave a
comment the video I hit us up at Twitter
level of Tut's let us know what you're
thinking we love to hear from you thanks
