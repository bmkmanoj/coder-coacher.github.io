tutorials and in this video i'm going to
be showing you rucksack now rucksack is
a super cool extension for post CSS and
it says that gives your CSS superpowers
so for this example we're just going to
install rucksack into our project and
i'm going to show you this outrageously
cool responsive text property that comes
with rucksack now over the next few
videos we're going to be going over some
other rucksack properties but for right
now let's just get started with this
responsive font size so now to get
started we basically need to install
rucksack so we can come into our
terminal here in our project and we can
run npm install hyphen hyphen save
hyphen dev now the package is is going
to be ruck sack hyphen CSS ok so now
rucksack is going to be downloaded okay
so now we can go ahead and add it to our
cope file which is what we've been doing
so this should be no surprise to you at
this point because we've been using gulp
if you're using something else you can
just add it the same way that you add
any other package with your post CSS now
we can say require rucksack hyphen the
CSS and we're going to just say the VAR
is going to just be rucksack keep it
simple like some and then we can just
add it to the list of processors so add
another list and just say rucksack is as
simple as that so now we can take
advantage of some really super cool
rucksack features so with rucksack we
can just leave it right now for the
default options and let's go ahead and
see some crazy responsive at CSS stuff
going on let's go ahead and just make a
paragraph and I'm going to go ahead and
just paste in some dummy text in here
just going to use some lorem ipsum here
from this sublime plug-in and let's give
this a class we couldn't just say class
responsive okay just copy this class
name for use later now let's come and
refresh our page and you can see we have
a paragraph here nothing too crazy you
can see it just flows the sort of way
that you
expect now let's actually see this a
crazy responsive typography in action
here so we can come to our sublime let's
come to our CSS and now let's go ahead
and use that class responsive so let's
go ahead and say font type in size and
we can say is response it now this isn't
a value that you normally have for font
size but with rucksack this is possible
so let's go ahead and but before this
will work let's go ahead and cancel our
watch command and rerun it just so it
because no just so it now takes in an
effect of the new packages okay so let's
come ahead and save this and as you can
see we get a bunch of crazy stuff in
here we add this font size calc we get
this screen min-width and max wit and
starting at 12 and going to 21 so let's
actually see what goes on here so when i
refresh my page let's go ahead and
highlight this you can see the font size
is being calculated and as we change the
width of the browser here font size gets
smaller and smaller and likewise as we
go bigger at the font size gets bigger
and bigger so this is really
accommodating your browser with and
we're sort of making things get really
small and really large upon changing the
width of the browser now this is really
interesting right it's taking the
viewport wet and then subtracting the
minimum break point and then dividing by
860 and it's the base font size is 12
pixels plus nine I mean this is just
sort of wild so let's go ahead and show
you some options right for instance when
we were here and we got this really
small this is unreadable it's too small
right so we can actually modify that so
by coming in here to this font size
property responsive we can give this a
minimum font size but let's say we want
to modify the minimum and maximum well
we can actually add that on the end here
by saying let's say we want this to get
no larger or no smaller than 16 pixels
and we want this to get a little bit
larger like 36 pixels at its maximum so
a little bit wider range but as you can
see the values have already changed for
the maximum is set to 36 in the minimum
set to 16 and our values in this calc
statement have even changed so if we
come here and refresh you can see that
even at the larger screens if we select
this we can see that the font size never
gets below 16 and then when we get
larger you can see it's quite a bit
larger now this is something that might
change the way you think about doing
responsive text because the calc system
is nice that it actually scales it's
almost like if you've ever used the fit
text plugin which is a JavaScript plugin
if you've ever used that this is a very
similar thing it's going to be changing
your size here and adjusting it
accordingly that's awesome I mean let's
look at the CSS it took to do that this
this one line so rucksack is full of
really cool things like this now this is
just the most the first example as you
can see responsive typography is number
one on their list it just is add this
and then resize your browser in addition
we have some really cool stuff like
short-handed positioning I personally
use a short hand positioning mixin
that's in stylist however this one's
really cool too we have quantity queries
where you can say if there's at least
five things then make the color red
that's awesome there's a whole lot of
stuff and in the next few videos we're
going to be going over a lot of the more
interesting things that rucksack has to
offer so rucksack is a killer app for
post CSS check it out as always this is
