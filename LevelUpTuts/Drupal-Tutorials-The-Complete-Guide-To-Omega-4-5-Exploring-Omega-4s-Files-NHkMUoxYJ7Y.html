up tux and in the last Omega video we
went over the admin theme settings for
Omega 4 in this video we're going to
talk about the files that came with your
Omega theme and since we're going to be
doing most of the work in the files it's
only appropriate that we give a good
rundown about exactly what you're giving
now as we've mentioned before an Omega 3
you did a lot of your configuration and
a lot of your grid settings in the
settings menu however here we're gonna
be doing it all with CSS which if you
are familiar with CSS and tool success
you're gonna be very happy about that
if you're not it might scare you a
little bit but to be honest it's for the
best it's really easy and you just have
to practice a little bit or get used to
it and I'm sure you're going to be a pro
in no time it's really not that intense
or anything so let's check it out we
have our basic folder structure here and
I'm actually going to zoom in here
forgive me if this gets a little
pixelated here I'm just zooming in on
the screen and we have inside of our
level of omega theme we have a CSS
folder which contains 4 CSS files
it's just our general styles normalize
no query and omega hex and you know what
we rarely need to actually go into this
directory
you know why is that it's because we're
writing our CSS actually in SAS files
which get compiled into CSS now if
you're so inclined you could totally
just you know throw in a CSS grid
framework you could come in here and
just start editing this Styles that CSS
file to basically treat it like it's
just CSS right but then you'd be
ignoring most of the wonderful things
that this Omega 4 is including and with
the assess functionality so if you're
not familiar take some time to get
familiar I promise it's well worth it so
let's
hide that for now of course in images
there's not going to be anything we
haven't put any images in here these are
going to be images that you're using
with your theme things like background
images images for CSS that you're going
to be using in your code and then in we
have our J s which this is going to be
our user and J s so this isn't going to
be our libraries or anything like that
but this is going to be where the
JavaScript that you write goes and
notice how it's a dot behaviors dot J s
and now I'm gonna zoom out for a second
just so you can see some of this
document now we're going to go over what
exactly all of this stuff is but if you
see this Drupal theme DUP prototype
stuff or down here Drupal DUP behaviors
this stuff may look really confusing
it's not in fact it's for your benefit
again that's the one thing that's great
about Omega is all the stuff is for your
benefit and of course we're gonna go
over how exactly you can be using
JavaScript you can see it's a little bit
different they have to add these
paragraphs to explain it you can go
ahead and read that if you like but
we're gonna go over that indeed
JavaScript video now let's close this up
and let's check out the libraries so
again I'm gonna zoom in here and these
are the libraries that we've checked and
basically by checking these libraries
we're just saying we want to enable them
right but to get them it was actually
downloaded when we installed our theme
and if you'll look in our the theme that
we did without drush these aren't going
to be in here so if you installed your
theme without drush these probably won't
be in here and you'll have to run a
Bower command to get them to download or
use the libraries that make file that's
included in here that it has specific
instructions how to do that but you'll
notice these are you know just the J's
files and again these exist but you
really are most likely not going to have
to dive into them for any particular
reason unless you just want to look at
their source and check it out see what's
going on which in that case I would
recommend doing that so let's get out of
libraries and now if we go down we have
a pre process
and now in pre-process it contains just
a page that pre-processed at ink and
let's zoom out again and this is really
a pre-processed page hook and it really
just allows you to modify things before
anything right so this is a pre process
this is happening first right so
basically any changes that happen here
are going to be happening before the
process functions are called
and later at a later phase and basically
anything you want to alter you can throw
in your pre process and then we have the
process folder which includes the
process so these are just for making
changes later in the process phase if
you're not familiar with this stuff if
you're doing mostly CSS you probably
won't have to touch this but in case
you're going to be needing to modify
your bowl with some hooks you're gonna
want to get in here now we have this
sass folder which is really quite
excellent here so if we open this up
you'll notice there's a bunch of folders
we have abstractions base components
variables and then we have the CSS file
while these RS CSS files but these are
the CSS files that we saw it with in CSS
so mega Styles
normalize no query hacks and we're gonna
go over exactly the sass stuff you see
this import statement it might be a
little bit foreign to you but we're
gonna go over it all rest assured we
have all these folders right we have
variables so with things like SAS you're
gonna define things like your colors for
variables inside of a colors that CSS
file that gets compiled into your styles
that gets output onto your page and and
basically by pulling all these
components out into separate partial SAS
files as CSS files we're able to really
have nice structured CSS and this really
allows for sites to grow and have a very
organized code we also have components
which are for things like navigation
search basically components of your site
you'd fill in here base basically
contains
like base styles things that you would
include like your header so your
typography your tables basically things
that you're gonna be defining like h1 is
always going to be like this h2 is
always going to be like this or a
paragraph tag default styles are it is
will be going in these typography and
now abstractions this folder is going to
contain things like your mix-ins
basically things that you want to pull
out that aren't necessarily defining
code that are just more abstract and
again we're going to be going over the
true meaning of what that is and how to
do it later so that's the first half of
the files and the next video I'm gonna
go over about the second 1/2 of the
files to claim with our theme and what
they do and if you need to worry about
them or not a lot of these files are
going to be either for advanced users or
maybe they're just for configuration
things and you don't even need to touch
them at all so check out the next video
and see what you need to edit and what
maybe you can just dig into if you want
to so as always this is Scott with level
up touch and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
