of Tut's and today we're gonna continue
our JavaScript basics with talking about
numbers so if you've worked with other
programming languages before you might
know that other languages break up
numbers into several different types you
have floats you have integers which are
you know values that don't have decimals
and stuff like that
basically with JavaScript you just have
numbers and numbers encapsulate any of
that so if you want to use a number for
any particular reason
you would turn it to a number so let's
see what we can do with numbers right so
let's come to our code here and we
council logged this variable a hello
world and now we're going to count to
log just a new variable and this is just
going to be value and value is going to
be equal to three notice how I don't put
quotes around this I do finish it off
with a semicolon
most lines to our lives in JavaScript
are finished with a semicolon so when
you're done with a particular sentence
so to say you finish it with a semicolon
so we have the variable value is equal
to the number three and my code coloring
might sort of takes care of this so you
know that this is different than a
string which turns yellow so if we were
to now council that log our value what
might you expect let's come to our page
and you see it just outputs the number
three that's cool so let's create a new
variable and let's try something
different we want to save our new value
actually let's not use new let's do you
two just like here notice how it
capitalized the second word of the first
letter of the second word it's something
called camelcase it's used for
JavaScript variables and that's really
just sort of a style thing you could
technically name this all sorts of
things but you'll see this a lot in most
people's code and it's nice to stick to
conventions
so instead of having three here like
this we have three like this and notice
how this character is still the number
three but it's yellow it's being wrapped
in quotes so therefore it's a string so
now let's console.log value and let's
counsel log value two and let's come to
our page and refresh and notice how this
Chrome it recolors them so you see three
is a darker blue and the other three is
black so it's a string now I'm not sure
that all councils
color their eyes these it could just be
Chrome's inspect I can't speak on that
however they're both three it's
outputting three however this is not a
number so what are some features of
numbers that make them worthwhile
well numbers can perform mathematics
right so you can use numbers in the most
basic sense for addition so let's try
something like this where we plus three
like that
and now let's plus three like this we'll
get into the specifics of what happens
when you're using the plus sign and
strings however for this example we're
just going to show what you can do with
numbers refresh this just added the two
strings together giving us 33 where the
number actually come computed the math
so it added three two three and output
six so this is the beauty of numbers
here we could even do something like
value plus value refresh and still going
to be six we can evaluate 3.1 whatever
like this refresh notice how it just
still does the addition like normal like
I said there's no distinction between
integers or or floats or anything like
that but we have numbers and numbers are
capable of performing all sorts of great
computations and we can use them in all
sorts of wonderful ways in programming
so we have a hello world string we have
a value and we have a value too that's a
string of three let's get rid of this
value to like it here let's just set
this back to three and these are numbers
in JavaScript now obviously there's a
ton more to it and we're going to go
over all of the specifics so if you know
JavaScript and you feel like we've left
something out it's obviously on purpose
what we're doing here is we're really
just trying to build a foundation for
you to understand JavaScript and this is
at its very most basics you have a
string which is text you have a number
which is a number and from there we can
do all sorts of great things so as
always if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment the
video or hit us up at Twitter I love
love tubs let us know what you're
thinking we love to hear from you
there's lots more to come in this series
it's gonna be really exciting so thanks
