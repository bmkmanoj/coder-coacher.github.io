up tutorials and in this video we're
going to start taking steps to organize
our project even further and we're gonna
add the CSS so things start to look a
little bit nicer let's get going on that
now
okay so at this point things are coming
along quite nicely now what we really
want to do is go ahead and get some
styles I'm gonna make a link available
to a rap haste bin so that you can
directly just copy and paste this into
your Styles file but first we need to
add a package so that it actually works
let's go to our packages folder and at
the very bottom we can add a package
that I actually made off of a fork here
we could call cell estou Lenski and then
colon stylist - Multi MU LTI now you
might be wondering why stylist I
personally use stylus and all of my own
projects I really like it a lot and this
one includes a whole bunch of little
nice things so you can actually pop
through these styles and see what's
going on here if you want I'm gonna
create a new file in the root of my
directory and we can just name this
Styles sty l4 stylist sty Oh is the
extended extension for stylist and I
will paste in these styles and you can
paste in the styles from the repo here
there's a lot of good stuff in here but
if you just want to check this out it
should make your site already look much
better so as long as you have the
estulin ski stylist multi package and
you have these styles pasted into styles
styles st yl we should be able to head
back to our site here and hopefully this
isn't broken for some reason and as you
can see my resolutions is already
looking quite a bit nicer obviously
there's some things that are totally
wrong here so let's head back to our
HTML let's go to our layout so let's
start at the layout first and sort of
work inwards so let's head to client
layouts main layout now the first thing
I want to do here is we have this class
main layout great let's go ahead and add
a header
now inside of this header I can add an
h2 that says my resolutions okay and we
can have a nav item and I'm actually
instead having an order list here
because this is just sort of quick I'm
going to have just a couple of links so
H ref and this is going to be equal to
forward slash and this is just going to
be resolutions okay and now let's go
ahead and have another one which can be
about we don't have an about page yet
but we should probably make one at some
point
that way we can even add some more
routing stuff cool so we now have our
nav and we have our header we have our
content however our content we want this
to actually be inside of a main tag so
we can have main forward slash main okay
this is the main section of our website
and if you wanted to have a footer we
could have a footer too but I don't have
any content in the footer plan so that's
really up to you at this point if you
add it or don't add it it's not going to
do much so we can see we have our main
layout here with our header navigation
let's check back to our page and as you
can see again things looking a little
bit better we have some nice little
transitions here we have our links up
top so let's go ahead and talk about
project structure a little bit right now
we're not doing anything particular let
me close this meteor folder so that
things are a little bit obvious we have
our resolution single resolutions form
and our app JSX all living in the root
of our document now that's not sort of
ideal at all here and in this instance
what we can do is we can move a lot of
these things into our client folder
let's go ahead I'm going to open up
finder here just so this is a little bit
easier than doing it through sublime
texts interface and as you can see
resolutions form resolutions single we
have client and layouts I'm going to
make a new folder inside of client and
this is going to be resolutions now the
reason for this is is that
I personally prefer a sort of feature
based folder structure so everything
that has to do with resolutions such as
the resolutions form the resolution
single are all gonna go inside of client
resolutions now app dot JSX yeah that's
it's okay but it doesn't really
necessarily make sense to have this be
called epic JSX even though this is our
app it's really just the resolutions
page if we were to have an about page
none of that content would be in here
we'd be using the main layout and we'd
be bypassing app Deus Ex entirely
so let's actually change this file name
to resolutions with an S and let's throw
this inside of client ok I'm actually
now going to throw this inside of the
resolutions folder itself so now we have
resolutions resolutions form resolutions
a single now you'll notice we have all
of these within client we haven't done
any server-side stuff and it's one thing
that's important to note is that if
we're going to be doing server-side
rendering which is actually going to be
covered in a more premium video in this
series that's only available through
purchase then you don't want to actually
throw this stuff into client however
since all the stuffs getting rendered
client-side right now putting it in
client is certainly no issue now sublime
text is going to complain if you had
these files open so I'm going to click
don't save on all of these just so the
paths are correct and we're gonna have
some work to do to make sure this works
correctly so let's start again at main
layout nothing's going to change in this
file main layout is good now so let's
close that let's have two routes JSX
we used app and app dot JSX and app all
within this let's also come to
resolutions and resolutions JSX so what
we really want here we want this class
now to be as resolutions so export
default class resolutions is now going
to be appropriate because this is
resolutions JSX so I just changed the
component app to resolutions which does
make sense because it encompasses all of
our resolutions and it lists a single
resolution
as well as the resolution form let's go
ahead back to the routes file where we
can now change import app to import
resolutions from resolutions JSX however
this path is now totally wrong since
we're in the client folder we need to
remove this one dot and had a
resolutions forward slash so we now have
resolutions resolutions JSX so it should
now be finding this component correctly
and now Apple once more again needs to
be changed to resolutions now this makes
way more sense because like I said this
isn't necessarily our entire app so now
let's hit to resolutions JSX to make
sure nothing else is broken before we
imported the form and the single from
the same directory so even though this
has moved paths entirely to an entirely
new location since it's a relative path
we don't have to update this at all it's
still gonna find this file in the same
folder cool so let's actually head to
our page now and see if we broke
anything that's the best way to sort of
figure this stuff out sometimes just
sort of see what's broken fix it so now
we're gonna see that resolutions dot
find is not a function and uh-oh we now
have a problem now this problem stems
from defining resolutions we have
resolutions being defined everywhere
right so let's go ahead and actually fix
this we're going to now change this to
resolutions wrapper okay so resolutions
rapper in routes dust JSX now it needs
to be changed as well two resolutions
wrapper and resolutions wrapper likewise
we can also change the file name to
resolutions wrapper as well as rename
this to resolutions wrapper okay so this
is an important lesson as you can see
here we're already using resolutions as
a variable it's gonna get confused it
has no idea what I'm talking about when
I say resolutions dot find so let's go
ahead and now check this out refresh and
all of the sudden we're getting another
error I can't read text of undef'
and now if you were to console.log this
stat res you would see that we're not
getting anything and you might be
wondering why that is we didn't change
anything here we're getting resolutions
from new Mongo collection resolutions
dot fiying should be finding it however
what we're not defining it ever is the
Mongo collection on this server before
when we had this file in the root of our
directory this phango collection find
was happening on both the client and the
server so what we can do is actually
create a new folder in my resolutions
called server and inside of here I'm
just going to make a new file and I'm
going to call this publish for reasons
published JSX I should say for reasons
that are going to become more obvious
one to remove auto publish and subscribe
so resolutions new Mongo collection
resolutions inside of Server publish j/s
you get that now we should come we
should be able to refresh and all of a
sudden we have our data once again cool
so if it seems like we're just breaking
and fixing things breaking and fixing
things in breaking and fixing things
it's really sort of the process of
learning obviously do this of course
what I want you to do is make some of
the mistakes that you're going to make
when you're actually working so by
making these mistakes allows us to see
the actual way of doing things and why
things work correctly so as you can see
we now have a much more organized
application our client-side code is all
living in clients we have our layouts we
have our resolutions form single and we
have the wrapper the wrapper itself is
really just sort of grabbing data and
laying this thing out I'm going to get
rid of that Council log here but as you
can see it's just sort of wrapping this
up cool so this projects looking a ton
nicer but as you can see we're we're we
still a long ways to go we're still
using these prototyping packages for
auto publishing and Auto subscribing
we're still using the insecure package
so obviously these are things that we're
going to want to take care of in the
next few videos so as always this is
Scott
with level up tutorials if you want to
help support the creation of these free
videos had to start out level up
tutorials calm and you can purchase a
series along with code from every single
video that I've made in this series and
even some videos that are unreleased and
will not be released on YouTube ever
including things like server-side
rendering and routing with react router
so as always this is Scott with level of
tutorials thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
