up tuts and today what we're going to be
doing is making a 3d card flipping
effect with CSS now we're actually going
to have his content on the front and
back of a card and on hover we're going
to rotate that card in 3d space and
you're going to be able to see what's on
the back now this might sound scary if
you're not used to these techniques but
it's really not that much CSS and it's
really cool the best part is is there's
a lot of things in this experiment that
you can apply to other things so keep
watching over the next couple of videos
we're in if I working a card flip that
you can mess around and modify and
really understand what's going on so I'm
going to be using code pen to show you
an example you can follow along if you
like I am NOT going to be using sass
this is just going to be only CSS
however I'm using normalized and
autoprefixer to make sure I have my
prefixes and that's all I have there and
nothing on the HTML end so let's go
ahead and get started and the first
thing we're going to do is make a square
essentially that just flips over so
let's go ahead and make a div we can
just call this a let's call this card so
we have a card here and in our CSS our
cart is going to get some basic styles
it's going to have a width of 200 pixels
it's going to have a height of 300
pixels and it's going to have a
background and this background color we
can go ahead and just make this a nice
blue color here we can do five six seven
7fc now you can make this of course any
color you would like let's give this
some more room actually let's make this
height a little bit smaller here we can
go 200 pixels with the height as well
just so that this this example isn't
taking over everything okay so we have
our card it has a height than a width
it's got a background color and because
it's a div it's automatically
display:block right so we don't have to
tell this display block or
like that if you weren't maybe using
with the block-level item you'd want to
do that okay so now let's go ahead and
put a hover state on it so we say dot
card hover and for the hover state let's
transform this card so using CSS
transforms we can rotate this card so
let's say trans form and then colon and
then rotate Capital y and we're going to
rotate it on a certain amount of degrees
now let's actually go ahead and put this
add something like 90 degrees now if we
put a semicolon here now whenever we
hover the card is going to rotate on the
y axis 100 or it's just 90 degrees so
here we go as you can see I hover over
this and it essentially disappears it is
doing that because there's one there's
no animation in here it's just instantly
rotating it and to 90 degrees
essentially means it's not there 90
degrees means it's rotating out towards
you and it's gone because it takes up no
space essentially so let's go ahead and
make this something like 120 degrees now
if we hover over it it's rotating and
you can see it's mid rotate but it
really just looks like it's shrunk okay
so we're sort of getting there let's
actually add a little bit of margin top
to this just because I want to give it
some space here okay so now it's sort of
doing it but it's not really what we
would want right
so now we want to add a transition to do
that we just need to add a transition
and then we can pass this all and then
let's say 0.6 seconds and then we can
ease it if you wanted to only target
this transform specifically you could
have this a transform here
but just in case we animate anything
else or transition anything else here
I'm just going to put it all for now now
let's save this and let's check it out
okay you can see it's going beyond the
90 and then almost all the way back
so let's actually put this at 180
degrees to make it do an entire full on
rotation okay so now this is flipping
out 180 degrees now to get this to work
the way we wanted to we're going to have
to add a couple more things first of all
we need to tell this card to preserve
its 3d so we can say that's on transform
so we can say transform - style and then
preserve 3d because we want this to be
popping out at you we want this to look
like it's 3d not like it's just rotating
in 2d space like it is right now well
it's always going to be rotating in 2d
space but we want it to look give the
illusion of 3d space so the next thing
we need is we need to give a container
to this card and we need to give that
container or perspective so let's go
ahead and call this card - container and
let's go ahead and place our card inside
of there now our very first line of code
here is going to be for card and Taner
and card container is going to get a
perspective and we're just going to set
this edge 700 okay so now let's check
out what happens when we hover over our
cube you not get this great 3d effect in
fact uh it looks like it's in 3d space
everything is perfect and it's really
nice and smooth like who'da thought
maybe even like a couple years ago that
doing something like this with CSS would
be so easy it's just really awesome it's
great and now this is something you can
go ahead and try on your own
men with and plague it working do all
sorts of cool stuff with it there's a
lot of great things you can do with
these transforms now let's say you
didn't want this vertical flip here
where you wanted to actually flip
vertically so flip over the x-axis it's
as simple as changing this Y to an X and
now when we hover over this you can see
it's now twisting up and down
essentially over the horizontal axis
there cool so this is how we get the
card flipping animation working in the
next video we're going to show you how
exactly you can have content on the
front and back of this card flipper and
and you can use it to reveal things
about you know maybe an interesting
effect that you have to reveal some
particular type of content so as always
this is Scott with level up tuts if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video below it is up at
Twitter or Facebook let us know what you
think we'd love to hear from you thanks
for watching and we'll see in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
