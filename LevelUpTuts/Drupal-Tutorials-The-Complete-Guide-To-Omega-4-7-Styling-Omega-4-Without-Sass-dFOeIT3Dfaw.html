of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to style your Omega 4 site without
using SAS and now I'm gonna preface this
video with saying this is the only video
I'm gonna do without using SAS because I
strongly believe and I'm sure the
creators of Omega would agree that SAS
is how this this theme and sub theme are
meant to be used and and like I've
stated before it's not a huge learning
curve it's not even a medium-size
learning curve it's a small learning
curve and once you learn it you're gonna
be happy you did so if you're really
stubborn and you don't want to learn SAS
and you just want to use CSS you can
still do that I might recommend maybe
using other frameworks but you can still
do that and here's how basically if we
come to our our themed info site you'll
see that our theme just like any other
Drupal theme is really just looking for
these style sheets and in fact if we
didn't want to use this Omega hax and
Omega know query the Omega know query is
generated by SAS we could actually get
rid of these like that and of course
you'd want to save and clear your cache
and then it's only gonna be looking at
this Omega styles and then of course
you're probably gonna want to keep
normalized and in that case you could
delete this whole SAS folder you could
just straight-up delete it and then the
CSS you could delete everything but
normalized in styles here is at your
Styles dot CSS and you could get going I
mean if we type in background I mean if
we just do like body background and make
this blue let's save this if we do that
we refresh our page the backgrounds blue
so this site is still looking for this
CSS file but at that point what's the
real point of using Omega because really
we have our Regents and stuff like that
and you could say you know maybe you
want to use Omega for its
for it's nice you know semantic code in
the way it gives your Regents stuff
classes I mean maybe that's something
that you like and maybe you want to keep
using Omega like that but there's no way
to control your regions in the
administrative interface anyways so if
you don't want to use SAS and you'd like
to use the administrative interface to
do your grid settings use Omega 3 and
that and that's really they're all there
is to it but if you're interested in
learning SAS or you know SAS or you view
something like les or stylus or
something like that before then Omega 4
SAS is the way to go so in the next
video I'm going to show you how to use
how to start setting up your project to
be able to use SAS and all of the great
tools such as like brushguard and stuff
like that that Omega 4 has to offer so
if you want to use just plan CSS go to
town start writing your CSS and the
Styles and it's gonna take care of it
like any other Drupal sub theme if you
want to add a grid you're gonna have to
add a grid system yourself like maybe
something like skeleton or maybe
bootstraps good framework because the
grid frameworks in Omega this time are
done with SAS so like I said we're gonna
get into that now in the next video I'm
gonna show you how to set up your
project for SAS as always this is Scott
with LevelUp Tut's if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video I hit up at Twitter at level
up Tut's listeners you're thinking we
love to hear from you thanks and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
