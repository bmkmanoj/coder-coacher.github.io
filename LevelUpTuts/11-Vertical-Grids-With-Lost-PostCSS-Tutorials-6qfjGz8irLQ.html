tutorials and in this video we're going
to be showing you how you can make
vertical grids using lost now vertical
grids are a little bit different and
it's something that no other grid system
really has let's get going on sing what
vertical grids are and how they can help
you okay so now that we've covered
responsive grids we covered your sort of
basic grids now let's cover something
that's sort of unique to lost itself I'm
going to go ahead and copy this section
I'm going to rename it grid 2 because
this is going to be a different grid
here and uh in our CSS here I'm going to
make some room for grid 2 let's go ahead
and paste this down here we're going to
say grid 2 is going to be one hundred
percent of the parent container so it's
going to be with one hundred percent
it's also going to contain a clear fix
and let's give this a height as well so
this is going to be different okay so
we're going to give it a height and the
height is going to be just say 500
pixels now let's go ahead and say that
grid hyphen two and then div and then
inside of this we're going to give this
a lost hyphen row so you've seen that
lost hyphen column lost hyphen row is
for a vertical grid which is something
that's really super awesome so let's go
ahead and say this is going to be one
half and let's see what sort of results
a lost row of one half has on a grid
with one two three four five items in it
so let's check this out and see exactly
what happened so I'm gonna refresh so
what's interesting about this is that we
have inside of this we have grid to its
come here let's open this up this grid
to is 500 pixels so it's getting that
500 pixels that we gave it and then if
we go ahead and look at our grid items
you can see that we have two items that
are taking up this entire space now the
other item sir
get pushed out of this grid in fact if
we were to throw and overflow hidden on
this you'd see that they don't even show
up at all because they're outside of the
container essentially so what we're
saying is grid to have lost columns that
take up each one of these divs should be
taking up one half of the parent
container now if we know we're going to
have five divs in here we can say
one-fifth we can come in here and
refresh this and you can see it's
calculating using this margin bottom
which is currently the same as the
gutters on the rest of the site and it's
calculating this height based on how
many of these divs need to fit in this
container so as you can see it's
perfectly 500 and there's no barge and
bottom on the last one and you can think
of this is a little bit different
approach to filling elements in a
container now what's cool about this is
that you essentially just don't have to
do the math yourself you could come in
here and you could say okay well i know
i'm going to have let's say four items
inside of this grid it needs to be 500
pixels then each one needs to be you
know one point or 125 pixels tall or you
could do 100 pixels tall and then with a
25 pixel gutter and then you just having
to get into some math here in this way
you can control the height of the
container and have your children of that
container just automatically take up
that entire space so these are vertical
grids for loss now this may not be
something that you find totally useful
in every situation however it's a nice
thing to have when working on your
layouts it just gives you another tool
in your arsenal to easily accomplished
something that wasn't necessarily bad
easy to accomplish before so as always
this is Scott would level up tutorials
if you have any questions or comments
leave a comment a video or hit is up at
Twitter or Facebook at level of
tutorials I love to hear from you thanks
for watching and I'll see in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
