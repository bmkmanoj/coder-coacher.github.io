love-love tutorials and in this video
we're in be creating some basic layouts
that we can use in our routing so let's
get going on that right now so we're
finally going to get to start writing
some real code now what we can sort of
do here so certain new got a lot of this
stuff in fact I'm going to really delete
everything in my index that's not the
head tags so we can get rid of that like
so and because we don't want any air as
we can just go ahead and delete
everything in this index file that we
had inside of our client actually you
can just go ahead and just delete that
file entirely we're not going to be
using this we now have this index.html
with really nothing in it and what we
want to start to do is we want to create
a layout now this layout can that be
used simply for any of our interior
pages now we're also going to be having
an entirely separate layout for our home
page so let's go ahead and in layouts
I'm going to right click new file and
I'm going to make a new file here and
I'm going to save this as main layout
and I'm doing this in capitalized
camelcase
so we're going to be saying template
with the name of equal to and up and
it's good convinced to always name your
template the same as your file so we can
say main layout like so now let's wrap
that template tag up now from here what
I'm going to add is a main tag so just a
main element make sure this is properly
tabbed okay and inside of this main I'm
actually going to have what is called a
dynamic template tag so instead of just
having the /no template name what we can
actually say is template dot dynamic and
we can say template is equal to main so
now this is going to be the main area of
the site now what this is essentially
acting as an
for you to render content into once we
get started with our routing we're going
to essentially be saying render this
template into the main area and that's
going to drop it right into this
template dynamic tag so that's really
all we need right now for this layout
however we're going to want to add some
things like our header header like so
just throw in an h1 my recipe book ok
and we're also going to be just throwing
in the standard login buttons in here so
we can just say login buttons and you
should have all of these packages
already in your site if you grabbed the
packages list from the last video if you
don't have the packages let's go grab
the packages you need just so things
like the login buttons will work with no
issue ok so now that we have our main
layout we're let's go ahead and actually
create our home layout as well now we
could actually do this home layout as
another template dynamic sort of thing
where we're inputting content into this
however for this example I'm actually
going to be making the home loud
entirely self-sufficient other than
maybe we're going to be breaking out
some things like the header into a
partial or something like that however
the home layout we're not going to be
rendering content into the home layout
should probably contain the billboard in
anything else that we need into it let's
go ahead and make a new file and again
we're just going to name this home
layout HTML now you certainly don't have
to do it this way in fact the reason why
I meant doing it this way is essentially
just to show flow router loading a
specific template only and loading a
template within a template the dynamic
way so for the home layout it's going to
be rendering just this page for the main
layout it's going to be using this as a
layout to render other content
so I'm just going to name this home
layout okay and inside of here
I'm temporarily going to copy and paste
into this header like I said we'll
probably push this out into a partial so
we don't have a issue what we're
repeating ourselves here and then now
let's just go ahead and make another
main tag inside of our main let's have a
div with a class of billboard and I'm
using Emmet for this HTML
auto-completion so if you're not using
Emmet check it out it's really super
handy I have a video on Emmet in the
sublime text tutorials playlist so here
we can just have a some sort of generic
titles organize your meals with a Z know
we'll have an S okay okay so we now have
our home layout which you can see isn't
doing anything fancy it looks just like
a normal template we have our main
layout which is going to be rendering a
dynamic template in here and now the
next thing we just need is some content
to render in here and some routing code
to allow us to change between these
pages so in the next video we're going
to set up our router to do some really
super basic routing just between these
two layouts so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a come in
the video or hit us up at twitter or
facebook at level up tutorials I'd love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
