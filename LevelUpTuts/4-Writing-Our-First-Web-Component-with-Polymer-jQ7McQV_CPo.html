tutorials and today we're going to be
writing our very first web component and
this is going to be a bare-bones hello
world web component but it's going to be
your first web component with polymer
nonetheless so check it out let's get
going writing our first web component
with polymer so in the last video we
wanted to drop in this google map we
took a little bit of a look inside of it
now let's go ahead and let's write our
own element now there's going to be lots
of different ways to write your own
element in fact on the polymer
project.org site there's a whole thing
about re creating a reusable element
where you can download a seed element
and things like that however we're just
going to be creating a basic hello world
and we don't need to do that for this
particular example we're just going to
create this element nice and easy and
we're not going to worry about anything
else but later on we're going to go over
the whole preparing and creating your
element so that they can be distributed
on things like Bower and that they can
be easily reused on other projects since
this isn't anything we plan on doing
anything with it certainly doesn't
matter so let's come to our site here
I'm going to click on this and just make
a new file and I name this hello hyphen
world HTML ok now let's actually up
import the polymer script directly into
this hello world HTML file so to do that
we can do exactly what they did in the
bower components google map component
HTML page you'll notice up top here
they're just importing this polymer HTML
now the only difference here is since
this hello world is located at the root
directory of our project we're going to
want to go ahead and type in the bower
components first so that make sure it
can find this correctly Bauer underscore
components
so we're now bringing in polymer HTML
into our hello world now the next thing
we want to do is come over here and
scroll down we can see that we have this
Dom module and okay and inside the down
module we have style we have template we
have style and we have template
sometimes you're going to copy this hold
down module part right here and let's go
ahead and delete a whole lot of stuff
let's delete everything in between the
templates and let's go ahead and delete
everything in between the style tags and
let's go ahead and change the ID to be
hello world ok so now inside of this
template we're simply going to have the
HTML that's output by this element be an
h1 and it's going to be just outputting
the words hello world like so perfect
and in the style we can go ahead and
give the h1 some properties just so we
can make sure it is getting this working
so we can just do a color and simply we
can use the stock blue color so we can
just type blue just so it's nice and
obvious so we have h1 with a color of
blue and we have in between our template
tags hello world and that's the end of
the Dom module section next is we need
to have some JavaScript so if we scroll
down in the google map one that we had
you'll notice we had this is so pretty
much the only thing that we need here is
the is because we're not going to have
any properties so to register this
element that we have in our hello world
we're going to go ahead and start a
script tag and like I said we don't need
this text this type JavaScript because
we're using html5 and then we can have
the polymer object so palomar like so
open parentheses and then we have curly
brackets and we wrap it all up with the
semicolon now inside of this object here
we can say is and the is property is
going to be hello
hyphen world like we've been using and
now we're going to simply save this ok
so this hello world element is as simple
as it gets we basically have this dumb
module that includes the template with
the h1 it also includes our styles we're
importing polymer and we have a script
that has polymer colon is now let's come
to our HTML and let's import just like
we imported this google map right here
i'm going to copy this line and i'm
going to paste this in here and now
we're going to just import not within
our bower components because this is
just in the root directory our hello
hyphen world and now we can use the
hello world element in our document so
now we can say bracket hello hyphen
world and then we can close that element
and save it now let's go ahead and I'm
going to comment out this google map cuz
we don't need it right now alright so
your commented out let's head to our
HTML let's refresh the page and you can
see with little to no effort we have
this brilliant hello world here so let's
check out something so let's actually
try something that's pretty cool here
they give you a little bit of idea just
why web components are just so cool so
we can have an h1 in our code so let's
just have an h1 let's wrap it up here
and let's type in hello world and what
color would you expect this hello world
to be well we've defined in the CSS that
H ones are blue however that's just the
h1 that is contained within this hello
world element so this hello world
element the styles are scoped to this
element so we don't have to worry about
styles bleeding out into other elements
however let's say we wanted to actually
modify the h1 color of this element in
our CSS so let's actually had two main
dot CSS before we reference the google
map and let's do hello hyphen world and
let's
scope that to an h1 and now let's call
this color red just come back to our
page and refresh and you'll notice it's
not getting the red let's open up this
hello world and let's check out the h1
now let's check out the eight the CSS
here as you can see the h1 named hello
world is getting the color of blue
because that is assigned to an h1 the
class of hello world so for us to be
able to override this we would want to
target an h1 with a class of hello world
so we can say hello world save it
refresh and now you can see it's being
properly overridden but what's so great
is that you can open up any of these
elements and really just see the CSS
that's being applied to it and where
it's being applied to from so here we
have our very first custom web component
created by you and it's just an
introduction to the awesome things
you're going to be able to start to
create using polymer so as always this
is Scott would level of tutorials if you
have any questions or comments have
become in the video artists about order
or Facebook at level up tutorials we'd
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
