tutorials and in this video i'm going to
be showing you graphic stock which is a
great resource to be downloading stock
images and vectors for your projects now
it's nice is that they give you the
vectors in an EPS format so that you can
download and throw it into your sketch
application or your illustrator
application and you can work with those
in whatever way that you feel most
comfortable so part of working on the
web and with media in general is having
access to high quality resources to be
able to augment your designs or maybe
just gain inspiration from so because
graphic stock has provided me with an
account and a coupon code for you to
sign up for forty nine dollars I thought
I would show you some of what they have
to offer in terms of vectors
illustrations photos basically kind of
what you'd get out of your membership
and they have a lot to offer they have
over 300,000 assets available to
download with that subscription and from
what I've seen that's a library that's
almost always growing and sites like
graphics stuck allow you to essentially
download a whole bunch of stuff you can
see we have vector graphics
illustrations and photos like stock
photos and things like that now a lot of
other sites what you're gonna have to do
is you're gonna have to pay for an
individual stock photo I've worked out a
lot of agencies that have involved
having to comb through a lot of stock
photos pick out the ones and by the time
you you want to purchase them it your
costs kind of have gone up quite a bit
so it's nice is that graphic stock it's
a little bit different here it offers a
yearly subscription for unlimited
downloads of ninety nine dollars
although actually graphic stock has been
great enough to provide us with a coupon
code to allow you to get a year's worth
of downloading for only forty nine
dollars instead of 99 and I actually
have the link for that in the
description of this video so if you want
to check out graphic stock it can be
forty nine dollars for you for a year
you can
unlimited access to downloading
resources from them is that if your
freelancer you work for a company you
can just write that forty nine dollars
off it's a small fee and then you can
have access to a whole bunch of stuff
like this now what's great is that this
is an advertisement layout right and you
could see you can grab it as a JPEG or a
ping if you just want to use this as
inspiration and not have that logo
however if you grab stuff that is
available as a vector you can see that
let's come in grab something like here
we have this tree image here now I'm
going to do this on my account instead
of the unlocked in version that I just
had open that way we can just go simply
click download or you can add it to your
Dropbox or you can save it to a folder
but as an eps or a PSD you have access
to opening in Photoshop or anything like
that but however since this is an EPS
will also have access to adding it to
other vector applications so for
instance I can throw this into sketch
here and after it takes a second here we
now have this fully imported and what's
great is that as an eps we can scale you
can see we have a folder but we have
access to this as a total vector any
sort of way that you want to do this so
you're not just restricted to
downloading an illustrator file you have
access to vector files that you could
then modify and use in your own projects
so let's check out something else here
we have these icons we could actually
download these icons as an eps and we
could open them within sketch just like
we did the tree let's drop this in here
and as you can see as an eps we have
access to these vector points and we can
modify them as needed we can change
colors we can change any of the vectors
to modify in ways that we may or may not
see fit for our application but as you
can see these are some nice resources
just to have here right i mean even just
to collect these sort of icons if you
ever need a light bulb or anything like
that
you could save this export it as an SVG
use it in your website there's a lot
here so a lot of people are often
looking for royalty free images in terms
of stock images vector images that sort
of stuff and with a subscription to
graphic stock for 49 bucks I mean that
seems like a nice value to get a lot of
stuff so check it out let me know what
you think of graphic stock and if you
want to take advantage of that $49
subscription check out the description
of this video I'll have a link available
