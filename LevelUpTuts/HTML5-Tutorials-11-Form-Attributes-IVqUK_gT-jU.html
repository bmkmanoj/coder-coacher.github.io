up huts and in this video we're going to
continue our html5 form talk with some
new attributes and new things you can
use in your forms and what if the ones I
use most often is placeholder so if we
just had a normal text field let's just
do an input type and it's just going to
be an input type text right but we can
have a placeholder text and this is just
by typing in place holder and now we can
say enter your name okay and let's save
this now in our browser let's refresh
now we see sort of grayed out in this
text box it says enter your name the
best part about this is this isn't any
text here you can't select it it's not
going to submit the form if you submit
it it's basically just a background to
this area when you start typing it
completely goes away you stop typing it
comes back it's really just
presentational but it's really great
because before to do this if you have
like a value and here is the point like
that that might not necessarily fit
because then you have a value in your
form and if you want to validate for
value presence or something that
wouldn't work so placeholder text is a
great way to do this directly in HTML
and now browser support is pretty good
for this and I think ie10 supports it
but I'm not positive anything other than
that's not going to and like I said the
browser support is going to change all
the time but this one is one of your
more well used items here so another one
we have is pattern and pattern is really
interesting as well because it allows
you to validate a field without using
JavaScript with just using a regex
pattern so I would recommend doing some
research on the regex because it's
really useful regular expressions that
is and you could type in here pattern
and inside of the quotes here we can
just have a regex pattern so I'm going
to say this accepts all characters
lowercase a through these a3
see and all characters uppercase a
through Z and I'm going to say that
happens as many times as you want
so let's come back here refresh so it
looks normal nothing looks like it's
changed however if you try to submit
your form it's going to tell you that
the requested for Matt wasn't matched so
you of course would want to have some
instructions in here and you know maybe
if you're looking for an employee ID
number something like that it has
certain characters and you want to
validate with regex either way it's
pretty darn cool to be able to use a
regular expression in HTML like that so
the last item we're going to have here
I'm also going to throw it on this text
this input type text and it's going to
be one of the more useful ones it's
going to be required and this is just a
boolean attribute so by having the word
required here you're basically turning
this on so if you save this and refresh
this page again you're not going to see
anything different but if you try to
submit this form it's not going to let
you so let's actually go ahead and add a
submit button here and we'll just do an
input type to mid
and let's save this and now we refresh
our page we have a submit button and
you'll notice when we try to fill this
out
it does say please fill out this field
it's letting us know that nothing in
there is acceptable also if I try to
type in a number and I click Submit it's
giving me an error saying that the
requested for Matt wasn't matched
because it wasn't a character so that's
awesome
so let's actually see how this affects
some of these other fields let's say
it's a email right let's make email
required as well save this come back
refresh you have a name in here it's now
telling me I need to fill up this field
and I'll just put some junk in here
please enter an email address great so
let's uh at level up tuts comm and it
knows this is an email address and the
form submits correctly so you've just
built an html5 form with a whole bunch
of new input types with new attributes
you can now require make fields required
directly in HTML and not have to rely on
JavaScript pretty cool so this is all
we're going to do for forms right now we
may come back to some more things later
but this is quite a bit here and have
fun playing around with these new form
types</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
