up Tut's and today we're going to be
talking about the functions file in your
theme now this functions file is not
just going to be sort of a one video and
done thing and I'm not necessarily going
to do a long series on it however it's
going to come up again and again because
the functions file is really where you
add a lot of custom functionality to
your theme now that doesn't mean you
would add all of your custom
functionality to your theme in fact
there is a little bit of thinking
whether or not your custom functionality
belongs in a plug-in or if it belongs in
your functions file well it really has
to do with what your custom
functionality is doing if you plan on
reusing it through multiple themes then
it's going to be better off in a plug-in
because this functions file is going to
be just the specific theme right so when
you do you know move on to a different
theme this functions file does not come
with it it's part of your theme
specifically and what kind of cool
things can I do in my what might you be
using it for most often well you can in
cue scripts with it so you can add like
JavaScript or CSS to your site which is
something that we're going to be doing
in this video just to give you a basic
introduction to functions you can
register new widget areas you can create
new image styles that you can then use
within your site like predefined image
sizes you can create custom post types
there's all sorts of stuff in fact is
it's a very powerful you know it's a
very powerful function or file that
we're going to be spending a lot of time
in so what's important to know about
this functions file is it basically is
going to get run when WordPress is
loading right so this file is going to
get run and anything that you are doing
maybe multiple times through at your
site can actually be put into a function
within this file and then you could
always just call
that function because that functions
going to be loaded so if that is a
little cloudy that's totally
understandable because once we get into
it you're going to see a bunch of cool
stuff that you can do with your
functions file so what we first need to
do is actually create it and I'm going
to right click on my child theme folder
and click new file and I'm going to save
this as functions dot PHP and now don't
let PHP scare you because we're going to
talk exactly about what we're doing okay
so in here sorry I have this other page
open the first thing we need to do is we
need to open up this this PHP file with
a PHP tag so that is a less than sign a
question mark and then PHP now we can
jump down a couple of lines here now if
we take a look at the functions file in
our parent theme which is 2014 you're
gonna see it's got a lot of stuff in it
but it could teach us some lessons right
so we have this big comment here in fact
you can give a comment describing yours
as well
however you don't necessarily need to
and there's a lot of stuff we have some
functions that are adding some some
functionality to our site we have our
widget areas that are being added in
fact you've seen these before primary
sidebar content sidebar and footer
widget area those names should look
familiar from when we were going over
the widgets and we'll keep scrolling
down okay and so basically there's a lot
of functions that are being run here and
these are all doing different things to
extend the functionality of our site
it's worth applying through this just to
sort of read the comments even if you
don't necessarily understand what's
going on but we'll be doing all this and
more and you'll be able to completely
understand what's going on so from here
we have our functions file right we've
opened our PHP tag now if you'll notice
the other WordPress file didn't close
the PHP tag I think that's just a
WordPress
typically you'd close your PHP tags with
another question mark and then a greater
than but for this file we're not okay so
this has been an introduction to
functions dot PHP in the next video is
going to pick up exactly where we left
off here and we're going to be writing
our very first function and writing our
very first hook and we're going to be in
queueing a script so as always this is
Scott with level up tuts if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video or his up at twitter facebook
at level up tuts
we love to hear from you so thanks for
watching and we'll see you really quick
right in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
