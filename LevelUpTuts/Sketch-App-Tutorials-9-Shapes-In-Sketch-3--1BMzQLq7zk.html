of huts and today we're going to
continue our sketch Basics by talking
about shapes now we're going to show you
everything you need to know about
creating shapes modifying shapes
transforming them in any sort of way and
even creating more complex types of
shapes multiple combine shapes or things
like that so check it out we're going to
get started so we have a blank canvas
here and we're going to get started
creating some shapes now you can create
all sorts of shapes simply with a
keyboard command for instance if we want
to create a rectangle all we have to do
with nothing selected is hit R and
you'll see we get a crosshair where we
can click and drag now if we wanted to
set a specific size we could always come
to our inspector and under size set this
to be something a little bit more
specific now that's great we have a
rectangle however what other shapes can
we make if we click this insert button
in the top left and then shape you'll
see we have the options for all sorts of
things we have a line which can really
just get an increased thickness you
can't really add too much more to it
other than that now we also have the
ability to create an arrow where we can
just click and drag and create an arrow
here you'll notice that's not filled in
or anything so we need to select this
and then select a fill which we maybe
want to add something B like black or
for the borders we can also make those
black now we also have four shapes we
can make a rectangle like we saw we can
make an oval if you hold down shift it's
going to make the both the sides equal
therefore making it a circle likewise if
you do that with the rectangle you hold
down shift it's going to make it in a
square these are things that are pretty
much used in every single application
like this so if you familiar with
illustrator or any other application
where you're making shapes chances are
you've held down shift to make a perfect
shape before okay so we have a square we
have a while we rectangle a circle now
let's see what other shapes we can make
we can make a rounded square which is
just a square
there with a border-radius if we click
and drag here you'll notice that it's
basically the same options for a square
except for we have this radius slider
here that can make these the edges more
of a rounded edge here okay now we also
have a star and polygon and a triangle
if you're wondering where the options
are for these objects well we're going
to click and drag to make a star first
and then we can add more points we can
change its radius to make it maybe like
a fatter star or a you know more pointy
star so you're not actually setting
these things before you draw it but
after you draw it you can then change
the points in the radius if you'll
notice any of these shapes if they have
specific tools are going to be over here
in the inspector so okay we have a star
circle square worth rounded edges square
arrow line and we also have a polygon
and triangle so let's do the polygon
polygon is the same thing here where we
can change the amount of points let's
say we wanted to make a hexagon we have
one here and this can go up pretty darn
high can go up to 10 but if you really
want you can have it go up even higher
than that just the slider doesn't go up
past 10 you just have to enter those
values manually okay and else on shapes
we just have triangles so let's go ahead
and make a triangle okay so we've made a
triangle and now you could choose if you
want it to be equilateral or not if we
click that it's going to make this an
equilateral triangle if not it's going
to remain like this however what happens
if we wanted to move this top point of
the triangle actually what happens if we
wanted to move the points of any of
these shapes well in illustrator you had
two different types of pointers you had
a white pointer and a black pointer and
sketch you just have this one if you'll
notice we click on the shape once and it
only really gives us these transform
tools how do we actually get to the
vertices here well if we double click on
the object then we can now
see all of our points and we have the
pen tool show up we can click and drag
move any of these points around just
like that if we wanted to add a point if
we just up click somewhere in a line
segment like this you'll see that the
Plus comes up and we can create this
point just like here and double clicking
it turns it from a curve to a straight
point and then back again so you can
make this rounded and then extend this
by using these little Bezier curve tools
now let's say we wanted to delete one of
these all we have to do is click it and
then we can click delete now that point
is gone and we have a totally wacky
shape going on here let's delete this
other one and make it even weirder and
let's turn this point into a straight
point and now we have sort of a wild
triangle from here we can now shift and
modify this as needed and what's more is
that we can even take this and add it to
another triangle like this select both
of them and click Union and now we have
one shape now we showed this a long time
ago when we were going over the
interface this adding a union it
actually just makes a group but what
happens when we double click this group
well what happens is it opens up and we
can now have access to modify either of
the shapes individually so if you double
click this now we can access this shape
and it's going to allow us to move our
one triangle cool
so we've now created shapes we've
created a shape that made a Union out of
two modified shapes we figured out how
to not only transform these shapes by
clicking and transforming and these
tools work the same way they're used to
where you click the middle square and it
shrinks horizontally the middle ones and
it'll shrink vertically or the corners
and it's going to shrink both of them
again holding shift is going to make
sure that change happens evenly now this
will make this a perfect square but it's
going to make sure that when you scale
it up
that it retains the proportions that it
had before so now you should be able to
not only get in here and create some
shapes but you can modify them and
change them to be whatever you need them
to be now in further videos we're going
to be talking about using the vector or
the pen tool that you're used to to
create even more complex custom shapes
and we're going to be going over more
things with Union subtract intersect and
difference to make some really cool
complex shapes so like I said these are
just the basics of sketch three we're
going to be taking it through all the
way into advanced features and we're
going to get there soon I promise
these videos are going to keep coming
all month long and maybe even two next
month too depends on how far we can get
so keep watching I promise there are
many more sketch videos on the way soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
