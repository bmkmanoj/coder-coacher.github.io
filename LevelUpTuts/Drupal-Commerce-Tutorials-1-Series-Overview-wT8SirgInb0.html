up Tut's and today we're going to be
installing Drupal commerce on your
pre-existing Drupal site effectively
turning any Drupal site into a webstore
now Drupal commerce and commerce in
general on Drupal has come a long long
ways with the release of Drupal commerce
itself compared to past versions of
software like ubercart which would be
the precursor Drupal commerce is large
steps forward and it's a really nice way
of making a configurable completely
changeable Drupal store now we went over
commerce kickstart in some Drupal videos
which is a basically a fresh install
including a theme and a bunch of modules
pre-configured to start up your store so
if you're looking for commerce kickstart
or a pre-configured store like you'd
have with Magento or something like that
check out the commerce kickstart videos
we did we go through a lot of the
process and and get you used to the
interface there however for this series
in particular we're going to be focusing
on Drupal commerce itself and how you
can use it within Drupal and we're also
going to be talking about extensions how
you can download additional modules to
extend Drupal commerce past what is by
default so to get started check out
triple commerce org you can click
download now here and it is going to
take you to a page where you could I
mean download something but it's really
not that obvious it's like a couple of
brief paragraphs I mean really they
could have like a link or something but
really what you should do is come to
drupal.org
slash project slash commerce and get the
latest version for Drupal 7 right here
as of recording this video the latest
version was on March 5th 2014 and at 7 X
10.9 just go ahead and grab the gzip
version
that awesome so this is what we're going
to be doing in this series and in the
next video we're going to show you how
to install Drupal commerce and get your
shop up and running from there we're
gonna be building out products and
taking it from there to have a complete
working store whether you're selling one
product or 100 products whatever Drupal
commerce is gonna work for you and
there's tons of add-ons to make it
anything you want it to be so as always
this is Scott would love love tuts and
stick around for the next videos so you
can learn a whole bunch about Drupal
commerce</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
