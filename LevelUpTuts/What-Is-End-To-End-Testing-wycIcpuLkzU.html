is Wednesday testing series by doing a
new video on what is e to e or
end-to-end testing so what is end-to-end
testing well we went over unit testing
which was testing a specific unit of
your code and then we went over
integration testing which is how to test
how your units work together now
end-to-end testing is going to be one of
the more obvious ones right we're going
to be testing the entirety of the
application the front end the back end
the rendering every single thing we're
going to be testing in a browser
environment now in the past tools like
selenium have been a very popular
however I've been a huge fan of Cypress
from Cypress dot IO because it not only
gives you a nice query language to work
with and a normal sort of syntax that
you'd be used to but it also gives you
this really great visual indicator you
can click through it and find out why
your tests might not be working in fact
I can even show you some of my ciphers
tests right here this is not sponsored
by Cypress I just love use and like this
service here like if I wanted to go
ahead and just click to run this you'll
see let me make this window a better
size here you can see that my app is
crashing and I'm currently failing all
of my tests let's go ahead and actually
fix that really quickly here and these
errors are happening just because of
this method that I completely changed
here let me comment out the old one
saved this and hopefully if we head back
to our tests you should see this kind of
stuff in action here let me open up my
google chrome instance here what
actually happens is this cypress opens
up a new instance of Chrome and runs
your tests in an actual browser now
what's great about that is it means that
you can not only see Cypress clicking
through your website but we could go
through and step by step after all my
tests of run you can see that well it's
looking for react 16 for everyone it
doesn't exist you can see that after all
of our tests are done I can
go through and click on a test select
and then sort of see the step by step
everything that's happening now this is
just one specific environment for
end-to-end testing I mentioned that
selenium is a previous very common
testing suite I personally really enjoy
Cypress though because on top of it you
can write all these tests you can run
all of them you can run a couple of them
but what end-to-end testing does is it's
running your site it's running the
server it's running the client and the
actual browser in a Chrome browser and
other services like selenium will do it
in other browsers other than chrome I
believe and actually think that either
Cypress is working on that feature or
they already have it as far as I know
but what's going on here is that this is
running your app in a real world if this
is a real Chrome browser you can slide
you can click through it you can inspect
it you could do all of the same stuff so
that is end-to-end testing right now we
went over why integration and unit
testing were important right unit
testing is important because you want to
make sure this one specific unit is
working right does what it's supposed to
do integration testing is important
because you want to make sure that stuff
integrates well it works together in
unison or it works together in a nested
component structure or something like
that
now end-to-end testing is important
because it makes sure that everything is
working together with all of the
technology all of the interesting
browser stuff and it's not taking your
individual components and just trying to
render them on client or server or
whatever it's doing everything in the
actual environment your users are going
to be using it in so this is just one
facet of testing in your testing arsenal
and I think it's extremely important to
write a lot of end-to-end tests as well
as integration tests I think most of my
tests are end to end and integration
because that's gonna identify more of
the issues that users are actually
facing and then on more critical
functions and things like that I'm doing
specific unit testing on all of those
critical functions right okay so this is
one example of what an end-to-end
testing system might look like by the
end of the day all you need to know is
that an end-to-end testing should be
very similar to what a user might
do for instance I have one of my tests
be an anonymous users tour of the
website they're essentially just
clicking around the website and making
sure the correct pages load and the
correct things are on the pages that
load and that's something that someone
might do they're going to click they're
gonna open this they're gonna open that
they're going to this page in that page
right and this is something again real
world user interaction and real world
user things are all getting tested and
made sure that they work ok so this is
just one facet of testing we went over a
bunch more and now there are others but
these are the primary ones you're going
to be using so I hope this illuminated
what e to e or end-to-end testing is now
I recommend you check out Cypress if you
want again is not sponsored by Cypress I
just really really liked this service I
had so many issues just feeling like I
was in the dark trying to test write and
Cypress kind of illuminated all of that
or illuminated all of that because of
its nice interface and all that good
stuff ok so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you want to help
support level up tutorials head on over
to level up tutorials dot-com I just
released a new series today called view
Jay s for everyone which is a basic
introduction to view Jay s 24 videos to
teach you what is the like hottest
framework out right now and I talked a
little bit about comparisons to react in
all sorts of good stuff but the end of
the day we end up building a view Jay as
application we do API hits we do routing
we do some animations and take you
through all of the view Jay s
foundations now if you don't want to
become a level of pro to watch that you
can always head to the level up store
and it purchased this series outright
it's currently on sale for 29 bucks and
yeah it will be that way for the rest of
the month so if you are interested in
view Jay s for everyone check it out
level up tutorials comm 4 slash store it
should be on the billboard right at when
you get to the store so thanks so much
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
