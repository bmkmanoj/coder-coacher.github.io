up tutorials and in this series we're
gonna be exploring one of my very
favorite applications principle for Mac
now principle is a user interface user
experience prototyping software that
allows you to build in real life awesome
animations and interactions into your
visual files so it's like almost like if
you took sketch and then mixed it with
After Effects and then had some
interaction layer in there you can do
some really amazing stuff with principle
and over the course of this series I'm
going to be showing you not only the
interface but also some of the basic
techniques that you'll need to get going
building some really super cool stuff
with principle now in addition if you
purchase a series or your level of pro
you'll get access to some of my favorite
principle files that I've found on the
principle Facebook group and I'm gonna
dive into them and show you exactly not
only how they were made but what
interesting techniques or sort of useful
things that are buried within these
awesome principle files so if you want
to learn some really practical examples
head over to store that level of
tutorials dot-com and purchase this
series right now or you can become a
level of pro and get streaming access to
everything right away you'll also get
access to all of the principal files
from this series so that's it going
right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
