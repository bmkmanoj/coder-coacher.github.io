tutorials and in this video we are going
to be talking about the stack navigator
which is going to be the introduction to
any sort of routing or navigation in our
native app at all which by the way is
something that is quite a bit different
than normal react for the web so let's
get going on that right now okay and I
mentioned that because this is an
intermediate series I won't be showing
some of the things that I showed them
the react native for everyone series
obviously if you're a subscriber you're
going to want to go ahead and watch that
to get set up and the reason that is is
because well there's a lot to cover here
and so in these videos I'm not going to
be teaching you basic react stuff but I
will be teaching react native stuff that
we haven't gone over yet in the other
series I mean we did go over basics of
styling and some of the basic components
like view and text but we haven't gone
over anything like navigation we haven't
gone over anything about touchable
highlights or in well I guess we did a
little bit of input stuff but we didn't
save any data we didn't hit an API we
didn't work with lists which is actually
something that's weird and react native
if you want to think of it as being
weird it's just different than normal
react and so in this video what I wanted
to do is get set up with our navigation
now navigation just like lists is
different than react for the web and
it's different in a lot of ways in fact
we don't have the same kind of react
router routing system that you would
typically be used to where you're
looking for a URL to determine your
location now or using links in fact
we're not using anything like that at
all and because of that the idea around
navigation within react native can
really be confusing for people just
starting out now here we have our App KS
file and we're going to be using a react
navigation platform called react -
navigation we're using this because this
is the one that Expo is works best with
I've also used it I think it's react -
native - navigation by Wix which is
super nice however doesn't work with an
X
though it's not a big deal because
honestly this one works it very well as
well if I had one major complaint about
react native as a whole it would be the
entire landscape of navigation platforms
although it has gotten significantly
better so let's go ahead and head to our
terminal and I'm gonna open up a new tab
here I'm gonna let's move this over and
now you'll want to make sure that you
are in your application directory before
you go and install something and we're
gonna do NPM install react - navigation
- - save now you might be wondering hey
you said not to use NPM well that's not
necessarily the case overall what we did
need is we need a yarn to be installed
so that react create react native app
could grab the dependencies but after
you know that whole process is done we
can use NPM just fine here this is gonna
work just a ok if you want to continue
to use yarn here that is 100% cool - the
main reason I use NPM is just a muscle
memory at this point so I want to click
enter here react - navigation - - save
and let this install into our app ok now
that we have this installed let's head
back to our app and import the stack
navigator now I'm in app is which is
really the only file we have right now
and instead of here from here we're
going to import a stack navigate tour ok
navigator stack navigator from and if
you could guess its react - navigation
navigation ok so check it out we now
have stack navigator being imported into
our application at this point the
simulator will unable to resolve module
now you'll occasionally get errors like
this this is a cannot find the node
module react native scripts been CRNA
entry yeah you may occasionally get
errors like this and and that's part of
the problem with well react native is
that there's so much complex stuff going
on that occasionally get a big red error
that is not your fault so in this case
what we want to do is
head to our terminal here I'm gonna
close out of this tab here says it
failed building yeah it wants us to run
npm install inside of our project now
this could have been a symptom of using
the npm just now so i'm going to go
ahead and run npm install again react
native is touchy so one of those things
that when you're working in these
projects you kind of have to have a
certain amount of expectations that
you're gonna be seeing some read some of
which may be fixed by running an npm
install some of which may be fixed by
simply stopping the bundler and
rerunning it and to be honest those are
a handful of tools whenever you hit a
big old error that makes no sense
the third step there is just undo the
code that you did until it works so with
react native again you kind of gotta
expect a little bit of red here as
growing pains as you start to get ready
okay and now that is installed you might
think that this hey this air is gonna go
away and let's see we're building our
bundle and it looks like we're good once
again we have hello so it looks like all
we needed to do was simply run npm
install and like i mentioned that could
have been a result of us not using yarn
to install this it could just be because
react native is temperamental okay
so we have our hello let's go ahead and
now get our stack navigator all set up
so what we need to do here is actually
use this navigator now now although I'm
only talking about stack navigator as it
is there's a lot of different kinds of
other navigators as well in this react
navigation pack but for now what you
need to know is stack navigation well we
have a main screen and then if you want
to browse to another screen well this
stack is sort of the next one in the
stack or at least it goes to the next
page in which you'll have a back arrow
you could pull it back with a gesture or
that kind of thing so stack navigator is
definitely the most like a link system
that you're used to within any sort of
other platform now let's go ahead and
let's simply set
our actual navigation the first thing
you want to do is export the Navigator
instead of our app okay right now we're
exporting our default app component so
let's get rid of this export default and
let's put it at the bottom here we're
gonna export default but instead of
exporting a default app class we're
going to export a default stack
navigator now stack navigator is a
function that accepts an object and
inside of this object we're going to be
giving it some different home screens or
different screens so to say so basically
we want to define a screen in this case
we could say hey our home screen the
word home here is not necessarily
important it's just the first item and
inside this property is another object
in which it's going to take a screen
property the screen property is going to
be the actual react component that you
want to be on this particular screen now
keep in mind this is not a web router
this doesn't work like react native you
have different screens you have your
home screen we're gonna have a detail
screen a post screen that sort of stuff
so we're gonna have the screen and now
the screen accepts a component if you
remember we had our app component up top
here so we can say hey the home screen
is going to be the screen app now if I
save this let's see what happens here
because well we should be using the
stack navigator keep in mind that the
only reason our application renders the
way it does is through the default
export and these tech navigators
technically outputting a react component
so export default stack Navigator is
going to tell us that hey the very first
screen is the app so let's check it out
in our simulator and hey this changed a
little bit now how did it change we get
a top bar up top here okay so this is
pretty darn cool and although it may not
seem like anything major in the next
video what we're gonna be doing is
customizing this top bar quite a little
bit to give you some ideas about what's
going on
this because up top here is essentially
showing us that we are now have some
sort of header with our navigation this
sort of status bar this header style
this sort of thing comes through the
Navigator and although it's blank and
gray it won't be for long
if you were to breathe if you were to
view this on Android it would be very
very similar just more of the material
design style now I am going to be having
the iOS simulator open for most of this
series but I encourage you to check the
app throughout in the Android emulator
as well just so I don't have to be
running them all so the Android emulator
takes up more CPU so while screen
recording it's not necessarily as ideal
but I do have Android phones at home
that I'm checking these apps on all the
time through Expo so if you do have
anything like that around it could be a
fun time to get your app actually on a
real device so check it out we have now
added our navigator
we aren't doing any sort of navigation
yet but that will come very soon and so
in the next video we're going to be
styling and talking a little bit about
our navigation header and then we're
actually going to get ourselves
navigating to another page as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
you want to complete this series head on
over to level up tutorials comm for its
Ice tour and you can purchase a series
outright you can even grab it in a combo
pack with react native for everyone if
you want the basics and the intermediate
all in one go so thanks so much for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
