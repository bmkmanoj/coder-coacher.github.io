up tuts and today we're gonna continue
our bolt series and what we're going to
do today is create our first theme and
so the theme that bolt uses by default
is actually called base - 2013 so it's
the base theme for 2013 so what we're
going to do first is we're going to
create our own theme and we're going to
use that for this site it's gonna be
awesome okay
so one thing we want to do first is I
want to go to my finder and then I'm
gonna browse to the site directory and
in here under theme if you open this
down you'll see base 2013 and what I'm
going to do is just copy this and now
that's copied I'm going to call this
level up and here we have a theme so now
if I go into sublime text let's make
this fit you can see that I have this
level up theme and it has all these
files in it that are dot twig extension
and don't be worried about the dot twig
because it's really just a form of an
HTML document that uses some templating
tags so it's going to be using these
curly brackets here to denote when
you're going to it use some data so what
these twig files are is really it's a
templating language it makes it easier
to code sites than just straight-up PHP
and if you've used something like
expression engine before you may be
really you know totally experienced with
this type of interface or this type of
templating language and it's the same
thing that you can find in all sorts of
other frameworks and CMS's so it's a
good time to get used to it and we're
going to go over how to do twig template
files in future tutorials however since
we did just copy this theme you know
it's worth we should probably change it
so we can tell if we're actually using
this theme or not when we set a new one
so let's go to style sheets right here
and in the app CSS you'll notice there's
two other ones foundation and foundation
min this is using the ZURB foundation so
they have
default styles and that provides some
default in you know functionality their
grid framework and stuff like that you
can always check out Serbs foundation
and I believe this is foundation three
they just recently released a foundation
for this shouldn't matter much you can
check out their documentation to see
exactly what's available but let's do
something interesting so that it's not
so we know it's not using this we're
just gonna change the font family to
Helvetica and that's not really that
interesting but it'll make it pretty
obvious that we're not using this old
theme anymore once we tell it a new
theme so I'm gonna go through here and
I'm also going to just add a background
color to the body and this one is this
f8f8f8 and you can see it's sort of this
creamy greyish white that's in the
background here we're just gonna set
this to super ugly blue for one second
just so we can make sure that we're
using the right theme here so we have
our theme it's named LevelUp it's right
here how do we enable this theme well
your wonder when I click on app and then
config and then it config Diet yml and
in here you can see a bunch of bunch of
cool stuff while we're in here we're
actually going to change the name of the
website to level of bolts and the
amazing payoff goes here of course we'll
leave that and it so if you scroll down
a little bit you'll see a theme and all
you needed here is the name of your
theme so ours was just love a lock all
one word just like that and if we save
this come back to our site if we refresh
you notice that we now have this hideous
blue background and our headlines
everything's Helvetica so we're now
using our own theme
so that's it this is an ugly result
we're gonna make it cooler in the next
video but we have our own theme we're
using our own theme and even though
we're relying on some of the styles from
the past theme it's still a brand new
theme and once we nuke it out or write
our own code it's going to be looking
like a real website look how we want to
do so as always this is got with love
love tubs if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video or
hit us up at Twitter LevelUp tuts let us
know what you're thinking let's know do
you want to see any of that stuff and
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
