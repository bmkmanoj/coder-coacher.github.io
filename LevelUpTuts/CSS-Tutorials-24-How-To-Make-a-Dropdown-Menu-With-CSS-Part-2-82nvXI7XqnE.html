of Tut's and today we're gonna continue
our CSS drop down and keep in mind I'm
just gonna really slow with this because
I want to hit every single point so you
really understand exactly what the CSS
is doing to make this menu working so
here we're actually going to have a
working drop down menu at the end of
this video okay so follow along and keep
going well now one more thing we have to
do here is we need to make these links
actually drop down so what we want to do
is we want to say that these this entire
unordered list here now have UL li UL we
want to say display not at night we
wanted to say display none that gets rid
of it and now we can say on the nav UL
li so what we can add a colon hover so
so saying when you hover over a list
item it's going to do something and
we're going to say the child unordered
list we want it to display block so what
this is really doing it's hiding it
however when we hover over this list
item the unordered list that's
immediately within it is going to be
displayed block so let's come back to
our site refresh you'll now notice when
I hover over this our link show up and
there's still a whole lot of funkiness
and I'm gonna tell you why so there's
just one more thing and if you could
guess what it is we need to position
this unordered list absolutely so that
it's not within this hole it's not
disrupting the flow of the document here
so we're going to say that these
unordered lists that are also display
done have a position:absolute and we
need their containers these list items
the nav Li the first level items we need
those to have a position:relative not
petting
right so to clear this up a little bit
we say our first love oh okay and then
starting right here is our second level
perfect and let's come back to our
document now that we have to position
absolutely to this item now we are going
to want to start telling these where
exactly to position and it looks like we
need a background color on these as well
so let's do that let's add a background
color of three three three and and we
need to declare exactly where these are
going to be so we gave them a
position:absolute so we want to say from
the top they're going to be 42 pixels
and we are doing this relative to this
list item right here so when you
position things absolutely you've
probably watched our video if you
haven't when you are wrapping something
that's positioned absolutely in a
position relative it's going to position
relative to that item instead of
relative to the document itself
so 42 pixels because that is the height
of our buttons of our first level
buttons so that's where I got this
number 42 I'm also going to give this a
margin of 0 and padding of 0 refresh ok
here we are I hover over and we have our
drop down menu notice how this is
supremely basic but it's working totally
functioning and looks pretty good for 6
minutes or however long this video was
now if we want this UL to be some sort
of a wrapper or something we could say
we can have this child selector here and
this is going to say that the UL
immediately in the nav will have a
margin of 0 and auto
this is going to have a width of 80%
check it out
we now have a nice-looking drop-down
menu well as always if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment on
the video or hit us up at Twitter
LevelUp Tut's as always we love hearing
from you
we're also on Facebook whatever just let
us know what you're thinking and thanks
for watching
