up tubs and today I'm going to show you
how to modify the preferences in your
sublime text too
so one of the things you might have done
is open up sublime text click on the
name here and see that under preferences
we have all these different things more
than just settings there's color schemes
or whatever if you have text mate your
color schemes from textmate are going to
show up here and you won't see package
settings I have that Biggs I have
something called package control install
will tell you more about that once I
give you the video on package control
but let's go into settings default so
you notice we have this file here and
this format might look familiar with
might look familiar to you as a
JavaScript object a JSON file and really
what this is is every single type of
preference there is in sublime text that
you could modify from your color scheme
to the default size of your font so it
starts off as 10 with the font face you
can change what font it uses however you
know you want to use a mono spaced font
you could change the margin here the
gutter you can change all sorts of stuff
you could turn on spell checking by
default and what you could do is you
could come in here if you wanted let's
say to have let's let's find something
that's going to be obvious so if we come
down here this preview on click says
true what happens if we set this to
false and what this is is in the last
lesson when you click down a file here
it popped up in your View window notice
how I've already saved this JSON file
I'll click on any of these and it's not
updating our window if I go in here and
change this to true save it again click
on one of these now it's changing the
window here so that's really great it's
nice and easy
but you may have noticed if an update
was released to sublime text all of your
preferences that you would have set
would have already been changed and it
might be you know you would know why
well because this is
sublimes preferences this is the
preferences for the application and if
you were to read the paragraph at the
very top it would say do put your
preferences in the user preferences file
this that file is not going to get
overwritten once a sublime text updates
so what you're going to go ahead and do
is copy this I'm going to change is
preview and click and I'm going to go to
preferences and then settings user and
you'll notice the only thing in here is
font size 23 we're going to put a comma
after that and they're going to paste in
preview on click true and I'm going to
set this to false anything that you have
in this file Oh
add extra comma anything that you have
in this file is going to overwrite
sublime settings so okay I save this now
let's click here and you can see this
preview and click is not working change
it back to true save it
alright now it's working again okay so
this is how you modify preferences in
sublime text to and if you want you're
going to want to grab this this
commented out code here because what
this is going to do is later when you
need to edit this stuff again it's going
to help you remember exactly what you
have here so this is where you modify
your preferences there is no user
interface for it like you might be used
to however it's really not a bad system
and you can get anything you want
changed I will just pop through this a
sublime text settings file and see
everything that you can do different
because you might not even know of some
of the options that you have until you
look through here ok well that does it
for modifying preferences in sublime
text to let me know if you have any
problems with that if you have any
questions you can always hit us up at
twitter level up tuts or my twitter is a
test olenski and we now have facebook as
you can see on our level of Tufts
YouTube page also quick notice I like to
give these just short speeches at some
point in the new series all these videos
are made at our own free time I get home
from work and I add dry I try to get
these tutorials up because I know
that people want to see these so if
you're learning some things for two
something from these tutorials and maybe
you've learned a skill and you've made
some money off of it you know feel free
to to donate and you don't have to
donate by all means I want to keep these
videos free but I am doing the same is
in my spare time so donations out
absolutely don't hurt LevelUp Tut's in
any way in fact they'll just allow us to
keep on producing more and more also the
other developer Ben who you may have
heard from the expression engine and the
he had done like two WordPress tutorials
before he ended up getting swamped with
work so he hasn't been able to produce
any videos for a little bit but I just
got word that he's going to be back in
action and there's going to be more
expression engine videos and more
WordPress videos in the very near future
so as always with level up tuts thanks
