up Tut's and today we're going to be
installing Drupal on your local machine
what I'm going to be using today is zamp
or xampp you can also use MAMP
the instructions are really similar I'm
not a Natchitoches of course so um if
you're using Windows you know you can
sort of follow along and the
instructions are very similar so what
we're going to do is we're on drupal.org
here first we're going to download so
you go download and extend download
Drupal find the latest version I'm just
going to grab the zip and down here my
downloads alright when it's done unzip
it ok so I'm going to put it in exam
there's your folder and htdocs' so I'm
going to drag this Drupal 7 - or yeah
7.1 whatever 7.1 - so I'm going to drag
this down here and we can just rename
this um so this just can be short for
whatever your name is
whatever your website's name is I'm just
going to call mine St for my name so st
alright in the the main reason we want
to drag the whole folder and instead of
instead of just copying the contents of
the folder is because this contains
hidden files and you can actually see
hidden files by default in finder so um
like there's a htaccess file that does a
lot of your drupal site that you'll want
to make sure is in your folder if you're
having some weird problems always make
sure that you made sure that you copy
the whole folder instead of just the
contents so now that we have that there
the next thing we need is a database so
I'm going to go here to PHP myadmin
if you're using an exam you can get to
it through PHP myadmin here on the side
and we're going to create a new database
I'm just going to call this d7
underscore ST it's created ok so now if
we browse to our localhost and the
folder st we are going to let's see
localhost
st
all right so you get to the installation
screen before we run the Installer you
need to actually set up a couple more
things first one of which I want to have
transmitted for just to set permissions
you can use it basically I think you
know you could pretty much use use
terminal finder I just like transmits
interface for setting permission so I'm
just going to show with that so in your
folder here under sites and then there
default you have this default settings
that PHP what you're going to need to do
is duplicate that file and then you're
going to rename this to just be settings
that PHP don't just change the settings
that are default settings that PHP and
deleting this one because Drupal
actually needs both of those files so
you're going to want the setting this
file to be able to be written so over
here and transmitted I'm just going to
browse to that location sites default
settings dot PHP and then I just did a
command I to bring up the info and we're
going to change this to 666 okay so so
that Drupal can write to this file so
we'll also need a files folder within
our default folder so just in here we're
going to make a new folder called files
that in here and then we want this to us
will be writable so we're going to give
this 777 why okay so now we should be
ready to install Drupal if we come up to
here go back to our localhost and then
browse to the directory you have your
files in it's going to automatically
take you to install that PHP so we're
going to select standard we're going to
click Save and continue okay now it's
going to ask for your database
information if you remembered we named
ours d7 underscore st you could have
named yours whatever you would like
and so for example username is root and
your database password is blank from
what I understand a forum amp I believe
it's root and then your password is also
root so now we're going to click Save
and continue and it's going to be
installing Drupal for us
okay so now that that's done it just as
for some set information that it will
you know propagate so that your site is
you know starts off usable so your set
name I'm going to call this Scott
talansky that's it's going to be a
personal site for myself so this is just
going to be my email address user name I
keep it as admin email address I'll use
my email address of course and then
password I'm going to make a super
secure password just so nobody can get
into my admin account it mess up my site
kept default country states okay and
time zone in its time zones fine for me
okay so I'm going to keep these checked
just so Drupal emails me about
notifications about modules nothing to
be updated or anything so click Save and
continue
and now Drupal has finished installing
so I'm going to visit our new site and
here it is and one more thing we want to
do before we're all done who is we want
to change that settings dot PHP file
back to being a six four four because
that way people can't access it right to
it make your site more secure all right
so we're all good there refresh and
here's your site you now have Drupal
installed on your localhost as always
thanks for watching and if you have any
questions please leave a comment below
this is Scott with level up tuts and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
