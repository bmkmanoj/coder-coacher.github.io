love tutorials and today is going to be
the start of a new video series I plan
to keep up once a month on level up
tutorials now what this is going to be
is essentially a video blog about what
I'm doing what's coming up next and just
sort of what I'm into right now so first
and foremost the most exciting news is
that level of tutorials has officially
hit 600 videos now i'm at 602 as of this
video and will be 603 for this video and
we're nearing 6 million views total so
thank you so much if you subscribed or
watch any of my videos I'm truly truly
grateful thank you and please let me
know what I can do to get better at
making these tutorials in the future
because of course one of these things
with this channel is that we want to
keep getting better all the time in
other exciting news I'm going to be
moving I'm gonna be moving from Michigan
to Denver Colorado's now I've never
lived anywhere other than the state of
Michigan so the whole Colorado
experience is going to be really
exciting although I don't know many
developers in the area so if you're in
the denver colorado area I'd be happy to
meet up and just chat about whatever
you're into what you're working on just
so I can get a handle on what developers
are on the area I'm also going to be
heading up to a lot of meetups when I
move out there in May so what's great
about this move is that I'm going to be
working remotely and what this is going
to do is it's going to allow me two
extra hours every single day to devote
to things like level up tutorials now
this is because i have an hour commute
both ways right now and i'm going to be
waking up quite a bit earlier in
colorado to maintain the same schedule
that I have with Michigan so I'm going
to have a lot more time at my disposal
to not only develop new courses but
improve the production quality on the
current level of tutorials courses and
even produce more content than before so
that's all really exciting news not only
for me but anybody who subscribes this
channel and wants to see more content
speaking of content let's talk about
some of the new tutorial series that are
coming in april now since i'm the only
person creating and planning these
series i have a lot of flexibility and
there is a chance that things may shift
slightly however the current plan is to
wrap up this meteors basic series that
I'm working
on right now and then I'm going to get
into angularjs basics if you haven't
used angular it's an awesome front-end
framework it's something that I use
every single day and my job so I'm very
familiar with working and angular so I
can hope I can help you remove any
insecurities you have about perhaps
getting started with a framework like
angular or maybe even clearing up some
confusions that you might have about it
because it's really easy to get started
with and it's going to change how you
develop websites now in addition I'm
going to continue the meteor series I'm
going to do a few more videos to wrap up
sort of how we work on sites and we can
deploy them and then I'm going to jump
in to some more stuff with stylus so
we're going to cover the G grid system
which is one of my favorite grid systems
for any CSS preprocessor because you can
actually use it with SAS or stylus so I
have used it with both of them and it's
something I really like so we're going
to be showing you all the good stuff
that there is to use with jeet just add
it to your stylus workflow now in
addition to that I'm going to be working
on a new sketch series where we take a
web design and we build it from scratch
a completely responsive mobile through
desktop and we talk about great ways to
organize your project to reuse assets
and even export your assets so that you
can use them when you start to build
this site so I'm really excited about
that in addition I'm also going to be
covering some content for the Drupal
folks who may have been feeling a little
bit left out with the lack of Drupal
content on this channel lately so we're
going to be doing an entirely new
theming and Drupal series where we're
going to cover several different sub
themes and we're going to be working on
a site design that said we're going to
show you how you can work in several
different sub themes to create the same
sort of content some of which are maybe
a little bit more assisted than others
since some of which may be offer a
little bit more for people who like to
get their hands in the code more than
working in a click click click sort of
interface so those are my really
exciting plans for April so keep
watching level up tutorials and that's
going to be covering through this coming
month now let's talk about what are some
things that I'm interested in right now
so my first pick of the month is
go to the stylist hyphen Lang calm it's
a completely redesigned version of the
stylist documentation so check it out
I'm gonna put a link to all of these
things in the video description but what
it really is is just a nicer version of
any sort of style of stocks because the
as you probably noticed when you were
working with stylist after watching your
videos the visual style and perhaps
clarity of the documentation wasn't
exactly the best so now it's got a great
style a great logo gray color scheme and
everything just is a lot easier to read
and sort of get around and we have this
nice menu on the side here to sort of
see exactly what we're getting into when
we want to search for things next is the
G grid system like I said I'd be doing a
tutorial series on how to use jeet with
stylist now if you're into sass uh and
you want to see a jeet series on SAS
please let me know the comments and I'll
also tackle that if it's something
you're into so jeet is a really great
grid system in the same sort of style
that something like Susie or singularity
these other grid systems where your grid
is being defined in your preprocessor in
your CSS instead of using HTML to say
like column one sort of thing and jeet
really allows for some really flexible
really nice grids and they have a great
looking website on top of that with a
really easy to read documentation
however some things might not be totally
obvious when getting started with G so
the the tutorial series that we're
planning on jeet is going to be just a
really good overview of how you can
build simple to complex grids using this
system now another thing is meteor as
you can tell I've been doing a lot of
media tutorials lately and really it's
because I just really like working in
meteor for a long time I've been working
in the mean stack with a note and
Express backend and angular on the front
end however the last four or five
projects I've started I find myself only
wanting to use meteor for them it's just
a really nice
system to work in and it's not too hard
to learn if you're curious about what
meteors capable of check out the level
of tutorial series on meteor for
everyone it's aimed up beginners so you
don't have to be scared about not
knowing the right javascript stuff to
work in it we're going to tackle
everything piece by piece so that you
can work in a system like this and feel
confident and as a quick overview meteor
it's essentially a full stack framework
to handle fernan back end all sorts of
stuff using what are essentially smaller
packages that are built by the meteor
team to interface with things like
MongoDB they have a view engine they
have a template engine and these are all
part of the meteor project it allows for
some really great modern interactive
sites to be built very very quickly it's
really exciting and awesome to use know
another thing I'm happy to show off is
the Q the new level of tutorials Q which
is can be found at Q that level of
tutorials com again i'll have the link
to this in the description of the video
but this just sort of allows you to see
what kind of series i'm thinking about
working on videos and stuff like that
now this is super rough so if you come
here and there's some weird styles or
something just doesn't look quite right
it's probably because I'm still working
on it and this is still under very much
of a beta or even an alpha I don't even
I don't have like a version number on it
but it's um it's something that I've
been using as a utility for myself for
these a past month or so and now you can
check it out and see what kind of series
are on my list or what's even on my
radar or anything like that but we have
some really great stuff here it's a
nicer to handle to get where I'm at and
where level of tutorials is going in the
future so this is just something I built
for fun and I've been using as a utility
for level of tutorials and now I'm ready
for people to perhaps start looking at
it but it's not really totally ready for
primetime yet so keep that in mind when
you're browsing around and clicking on
things if some things don't seem to work
quite right cool so those are the
technologies I'm really excited about
right now and just a quick glimpse add
some stuff I've been working on
and future video blogs we're going to
cover some more projects that I've been
working on and I might even dive into
some code just to show you what's going
on behind the scenes and maybe a little
bit of where my head's at via design or
development or any of that stuff thanks
for watching and you already have
another great month with the level of
tutorials but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
