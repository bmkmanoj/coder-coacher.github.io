up tuts
and today I'm going to be talking about
the screen options and other options
within creating a post now from our post
here that we created our first post we
can click Edit this post at the top here
so there's just edit here now from here
you can see exactly what we saw before
we have format categories tags and you
can click and drag these around to see
how you see fit where depending on where
you'd want them but what about some
extra stuff right seems like there
should be more stuff here well there is
in fact up top here out of the way we
have this screen options and in screen
options it gives you a bunch of things
that are not necessarily on the Edit
screen by default you can also even
choose the layout for instance if you
wanted this all to be in one big column
you could select this number of columns
to be one split it up into two you could
have a be two now let's just turn some
of the stuff on we have revisions
excerpt send Trackbacks custom fields
discussion comments slug and author now
let's see all of these things that we
just added here we scroll down it puts
them all down here in the main column of
course you could drag it and move it
wherever you'd like revisions just shows
the times that this was last updated so
it shows that this post was updated four
minutes ago and published 29 minutes ago
now we have an excerpt here and this
excerpt is as it says a handcrafted
summary of the content that you can use
in your theme so the thing is with
excerpts the theme itself this theme in
particular doesn't have any where where
this excerpt is going to be output
without modifying the theme so if you
type in here just know that you're going
to have to read some documentation to
find out how to give this excerpt to
actually print in your theme next we
have Trackbacks to send Trackbacks
so this is a way of letting legacy blog
systems know that you link to them
basically if you need to know what a
trackback is you probably know what it
is if not it's something that's worth
googling and this is you can just enter
the URLs within separating them by
spaces in here so if you need to add
Trackbacks this is how you
do it next we have custom fields which
again allows you to post extra metadata
in your theme but if your theme doesn't
have a way to output this metadata
nothing's going to show up so here you
could have a name and a value but that
doesn't mean anything's necessarily
going to show up on the front end of
your website if your theme doesn't call
for it next we have discussion these are
just some settings whether this
particular page allows trackbacks and
pingbacks or if it allows comments so if
you want a trackbacks and pingbacks or
you want comments make sure that these
are checked next we can add a comment
from the admin section itself simply
clicking this allows you to add a new
comment this way or it's going to show
you the comments that have recently been
posted on this content next we have the
slug which it is another way for the URL
slug right so it's the it's the text
that is no spaces lower case with
hyphens in it that is our URL so our
first post is slash our - first - post
for some reason if you needed to changes
you want to change this however it makes
a lot of sense for this to be the page
title so you're probably best off just
leaving this option and not not checked
now author allows you to change the
author of a piece of content maybe let's
say somebody wrote a piece of content
but you went in and created it for them
you'd want to be able to set this so
that they were the ones in fact that get
the credit for writing it now with all
of these you can you can make them small
like this to make them you know small
and out of the way you can throw them in
the right column but a lot of times it's
really you know some of this stuff your
content editors aren't going to need to
see so when we uncheck revisions excerpt
send Trackbacks custom fields discussion
comments Ludd author and even format and
then we can leave tags featured ID image
in category let's go ahead and update
this next time we create a new post
let's go to new post you'll notice that
those items are exactly what we told it
to be so WordPress remembers what your
screen options are so just make sure
that if you have all this stuff turned
that you want your content editors to
see that kind of stuff of course they
would need to have access to edit in the
first place but just be conscious of how
you want this edit page to be set up and
then a wordpress will remember that so
we've created our first post we've
edited it we use the screen options and
now we're ready to start creating pages
so in the next video we're going to
create pages and then we're going to
move on to some more advanced stuff so
as always this is Scott would love love
tuts if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment the
video and step at Twitter level up
