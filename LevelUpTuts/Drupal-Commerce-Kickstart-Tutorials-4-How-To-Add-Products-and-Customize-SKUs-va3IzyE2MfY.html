up tuts
and today
to do something that may seem like a
little bit
some people and may seem not basic for
others but we're going to just add a
product and we're gonna do that with
Conrad commerce kickstart too and so if
you are a site you know if you run a
site a Drupal site and you're not
necessarily a developer you might find
this useful and if you're a developer
new to Drupal and/or new to Drupal
commerce you might also find this useful
but if you're you know Drupal vet and
you know you can click through and sort
of know what you're doing you might not
find this as useful you could skip
forward but it's gonna be really simple
and we're going to add a product so the
first thing we want to do is click
products and then add a product and so
these are all the default product
variations that come in with kickstart 2
when you import all of the data like we
have in our installation and we're just
gonna add a top for now and we're gonna
call this level up T and we're gonna say
level up t-shirt and scroll down here
we get to add a new variation and so a
variation is just a type of product here
so we have our main product which is the
t-shirt and then each variation would be
little things like we're gonna say this
one's purple and a size medium and it's
1499 and I'm just gonna choose this
level of Tut's logo cuz I have really
really nothing else to use here which is
it's not a picture of a t-shirt or
anything but it's gonna do and so let's
save this variation and let's click and
add a new one and notice how when I
click to save variation it didn't take
us out of this product it saved us in
here so we could add more variations and
you can keep adding variations until all
of the different versions of your
product that you have are are in the
site so we also have a medium black
shirt that's $14.99 and I'm just gonna
save this last variation and here we
have three variations so now that that's
all set we can choose this collection
which these have been pre-made for us
however in later videos we'll make our
own we're gonna say this is to wear
a t-shirt it's unisex and there's no
brand so let's click save and this is
our product perfect just what we wanted
and what's really cool is that there's a
selected color based in and default
using this module that's in the commerce
kickstart 2 we have this color picker so
your users get to pick buy something it
looks like maybe a feature that you've
seen out a little bit more standard
store where you can click the color and
have the color show up so that's great
and it looks really good we can add it
to our cart here and just the 8 little
windows gonna eat Jackson here and pop
up and one thing I want you notice is
this SKU so this SKU even though the
contrast on this side really bad you can
still read it it says level up T and
then purple medium so that's okay but we
had asked you already created for this
let's click to edit this product and
let's scroll down here and let's click
Edit here because you see your excuse in
here but it doesn't give us an option to
change it well what we're going to do is
we want to come in to variation types
and we're gonna go to tops and we're
gonna click Edit in here you'll find
that automatically generates Q has been
checked
notice how when you check this it gives
you all these tokens if you're used to
working with tokens you can change this
so it grabs this information just sort
of how this is grabbing the the converse
product title you can have it grab
anything to automatically generate the
SKU however we don't want to
automatically generate the SKU so we're
gonna uncheck that completely and save
this project variation type
let's click out of this window and let's
click Edit again on our t-shirt now if
we scroll down I'm gonna click Edit on
this particular variation and you'll
notice SKU is no available to edit and
I'm gonna name this SKU level up 2001
for no reason in particular but it's
just asked you so let's save it
and here we are with our skew that we
typed in ourselves and we didn't have to
have this automatically generate one for
us and here's their product so as always
this is Scott with level up Tut's if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment on the video or hit us up at
Twitter our level of Tut's in the next
few videos we're going to go over
everything it takes to build your own
products from your own product types to
your own variation types and all sorts
of cool stuff and we're gonna throw it
into this store and thanks for watching
