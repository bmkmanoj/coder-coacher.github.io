tuts and today we're gonna continue our
html5 series by talking about figure and
fig caption now figure is an element for
content that's essential to the
understanding of the content the main
content on the page but might not be in
the necessary flow of the document so
you know figure could be used a lot for
an image with a caption or maybe a table
with a caption or something you could
even use it for code examples things
like that so in this article we're going
to add an image that has a caption
underneath it
so let's actually put this just
underneath our header before a paragraph
and this is going to just be figure and
and now instead of our figure we can
have an image and I'm actually just
grabbing a placeholder image and we're
also going to have a caption for this so
right underneath the image itself within
the figure tag we're gonna write big
caption and this figure caption you can
just put text in here a nice animal
picture and maybe this is information
about who took the photo with a link to
their portfolio or something this is
right now is just describing the picture
now let's go to our page and refresh you
notice here's our animal and picture and
here's our heading a nice animal picture
we can look in our code here we have our
figure figcaption so what this is really
doing is telling the browser and telling
search engines anything that's
understanding your site really that this
image in this caption they're related
and more importantly that they're
related to the content within this
article and they might not necessarily
be in the flow of this article maybe on
a normal page this content is in the
sidebar but it is saying that it is a
part of the main content regardless of
it's in the flow of the document or not
so let's add another example and let's
show you how you can actually use a
figcaption to describe
a few images within a figure tag and now
I'm actually going to modify the size of
these images and then go ahead and
change this one to two so that they show
up as different animals here I'll
refresh we know these three pictures and
this caption is going to be relating all
of these images so you can certainly
nest more images than one within a
figure tag it just means that the figure
caption has to do with all of the images
itself now like I said you can use
figure to rep you know lines of code and
then have a caption describing that code
maybe the licensing you can use figure
to wrap a canvass maybe SVG something so
you can use figure for lots of things it
really is just saying that the content
is essential to the document to the
understanding of the document whereas
with something like a side the a side
content is not really essential to the
document itself great well let me know
if you have any questions leave a come
in the video I just up at Twitter level
of tuts let us know what you think in
we'd love to hear from you as always
this is Scott with level up nuts and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
