up tutorials and in this video we're
going to introduce animations into our
application it's going to be really
great we can animate when we add new
resolutions when we delete new
resolutions and much more so let's get
started on that now
okay so we've got this thing working
really well let's add some niceties to
it now we're secure and we have some
nice user experience things but what we
really want is some cool animations
because seriously that's what we all
want we all want cool animations so
let's actually head to our our
resolutions wrapper and let me open up
that and find the resolutions wrapper
here we go and what we want to do is we
want to animate every single time one of
these resolutions is added into our
application here every time we add a new
one instead of having it just pop into
the screen let's have it do a nice
little fade in
so let's actually head to our command
line first because what we need is we
need a react package I'm gonna open up a
new tab I'm going to change directories
to the root of my site and I'm going to
npm install - - save it now this is a
long one it's react - add-ons - CSS -
transition
- group now this is an official react
package that allows us to do some really
great CSS animations really in the vein
of if you've ever used the ng animations
so like angular animations where it adds
a class when something's loaded when
something is done loading when
something's about to leave and when
something's live leaving and stuff like
that
it just adds a bunch of classes during
any given point where you'd want to add
an animation let's go ahead and install
this okay so we now have a CSS
transition group I'm going to go in and
just copy this whole thing this whole
react transition group so we don't have
to write that again let's head to the
top of our page and let's import this
thing so we can import in import and we
want to import react CSS transition yes
well this correctly transition group
from and then we can just go ahead and
paste in that react - add-ons okay so we
want this rekt transition group let's
make sure that this found list make sure
I didn't spell anything incorrectly
would tell you here if you did let's
come back we now have access to react
CSS transition group what this is is a
react component that will wrap around
your stuff so let's head here and I'm
gonna use this like so I'm gonna put
this react CSS transitions group here
I'm going to put another one just below
this I'm gonna close this out here like
that okay cool and this is going to take
a bunch of properties for instance let's
go in and just hit enter because the
properties for this are stuff we're
gonna want to use the properties for the
sir stuff we're gonna want to see for
instance the first one is transition
name and now transition name is going to
be what's used in your class now I
actually wrote some CSS for this already
we're gonna go over that in great detail
but I want to make sure I get the right
name based on the CSS that I have here
let's scroll up here so we have a
resolution &amp;amp; Turf a resolution load here
so resolution load is the class I'll go
over what's going on here in a minute we
can say the transition name is just
going to be resolution load now let's
have another line and it's gonna be
expecting some things so we're going to
say transition and then enter time out
and this is how long this transition is
going to take right this is how long
your animation is going to take so again
let's consult the Styles because I have
these taking a certain amount of time I
have the enter taking point zero six
seconds so that is 600 milliseconds here
like that and that's the timeout for the
enter that's how long it should take to
enter now if you can imagine we're going
to need a transition leave
as well which actually it is a different
time I believe I had it as for yeah so I
had it as for so this is 400 here
cool so let's save this we now have
transition enter timeout transition
enter leave and let's refresh and check
this out nice so I have this set up with
CSS and it's gonna happen really super
quickly so I can't show you necessarily
what's going on in the classes but let's
go ahead and just add a new one of jump
around all right
let's enter and beautiful you see that
slide in there awesome so that's really
what we want and when we delete one it
fades out the other way man that's good
okay so let's check out what's going on
there when it's loading it's hitting it
this enter and when it's leaving like
it's being deleted it's hitting this
leave now what this does is it triggers
a class so we have the transition name
as resolution load so let's head to my
CSS you'll notice that I'm saying when
this gets a class of resolution load -
enter when it gets that class then run
this animation the animation is slide in
and it's going to give this a cubic
Bezier for the easing function and the
slide in let's scroll down is actually
opacity 0 transform a translate 3d super
cool actually let's get rid of this
opacity on here right now like that so
we just have just the animation and the
opacity is getting said in the animation
let's make sure that this in fact works
how we wanted to there we go I saw a
little jump in opacity when I added one
so we can now just say do handstands
these are all things I like to do by the
way and now there's no little jump I
think there was something weird with a
transition on this that was causing that
little flicker and I think that might
have been setting the opacity on the
enter but now you can see it works great
and likewise so when it gets that class
it runs that animation ok so as it's
entering it's getting this class and
then after it's done being entered
like after it shows up on the page
this class is gone and the animation is
taking the exact length of the animation
so we don't have to worry about it
running multiple times now let's check
out the leave animation of which I also
kind of want to just make this like that
okay so let's make sure this works as
well too but the resolution that load
remembers the name of the animation and
when it gets the class of leave it's
gonna take point zero four it's going to
take point four seconds to a slide out
now slide out is just setting the
opacity from 1 to zero and transforming
it to 50 pixels to the right you might
be wondering why use translate3d if you
don't know too much about transforms it
using translate 3d actually enables the
graphics processor so your animations
are gonna be smoother if you're doing
translating or transforming any of kind
that for that matter
okay so we have slide out let's make
sure this works perfectly cool although
I do want to dance in my office so I'm
gonna add that back cool wow that I mean
that's just really super nice right I
mean that just adds so much to this
application that didn't exist before you
loaded that fades in that's I mean
that's great and in reality how how much
did that take us to add here we just had
this react CSS transitions group we gave
it some times for animation we gave it a
name and if you wanted to use an
animation library that already has these
animations program for you then use an
animation library and then you could
just drop in those animations there's
tons of animation libraries out there
for CSS it's super cool and if you use
like a sass or a stylus based one that
you'd be able to really easily
integrated it with this resolution with
your class - leave or your class - enter
and I personally like to write a lot of
animations myself so I write these by
hand but you certainly don't have to if
you're interested more in CSS animations
I have a premium series called
next-level CSS animations and
transitions it teaches you a lot about
building only smooth animations but
teaches you about things like the Bezier
curves
just nice ways to do things in animation
so check that out if you're interested
in learning more about animations okay
so this is pretty cool but we have this
sort of extraneous tag that's sitting
within a UL let's actually check out
something that's really cool that we can
do here
we can get rid of this ul first thing I
want to do is I want to grab this class
name of resolutions then I'm just going
to delete this unordered list entirely
from the face of the earth now I can
have the class name on the transition
group I can also specify what the
transition group component should be so
we can say component is equal to and
then this is a string I'm just gonna
have an unordered list so now this
transition group acts as an unordered
list but it still does all of the stuff
that we wanted to do as the transition
group and it even has the class name we
want so our site looks and functions
just the way it does we don't have any
extraneous elements sitting around where
we don't need them amazing right so this
is animations using a react CSS
transition group now I'm not done here
in the next video I'm gonna show you
could use these transition groups to
actually animate your pages while we do
page transitions we want to have
something when you go from about two
resolutions I mean that should be pretty
cool right so I'm gonna show you in the
next video how we can use the react CSS
transition animation group to be able to
animate when a page loads itself so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you want to gain more react
meteor knowledge there are exclusive
videos in this series that you can only
get from purchasing at store that level
up tutorials calm along with all of the
code examples from all of these other
videos so you can check your code
against every single video especially if
you have any problems make sure
everything looks the exact same the only
thing I don't recommend doing is copying
and pasting that code because you want
to get your hands used to writing it and
get used to understanding the possible
issues that could come up whenever you
do face a problem I think one of the
most important things when learning and
this stuff is making lots of mistakes
getting error messages reading those
error messages and fixing them because
that's how that stuff's gonna get burned
into your brain so as always this is
Scott with level up to tour
have any questions or comments if you
come in the video harm yep a Twitter or
Facebook at level up tutorials love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
