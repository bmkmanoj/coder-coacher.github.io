tutorials and in this video we're gonna
be showing you some of the plugins and
themes for oh my fish which is sort of a
framework for fish shell that allows you
to do some really cool stuff now there's
a whole bunch of packages and themes so
we can't nearly show you them all but
I'll put a link to the main repository
for these in the description of the
video and then that way you can check
out all the plugins and themes yourself
so let's get going on that right now
so now that we have fish and oh my fish
installed let's actually get to using
some of these extensions packages and
themes of that nature so I'm gonna post
a link to this page in the description
of the video and you can check it out
for yourself but you can see there's a
whole bunch of repositories several
pages of them in fact of different
themes and different plugins now if you
want to see what sort of themes are even
available we could just simply type OMF
theme no s here it's wanting to
autocomplete that so we can say OMF
theme and as you can see we have all of
these at different themes now let's go
ahead and just try to roll one on here
one of the themes I use a lot is toaster
so we can do OMF theme and then toaster
and as you can see it's already
installed this theme we have a dollar
sign here and it looks really nice the
colors it changes the colors a little
bit it sort of changes the command
prompt but let's actually go inside of a
a site so let's go to my sites folder
and let's go into a site that's
associated with a git repository here so
as you can see when we're using this we
actually get what sort of we actually
get that it's using it get there we have
a colon we have this the branch name
right here and we have a little status
indicator let's go ahead and type OMF
theme once more let's grab something
else and let's go ahead and try om F
theme trout okay so as you can see they
get a little bit different right so we
now have this theme that has some
information over here on the right side
it tells us what our directory is this
has some of our let's say this is our
git branch so our branch is number seven
then we have this like star indicator
right here so as you can see we could
really quickly change these themes but
right now we have no way of really
telling what they look like without
coming in here and let's say we could
search for a theme let's go to theme
dangerous and let's see as you can see
this is what theme dangerous looks like
and it's nice that they actually have
sort of an animated image here an
animated gif of this working so let's
actually go and install this one and as
you can see this actually has some
information here it says to set VI mode
enabled so we can go ahead and do that
now to set this theme we can set it with
OMF theme and then dangerous now if
you'll notice in the repo it's named
theme - dangerous we just need the
dangerous part of that and you can see
it's going to install it and it's
successfully installed and as you can
see we have some nice theme dangerous
going on here if we change directory
once more into this into this file you
can see we now get the file location
over here on the right before we were
just in my user directory and once we
move in to the repository you can see
that we get the branch information as
well so we can set our colors using this
set dangerous colors or we can simply
just type something like day or night
and as you can see it changes the colors
here it's very subtle but it changes
them a little bit you can see it mostly
in this green check mark here okay so
let's go and install a package while
we're here and let's go to a sublime
text plug-in there's one that
essentially just allows you to open any
file that you're looking at in sublime
so this is plug-in sublime you could see
on the plugins so there's this OMF
install sublime we can go ahead and just
paste that in here it's going to install
the sublime package now we're inside of
this let's go ahead and open this
index.html file using this
package so from here we can just type su
BL and then index.html and as you can
see it opens up sublime text which is
not previously open and open this file
so that's just one of many packages such
as one of many plugins and themes that
are available for oh my fish here so you
can come here and check out all of these
suite plugins and upgrade your
command-line shell so as always this is
