up Tut's and today we're going to be
going over two really cool pseudo
elements and what they are is before and
after and they allow you to insert
things before and after your code in any
given item really the only downside to
this is that it doesn't work in IE 7 m
and lower so you're going to want to
maybe follow both the rules of
progressive enhancement and have the
site looking good for those clients that
are on 7 or whatever you support and
then you know maybe the people who have
the more modern browsers might get a
little bit nicer looking site but so one
of the cool things about before and
after is that they're they're just a
little bit different than what we've
done before and before we added
something like hover to end effect when
you rollover before and after is
inserting content so let's say we want
every single list item on the site in
front of it to have a right angle quote
okay
so I'm going to do list item and then
colon before and then in my brackets
here I'm going to say content colon and
then here is the hexadecimal code for a
right and Gold quote I will post this
link in the video but here's a really
helpful Unicode code converter and you
might be familiar with HTML and XML
entities but those aren't going to work
in CSS so what we're going to want to
use is this hexadecimal code and it's
going to render fun so now if we have
this this code here we can save this I'm
actually going to give this font size of
let's say 20 pixels just so it stands
out and let's check out our site
and as you can see before every single
list item not only do we have the actual
list item list style we also have this
right and cold quote that goes directly
before the Li and it happens on every
single one well even if we wanted to we
could say let's change us to paragraph
now every single paragraph before it
instead is going to have that right
ankle quote in front of it
then this can be useful for something
like this where it's just adding some
Flair really and but what you're not
going to want to do is get into
situations where you're writing let's
just say let's say put a word here right
because now we have this word item that
appears before all of them and let's say
that's something we really wanted to do
for some reason
well this code here isn't part of your
HTML and it's not really following the
principles that you have CSS for in the
beginning you want to keep your styles
and your content separate well 8 while
CSS really gives you an opportunity to
add content to your code with CSS here
you're not going to want to add a whole
lot of content here because it's not
going to it's it's you want to keep your
your styles and your content separate so
that's why I think it's really useful
for something like adding a right-angle
quote or add just adding maybe something
after your code and after works the same
way I should illustrate that as well
after and let's just uh let's just put a
word OK and refresh now you get word
after every single paragraph okay so
what else can before and after do well
it can allow you to do some really cool
effects if you used in an interesting
way see one thing about before and after
is that we have to have this content for
it to work however we don't have to have
anything in that content if we delete it
and we just have an empty content here
we can do all sorts of stuff
you
so let's see something a little bit more
thing we can do with this so I'm going
to add this to our main actually let's
send this to all of the paragraphs and
first I'm going to say for all the
paragraphs you're going to get a
background color of blue because we like
that and a color of white okay and what
we're going to do for after these
paragraphs is we're going to give this a
shape on the side of it okay what we
want to do is we want to get rid of this
font size because we're not going to be
using that for this this and it's going
to be this will be a hilarious example
because right now we just don't know
enough to do anything really cool with
this but and the future it's going to
have a opening for some really
interesting great CSS techniques that
you'll be using to just have great
effects so we're going to just give this
a height go by height of 40 pixels we're
going to give this a width of 40 pixels
and we're going to give this a display
block and we're going to give this a
background of yellow because we like
this to look hideous okay
now that should be good and you know
what I'm going to give it a
position:relative if you recall before
this is going to position this
relatively to the paragraph and we're
going to say it's going to be right by
negative 10 pixels just so we can see it
okay and now let's come to our page
refresh and so here are these yellow
boxes that we've created by saying after
the paragraph here's your yellow box
okay so now this might seem a totally
useless to you um and I promise it's
going to be really cool we're going to
be able to create some great shapes of
something a little bit more complex but
once we get into how you do things like
CSS triangles and stuff it'll all make a
little bit more sense how this can be
useful to you but just experiment with
before and after and see what you can
come up with okay as always if you have
any questions please leave a comment on
the video hit us up at twitter level of
touch
you're thinking once again this is Scott
