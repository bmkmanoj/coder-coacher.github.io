little tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be writing our second chart which
is going to be a bar graph now we're
gonna do this one from scratch to see
how much that we remembered about
writing our first chart so let's get
going on that now okay so to go along
with the challenge that I presented you
in the last video I want you to
experiment here now we have let line
chart equal new chart now what we're
gonna do is sort of experiment this a
little bit I'm gonna leave this get
element by ID grabbing the line chart
even though it's no longer going to be a
line chart and it's don't feel like
changing all that we can change this
though to bar a bar chart
okay and we have this in here let bar
chart equal new chart which is a good
start because that's the way we had it
before now you may have remembered in
our previous chart if you kept that open
then we needed some things here one of
which is a type you know the type if you
could have guessed is just bar
considering the type of the other one
was just line so we're pretty close
right we at type and we have bar you
probably could have guessed that okay so
what else do we have in the last one
well we had a data which didn't just
straight up except data was actually in
the object that accepted a few things
now these options included one of which
was a property called data sets so we
had inside of here data and this is not
in camelcase data sets and data sets was
equal to an array of objects and instead
of here we had an actual data property
where we had an array of some data let's
check this out let's give this some some
numbers here 10 20 switch it up with 55
and then back down to 30 okay so at this
bare minimum now we have a type we have
a data with datasets with data and we
have our draw and we have our chart
that's being attached
two and a canvas item let's go ahead and
check this out to see if this worked
this is how I like to learn new things i
I come in and I just try what I think is
gonna work and if it doesn't work then I
go from there okay so now we can refresh
and you can see
can I read property length of undefined
now we might be wondering what exactly
that is oh you could scroll down here
and you could check this out and sort of
see what it's looking for but I sort of
already have an idea of what it's
looking for lengthwise now remember we
had an issue where we had labels and if
we didn't have the right number of
labels the right number of data wasn't
showing up
so let's come back up top here to our
data above datasets and let's add a
labels
okay now labels let's go ahead and have
this be an array of strings and we're
going to have four different strings in
here we can just keep the month theme
going and just have January February
okay March my favorite month and April
okay super cool now we need a comma
obviously this is an object and let's go
ahead and refresh our page here and now
obviously we're getting the same error
now I had a theory and I'm still believe
that theories right I spelled labels lab
was so obviously that wasn't correct I'm
gonna fix that spelling no I'm gonna
check it out
refresh and as you can see we now have a
chart so remember in the last time we
just copied and pasted all of that
information and it sir just seemed like
a whole lot of stuff well this is the
bare minimum we need to have the chart
showing up and if we were to change this
to type line I'm gonna spell it
correctly line refresh you see it works
too and that's pretty done amazing right
cuz all we did was change one thing and
it completely changed the look of this
graph we didn't have to change anything
else we didn't have to change any of our
data any of this other structure and
this object so so as you can see here
this
is the bare minimum of information that
we need and from this point anything
else that we want to add to this we can
do so just simply by looking at the doc
so for instance if we want to add a
label to this particular data we can do
so with this and say numbers per month
okay as you know it makes sense and then
we can add a border color so we can say
border color and the border color can be
an RGBA or it can be a hex value so if
we wanted to go super ugly we could do 0
0 FF 0 0 and get this really awesome
hideous green color and come in and
refresh and now it's interesting here is
that we don't have a border yet so even
though we've defined a border color
showing up in our key but not in our
actual chart itself so of course we want
to come back and we want to give this a
border width and this is the great part
about experimenting with this stuff is
that you really sort of you say okay
well maybe a border width will work or
border color you can come back check it
out and your association with what's
going to work and what's not going to
work is no longer copying and pasting
things out of the documentation which is
very good but it's more or less knowing
the information now now another thing
you'll notice is that our 10 down here
our lowest item does not show up because
it's 10 and that's the lowest I I really
don't like that let's go ahead and in
the last video we showed you global
config now let's say we wanted to go
ahead and add this as beginning at 0 now
we could add it as an option but I see
that we're adding this as an option and
we will be quite frequently because
honestly I like the begins at 0 so let's
go ahead and set a global begin at 0 we
can do so we can find it within charts
defaults global and then we can look at
instead of animation here we can have
this be
Gayle's dot y-axis that ticks that begin
at zero and we can set this to true
let's see if this worked again I'm all
about exploring here now as you can see
this didn't work because we can't find
property of undefined which means that
charts that global dot scales is not a
thing let's go ahead and comment this
line out and we can council that log and
paste in the charts defaults global and
see what actually exists in here
obviously we could look in the docs but
let's go ahead and just explore this
animation or this object right here and
we could see we have tooltips
title unclick legend hover elements we
have a whole bunch of stuff but we don't
have anything to do with scales let's go
ahead and actually drill up a little bit
we can come back in here and say charts
dot defaults ok and refresh now here's
something that's interesting we have
charts dot scale and let's open up chart
scale and we have charts dot
ticks and we have ticks dot begin at 0
so if you don't want to head to the docs
you can always just come in and count to
like this object and drill down here and
see that what we really want is charts
that defaults dot scale dot ticks and if
we refresh this will now see that we
have begin at zero as an option set to
false so what we want to do let's go
ahead and uncomment this out charts
defaults now we want to have this B dot
scale get rid of y-axis dot Tex begin at
zero equals to true save this thing
let's check it out and as you can see
just like magic we've set this default
and we did so without exploring the
documentation but they're really just
exploring the configuration object here
so this is super duper cool
we now have a bar chart and this has a
nice fancy little growing animation
that's taking the default 1000
milliseconds if we want to go ahead and
change this fill color we can mail it
and so if we want to go ahead and change
this fill color we can try to do that as
well that way it's not sort of grey and
neon green let's say we want a complete
neon green bar how do we go about that
well you might think we need a
background color and you'll notice these
follow CSS fairly closely right
background color border color border
with these are all just the same things
except for in camel case rather than
hyphenated what could be called kebab
case now I'm gonna set this background
colored neon green refresh and we have
this fantastic neon green awesome chart
here so this is what I love chart ah yes
it's intuitive it's easy and you can
sort of guess your way through it and if
you need to check out the documentation
the docs are awesome so as you can see
here we now have a neon green bar chart
in the next video we're gonna be talking
about the next type of charts which is a
radar chart as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments to become in the
video hurt me up at twitter or facebook
at level up tutorials if you want to
purchase this series there's going to be
extra content including or going to show
you how to make some really super cool
nice looking charts i'm gonna have a
whole bunch of defaults are gonna be
available for anyone who purchased is
the series so it's going to be some nice
extras there for you you'll be able to
just drop in some configurations options
and have some really super cool looking
at charts as always this is scott with
level up tutorial so if you have any
questions or comments if you come in the
video we're gonna Pat twitter or
facebook at level up tutorials thanks so
much for watching and i'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
