of Hudson today I'm going to show you
how to add attributes to our product
grid listing here and we're gonna go
over this temp little bit that used to
do this if you'll notice I did add some
CSS to make these things floating left
however I'm going to add a clear fix
because it's doing some funky stuff so
we'll be adding that clear fix in our
template as well but basically what we
need to get started is we need to pick
an attribute I've decided that I wanted
these monitors to show the resolution on
this page so you can see the resolution
before you even go down into the product
so to do that I've gone into the rest of
the max resolution attribute by going to
attributes manage attributes and then
finding the one that I want displayed
okay so there's a couple things I want
to make sure if here I want to make sure
the scope is set to global and I've in
fact I'm not even 100% positive on the
requirements for to show up on the front
end I just know that these are probably
the minimum requirements so you don't
have to worry about search you have to
worry about compare we don't have to
worry about promo rule conditions
however we want tags on the front end we
want this to be visible on the view page
and the front end and we want this to be
used in the product listing this is the
important one right here and we don't
care about sorting so I'm going to say
this make sure that that is all correct
and now I'm going to go to our monitors
page and typically what we the heavy do
is go to configuration developer and
turn on your block stuff like usual so
you can see the template that this page
is using but I know for a fact that this
is using the list template so I'm going
to go to my templates and under default
template catalog and then a product with
a rule over and we're going to see this
list that P HTML this is the one that we
want so I'm going to hold option and
copy this file and I'm going to throw it
into my template catalog and product
folder in my own theme and then now that
I have this I'm going to open this up in
sublime text 2 and we're gonna go
through this file
so this file is really important because
this pretty much contains the product
listing for our list and grid you can
see if we want to make sure we're in the
right template before we get into this
PHP I'm just gonna write a test in here
I'm not gonna put any tags or anything
I'll refresh this page and you'll see
test right here so this is where this
templates starting and if I were to put
another test it would plot one out down
here because that's where this is ending
so if PHP scares you don't worry we can
go through this and you don't have to
know any PHP to do this because I'm
going to tell you what to write and you
will start to understand some PHP so
let's scroll down here if you'll notice
this file is broken into two sections
the first one it might be a little weird
to see this but you can see this comment
that says list mode so this is saying
that the first little block here all
this stuff is used to generate the list
mode the list mode is you notice on this
page you can see view as greater list
you know that's just options sometimes I
turn off lists entirely it really
depends on what the client wants so
we're just gonna leave grid I'm not
gonna worry about list because it's
really the same thing you can just copy
and paste it but if we scroll down here
a little bit further you could see grid
mode so this is where the grid mode
stuff starts in fact if you sort of look
through this you can see this is a UL
this is our products grid in fact this
is what I'm gonna have a clear fix to
I'm just gonna write clear fix I'm gonna
save this as a class to refresh this and
it should fix some stuff here okay so
now it fixed all this is not showing up
where it should okay here's our product
still it's all good so let's go through
here and you can see in this list item
we have an anchor tag and it's saying
product get product URL and then
basically this is printing out the link
to the product and then inside of that
link is the catalog image it's doing
some fancy stuff to resize the image
don't worry about too much know that
this block right here outputs the image
down here we have an h2
this outputs the title you can tell
because this is product to get name and
it's within an age too so one way you
can think of this is you can look at
this code and sort of see the HTML then
you can come back to your own page you
can inspect this and see what this looks
like here's the h2 with a class of
product name so that little bit must be
outputting this little chunk of HTML so
there's some things like this review
ratings I don't ever plan on having
ratings in the grid mode of my theme
whatsoever so I'm gonna delete this
whole block that says if product of
great rating summary exists you know
then HECO it then print it so I'm gonna
just delete this whole bit and this is
where I'm going to put my attribute
stuff so I'm just gonna give me some
space here so you can see this and we're
going to type less than question mark
PHP and this is just an opening PHP tag
and then we're gonna do question mark
greater than and inside here we're going
to take we're going to type echo and
then we want our product so if you look
at some of these other examples to get
anything for the product it's under sign
underscore product so dollar signs how
you have a variable in PHP an underscore
product is the variable that houses all
the product information so and then I'm
gonna have arrow greater than and this
is where it has a little bit of magic
involved here we have our product title
or an attribute title which was max
resolution you see some of these things
like get name and get price HTML well
we're gonna type get and then we're
gonna type our attribute name so max
space resolution okay and the thing is
here you can't have a space so what
we're gonna do is we're just gonna
delete the space and notice this is
camel cased get is lower case but then
and this upper case and the R is upper
case then after this we're gonna put
parentheses and our semicolon and I'm
gonna save this
keep in mind if you don't have the
semicolon or keep in mind if you met
some of this stuff up you might see some
funky stuff going on your page
take a second to make sure your code
looks just like this
okay now I'm going to come to our page
refresh and there is our resolution top
that right there
exactly where we wanted it to in fact
this is it this isn't quite what I need
I actually want I want some information
there so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
put a paragraph tag like this and then
inside of this paragraph tag I'm gonna
write actually I'm gonna say max space
resolution and this is just like we were
be writing HTML and then I'm gonna have
a colon space and then here it's gonna
print out the max resolution close that
paragraph tag save it refresh cool now
it's this max resolution that gives the
resolution well you might be thinking
what happens if a product doesn't have a
resolution let's say we picked a
computer right let's say we picked it's
go to electronics computers and this
this computer doesn't have a resolution
so this this field is blank here but it
still says max resolution in fact even
if we went to our apparel s shirts our
shoes it's gonna say max resolution and
we don't want that so we need to have a
little bit more PHP to say only show
this max resolution if it exists so I'm
going to tab this over and above this
I'm going to do another open PHP tag MSA
if and then inside of parentheses we're
gonna just grab this whole dollar sign
product max resolution bit - the
semicolon and paste it in here and this
is gonna say if anything exists here and
then let's put a a colon
question mark close that PHP tag and
then down here we need to close this if
statement so and if
and then we need a semicolon here I'm
gonna say this so again take a second to
make sure your code looks like this
pause the video check it out especially
if you are having problems so now let's
come back to our page refresh and now
max resolution shows up for these
computers let's go to our shoes and we
should see nothing perfect it's exactly
what we want it's not how putting when
we don't want it to its how put in when
you wanted to everything is is awesome
is great okay so that's how you output
and attribute in your list that RP HTML
and that's how you modify this this list
code here in the next lesson we're gonna
be going over some more modifications
I'm just going to basically be deleting
a lot of this stuff and we're going at
this looking good as always this is
Scott with level of touch if you have
any questions please head of this up on
