level up tents and today we're going to
take our drop down menu that we made one
step further by
working it into a third level so if you
remember this is what we had before we
hovered over these items and that's
great what happens when you add a second
level to this menu well let's go ahead
and do that with our HTML and you know
what I'm actually going to not add this
to every link because there's a ton of
links here already but I'm just gonna
write inside this first one I'm going to
add another row and to do that I'm
actually using an app called Emmet that
allows me to just type out shorthand and
sort of have that filter out like that
it's pretty cool
so it's Emmet spelled with an E and then
et I think or something like that and
that emm et yep and I would check that
out if I were you it's been pretty cool
so that just built this out really
quickly and you know and I have this B
link level 3 all inside of here ok so we
have a link level 3 it's on this and
I'll signify this with a couple of lines
over just so I know which one it is and
let's come back to our document here now
we hover over this if I hover over our
second level item the third level comes
in and it's really funky you can't click
on anything and really this just wasn't
built for being a third level of
navigation so what we want to do is have
this third level navigation fly off to
the right here and that's going to be
really easy to do so one thing I like to
do is I like to build things out in the
browser before I type them out so if we
click on this ul let's inspect this
first one and we click on this ul down
here and we tell this one in particular
to display block then this one is just
gonna be here we don't have to hover
over
and let's open this up and inside of
this again we're gonna tell this next DL
to display:block and now that shows up
it's good to get familiar with these
inspect element because I you know we
really use this all the time and there's
some really great things we can do with
this so in this element style here we
can add some styles and just temporarily
see how it's going to look so now that
this third level is gonna be displayed
without me having to do anything let's
mess around with it it's already getting
a position here absolute it's already
getting the right width the thing is not
getting correctly its top it should have
a top value of zero and what top of zero
does is it's going to push it right up
to the top here so it's gonna be in the
line with this and let's actually give
this one a darker background while we're
here so we can distinguish quickly the
third level laughs from the second level
nav so you can see here that the third
level lab is now sitting directly on top
of our other one so we gave at the top
of zero now we're going to give it a
left and if we hover over this UL we'll
see that it's a hundred ninety pixels
wide so we can say one ninety pixels
left cool so this is going to be how
this menu appears check it out this is
what it's going to look like when we
hover over it it's gonna shoot out here
and that's pretty cool so let's copy all
of this right here you couldn't exactly
just select it and welcome to our CSS
and in our CSS just like we had this
before where this was displaying the
block that's still gonna work but we're
going to need to now target the nav ul
then inside of another ul and then
inside of one more this is where we're
gonna be wanting to give these
properties so you just end up these
correctly right here and I'm gonna have
a comment saying third-level
and we just need to delete this
display:block here because we don't want
it showing up so let's save refresh now
we hover over here we'll hover over this
here's our third level menu cool that
works really nice and easy let's add
another one let's see let's just grab
this entire unordered list and I'm gonna
just even this link I'm gonna add all
this bit somewhere else
I'm added just to one of these other
done here and let's do it right here
okay we'll save this and now let's come
back to our page refresh so now if you
hover over this you'll notice it works
fine for this one over if it's not in
the first position it's still jumping up
there so why is that even though we have
these position:relative well we just
need to give these a height so these are
pretty two pixels so if we're saying
these are 42 pixels tall refresh each of
the list items is now going to be 42
pixels tall and here we are here's our
third level working just like that cool
so that's really nice
more thing we can do to make this a
little bit better so this isn't so
determined by width we can just say this
is needs to be left by a 100% instead of
you know whatever pixel width we had
there and just like we did that left
here we can also say top 100% here and
this just makes it so we don't have to
tie this into any sort of pixel width if
we change the height of our list items
or something like that then the Navajo
will in fact respond the same way just
like we did left 100% we can do 100% or
top 100% and we're all good so as always
if you have any questions or comments
please leave a comment the video or hit
us up at Twitter level up tuts let us
know what you're thinking
I was like to hear from you and thanks
