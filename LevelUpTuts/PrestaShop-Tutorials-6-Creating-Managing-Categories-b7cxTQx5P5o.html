up tuts and today we're going to show
you how to create new categories and
manage the existing categories within
PrestaShop we'll give you the whole
rundown about the categories menu and
how to get around so check it out we're
gonna get into that right now so what we
need to do from our dashboard has come
to catalogue and if we have our catalog
we can't have access to the categories
menu now what our categories other than
what the definition of the word is well
if we take a look on the front end of
our store we can see that we have women
is a category along with that tops and
t-shirts are also a category let's
actually check out the categories menu
here to see them so we have women right
here if we click on that you can see we
have tops and dresses now if we look
further under tops we have t-shirts tops
and blouses however if you go back to
the store you can see that under women's
tops we just have t-shirts and blouses
so what happened to tops underneath tops
t-shirts and blouses well it has this
red checkmark here and we've seen this
before in PrestaShop you have a green
check mark or a red X that is basically
letting you know if something is enabled
or disabled and what I really love about
PrestaShop interface is that it makes it
really obvious what is enabled and
what's disabled there's nothing a no yes
true/false it's a big green check or a
red X so let's go ahead and click this
and you can see that the status has been
updated so we clicked the X let's
refresh it now you'll notice that tops
has been added to our list and if we
were to go under dresses you would see
casual evening in summer so let's go
ahead and do women dresses and casual
evening in summer now you might be
seeing this links up top here dresses
and t-shirts and be wondering how they
got into the main navigation well let's
explore those categories specifically if
we click on dresses you can see that
it's all women's dresses underneath we
have the same three
categories casually evening in summer so
you can probably guess that this dresses
is the same dresses that's under this
headline right here so let's go ahead
and check that out
let's go back one level where we have
our dresses category now I'm going to
click this and click edit now from here
we can choose whether that's displayed
we can see the category structure by
selecting this folder you can see that
women's we have tops and dresses are
beneath this so you can really get an
idea about what the structure is so the
parent category is women's if we were to
have the parent category category be
home it would be at the same level as
women's and you might be thinking well
it's sort of at the same level as
women's right now well not quite so
let's scroll down we see we have the
description we see we have this large
image which is the image that's showing
up right here this text and headline is
actually showing up on top of the image
which is great for SEO purposes you
don't often want to have text in an
image that way this text is nice and
searchable ok now if we scroll down you
can see we have access to some meta
information you can add some keywords
it's friendly addresses slash dresses
and everybody can visit this so now a
category is going to show up as a sub
item under your main category here
that's on the root level but that
doesn't simply add it to the main
navigation as well dresses and t-shirts
have actually been added here especially
through the top navigation module we're
gonna go through that module in the
video of its own however let's add a new
category and let's make it a root level
category so let's click add new category
up top here and we're just gonna say
men's because we have all this women's
clothes let's actually make a men's
clothes section and we can have it be
displayed yes now the parent category
for this is actually going to be home
because we want this to be at the same
level as women and since it says women
I'm gonna change us to just men
okay and we can say men's clothing now I
don't have an image so I'm just gonna
leave that blank and everybody can have
access to this so let's go ahead and
click Save and see what happens so we
now have men's clothing it's it's ready
to be displayed and let's refresh our
page as you can see it's still nothing
so we're PrestaShop differs from things
like Magento is PrestaShop doesn't
automatically add your categories to the
main navigation which is good because in
Magento that can get really annoying
when you have to get in there and do
some major editing or create a new
category simply to add something to the
navigation with PrestaShop it keeps the
navigation separate from your categories
so how do we get to our new category
well since we named it men and you can
see we have the URL as 3 - women and
eight - dresses five hype and t-shirts
well then is actually the 12th category
so we can guess that the men's catalog
category is going to be in 12 - men so
we can say 12 - men and hit enter now we
I have arrived at our men's category we
can see that we have men men's clothing
our description since there's no image
it just puts it on top of this grey box
which actually looks really nice and we
have another subheading and says there's
no products let's go and head add our
html5 sticker even though it's a sticker
and not a t-shirt let's go ahead and
just add that to the men's clothing just
so you can see this populate so again
let's go to catalog and then products
let's browse to our sticker product in
fact if you don't want to spend time
looking for you can search for it but
since we don't have that many it sits
nice and top on the list here well not
the top but it's on the first page now
under associations let's select a men as
a new category that this will be in and
let's click Save now when refreshing our
men's page we can see that our sticker
is now
officially showing up and we have access
to all these things like compare sort by
and all the nice stuff that you'd want
on your store page so this is awesome we
now have our new category in here you
can create subcategories of that and
subcategories of that just like we have
with women so now you can get creating
categories and grouping your products
into categories that make sense you can
get as granular or as global as you want
with this to have a big category of
men's or you can do men's t-shirts men's
you know cotton t-shirts or whatever you
want you can categorize your shirts in
as many different things as you want now
if you notice from the product screen
you can add products to more than one
category so like I said you can get
really granular with it if you want or
you don't have to so in the next video
we're gonna show you how you can
actually modify this main navigation
menu and add our new category to the
menu and see it in action just like we
have women with tops and dresses here so
as always this is Scott with level up
tuts if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment on the video it
has Abed Twitter or Facebook we love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next video that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
