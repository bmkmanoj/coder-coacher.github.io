today we're going to be doing an
overview of the Drupal 8 beta since we
install the Drupal 8 beta in the last
video we're going to take you through
and show you some of the admin interface
the front end stuff some of the stuff
that you might not know about the new
Drupal 8 setup now this isn't going to
be a full octave Drupal 8 i'm going to
save that for after the full version is
released but this should give you a good
idea about where things are and where
things are headed with the Drupal 8 beta
so check it out we're going to get into
that right now okay so we now have the
Drupal 8 installed and you can see
automatically there's a bit of a
difference well it's not a huge
difference first of all our alert
message looks just a hair prettier um
that was it always looked pretty basic
before and it still doesn't look great
but it looks better next we have this
theme that sort of looks like bardic
that pretty much is but it's not
necessarily the same Bartok it's just
visually very similar so you also notice
at the top here we have our new admin
toolbar it has managed shortcuts and
admin admin asst things like log out at
a profile view profile Schork shortcuts
are your shortcuts that you will add
that more could show up here manage is
our content structure appearance extend
configuration people reports and help
now these are sort of new to be up here
these are a little bit different than
what we had before but they all make
sense and you have nice little icons now
to sort of get at a quick glance what
everything's doing now you'll notice
there's also button here where you can
move this menu to the side and you'll
notice it pushes over our content cool
so let's go ahead and go to content so
you can see something maybe a little bit
more familiar now this page should also
look pretty familiar this theme it
hasn't changed a whole lot from the
Drupal 7 we can just as easily add
content sorted the same way that we
could be for so this is not going to
feel very natural in fact we click add
content it's going to feel very natural
again we have article basic page and so
while we do have not a ton of
changes here the all authoring situation
looks very similar there's a lot of
stuff under the hood and Drupal 8 is
pretty different for a lot of reasons
under the the technical aspects of it
that we're not going to cover in this
video however in our more complete
Drupal 8 series that arrives when Drupal
8 arrives we'll certainly be covering
that so next we have structure and
structure is going to have the stuff
that you would expect we have block
layout which is a new section here so it
allows you to configure what block
content appears on your side side bars
in other regions so this sounds a lot
like blocks however if we go to block
layout you'll see it's going to be a
little bit different okay it's going to
be more full-featured it's sort of a
better layout system than what we've had
before now we also have comment types
contact forms which is now the default
that's in here by default here we don't
have to have a web form or any of these
other modules added on after the fact we
can use contact forms we also have
content types display modes are where
you can figure how your page is
displaying your content type is
displaying in that that existed in
Drupal 7 just a little bit differently
next we have menus to text out of Maine
views now any Drupal user should be
really excited that views is now part of
core and here it is we didn't have to
install it like we do on every single
Drupal site we use so views exists by
default menus should feel largely the
same we can go ahead and edit one of
these menus just so you can see dragged
around so there's not a ton of crazy
differences but Drupal 8 all around is a
much nicer experience okay next we have
appearance which is where you can change
your theme which looks extremely similar
to Drupal 7 s appearance page and next
we have extend which is going to be
where you're going to add modules so
it's no longer screaming at you modules
modules modules it's now extend where
you're going to extend your pool with
modules
and that might make for a nicer
experience and it may not it might be
completely inconsequential okay let's go
ahead and search so let's enter module
name and this is automatic filtering
built-in and people have used other
plugins like module filter and the past
so it's really nice to see this module
filtering in here now we can see we have
views and views you I if you click on
the knees drop down menus you get access
to help or configure and you can save
your configuration here okay now let's
go to configuration and again this looks
very similar some of these headlines are
a little bit different text formats and
editors we still have performance things
like that and this is all going to feel
very similar so I suggest you just
install Drupal 8 and poke around however
a lot of the stuff isn't going to be
completely mind-blowing next we have
people which is going to be your just
basic no listing like we have our user
accounts here and next we have a section
called reports now reports gives us
access to things like available updates
recent log messages you can see we have
some log messages looks like there's a
PHP error here and also with things like
status report top access denied errors
so just sort of any sort of maybe errors
or reporting that you'd want to see is
going to be available here lastly we
have helped which opens up some getting
started documentation and some
documentation about the individual
modules you click on views it's going to
tell you some basic views usage honestly
I hope the documentation here gets
better there's the online documentation
for the views module but really none of
this is very good I feel like they could
do a much better job of explaining how
to use these modules however there's
always level of Tut's and you can come
here and learn how to use this stuff
okay so this is the overview of the
Drupal 8 beta well you
tell is that on the surface not a ton
has changed about underneath the hood
there is a lot changed and the core
Drupal experience is significantly
improved from Drupal 7 so I'm excited I
can't wait to try it when it comes out
and start using it on projects right
away so is this is got to lynskey if you
have any questions or comments if you
come in the video or hit us up at
twitter or facebook and i love a lot of
Tut's we'd love to hear from you thanks
for watching and we'll see in the next
one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
