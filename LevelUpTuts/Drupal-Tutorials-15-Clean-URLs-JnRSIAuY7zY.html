with the level of Tut's and today I'm
going to show you something really quick
about your new Drupal site that you just
installed what we're going to do is
we're going to make sure clean URLs are
enabled if you don't have clean URLs
enabled basically in your in your URL
here it's going to have like a question
mark Q equals and it's basically not
good for things like SEO or just you
know it doesn't have your URLs looking
nice and clean so um if we go to
configuration and then we go to clean
URLs under search and metadata click
this and you'll notice um that if your
Drupal site was set up correctly clean
URLs will already be enabled if this is
not enabled and you run the
configuration testaments as you failed
chances are you don't have that htaccess
file that exists in your site um so if
we go to transmit here click here let's
go back to my site you'll see this
htaccess file and you won't see that in
finder i did mention this in the
previous video but i know some people
have some problems with that and i just
wanted to make that clear that if you
are having this clean URLs that won't
enable make sure that you grab that
htaccess file
okay well that's clean URLs and how to
enable them if you are having problems
with that in the next tutorials we're
going to be going over all sorts of
stuff anywhere from you know adding and
adding content to your site to theming
to individual module profiles all sorts
of stuff it's going to be awesome
so if you like this video and you want
to keep watching subscribe hit us up on
Twitter at level up level up tuts calm
as always thanks for watching and have a
good one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
