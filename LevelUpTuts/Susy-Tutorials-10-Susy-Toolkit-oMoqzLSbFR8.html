of HUD's and today we're going to be
talking about some more of the mix-ins
within the Susy tool kit now we're just
gonna go over a few of them to show you
what they have to offer so to get
started we're going to talk about some
of the spacing mix-ins we have the
ability to add headings to our columns
using three mix-ins the prefix mixin to
add padding before the suffix mixin to
add padding after and the pad mixin for
adding padding to both prefix and suffix
so if we wanted to take one of our
columns let's say this span which is the
aside here which is actually let me
refresh here if we wanted to add padding
to our little side nav here we could use
the mixin pad or I'm sorry I'd include
pad and inside here we're just going to
give it what type of padding we want now
we could say things like 25% and let's
save that now for refresh you can see
that that padding has of course caused
us to go on another level but it's
definitely getting let's see but what it
is getting is this 25% padding on both
the left and the right which is why it's
so giant if you wanted to give it a
pixel dimension you could of course do
that too so if we wanted to say 10
pixels of padding on both sides we could
do that as well and now you'll notice
that we just have the 10 pixels of
padding on the left and the right as you
can see here and if we wanted to do the
left and right separately we could do it
like so we could say 10 pixels comma 20
pixels now when we check it out the
right side is going to have 20 pixels
and the left side is going to have 10
pixels of padding now of course if you
just wanted to have a suffix or prefix
you could just say
Suffolk's just like that and now that's
only going to add 10 pixels to the right
side for padding cool so that is some of
our padding nixon's we also have the
ability to do adjust margins we can do
that with pre post pull or squish
so what post does what pre pre and post
are basically the same as suffix and
prefix just with margin instead of
padding and Paul is actually going to be
applying for negative margins so it's
gonna be pulling it in that against the
direction of the flow where in the other
margins are going to be going with the
direction of the flow of your document
so for instance if we wanted this aside
to be pulled by 100 pixels we could say
include Paul 100 pixels save this now
let's check it out you can see it's
being moved over by a negative margin
cool so that's just some of our our
mix-ins there we also have a squish
mixin which is the shortcut for adding
pre and post similar to the pad mixin
that we had just used for padding and
that's it for our margin mix sense
now the margin mix-ins are pretty much
just what you'd expect now we also have
a bleed mixin which allows you to apply
negative margins with equal positive
padding so basically so the element
borders and backgrounds bleed outside of
their containers for instance if we had
a bleed of 10 pixels what it's going to
do is it's going to add a margin of
negative 10 pixels and it's going to add
a padding of positive 10 pixels so let's
try that out and come back here and we
can just say bleed and now it's going to
ask for the bleed value we can just give
this
any pixels and save this refresh now
let's check out our side well we have as
you can see is a margin of negative 10
or 20 pixels and a padding of 20 pixels
it's become apparent if we give this a
background of let's say ugly blue you
can see that it where the boundaries are
a little bit more definitively now if
you just wanted to bleed the horizontal
or the vertical amount you could say
bleed - X for the horizontal or bleed -
Y for the vertical now we also have a
mixin I'm going to go ahead and delete
this bleed 1 and there's also a gallery
mixin where we can pass it some
arguments here and it's going to output
our items into a grid-like gallery so
let's go ahead and quickly very quickly
produce a gallery we can just say
gallery and then inside of this I'm
going to have let's just say for for
image tags like that and I'm gonna use
some place kittens here so we have some
kittens now so let's say then check it
out if i refresh here our our kittens
they are lovely here chillin hanging out
in this you can see they're not doing
too much so let's say we one of these in
a gallery we're gonna have two images on
each row now let's come to our CSS and
since we have in our base grid we have a
12 column grid here we're going to say
that these gallery images take up a
certain amount of columns per the grid
like normal but we're going to be doing
it using the gallery mixin instead so we
can type in gallery because that's our
class and then we're gonna say every
single image within gallery we're going
to use this include
Mixson it's going to be the gallery
mixin just like this and now we can say
because we have we want to do two images
on each row we're going to say that it's
going to be six of 12 right because we
have a 12 column grid we have two on
each row therefore each image is going
to take up six of twelve finish it off
with a semicolon and let's check out our
gallery when i refresh so you can now
see that we have a two column two row
gallery that's going to responsively
adjust and remain two columns now this
is pretty sweet and let's check out how
we can make it a little bit cooler with
the use of our break point mixin if we
want to give it a break point and say at
the large break point we want this now
to have a new gallery dimensions right
we want this to say we want it to be now
3 of 12 so what 3 of 12 is going to do
is it's going to put 4 images on one row
because 4 times 3 is 12 so let's come
over to our page here obviously we
refresh and we still have our two
columns for mobile but once we get
bigger you can see once it hits this
large breakpoint so just like that we
have a perfect responsive gallery that
we can adjust at any breakpoint and we
hardly even have to tell anything if
Susie is doing all of the complex math
for you and it is just excellent
so check out the rest of the tool kit
there's not a ton left but there are
some ones I didn't go over so just check
out the docs they're nice and easy to
understand so go to the the toolkit
section of the Susie documentation and
see what other mixes they have to offer
so as always this is Scott with LevelUp
Tut's if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment of the
video hit us up
Facebook Twitter pretty much anywhere we
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and I'll see in the next one
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
