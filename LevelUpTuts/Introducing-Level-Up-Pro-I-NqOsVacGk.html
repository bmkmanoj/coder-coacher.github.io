Tut's and today I'm super excited to
announce level up pro a level of pro is
our new subscription service for level
of Tut's calm in 2012 we started
creating free video tutorials on YouTube
and now as we're coming into our third
year of level up Tut's we would love to
bring more features more content and
more everything however to do that we
need more resources and to get these
resources we've decided to introduce a
subscription service now it's important
to note that our videos are free and
will always remain free however the
level of todd's pro subscription that
just gives you access to some exciting
new features and you get the benefit of
knowing that you're supporting free
tutorials for everybody on youtube so if
you come to the level of Tut's calm
website you'll now see this upgrade now
with level up pro and here we have a
button to see the features or you can
just go sign up if you're feeling really
excited I encourage either so we can
click see the features and let's check
out some of the stuff you get with level
up pro now of course these videos are
always going to be streaming free
regardless if you're a pro member or if
you're just browsing the site and
likewise if you have a free account you
can still post in the forum and you can
still vote in the level of q three times
now is a level of pro member you can
vote an unlimited amount of times you
can keep voting for the things you want
to see also you can now download all of
the videos on level up Tut's as a pro
member so let's check out this download
videos in action now if I come to any
video page after being a level up Tut's
Pro you'll now see at the top here we
have this video download block right
here that allows you a one-step click to
download an mp4 of any of these videos
now this video is going to download it's
going to take just a minute you'll see
that once this opens it's a high-quality
1280 by 720 video mp4 that you can take
with you at mp4s are really great
because they play in all sorts of
different video players so we have a
video downloads now next we have a
private pros forum and this is really
just a place where level up Hut's pros
can go ahead and post it's bright here
brand new there's no post in it so come
in here sign up and we can have some
interesting conversation keep in mind
that I might be a little bit faster to
respond to the level up pros that the
ping subscribers but I still I'm going
to respond just as quick as I have been
in the normal form and we also give you
a user badge that's really just your a
badge similar to the one that's on the
site right here during the forum like
whenever you post just so people who
aren't pros can see you know who is
contributing to making level up Tut's
better than it is already now next we
have just the the sass master ii to our
course download and SAS mastery is a
course that I produced for envato for
the tuts+ marketplace a year two ago and
it's a high-quality SAS course complete
SAS course with code examples and all
sorts of stuff since that marketplace is
no board I have been given access to
this files and I'm now giving them away
for free for pros now also as a level of
pro you'll see that if we come to any of
these pages you're no longer greeted
with ads and this is a big one for me
because I hate ads I hate ads on
websites I hate ads all over the place
but unfortunately because we do all this
stuff for free we have no way of really
maintaining you know level up tuts and
you know paying for servers and stuff
like that without ads so as a member of
level of Tut's Pro you can have a total
ad free experience and this is
personally the way that I think the site
should be viewed
okay now the next we have live code
examples now live code examples are not
here yet I should make that very
important it's not here yet but I am
working so hard on getting these ready I
in fact I'm that's that's all I'm
putting all my effort on right now is
making these live code examples into the
site so we can not only download but
actually they're going to be done in
embedded code pens so what you can do is
not only see them in action on the site
but you can even modify them play with
them save them as code pens and I think
that's going to be really functional and
useful for everybody now level up touch
pro is eight ninety-nine a month or $95
for a year and I think this is a good
price for a service like this it's
really helping support level up Tut's
it's going to give us the opportunity to
make the site better than it is right
now which is something that I've you
know I really really want to make level
up Tut's as awesome as it can be but you
know being a side project there's just
no way for that to happen now they're
just saying a note that some videos are
not available to download at launch
however i'm pretty sure i have
ninety-eight percent of the videos up
there's going to be one or two here and
there that you might find that aren't
the up yet but rest assured um maybe
even by the time you watch this video
they're all going to be up so come to
this level up Todd's pro page check out
our features read a little bit about
them and decide if level up pro is right
for you we would love to have you
support the site but if not that's
totally cool the videos are still going
to be free for you regardless so thanks
for watching let me know if you have any
questions about level up Tut's or level
up Tut's pro we would be happy to answer
any of those questions you might have as
far as what features are coming what's
in the pipeline that sort of stuff so as
always this is scott Olinsky and thanks
for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
