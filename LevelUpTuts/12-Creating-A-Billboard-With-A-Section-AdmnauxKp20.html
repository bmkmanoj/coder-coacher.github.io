of tutorials and in this video I'm going
to show you the section element now
we're going to start by creating a
billboard for our website and we're
going to be using the section to talk
about what exactly that means so let's
get going on that right now so in the
last video we got our header going and
it's looking pretty good
so let's actually check out our website
I'm gonna right click on this reveal and
find her we just drop this right into
our browser here okay so as you can see
we're doing pretty good here
it's looking alright I think one of the
big things that we want to do next is to
make this sort of like a billboard here
for our homepage so let's go ahead and
get started with that now in our HTML
what we want to do is we want to come
down to this main section now before we
just had in the h2 and we had a
paragraph with a span and stuff we had
this just inside of the main however
there's another containing semantic
element called section now section
basically says here is some content on
your website that is grouped together
now a section can be all sorts of things
right you can have a section that's
essentially your detail page where you
have some content on there you could
have a section like this that's a
billboard you could have a section
that's something like a newsletter sign
up either way a section is sort of
grouping like content together in what's
considered a main content section of
your website
now there's another tag that's sort of
like section called a side that we're
going to be going over in the next video
so I'm gonna go ahead and paste all the
stuff in between our section tags here
and let's go ahead and let's indent
these correctly you know just by
highlighting everything and hitting tab
if you're using sublime text now as you
can see here we haven't really added
anything that is going to change the way
this looks if we come back to our
website refresh it looks the exact same
so a section like a div tag
is really just a black level semantic
tag now the difference between a div and
a section is that a section essentially
has meaning where a div really has no
meaning to a screen reader or anything
like that a section really just denotes
that all of the content within this is
going to be related so when you're
writing your code it's important to
think about things that not only humans
are going to read but screen readers and
robots and all sorts of things are going
to read your code and have a better
understanding of it okay so now that we
have this section let's go ahead and
turn this into more of a billboard here
I'm gonna go ahead and get rid of this
intro text part two we don't need it
anymore and likewise I'm gonna go ahead
to our CSS I'm gonna delete that CSS as
well
part two down here we don't need it okay
we just were sort of showing off some
coloring there before now let's go ahead
and give this main section of class name
and class is just going to be equal to
billboard okay like so now we can come
in here and we can give our billboard
some properties here so let's add a new
line there CSS we can say billboard and
we can give this a background color and
let's give this a just a background
color of a light gray for now we're not
going for any style Awards with this and
let's go ahead and make this
text-align:center so we can say text -
align Center this is going to bring all
of the text that's within this billboard
to a lining Center okay let's go ahead
and refresh cool so we now have learning
with level up tutorials I'm going to
build websites okay let's actually make
this a little bit lighter for gray
instead of this dark grey we did nine
nine nine before we can use something
like CCC which is just a couple shades
lighter than the FFF which is pure white
there we go
now you'll notice there's some weird
space between here this is the same
issue that we were having before where
the
heading of our website was pushing down
the header so this is the margin on this
h2 is actually pushing down this
billboard
so let's come back to our code and we
can say any h2s that are within
billboard like so will you say any h2s
that exist within billboard let's not
give them a margin top so we could say
margin top zero okay like so now we have
no margin top let's come back here cool
now let's actually do some work to get
this pushed down a little bit we don't
want all of this we want the gray to be
but upright against the blue here but we
don't want this text to be right
directly underneath that same width we
want some padding between this text and
the billboard itself so let's go ahead
and come to our billboard and let's add
some padding so we could say of padding
and let's just add 60 pixels of padding
on all sides so this is going to add
padding on the left and right top and
bottom if we refresh you can see we now
have this billboard now it's a little
bit heavy for the padding let's not get
down to something like 40 save it
refresh perfect so we now have this
heading we have a billboard and we have
the basics of footer content down here
right so we've headed our first section
we've made a billboard it's pretty
boring we'll get to that in a little bit
by adding some more interesting elements
to this however we have some nice things
going here and it's starting to come
together
so as always this is Scott would level
up tutorials if you have any questions
or comments you become in the video
Huertas about Twitter or Facebook at
level up tuts
i love to hear from you thanks for
watching and i'll see in the next one
