tuts and today we're going to be talking
about arrays and we've gone over some
other data types already we went over
strings we went over numbers and now
we're gonna go over another useful data
type and this is arrays
so let's declare a new array I'm
actually just gonna go ahead and delete
all this stuff right here and just like
we declared a string right here and a
number right here we're going to just
say var and this is just gonna be my
list and my list is going to be equal to
and then to declare an array all we have
to do is have these brackets right here
notice how these aren't the curly
brackets these are these square brackets
and you might be wondering what can you
put in an array well we could have an
array that's simply 1 comma 2 comma 3
comma 4 right and this is an array of
numbers it's basically has four separate
items in it right so an array is just a
listing of several items I mean it can
be 0 or as many items as you'd like
right so basically we have 1 2 3 4 but
what else can we put in a race well we
can put strings so we could say hello
and we could have another company here
and we can put another array another
rightful of anything and it couldn't
even include one value if we'd like so
let's have this like this and so now we
have an array here it has 1 2 3 4 5 6 6
items in it and then one of those items
is an array with two items in it so you
have an array and race can be very
useful you'll see basically their uses
in over the course of time here as we
write some more and more advanced code
here this array isn't particularly
useful but maybe you had a list of
people's names or something like that
and you wanted to out put everybody's
name or just have like a listing
basically anytime you need not
necessarily an order list but just a
grouping of data so this works really
well but what happens if we try to count
along this if you remember we council
logged name and it would just say bill
right but let's say we council dialogue
my list right how do we access my list
so let's say the the end result here we
want to have is we want to have it just
to display a value from this array we
want to have it to display one how do we
get it out of my list so let's save this
we're council logging my list I'm on the
page here I'm gonna inspect this and go
to our council and let's go to our
council here and you'll notice it says
irate sick so it's saying an array with
six items in it we can click this and it
has 0 1 2 3 4 5
and you'll notice what's interesting
about this is it has six items but the
maximum number here is five right so
what's going on here well arrays
actually start at 0 so we have 0 1 2 3 4
5 so let's say we wanted to access this
first item we actually have to reference
it by this zero right so the zero is the
index let's check out how we can display
this one so we want the first item in
our array and so I race starts at 0 we
have some brackets here and we put 0 so
this 0 here is saying give me the first
item in the array now we're refresh and
our council logging is 1 likewise if we
put 1 here it should output 2 now if we
output now what would you say we know we
would have to output to get hello well
all we have to do is count up from 0 so
0 1 2 3 4 so of course we have 4 here
and it says hello now if we have five
refresh you're going to get it
outputting an array again an array with
two strings in it and we want to access
this second string in here how do we do
that well we can actually just put
another set of brackets right here have
a one here refresh and then we're
accessing that second string so this is
saying give me the fifth item or give me
the sixth item in this array right and
that items an array so it returns an
array and then you're saying give me the
second item in an array cool so now
we've not only built an array with all
all sorts of different data types in it
all of the data types we've learned thus
far but we've also learned how to access
and use things from it well in the next
couple of videos we're gonna be going
over some cool stuff we're gonna be
going over methods and things that you
could do to add things to arrays remove
them you know modify them and all data
altogether so this is just the tip of
the iceberg as always like I've been
saying these are just introductory
videos and we're going to get into some
really great stuff so keep watching as
always this is Scott what level of Tut's
if you have any questions or comments
blues that would come in the video we're
gonna sup at Twitter level up HUD's
we're on Facebook level of HUD's yeah
check any of our stuff out and you know
I promise more contents coming all the
time so thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
