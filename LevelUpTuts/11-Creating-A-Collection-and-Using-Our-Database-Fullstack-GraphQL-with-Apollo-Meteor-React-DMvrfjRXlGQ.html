set up our API so that's returning our
name and ID of each of our resolutions
now the only problem is those
resolutions are coming from a hard-coded
string inside of our resolver now the
ideal outcome here would be that this
information comes directly from the
database now we don't have any
collections or anything set up so in
this video what we're gonna be doing is
creating a collection we're gonna be
importing it into a resolver and we're
going to be outputting some resolutions
from our database after sort of gently
adding Genki I don't know we're gonna be
adding one into our database and it's
gonna be kind of quick and dirty okay so
let's go ahead and inside of our
resolutions folder inside of our API
folder we're gonna create a new file
named resolutions dot J si use a
lowercase R for here but I guess it
doesn't really matter and we're going to
import inside of brackets Mongo Mongo
from meteor forward slash Mongo Ted next
thing we want to do is actually define
our collection so we can say Const and
this is going to be resolutions with a
capital r is equal to a new Mongo dot
collection and Mount new Mongo
collection accepts a string which is a
lowercase resolutions so check it out
we're going to say a new constant
resolutions is equal to a new Mongo
collection named resolutions and the
last thing we're going to do is export
resolutions okay
actually I take that back we're going to
export default resolutions so that this
is the default export from this file so
this file is going to be evaluated on
our server but all it simply does is
define a new collection named
resolutions now at this point we can go
ahead and import this collection into
our resolver where we're going to want
to insert something into it so let's go
ahead and end resolvers we're going to
import capital our resolutions from
and this is going to be dot forward
slash resolutions okay so we're bringing
in the collection now in a manga
collection we have access to all sorts
of stuff
one of which is dot find okay and if we
wanted to find something we would
actually need to call a dot fetch
afterwards because that find is going to
return what's called a cursor which is a
whole bunch of extra information that we
don't need what we want is the array of
IDs and names so fetch is going to give
us just the that information so if we
were to do something like Const res is
equal to resolutions dot find out fetch
and then we were to Council log res out
you can see when this starts up what
we're going to be getting is an empty
array which is what we want okay if
you're not seeing an empty array here
something is wrong because what we've
done is we've defined a collection and
we've said hey Mongo go give me
everything from within this collection
and obviously there's nothing so it's
returning an empty array no point
because right now our schema in our
graph QL type and ID is going to mirror
that of which our actual data is in the
database in but to think that those
always need to be one-to-one it would be
a huge mistake your schema for graph QL
this does not define the shape of the
data in your database in fact your
database could include a whole bunch of
extra information or your graph QL
schema could actually include extra
information to we'll go over that that's
not one-to-one here this is simply just
the schema of your public API this is
the stuff you can grab publicly okay and
I just wanted to make that distinction
here before we get inserting and adding
to the database and you'll see right now
that stuff is going to be one-to-one but
keep in mind that and typical
applications it's not okay so we've gone
to find and fetch and there's nothing in
here I mentioned at the beginning of
this video we're going to do a quick and
dirty insert so to do that
this file we're simply just going to do
resolutions that insert and we're simply
going to pass in a name and that name is
going to be test res now the reason I'm
not assigning an ID here is because
MongoDB and media will automatically
give this a underscore ID so if I save
this and we head to our command line you
should see it inserted one then when we
did our find it should actually return
our object right here okay this is a
little small for you but what I'm seeing
is an array of an object with test res
in it so if you aren't seeing that then
something definitely has gone wrong
however for those of you who have seen
this I'm going to comment this out okay
if you're having issues follow the
errors or go ahead and check out the
example code
okay so we've inserted a new item into
our database so now whenever we run a
find that fetch we're actually giving a
single item back so well check it out
this is an array of an object with an ID
and a name which if you remember in our
query I think we define that in our
register API Macey yeah
so in our query schema we defined the
resolutions query to return a resolution
inside of an array resolution is defined
inside of the resolution schema and
that's to find us an ID and a name so
this data matches exactly this so what
we should be able to do instead of
returning an array of objects here from
our resolutions query inside of
resolvers we should be able to return
the results of our resolutions find out
fetch and have this data the output
exactly like we want it to in our app so
if I come back to our app now and this
refresh is or since these are only
server-side changes you might have to do
an actual refresh you can see here test
res is now
output from our query and this is
brilliant because we didn't have to
change anything other than the resolver
right we just changed the resolver to
return the information directly from the
database rather than some hard-coded
objects so now our application is
actually working with real data coming
in from a database from our graph QL
query into our react component this is
exactly what we've been wanting to do
the whole time to get this thing going
so now that data is coming in via our
database the next step if you can
imagine is going to be inserting stuff
into our database now the reason why we
didn't insert first is because we
haven't gone over the concept of
mutations and I wanted to get real
database stuff coming in from concepts
we've already talked about now in the
next video we're going to be doing is
actually creating our form for our
resolutions which is going to be just
super simple and we're going to be
writing our first mutation and hopefully
when this is all said and done in the
next video we should be able to see
adding items to our resolutions database
directly from a graph QL from react and
to sing this all update in real time so
it's going to be SuperDuper cool so as
always this is Scott with level of
tutorials if you want to learn more
about this stuff and help support level
of tutorials on hundred or two level
tutorials com forward slash store and
either purchase some stuff or become a
subscriber and there's going to be a ton
of graph QL content this year so if
you're interested in this stuff there's
going to be so much more I'm gonna be
doing some graph QL and WordPress stuff
I'm going to be doing some graph cool
some graph CMS and all sorts of stuff so
become a subscriber and help support
this free and paid content thanks so
much for watching and I'll see you the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
