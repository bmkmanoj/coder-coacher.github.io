up tubs and today I'm going to show you
some project management stuff within
sublime text 2 and this is really just
how you can use a project in your
sublime text and manage all the files so
they're nice and easy to find and some
nice keyboard shortcuts to help you do
that so first thing I'm going to do is
grab one of my sites that I've been a
maybe not working on but I have worked
on at some point and this is a version
of my site and it's a Drupal site and
all the files that I'm going to be
editing are really in my theme so I'm
going to go to my theme in particular
and inside of here go down here it has
my CSS it has my CoffeeScript my sass my
JavaScript whatever I'm going to grab
this whole folder and I'm going to drop
it onto my sublime text icon and you can
see it didn't open up anything because I
have this double pane view and I have
the sidebar turned off but if we go to
view show sidebar or if your sidebar is
already on you'll see your folder
structure here so this is really nice
because what you can do here is you can
click and I can well as an image file so
you can click and you can go through
everything and I can modify these pages
without even opening in you'll notice
that this tab doesn't even show up if I
double click this file it pops up here
and it will remain up here however if I
wanted to I could just do this make a
change save it and be done okay so
that's really cool uh but what if you
let's say you know you want to edit the
global CSS file is a global sass file
and you don't want to have to go to open
up this folder click global a CSS I mean
that's not that much work but it it
could be a lot of it could be a lot of
work depending on where you are in your
file structure but let's say you want to
do that you can hit command T and what
this is going to do is show you your
files that are in your project and if
you've used a lot of files recently it's
going to actually have the file you just
opened last so if you'll notice we had
gone
- this config file we learn in this info
file this template file these are the
files we had open most recently but we
wanted the global s CSS so I can start
typing global and you can see within two
letters we have global dot CSS and
global s CSS and then just some cached
files I'm going to click this one and
just to enter opens it up ok I'm done
editing this I want to go back to that
node project page I was going on well
you could tab over by doing command one
to tap back or this or you could do
command T again hit down once and you're
already there enter and you could just
start typing away you want to go back a
couple of files ago let's say you close
this file and you close this file and
now you want to go back to one of them
well all you have to do is command T
global there we go and we're open and
it's so quick to change between files
using this command what it's going to do
is there's only going to look at these
profit files that are within your
project so you don't have to worry about
pulling in other files and anything like
that it's just a nice quicker way of
editing your files well let's say you
need to have a new template file and you
don't want to have to go create it you
know create a new file or whatever you
can click on this folder right here and
we can say new file we can just save
this a test dot TPL dot PHP and there
goes puts it in right here you don't I
don't have to tell it to even go in this
folder simply by right-clicking on this
folder and clicking new file and new to
put it in that folder likewise if I need
a new folder I can click on this and I
can say new folder and test folder it's
going to pop up with this dialog right
down here you can hit enter throws this
test folder inside of here and it did
that because I did right-click on this
and say new folder if I would have right
clicked on our project new folder it
would edit at the root level here so I'm
going to click and delete this folder
let's go ahead five one two yes delete
folder and you can also delete files
this way we want to get rid of this one
delete file you can also reveal it in
finder if you like
but it's gone great so we can actually
save this project and we can save this
as a sublime project untitled that's my
project I'm just going to call this test
that sublime project save I'm gonna
close this out no I don't want to say
this don't want to save this going to
close this whole window down well if I
want to open a project project open I'm
going to go to my desktop I'm gonna find
that project the last thing I worked on
here we go open project here it is back
in back and ready to go
so this is how a sublime text 2 handles
keeping your project files together it
keeps everything organized so you can
have a nice file structure to it you can
add files remove files whatever you want
so I hope this helps you manage your
projects a bit more in sublime text 2 if
you have any questions or comments
please leave a comment the video edits a
bit to it our level up tuts
