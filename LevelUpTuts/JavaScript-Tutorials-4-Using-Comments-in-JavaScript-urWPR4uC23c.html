tuts and today we're gonna continue our
JavaScript basics series talking about
comments and comments are not the most
exciting part of JavaScript but it's
something that you're going to use in
every every time you're using javascript
every time you're writing code and it
really takes a document that can be
unreadable and turn it into something
that's easily understood by all so I
definitely urge you to comment your code
well because there's nothing worse than
jumping into a project that somebody
else has worked on or even just looking
at a project that you want to understand
and not understanding the code because
maybe they're using variable names that
aren't exactly what you'd expect or the
code looks different to you so writing
good comments in your code not only
helps other people understand your code
so they can jump into it more quickly
but it also helps other people learn
from your code and see what you're
trying to do so if we jump to our
JavaScript code here we have just a
console log that's just adding three
plus three right and somebody let's say
this is a complex application and they
see this counsel dialog value plus value
and they might not know what we're
trying to do here so we can add a
comment and of course this is a really
basic example because you see value plus
that value and you know that this is
just some addition but if we type
forward slash forward slash you notice
my text editor Gray's it out and in here
we can just say adds value to itself and
this is really useful because this is
you comment right here it's really just
explaining this piece of code and the
way I did this was just adding it one
line above of course this is just a
stylistic choice but this is how you're
going to see it most often if we have
more complex code with functions and if
statements and whatever then you'll see
comments still at
beginning of the tops of lines of things
just sort of briefly explaining what
something does and this is really great
practice to get into so even in your
basic code DQ's to writing comments
because you know if you're new to
JavaScript and you come back to your
code a month later it's gonna it's gonna
you know that light that lights gonna go
off in your brain and you're gonna
remember exactly where your head was
when you're writing this and since this
code doesn't get evaluated in any way so
we save this and we come to our page and
we refresh it you don't see anything
different this this comment doesn't show
up anywhere you can just be really
liberal with your use of comments of
course any sort of oops any text that
you add to your document adds to the
document size and for production things
you're gonna want to minify
and remove your comments but you can do
that with utilities like code kit and
right now
that's not important at all because
we're just trying to learn JavaScript so
in addition to single line comments like
we can say here sets value sure okay and
you don't have to do it on every single
line but in any way that it makes sense
to help somebody understand something go
ahead and use a comment and you may be
thinking well what happens if I have a
comment that's more complex if I want to
explain this entire document or
something like that what I do forward
slash forward slash and then type a
whole bunch type a whole bunch you want
to do another line and then all sudden
it's not a comment right so you could
just do two forward slashes again sure
now you have a two line comment but
there's a way to do multi-line comments
too and this actually is really useful
in case you need to write a lot more
text for some reason if this text was
really important we could have it in
multiple lines just by doing forward
slash and then asterisk and then to
close that multi-line comment we would
do an asterisk
sorry not
Ford and then another Ford / and you'll
notice that what I do let all my coat
coloring comes back and we now have a
multi-line comment this is a multi-line
comment I don't know why I did those in
all caps but it's cool because it works
right so you're gonna see this in other
people's code you're gonna see it in
your own code I highly recommend get
used to commenting your code and just
you know and embracing that style so
this is a quick little bit here
it adds no new functionality to your
skills but by all means we're gonna get
jumping into some cooler stuff in just
one minute here so as always this is
Scott would love a lot of tuts if you
have any questions or comments please
leave a comment the video hurt us about
Twitter level up Tut's let's know what
you're thinking lots of new stuff coming
very soon I promise and thanks for
