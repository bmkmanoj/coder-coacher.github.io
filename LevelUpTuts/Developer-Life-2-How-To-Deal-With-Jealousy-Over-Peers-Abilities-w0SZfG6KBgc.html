tutorials and today i'm joined with
travis nielsen of dev tips that's right
hello everyone and today we're going to
be talking about some web developer life
things and in this series we had at dr.
Courtney to lindsay on before talking
about some of this web developer life
stuff and in this video we're going to
be talking with travis about design
development and what happens when you
encounter your peers and your co-workers
or there may be a little bit better or
they're just doing things that you want
to be doing and how to not feel negative
about that jealousy but how to use that
so a good place to jump off on would be
just sort of uh in this sort of new web
world where we're seeing all this this
great inspiration we have like dribble
we have site inspire we have all this
great things what can you do to not take
those all of that that positive great
stuff coming in and and and feel like
you can't hang right or you can't get
there because there can be so many
people doing so many good things mhm and
you just feel like man I'm not there
right yeah I think I think of first the
first step is to have a healthy respect
of the what creativity is how does
creation happen and when we can
appreciate that creativity and creation
happens in like three pillars the first
one being copying you know like a lot of
people may say like oh you copied this
that means it's bad the truth is that
everything that you've ever learned was
a copy of some other knowledge that
existed in the universe somewhere yeah
and the same thing of with everything
you create as a version of something so
after copying becomes transforming
taking that what the thing that you
learned how to do from like I copied
Scott I learned how to make an exact
replicate of what he taught me and now
it's it's it's my responsibility to
transform it into something new and to
take other things that I learned is the
third part is combining so I'm going to
take what Scott teaches me
take what you know another channel what
McKenzie teaches me what Travis teaches
me and I'm going to combine them and
transform them into something entirely
new and that is that is how create app
creation happens and only in one of
those three ways or combinations of them
and in no other so it's not a bad thing
to look at somebody in and be inspired
by them and even copy them I tell a lot
of newer people in the industry people
who want to learn just just copy just
copy Connie like what you're going to do
is by copying is not just learn how to
technically recreate but focus also your
mind on understanding why the initial
person created that way what inspired
them to do so what problems with their
China what problems were they trying to
solve yeah and in that way you don't
learn just how to create that thing but
you learn how to create yeah yeah yeah I
mean I totally get that too especially
because like as somebody who I know you
come from a design background you're a
designer you know and I'm not
necessarily designer but I want to be a
designer right off looks amazing though
it does not look at as your stuff sir
but like uh so love as good as exactly
but like for me I totally get that
because I mean it everybody is on their
own sort of path and you have to sort of
bring in things yeah to build your own
path right i mean i guess i just totally
makes sense by the way if you look at
the footer of level up tutorials and you
look at the footer of pitchforks latest
redesigned or not no I didn't steal it
hi but I there's like a conduct conde
nast conde nast whatever that is they're
like logo and the thing around was like
that looks nice like take that yeah but
it's just like little pieces yeah and in
in of course in doing so my footer
looked better and it's not like I I
ripped anything off major lead whatever
design colors whatever but just by
taking that little bit i took something
that maybe I felt I wasn't doing a good
job of designing in and I looked at
somebody else to solution they had made
the paragraph of text like the legal
text narrower had the logo offset to
balance it and before I was just like
Center everything will just sent her at
all and it just is like it wasn't
working right so yeah um so in that in
that experience of examining theirs and
going through and just looking at the
margins and whatever I did I learned a
lot about why my footer wasn't executing
and why there's was yeah absolutely and
I mean the same process and the same
principles apply to learning anything
and you're asking me about design by
this the same thing applies to people
who are learning to code a new type of
language or a new tactic like instead of
just coding JavaScript I want to do like
modular type of scripting and
programming like Nick you're going to
learn those patterns I'm going to copy
directly from you until I internalize
those ideas and then I can start or
branch them out and to transform them
and combine them with other ideas yeah
and I mean whether you're learning code
or science or even like you know the
humanities or even like parenting you
know this is we get ideas from elsewhere
we transform them and combine them and
use them for ourselves and kind of add
upon them this is how this is how all
creation and learning happens yeah yeah
I actually in a another arantes AQA or
the other dev life video that we had
done I mentioned a book called a
technique for producing ideas in that
book literally I mean you've summed up
the entire book only like 46 pages it
sounds good I didn't read it it's it's
like it's like five bucks I know is that
all those short books little short book
about basically the creation happens
from the combination of ideas that both
exist two ideas exist you combine them
based on your experiences and there you
have a new idea absolutely um so that
idea of taking but not ripping off right
you know in in Breaking and breakdancing
they call something if you steal someone
else's move something else they created
they call it biting you bite their move
like a moon yeah you could you know you
you're biting no in a and and if you rip
off somebody else's original content
that's like the same as coming out in
performing a song you didn't write
claiming that you wrote it or so yeah
yeah it's it's directly seen as a slight
against that person that created it and
so yeah they always stress
don't bite nibble haha just just nibble
a little bit off yeah and make it your
own yeah just make it your own take the
best of everything you see and add upon
it yeah exactly that's how you know
that's the evolution of art that's the
evolution of code and everything that we
do is just I mean where's i think around
on the the two pound coin in in britain
it says standing on the shoulders of
giants hmm i always loved that because
like how can we see the the whole view
if we're not elevating ourselves somehow
and the best way to do that is stand
upon the knowledge and wisdom and
strength and learnings and efforts and
achievements of those who come before us
yeah I like that a lot yeah yeah good
call you're like oh yeah yeah the
shoulders a giant man all right yeah
cool yeah I like that um so another
thing so we have it there can be like in
in development right there can be a huge
gap between where someone's at and where
someone else is that you can look at
somebody like TJ holla truck I believe
that's how you pronounce his nuts okay
have you ever heard of him no okay so
this guy TJ if you've done any node
programming or anything that you
probably heard his name he created
everything he created like express which
is the routing and web server for node
he created stylist he created basically
a thousand projects that people use in
everybody's like is this guy a human
being like an army of robot right like
some philippic it he absolutely is young
he and I he I don't think he he left
node and he's doing like go stuff either
way you would look at him and just say
like man that guy can really really get
it done he can really like make some
amazing stuff yeah and in it so how how
can you see somebody like that right
who's who's just executing on such a
high level consistently and how does
that not feel overwhelming yeah um what
can you do to say like I will never be
there too i don't i don't need to be
there or whatever
like what's your do you ever feel
overwhelmed by just how good some people
are yes worse yeah yeah all the time I
mean and it sometimes it's fun to get
overwhelmed with how good somebody
else's compared to you you just like me
I a friend coming up when we're both
learning design and kind of working
together and we'd send each other some
things that we saw and we just like I
give up I can't do this yeah I know like
my life is over I can I can never do
what this person is doing but I think
there's there's a few things to kind of
pull out from that um number one is you
don't have to do what they're doing yeah
they've already done it so you did what
they're doing that your it's you're not
adding anything to the general like
value of the human race so you gonna do
your own thing secondly I think that you
can you can kind of like use the
situation it's kind of the difference
between having a setting a fire under
your butt and letting it move you and
motivate you or catching yourself on
fire and burning to death sure there's
there's a subtle difference there sure
right yeah and one will make you run
really fast yeah and one will just you
know you'll die yeah you'll die
discouraged ball of flame exactly
exactly it burn out like flaming
horrible failure um I'll never touch a
computer yeah but so the difference is
how do you react to the heat because the
heat will never go away and so training
yourself to like appreciate and be
inspired by and even like I don't know
like I've been interested in in the idea
of being able to reach out to these
people and not ask things from them or
want you know to bother them or you know
whatever it is but but just to like
appreciate them and one thing that even
more than you can do is try to help them
right so if you want to be involved and
learn at the knee of somebody great the
thing you want to do is give them value
and have them decide to invest in you mm
right so asking someone to give you
feedback or asking someone to help you
with a problem that's not what you want
to do when you're looking at somebody
who you think
is like that I wish I could be like this
person yeah if you want to be like that
person don't don't like suck them dry
yeah feed them right and I doing so
you're going to create this kind of like
recursive loop of inspiration they're
gonna they're going to see that you are
the kind of person that understands how
creativity works that it's like a cycle
and that it's like a part you have to
you have to be actively feeding it and
if you're feeding it's going to come
back to it's like at some principle of
not recursion but möbius möbius strip
what's up it's a mobius strip is like an
infinite ribbon okay it just goes a
rat's like one interconnected ribbon
it's like in the infinity sign yes oh
yeah that works a kind of work I was
thinking reciprocation receive our yeah
yeah the same trendy every sip yeah yeah
yeah absolutely idea is that when you
give somebody value and they see then
they appreciate it and they want to feed
what you're doing because it's giving
them value yeah right yeah yeah so um
that's kind of how you approach those
people that if you want to learn at
their feet you you have to get them to
invest in you yeah yeah definitely cool
yeah so really what it comes down to is
is there's a lot of great stuff
happening and there's a lot of great
people doing these great things and that
doesn't mean that you won't get there
you can't get there or whatever but you
shouldn't worry about getting to where
they are because you're going to be
where you are and it could be an equally
as awesome place or it can be a better
place or completely different it could
be different it's just differently right
like think about five years ago or ten
years ago yes all these people that you
admired and where are you compared to
where they were it's maybe not better or
worse but I'm steering it's different
yeah I mean like the jobs that we have
wouldn't've weren't define ten years ago
no yeah yeah I couldn't have prepared
for anything and haha especially yours
nothing not even like a twinkle in its
dads I
and yeah I was doing like drupal
development for a long time and just
yeah I very different stuff you don't
but yeah so basically I guess the point
is is to not get discouraged and it's a
thing that you might have to practice
and you might have to actively say like
I can get to wherever I want to be I
have to work for it I have to understand
how these other things work you're
you're borrowing you're taking in ideas
you're sucking it in and you're you're
growing from it but what you can't let
it do is come in and weigh you down and
feel like it's too much it's yeah you
have to yeah you have to bend those legs
stand up and totally press that thing
out yeah I was kind of impressed by the
idea that like we're on this train and
it's moving yeah that's going pretty
fast right we're all very active trying
our hardest and then when we look at it
we realized that there's nothing in
front of us there's no tracks and we're
actually building the tracks right in
front of us and as we're traveling down
them and this is a great metaphor for
what it's like to you know to engage in
this type of Industry and this type of
I'd like like mind work right hmm um I I
did not plan to to be where i am now
like I I actually when I was younger
entering industry I wanted to design
books like novel savings right yeah like
I'm completely offended right as i do
cuz that track went this way and i just
built my way yeah so sometimes i get
emails like Chavez how do I um how do I
join Google and the answer is like I
have no freaking clue I don't know how I
got it here yeah my path yeah just have
like I guess in front of me as I was
head down working hard you know and and
there's there is no one path to anywhere
you know like there's general guidelines
in like you can see what other people
have done to get there but generally
what's worked for me or what's worked
for Scott is not going to work for you
but what is going to work for you is
hard work and like built and you know
building that path as you traveled out
building that path as you travel it and
that train is not going to move unless
you want it to yeah to continue that
metaphor right i mean you have to
you have to put in the work you have to
put in the energy or else that track
won't get built and it won't go anywhere
absolutely and you'll just be like look
at all those trains over there yeah
that's when like depression yeah see
this is a great metaphor and yes it's
yeah a big old metaphor right here that
metaphor just leave you little
behind-the-scenes comes from a Mickey
Mouse cartoon yeah better I watched my
kids and I was like yeah oh yeah oh yeah
yeah totally get that right cool alright
so I hope if you are feeling jealous
over other people's accomplishes other
people's design other people's sweet
coding abilities they're like crafting
and like amazing stuff like i hope i
hope that really helps you understand
just don't don't don't hate on it don't
get jealous use it to grow use it to
build that railroad track over and over
again absolutely yep so as always this
is scott and i'm travis is joined by
