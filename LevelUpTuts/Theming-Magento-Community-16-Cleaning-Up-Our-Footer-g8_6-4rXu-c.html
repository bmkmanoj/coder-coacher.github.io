up Tut's and today we're going to take
this page one step further and we're
going to finish up the footer and we're
going to have a nearly ready to go
looking site and in the next lesson
we're going to take care of some of
these inner pages so that we can have a
full skin working for our site you'll
notice system sort of off that way we
can then go further with this Magento
stuff and then really do some more
interesting things with our PHP okay so
to get started as always we want to find
this page and if you would assume from
the last one where we have header and
top menu it's probably going to be
footer P dot HTML and we're just going
to throw that again inside of our HTML
folder then don't forget to make a copy
of it so that the gentle has something
to fall back on so I'm gonna throw this
into our sublime text and we're gonna
edit this and yes I wanted edit it and
we're gonna leave this class for the
container and I'm going to make this div
I'm gonna make this a footer tag again
this is just like the header tag it
doesn't necessarily have to be the main
footer of your website but this sort of
lets your browser know that this is
footer content and we're also going to
give this a class of container like
we've done for the navigation and the
header just to give this the width and
we're gonna Center in everything in our
using skeleton our framework that we're
using so refresh this here it is nice
and good cool cool cool
so let's do some CSS let's check this
out and we have a couple of you else
here we have the first UL we have links
then we have this bugs thing then we
have our address um I'm gonna get rid of
this report all bugs because I mean this
is a production site I don't well this
isn't a production version of this site
but the site's gonna be on the internet
you don't want you might not want this
code that says you know your bug stuff
to be in here you can if you want to be
a nice member for the
to community but professionally AB might
not be the most professional thing
you'll notice there's also this address
tag where we have the address and the
copyright information that's generated
within Magento we can edit that from the
configuration itself so we'll say this
gets rid of the bug stuff and now we
have this get child HTML and these are
going to be footer blocks that we have
saved to go inside of the footer so
let's say this let's refresh cool
so these list items these are in a
static block called footer links and to
do that get there you have to log in to
Magento admin panel and we're gonna be
adding some classes to these to give
them some column spaces and column width
so that they all line up correctly and
everything ok it's gonna be under CMS
static pages and footer links and an old
tutorial we had added this test footer
link I'm gonna go ahead and get rid of
that and I'm gonna show unhide this
editor we have this UL here I'm going to
give this a class and let's check out
our skeleton page and now how many Cubs
we want to give it I'm gonna say this is
going to be 4 columns so code example 4
columns okay you might be getting used
to scouted by now so you might not
always have to keep this page open I
like to keep this page open right now
because we're going back and forth and
just making sure that our classes are
named correctly but once you get a hang
of it you won't need it anymore or not
container receive column okay four
columns and we're going to save this
block okay let's refresh our page okay
this one's good because it now has a
class of four columns but what about
this links right here this other UL
where's that where does that live well
as you know the best way to find this
out is to turn on our developer tools
under system configuration and find out
where this is getting this content
from so let's go down here to developer
we're going to change our current
configuration scope to main website
change both of these to yes and we're
going to save this and when that saves a
little refresh our page
hey let's scroll down here we can see
that this isn't from links P dot HTML so
let's find these links let's come to our
finder and there under page template and
then links P dot HTML so what I'm going
to do is I'm actually gonna grab this
whole folder because we might need these
eventually usually I like to to take the
files as we need them but this is just
easier right now to grab this whole
folder and it goes under page and let's
come to this page folder and we're gonna
go to links and we're going to open it
up yes we want to open this file from
the internet and we're going to give
this a class of again four columns save
save this now let's close this page I
also want to give the footer the same
dark purple color that we gave the nav
container so let's copy this background
and I'm going to say floating I also
don't need this column right background
white anymore in case you notice that
that was hanging out down there and
we're gonna give this a background of
this dark purple and we're going to give
this and the anchors inside of footer
we're all gonna give them a color of
white
and that's pretty much it I wanted I do
want to make a comment in my code here
just to have it hitting buttons like
crazy here okay sometimes it's
incredibly hard to talk and type let's
come back and I want to turn off this
developers tools because now we know our
file no no let's save this and once it's
locked good we should have our footer
looking nice and in fact I'm actually
while this is refreshing I'm going to
add this color of white to not only
anchors in the footer but I'm just going
to say everything in the footer color of
white and we'll refresh this and we
should see our papers looking a little
bit better okay a couple more things
that we need here okay we need to add
this background not on the footer tag
itself but on the footer container that
has my mistake here we have this class
of footer container
and if you caught that one good for you
okay and okay we also want to add a
clear fix if you remember the past
couple of toriel's you remember where we
went over the clear fix we want to add a
div around here div class and this is
just gonna have a clear fix in it and
inside of that we're going to put just
our links just our ULS and we're gonna
give we're gonna say this and we should
be good to go
so let's refresh this page and here we
go we have a footer looking a little bit
better of course there's always some
things we can do to make this look a
little bit nicer we're going to put some
padding inside of this footer container
we want a heading and the top and bottom
we're gonna do about 40 pixels the top
and bottom and then we're going to save
it and refresh looking good now we have
our footer our sites looking a lot more
complete it's looking pretty legit we're
all ready to go now the only problems we
need to solve are what happens when you
go to a product page or any sort of
template that's not using the same
layout see this one's fine you know
we're just need to do CSS thing on this
content here but let's say the furniture
page as a whole just looks bad so we're
going to take this template that we've
made at the next lesson and then fill it
out to the other template versions and
get this thing going as always this is
