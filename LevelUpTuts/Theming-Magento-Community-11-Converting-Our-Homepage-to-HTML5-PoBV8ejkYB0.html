up duds and today I'm going to be
showing you how to take your theme a
little bit further we're going to be
changing some of the templates I'm going
to be I want to be using html5 for this
site all sorts of stuff and we're going
to get in here this is going to start
looking a lot cleaner than it does
already okay okay so if we scroll down
here you'll notice the last time we have
our column in our column here we have
these two that we created last time by
the way if you don't know how to get
this information right here your inspect
all you have to do in Chrome or Safari
Firefox has this mode too but it's a
little bit different you want to click
right-click and then select inspect
element and it's going to bring up this
window yours might be on the bottom
instead of decide if you're on a latest
in a version of Chrome you can change
that down here with this option or I'm
sorry this option and I just usually
like to have it on the side because I
have a water monitor here but okay
that's besides the point if you look
here we had given this class this div a
class of it's a column main we gave it a
class of 13 so it's 1313 columns wide
and therefore it's 760 pixels and that's
defined by our skeleton framework that
we're using and here we have a column
that is three columns wide all right
ehh-ehh caught yeah a column of the site
that's three columns wide and it's 160
pixels wide so when I hover over this
you see this blue box here well what's
the stuff that shot in here below it
what's actually this footer container
which if you hover over looks pretty
confused because that's not where the
footer container should be well if
you've gone over any of the level up tot
CSS course or you have experience in CSS
you'll know that when you float elements
in fact if we click on this differ here
you can look at the CSS as you can see
it's floated left when we float elements
it takes them out of the flow of the
document so we floated the main column
we floated this one there out of the
flow of the document and then this
footer container sneaks up right up in
there and we don't want that to happen
obviously we want this footer to stay
below it so what we need is a clear fix
and luckily for us skeleton comes with a
clear fix built in most other frameworks
do as well if you're using html5
boilerplate or anything it has the clear
fix CSS right in there so I'm not going
to bother putting that CSS mi in a
document cuz it's already here so let's
go to our HTML and the way the clear fix
works is you put a class of clear fix on
the wrapping element that's wrapping
your columns and then they're going to
fill out and it's going to clear the
floats so that the flow of the document
is correct
so in our main container that has this
call to write layout I'm actually going
to get rid of this call to write layout
we don't need that and I'm going to add
clear fix I'm going to save this come
back to our page I'm going to refresh
now and now we have a proper right
column a proper left main column and we
have our footer down here in the bottom
exactly where it's supposed to be it's
no longer confused it's no longer trying
to take up space that it doesn't own so
this is pretty good this is a little bit
better
so what's other things we can do to
clean up this page a little bit well
we're going to be fixing this navigation
a little bit I'll show you how to do a
drop down navigation and we're going to
be cleaning up some of this but let's
clean up some of our HTML if we came in
here it's kind of you know not exactly
not ideal here so what we want to do is
we want to use html5 for this site
because
html5 is the new standard for HTML you
should be using it on your projects now
there's no reason not to even though
they say it's not complete the there's
nothing stopping you from using html5
and it's really going to benefit you to
use it in the long run so use html5
learn it no it's not hard it's just HTML
okay so the first thing we want to do is
take this doctype and we want to get rid
of all this public stuff and just by
specifying a doctype of HTML
we're now using html5 okay and then here
all this stuff I'm going to get rid of
this too and we're just going to have a
standard
HTML tag save that nice and easy cool
okay so what else can we have to have
this a little more you know making sense
what we have a div wrapping everything
it's our container we have a div with
the class of page and then it's our
header so this is the main container of
course this is where we had our clear
fix and it's spanning the entire width
of the page instead of that is we have
the main area and then we have the
column right which we're using for all
sorts of stuff well in html5 you want to
have your tags be a little bit more
semantically correct so instead of
saying that this is just a div that's
its column main we're going to change
this to section and this is now going to
be a section of the site so what that's
really saying is just like it sounds
this is a section where this column
right is now going to be an aside so the
side content doesn't just mean content
that has been pushed to the right or to
the left
it means content that's sort of aside to
the main content it's not the main
content your site people use aside for
things like side navigations or just
like we have our right column but you
could also use the side for other
purposes in this case it makes perfect
sense to use this aside because we're
using this as a nav or just secondary
information also we're going to be
changing some of other tags like and
footer we'll give this a footer tag and
stuff like this and header will give it
a header tag but that will we'll do that
when we get to it also I don't feel as
if we need this page class we can get
rid of this so let's get rid of that let
me just make sure you get rid of this
div and then you have to make sure you
get rid of its closing div as well okay
so it's getting a little bit better we
now have it's still too much little too
many dips for my liking personally but
actually I'm going to remove this
wrapper container it's nice to have a
wrapper class around everything but if
you recall this can
hey nerd class that came with skeleton
gives this a overall width and a margin
that sets it in the center we want our
header to know we don't necessarily want
our header to be bundled inside of that
because we want our header in our footer
to span the entire width the page not
the width that this defines so let's cut
this container class out of here where
we have it and let's put that in instead
of saying main container we're going to
put it right here so now the container
is just wrapping around the main stuff
our header is separate our footer is
separate we can save this and we can
come back to our page and we shouldn't
see a ton different in fact I would
suspect we won't see anything different
at all except for the header content so
here we have our header at spanning the
full width we have our nav and spanning
the full width and now our container our
main stuff is right here it's has the
margin and it's floating in the center
like this just like we want it and the
footer again is going to be entirely
separate okay so that cleans up this
page a little bit more in our HTML and
our CSS in the next lesson we're going
to go further into this we're going to
start changing out our header template
and then we're going to move on to
things like our navigation we're going
to build this out and it's going to be
looking great okay as always this is
