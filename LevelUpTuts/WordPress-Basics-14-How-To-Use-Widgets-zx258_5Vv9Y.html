up Tut's and today we're going to be
talking about widgets in WordPress and
now widgets are something that allows
you to use some more advanced
functionality in your site without
knowing advanced techniques through
coding so here you can do things that
you couldn't normally do without knowing
some sort of PHP and now we can
accomplish some pretty cool stuff so to
get to widgets we need to go to
appearance and then if we click on
appearance we can open this up or you
can just hover over it and get the menu
to go to widgets either/or and what you
see here is we have available widgets on
the left and we have widget areas on the
right and now you can collapse in and
show these all you would like that way
you know you only have to work on the
area that you're working on currently
and you may be wondering you know how do
we use these right so the primary
sidebar the content sidebar in the
footer widget area are all designated
areas in your theme for widgets and now
in a later video I'm going to show you
how you can actually add more widget
areas so if these aren't enough you can
actually add your own but it does take
some coding so if you're not comfortable
with PHP well we're going to go through
it nice and basic so by the end by the
time we get there with the series you're
going to be super comfortable and be
able to add your own widget areas so if
we click on primary sidebar you can see
the widgets we're currently using our
search recent post recent comments
archives categories and meta now I'm
going to open the site in a new tab here
at the front-end and you can see our
search recent posts recent comments
categories and meta let's say we don't
really want this meta information like I
don't want site admin login logout so if
we come over here we can actually drag
meta off now when I dragged it off it
removed it from the primary sidebar and
you'll notice there's no Save button so
we don't have to do anything right now
if we refresh this page that is gone so
just like that we added and remove
some really interesting functionality
now what else could we add here
basically these are all the available
widgets and you can even add more with
plugins now let's say you just wanted a
tag cloud of the most used tags of your
site well we can actually drag this tag
cloud there and we could even throw it
above the archives we could put it
anywhere just by dragging and moving
this around you can change the order of
your widgets so we're just going to
throw it in here and you'll notice when
I click on tag cloud we get a set of
options and it can say anything we can
just say Ted tags just like that so we
don't necessarily have to have it's a
tag cloud right it can say whatever
you'd like now we can have a choose
whether it's tags or categories or
whatever text on t'me you're using I
just want to use tags so let's click
Save now we have tag cloud with the
title of tags notice how any of the
other widgets you can also modify them
you know show more than five posts
display post date or change the title so
let's go ahead and like I said there's
no state button so we don't have to do
anything here after we make that
adjustment we can refresh and we have
our tag cloud first post hello world
hello upsome here's all of our tags
right here so in about five minutes or
less we have modified this sidebar we've
added some bit of functionality that
would normally take in programming and
we have changed it we have modified it
so that just shows you how awesome
widgets are now if we wanted to throw
that same meta information into
something like the footer we can go
ahead and just grab that meta and drop
it in the footer now we can click Save
and let's come back here and refresh our
page if we scroll down we now have that
meta information in the footer and we
could adjust the styling on that with
our CSS as we needed to if it didn't
necessarily look like how you'd like it
to great so that is the basics of
widgets feel free to play around with
them and see what you can make see how
you can adjust them on your page and
just generally what you can accomplish
in the next video we're going to be
hanging about menus and then we're going
to get into some more menu features then
we're going to get into installing and
using plugins and then that way we can
show you how to download and get more
widgets than our what is WordPress gives
you out of the box in these available
widgets because you can actually
download widgets from WordPress the
plug-in repository and add even more
functionality like slideshows and stuff
like that so check it out we're going to
get going and then after all of that
stuff we're going to get into some more
advanced and more intermediate features
of WordPress so as always this is Scott

questions or comments please leave a

Facebook or Twitter around the level up
