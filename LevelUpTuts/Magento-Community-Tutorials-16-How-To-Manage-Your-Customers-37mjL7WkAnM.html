level of Tut's and today I'm going to be
talking about the customer section of
the admin panel we're going to go over
how to create a customer from the admin
account we're going to go to how to
manage your current customers and we're
going to show you how you can see who's
online online right now first off I want
apologize for that little bit of white
noise in the background it is over 100
degrees here today and it is super hot
so even though I have the AC running I
am dying
so I have to have the fan on I hope it's
not too bothersome I think it's not too
loud but if it is too loud leave a
comment on the video and I will rerecord
this without the fan on a day that is
not so hot okay so first off we're going
to go to customers manage customers and
here are the customers all of the
customers that have registered to your
site if you notice you can export them
to a CSV this is really helpful if you
are moving your Magento site let's say
you have a new install and you want to
have your customer accounts on your
other install or let's say you're moving
from Magento community to go or
Enterprise or moving from any of the
other versions you can export a CSV and
import it in your new version of Magento
or you can modify it to whatever you
know format you need to to be on your
new site and you can import there and
have your customers and order history
and all that good stuff okay so that's
right up here just CSV export it's a
nice and cool function if you're going
to be you know moving sites or moving
your data so here's all your customers
it tells when they've joined what
website if you have a multiple site
their email the group their name their
ID let's actually click on this John Doe
one which was created for us by Magento
and we're going to get to see what we
can edit here so if you see this this is
a little bit more of a you know more
like a dashboard type thing lifetime
sales in about anything average sales
you can see their recent orders of
course there are none what's in their
shopping cart what's in their wish list
cool ok account information so you can
actually you know put in your
information here if you want to let's
say something happened and their email
is no longer something they have acts
us too but they need to change their
account information that I can't you
know recover their password because of
that you could go in here and change
their email for them you could fix any
mistakes if somebody's always you know
has all son has a problem with their
account and cannot seem to do it
themselves their address you can add
their address for them like I said let's
say somebody calls in and they want to
place an order and you want to have it
done through your website well you can
just do all that in here I'll show you
how to create a new customer in a second
but basically this is all of their
information that you need to see you
know it's in the shopping cart wishlist
and you know their newsletters that
they've received a product reviews that
they've done product tags you can see if
that particular user it's just sort of
like spamming your site or something
these are the products that John Doe has
tagged himself so that's really cool
let's say yeah you could tell if an
account was a spam account because
they're doing something like that you
could probably block them or something
okay so customers let's go back to
manage customers so here we have here
and you'll notice in our actions you can
subscribe people that need the
newsletter here we want to subscribe
everybody so we could just say subscribe
everybody to the newsletter submit and
now everybody is assigned to that are
subscribed to the newsletter cool so
let's add a customer really quick let's
click add new customer and you can say
which store they're at will say main
store general it will give them a name
this is going to be nuts God just that
me okay okay cool just an email I mean
there's like a billion things let's do
my Scout at level up okay and notice how
the only things that you have to fill on
are the email last name first name and
this stuff up here you don't have to put
in their gender or whatever if you know
this and you want to have it that's cool
you could have an auto-generated
password or you could just create one
but if you type in here you know it's
not hashed out or anything I want to you
know it saves in the database will be
secure but so that's why I'm not going
to put a real password in here because
I can't think of one okay so you can
also add their address here notice how
you don't have to save their address
right now you can always add it later
they can add themselves or whatever so
somebody's doing a call over the phone
you want to fill all this information
out you can create the account add in
their stuff you've probably already
taken their credit card information so
then you can then save this customer
okay so I'm not going to add an address
because that's you know not necessary
right now but let's click Save customer
ok password is not long enough okay save
customer and now they're going to be in
your customer list if this saves okay
okay so now we have this new noun Scott
who's a customer on our site we created
them ourselves they didn't have to do it
okay that's neat so let's check out
customer groups so if you want to keep
customers in all sorts of groups let's
say let us say they have not logged in
general retail wholesale you want to
assign the specific customers certain
prices and stuff like that you could do
that so let's take our other customer
and give them a wholesale account so
this customer we're going to assign them
to assign it to a customer group and
when the group is going to be wholesale
so submit so now this customer is going
to see wholesale prices if you have set
that up let's go back into customer
groups and create a new one so add new
customer group we're going to call this
let's say customer group is going to
just be new group and they're tax class
you can set this up we don't have any
other tax classes set up so right now
it's just we retail customer once we get
into tax classes I'll show you how to
set those up so let's just save this so
we now have a new group that we can
assign somebody to that's cool so now I
notice how I have this site open I'm on
this page if we go to customers online
customers it's going to show you who's
browsing your site at the moment right
now um actually the client who I did a
Magento site for who leaves this open
almost all day and just refreshes it
because they just love seeing who's on
their site at the moment you can see
somebody with this IP address which of
course is me it's a guest right now if I
were to log in under any of these
accounts it would actually give the
login name the first name email all this
stuff so that's really neat you can see
who's on your site right now IP
addresses and you can see what they're
doing okay so that is how do you manage
your customers view them online
basically any of the things you want to
be able to do with your customers once
we get into you know order placing will
place an order with one of our customers
and I'll show you how to you know go
through the invoice process and see
those orders later on but this is how
you manage your customers once again
this is Scott with level up
