up tuts and today I'm going to show you
how to install a theme using the
WordPress interface and we're lucky
because this is really easy so that's
one of the things WordPress handles
really well is making tasks like
installing and changing your theme as
well as installing plugins and changing
out plugins and things like that it
makes it really easy so to do this all
you have to go to is appearance and then
themes now we have our active themes
you'll notice if we click activate on
2013 and then we then come to the front
end of our website you'll see it's
already using this completely different
theme which was the the default theme
for 2013 now if we were to activate 2012
of course refresh eyesight would already
be using 2012 now you can even do a live
preview which is just going to give you
a quick preview of what your site would
look like we can click cancel on that
one now you'll notice we have this big
button here and it says add new theme
now let's click this and we can add a
new theme based on searching in the
WordPress repository here for themes so
we can look at all sorts of things we
can look at the newest themes we can
look at recently uploaded or featured
themes and you know a lot of these maybe
are going to be like theme engines that
allow you to build upon or some of them
are going to be or it could even be a
complete theme like you're seeing a lot
of these so what happens if we go
through this and we find something we
like so this responsive theme this one
looks pretty nice it's using what looks
like some variation of like Twitter
bootstrap or something so we have the
option to see some more details about it
see it's like star rating and just a
description text or we can even see a
preview which is going to just take a
second
and it's just going to more or less show
a larger version of the site it's not
necessarily your content
in the site here so what happens if we
actually wanted to install this theme
well luckily it's just as easy as
clicking this Install Now button and
you'll notice we get this message saying
download install package now if you
don't have proper permissions for the
directory it might be asking you for
your FTP information here and then of
course you'd want to gather your FTP
information and put it in there now it's
downloaded and installed the theme and
that took about one second so now we can
click activate or you could go to your
themes and click activate from there now
let's come to our home page and refresh
once more and fall out we've installed a
theme it's responsive you'll be able to
see it if we you know change the window
up here there you go you can see it
responding like that like so um but that
was incredibly easy now what sort of
tools do they give you to find themes
right so you can even search for what
sort of color you want you want a dark
theme maybe a black theme I want two
columns three columns I want it
responsive I want it to be using these
these particular features or plugins to
be built for those things maybe you have
a particular subject photo blogging
perhaps like if we click photo blogging
and we just go find themes it's going to
find us all of the themes that are you
know for photo blogging and then you can
then look through them and sort them and
find which ones are going to be perfect
for you so this is how you install a
theme from within WordPress like I said
it's super easy we did it in no time and
it's so easy that you can install a
bunch of themes and try them out and
then delete them if you don't like them
whatever you want so try it out install
some themes see what you can do in the
next video I want to show you how to
install a theme that you've downloaded
from somewhere else
that's not from this maybe you've
purchased it from somewhere you just
have a theme and you need to install it
so as always this is Scott with level of
cuts

see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
