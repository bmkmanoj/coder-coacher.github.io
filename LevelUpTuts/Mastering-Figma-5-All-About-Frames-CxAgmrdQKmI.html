tutorials and in this video we're gonna
be going over on the core concepts in
figma which is frames and now you might
know frames by different names and other
design applications but a frame is
basically a way to contain your design
on the canvas where you can organize
your designs into several frames on one
canvas so let's get going with that
right now
okay so we've now managed to get this
far without truly talking about frames
and I mentioned before that they're
basically art boards if you've used art
boards I honestly it's been so long
since I've used illustrator at this
point I don't remember what they're
called but I assume that something along
those lines now we have all these sort
of shapes and around here I'm gonna
start to delete some of this stuff
obviously we don't need to keep it so
let's go ahead and delete it yeah let's
just delete it now what I'm not going to
delete is this area over here well I'm
not going to delete it just yet I'm
gonna work with it so what we want to do
here is I want to simply just create a
new frame and you'll notice if we hover
over this icon in the top left looks
sort of like an art board or a frame
you'll see that just as frame tool and
if we hover over this arrow we get a
drop down for all of our region tools
this is allows us to basically set up
regions to export things or just contain
them and a frame tool is basically just
a way to contain your design inside of a
frame I mean consider this we have a
giant canvas here this canvas is
infinitely expanding and maybe not
necessarily infinite but it's it's it's
able to expand considerably right now
much more than we'll ever need to grow
from but typically your designs don't
exist in this giant space that's
uncontainable right you typically have a
a contained dimensions that you're
working with and that's very common so
what we're going to want to do is select
the frame tool to set up our frame and
you'll notice instantly we get some
default sort of presets in here we have
things like the iPhone iPhone 7 plus
iphone se iPhone or Galaxy s8 Google
pixel LG g3 no
one thing I love about figma and I've
mentioned this maybe once or twice
before it's that they do not exclude a
big problem of mine in in sketch was
always that it was Apple everything now
granted they did add some some Android
stuff at some points but for the most
part it was OSX only and iOS for
everything and so that was always kind
of a pain for me to have to look
elsewhere for this stuff and as an
Android user myself I really appreciate
having these tools available for not
just one platform to me that really
stands out as a company who's wider
thinking than just okay for Mac people
right and not that iOS is bad or Android
is better or whatever everyone has their
own opinions and no needs and even
though I prefer Android it doesn't
necessarily mean that one is better than
the other so because of that I'm glad
that a whole host of variety of devices
is available here especially in the
phone section right so you can see we
have a whole bunch of different
dimensions from our pixel sizes of all
of our different phones our tablets and
desktop now we're gonna be talking about
desktop and this one because this layout
that we're gonna be working with is a
little bit more desktop II than mobile
layout II and we're going to get down to
mobile layouts as well as we go and we
talk about things like constraints and
stuff like that
so don't worry this is not permanently
desktop now umos we have two options
which is desktop HT @ 1440 by 1024 or by
1024 by 1024 now here we can basically
select either of these now 1440s PI the
widest you're gonna design to I mean you
could design for an ultra wide monitor
or something like that I actually have
an ultra wide monitor but I can't
imagine designing for one because if
that's like such a small audience maybe
at some point right but let's go ahead
and select desktop HD and as you can see
upon selecting it it just dropped it on
our canvas now we could have dragged a
frame just like we would have any other
shape click and drag here's our frame it
can be any dimensions right so you're
not limited to these presets by any
means as you can see this desktop HD is
pretty big
and what we were working before from
before here was really just sort of an
estimate of what a desktop would look
like but here we actually have our pixel
dimensions inside of this giant canvas
now what's cool here is that we can
basically just move our stuff over and
when we move it over it's going to be
contained in our frame you'll notice
that right now all of our layers are
entirely aligned with each other that
means they're basically of equal
containment right none of these layers
is containing each other they're all on
equal footing on the same level of the
hierarchy what we want both our header
and our background image we want these
to be on our desktop here and we want
them to be contained with it so much so
that anytime any of these bleeds outside
of it it will be immediately cropped for
us so let's go ahead and one way we
could do that I'm gonna have two objects
here so through these two different ways
we can drag this rectangle on to desktop
HD and you'll notice let me zoom in here
actually let me zoom in before I do this
you'll notice that when I drag this on
here the moment it becomes a part of the
frame two things happen look in the
left-hand corner in your layers property
you'll notice that the rectangle is now
underneath an arrow that says Desktop HD
meaning that it's actually in the
hierarchy of things inside of desktop HD
the moment I pull it away enough you'll
notice the cursor crosses the plane here
it's now actually back to where it was
once again the cursor of the drag
crosses onto the frame and we now also
on the canvas get this sort of dot dot
dot dash line around our frame this is
indicating to us that this is going to
drop into this frame okay I'm gonna put
it up top here you notice there's a nice
little snapping going on we can always
turn that off it's too hard to show on
this monitor but you'll have some red
X's that are showing you if things are
snapping correctly a really cool feature
okay so check this out we now have our
rectangle inside of our canvas I'm going
to click and drag all the way till it
snaps to the end
next thing I want to move this into the
canvas now again we could do it the same
way or we could do it in our layers
property simply by clicking the
rectangle and dragging it underneath
Desktop HD now you'll notice a couple of
things have happened it's become
invisible basically because the the
frame is the bounding of this frame
right I mean outside of this frame if
something is a part of it it should be
cropped off just like any sort of photo
that you put into a frame is cropped off
at the edges of a frame right hence the
name and you'll also notice in our
right-hand column
our X property is now at negative 797 or
whatever yours may be it's it's negative
because it's off the canvas right and we
could move this onto the canvas simply
by hitting 0 on X we don't have to rely
and click and drag for everything and
and more times than that I'm actually
manipulating numbers for instance you
know I could move and drag this up top
here until it snaps that's all I'm good
or I could zoom in I could select this
and I could actually adjust the Y value
until it gets to the point where I want
it to be now granted you're not getting
sort of that the snapping that you are
but it's also a little bit more safe
mathematically if you know maybe like
the headers height you can do some math
there either way the tools are here to
help you now you remember in the last
video I set up this image to be tiling
which is really great because we're
gonna be using this as our background
here and I can drag this all the way
here and I'm gonna make this a little
bit less tall unless elect my fill I'm
gonna increase the tile size on here
just ever so slightly maybe get like 3
rows in here that way we're not seeing
way too much repetition ok so check it
out we now have our objects in a frame
and we've learned a couple of things
that when they're in a frame they're
contained in our layers right but also
their properties and their dimensions in
terms of positioning are actually now
positioned relatively to the frame which
is super nice because obviously we don't
want sort of some nebulous number here
that's often spaced of whatever this
global canvas
so we want to be able to say hey this
should be at zero zero and that would
position it in the top left corner
working in these numbers is really super
important
now you also notice something brand new
that we haven't seen before it's gonna
be a topic that we cover a lot in in
this series because it's one of the
figmas most powerful and interesting
features so that have constraints which
is immediately below here so remember
working in the last video we had layer
fill stroke and all this stuff but we
didn't have constraints and that's
because constraints relate directly to a
frame you're basically saying hey when
this frame resizes what should this
thing do right and right now the
constraints are set up so that it pins
it to the left and to the top now we
could pin this to the left and right and
then a little shrink in size there's a
whole bunch of cool stuff there like I
said we're gonna be going over that
stuff in great detail because
constraints along with components are to
the biggest most powerful awesome
excellent features within Sigma okay so
here we have our frame and just like
that things have gotten a little bit
better and if we were to remember we saw
this when this was off canvas by the way
it was invisible if we were to drag this
over only the parts that are off canvas
are invisible I mentioned it's like a
frame same concept applies here so it
doesn't have to be entirely off the
frame to have that like clipping going
on this is this functions exactly like
it does in other applications now what's
cool here is that we get sort of free
exporting with frames if we were to
select the name desktop HD from the
frame or we were to simply selected from
our layers bar we could come over here
and select export and then we could
export the desktop HD and it would save
an image of this entire frame for us we
didn't have to do any slicing we didn't
have to say hey you know export all this
stuff it's going to export the frame and
the frames bounds right that's it
obviously I keep saying this exports or
something we're gonna cover and create
depth because it's a topic with great
depth but also one that can be super
easy now frames for the most part
function like a lot of things in figma
if we were to select our frame we could
do command D or control D on Windows and
duplicate the frame
it's gonna duplicate it in everything in
it we can also rename the frame let's
say we don't like desktop HD in fact
this is a mock-up of the level up tuts
pro page I have I can actually show you
my one that I designed it on right now
let me head to my figma file that I work
in here for just different design ideas
I work with this is just sketches and
stuff like that and as you can see here
I have my design that I've done here for
the pro page and where we'll be
recreating this a little bit over the
next few videos just because it's a
design I like it's something I made and
it's gonna show off a lot of really cool
features because I used all of the
features that figma has to offer in this
you also notice my layers are pretty
sloppily named here that's just because
these are quick sketches and wasn't
intentionally turning into a big design
if I were to be doing this for a client
or working further on it I would
obviously be cleaning this up
considerably and we'll be doing so when
we work in figma so as you can see here
let's go ahead and start that by
renaming this and this is just going to
be Pro sign up okay and the pro sign up
aspect of this is basically hey this is
a signup page for the level up tutorials
Pro program oddly enough you can get the
series for subscribing to becoming a
level up Pro so let's do one more thing
I'm gonna start moving some of these
layers around and renaming them we
briefly touched on renaming things just
by right now with this Pro sign up I'm
putting the header rectangle up top here
and the background billboard right here
I'm going to rename the header simply by
double clicking on the word rectangle
three and say header I'm going to double
click on the rectangle three and name it
background okay and this is super cool
okay so in the next video what we're
gonna do is I'm gonna get started
showing you some of additional features
that may be kind of simple and we're
gonna build into figmas more powerful
features I mentioned in the interface
overview like a whole bunch of stuff and
you'll you'll see time and time again
that figma is really deep there's a lot
here so at any given point if the next
video isn't something
that you're super excited about skip
ahead there's a whole ton of content
here if you want to jump to comments or
you want to jump to prototyping mode or
code mode or any of that stuff just do
it you know these ideas well build upon
each other you can always come back but
for the most part there's a lot of great
stuff to learn in figma and I hope you
continue to watch and learn if you'd
like to complete this series along with
all of the excellent stuff that you will
learn in it head to level up tutorials
comm forward slash store store that
level up tutorials com they take you to
the same spot and you can purchase this
series or become a level of pro and get
streaming access to this you get all of
the figma files f IG files from this
series or any sort of updates or new
releases that come with updates and
figma now I say this because I know
figma is a new product and even though
it's really deep and there's a ton to
learn here there's a ton coming and
there's a lot of really great features
maybe your favorite feature from your
favorite application might be missing I
can assure you I don't know if it's on
the way or not but from what I've seen
the team at figma is rapidly improving
this which is already a beast of a
product so fire up the next video we're
going to talk about some things like
drop shadows and filters and stuff we
haven't talked about on individual
layers so far so we're gonna get into
some more interesting layer properties
as we start to build this design out I'm
gonna show you exactly what I did to
build my design and we're gonna do it
the right way so again if you want to
learn the finer points of Sigma while
doing a practical design purchase this
story series become a LevelUp pro all
that good stuff thanks so much for
watching and I'll see in the next one
