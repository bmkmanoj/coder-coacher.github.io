up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
one of my very favorite features about
sublime text - this is an add-on called
package control and what package control
is is it allows you to browse a
catalogue of all sorts of different
packages and extensions for sublime text
- extremely easily and there's all sorts
of great stuff from different types of
code coloring - a code completion you
have like if you're working in Drupal
there's Drupal snippets and stuff like
that or you can even download themes
there's all sorts of really great stuff
and it almost is like too much to know
about without just like going through
and looking at some of them so we're
going to get started with installing
sublime text package control so the site
is w bond net slash sublime underscore
packages a slash package underscore
control I'll try to link to this page in
the video comments so you can check it
out for yourself so we're going to click
this install button right here and this
is going to give us some instructions we
have to take this little bit of text and
we have to paste this into our site or
into our I'm sorry into our application
so you can follow those manual
instructions if you'd like or you can do
it the nice easy way and you press
control + tilde and you can get this
dialog window to pop up so here I'm
going to go to my sublime text new
control tilde and this line pops up down
here I'm going to paste this bit in here
that they give you I'm gonna hit enter
and it says please a please restart
sublime text to finish installation all
right well I already have it installed
but I'm going to quit this anyways just
so you can see and now let's load up
sublime text - and cool so how do we
access package control well you can
click around here you can see you should
see this package control button right
here if we click this it opens up this
menu or you can do it the computer
shortcut version and you can do command
shift P and then you can start typing P
for package and you'll have some
different options here there's package
control HED channel and repository
disabled packages discover packages
enable install what you're going to want
to do is you're going to want to find
install package because this is where
the listing of available packages are
and you can see just from here there's
all sorts of different stuff for here's
an ActionScript 3 if you're using
ActionScript 3 if anybody is any more
all sorts of great stuff and you can
really just go I mean they'll spend the
you can spend forever looking at these
different packages now there's just so
many different ones yours even Adreno
snip snippets if you're using Audrina or
just really great stuff in fact I'm
going to be detailing a lot of these
packages in further tutorials but just
know that this list goes on and on and
you can really just click through these
and find something really cool well
let's find something we want and install
it so I found this 8 this command this
terminal command and this one lets you
launch terminal from a specific file
that you're on and it's going to take
you right to that uh the the current
file or the project root folder in
terminal so I'm going to click the enter
to install you can see it's a little
message at the bottom right corner it
says package terminal successfully
installed so now you might be wondering
well how do how do I use this well one
way you can see this is you can go to
package settings and you can find your
package and then you can find the key
bindings the default key bindings and
these are going to tell you what the
commands do so open terminal project
folder is super shift alt T so super is
actually the button with the windows on
it a few using a Windows computer and if
you're on a Mac it's the command button
so we're going to do command shift T on
a file and it's going to open it up so
let's go to our local XML file this is
just a file that had open from a Magento
tutorial that we're doing I'm going to
do shift command T and what we should
see is terminal looks like it's popping
open for us and here it is and
if I do an LS in terminal it's going to
show that I'm in the directory where the
local XML file is this could be
extremely handy if you're using terminal
a lot and you want to go back and forth
between let's say you need to run some
commands or something but this is really
great or maybe you have SAS and you want
to tell SAS to watch this directory or
this file so this is just one of the
many mini packages for real it will take
you forever to get through them so check
them out let me know if you find any
really cool ones I'm using a lot of SAS
based ones and stuff like that
CoffeeScript added all that stuff but
there so just let me know if you find
any that our worth are worth in noting
