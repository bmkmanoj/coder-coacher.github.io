up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be talking about why it's
important to load your main javascript
file at the bottom of your page rather
than in the head of your page to
increase loading times so let's get
going on that right now
this will be a fairly quick one nothing
too crazy here however I want to stress
the importance of putting your main
JavaScript files or what should be your
main JavaScript file at the base of your
document now if you take a site like
Reddit and you view the source which by
the way is an important thing to look at
whenever you are sort of wanting to
learn more about websites it's just take
any sort of website like drupal.org in a
Mac its command option you or you can
just right click inspect element and you
can look at the source of the page now
checking out the difference between
these two it looks like reddit minifides
their HTML where Drupal has chosen not
to minify their HTML it's not a huge
deal there but let's take a look at
something that both of them are doing we
can scroll down and if you get to the
very bottom of these pages yeah you'll
see assets and links and images and
stuff like that
but at the very bottom of the page
you'll see the main javascript files
essentially for this
there's several main javascript files
and and to be honest without knowing
more about this site i can't really tell
you why they've broken it out but i'm
sure it's for a good reason in addition
to some inline javascript here where
reddit if you also look at the bottom we
have this reddit initialize j/s this
anit english guess and this is probably
just some initial j/s they want to load
before the rest of the page but if you
head to the bottom you will see their
main javascript file and this is
probably going to be the the meet of
essentially the JavaScript used on this
site right and you might be thinking
well why do all these people use their
javascript at the bottom of the page in
fact it's almost always right here right
before the closing body tag here we have
jQuery being loaded we have foundation
we
have homecontroller min which is you can
see a minified javascript file even
though it's not very large here we still
have everything being loaded at the
bottom and typically if you're seeing
any JavaScript being loaded at the top
you're seeing moderniser being loaded at
the top or some sort of initializer no
modernizer if you're not using it or not
familiar with it it's a library that
basically is a feature detection instead
of browser detection so it lets you know
what features the browser is using and
per their requirements it needs to be
loaded at the top but what does
everybody else load their main
javascript files at the bottom of their
application well the main reason is
simply because of loading so when your
website loads it hits a JavaScript file
in your header it needs to download that
file and your browser typically won't
download that in parallel with other
things and that's going to cause your
site to take a little bit longer to load
also most of the scripts that you're
running that don't need to do anything
until the rest of the Dom load so it
your scripts most likely need the HTML
to load in the first place before they
can even be useful so what's going to
happen is your website will load all the
CSS it's going to load the HTML and it's
going to make things load up the
essential aspects of your website are
going to load faster and then once it's
loaded all that it's going to come down
and it gets to the bottom of your page
and it's going to load the main
javascript file at this point the HTML
and CSS has already been loaded so the
download time it takes for that file
isn't going to harm the loading of the
rest of your page so in addition to
taking all of your JavaScript files and
sort of smashing them into one like we
had mentioned before to reduce the HTTP
connections you should actually be
putting them at the very bottom of your
site so that way things like your Google
Analytics and any sort of click
functions or any sort of JavaScript you
have that needs to be loaded are being
loaded the very last to speed up loading
time now this is a super easy change
that you can make in your site to
increase your page speed and your page
speed rank so if you have your main
javascript files
take it out and put it just before the
bottom of the body you made you see a
faster loading time on your site
immediately based on what your
JavaScript is doing ok so that's several
tips now on JavaScript you want to
minify them you want to concatenate the
files to reduce your request and you
want to put them at the bottom of your
HTML for loading order now these are a
lot of the low-hanging fruit they're
easy things to fix and some of them will
have a larger impact than others now in
the next few videos we're just gonna be
going down this list and checking out
these items in the PageSpeed that can
potentially increase the overall score
and loading time of your website so as
always this is Scott we level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments if you come in the HTML or hit
me up at Twitter or Facebook I level up
tutorials I'd love to hear from you
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
