up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be creating our web pack
configuration file now this
configuration file is going to be very
very basic and like I said this isn't
going to be a full-on tutorial about web
pack however I will be explaining what
I'm doing as I'm doing it by the end of
this we will have a web site going
although it's going to be very blank so
let's get started right now we should
have all of our dev dependencies and our
dependencies ready and now we can go
ahead and start with our config file for
web pack we can just name this simply as
web pack dot config is now in here we're
gonna use module dot exports so
basically in our exports here we just
have an object now we have things like
entry that's essentially just going to a
point to our actual development code
which of course we don't actually have
anything right yet so what we can do is
simply have a new folder in our base and
it can be SRC and inside of SRC we can
make a new file and this can simply just
be kept js' I'm using a capital a not
that it matters I know we have the
output of this is going to be app dot J
s with a lowercase a and that might get
confusing you might want to change it
yourself I personally do not mind and
then we're going to be looking at for
the entry is simply just an array and
inside of the array we're gonna have a
string with the path to app dot J s the
path being dot or word / sr c /a p-- dot
j s okay so this is where it's going to
essentially look where our project is so
we're snap j s and we're going to then
define the output which we already know
is going to be lowercase
app J us in the root of our project
because that's where hTML is going to be
looking for that script so we need to
define webpack to say hey outputted
stuff in to the home directory so we can
save path
then we knew to underscores der name
comma now we want file name which is
going to be the name of the outputted
file which is going to be a string which
we just want to be a pas remember this
is what index dot HTML is looking for a
pious in the root of our project
structure okay so we now have app that
is in our output and it should be
outputting to the root
now once more we have a comma and the
last is going to be module we could type
in module Olin and module is going to be
looking for loaders which so we can say
inside of this object we can say it
loader and then loader colon is going to
be looking for an array of an object now
inside of this object will say test now
test is where we're going to be saying
hey /x / j sx question mark dollar sign
forward / and this is just basically a
pattern to say look for any JSX files
now what did we do with j sx files well
we have a loader and that particular
loader is going to be babble so babble
is now going to handle any sort of j sx
file that we need and it will compile it
correctly know who's gonna wrap all this
off at the semicolons I like to make
sure I have those and although we have
nothing really going on here let's
actually just try to run our simple dev
server so if we head to our terminal we
can actually look in a particular folder
in our node packages but what we want to
say is node modules
inside of node modules we're going to be
looking for a dud in folder ODOT bin and
we're going to be now looking for
webpack
- dev server
so you should be able to find inside of
node modules been web pack dev server
and that's going to run our dev server
like I said this is a simple dev server
and it looks like bundle is now valid so
now if everything went alright you
should be able to head to your browser
and to localhost colon 8080 and you'll
see that your app is loading you're not
getting any sort of errors the only
error I'm getting a thing that I can't
find a favicon and that's quite all
right now if we had to sublime text we
do not see fjs here but what we do see
is that it is in fact loading app that
j/s correctly and it has some real basic
web heck stuff in here we don't need to
quite worry about but as you can see the
applications correctly getting app that
j/s despite it not actually writing any
sort of file which is good for us but
all we need to know is that it is in
fact getting this file and that means we
can move on so what you should have
again is a package JSON file that looks
like this with these versions if you're
not using these versions I cannot make
sure that it's going to work we have web
pack config at j/s which is going to be
looking like this make sure you have all
of your commas your brackets and
everything completed strings where there
should be strings and things like this
where we have a regular expression here
make sure this is all correct cool so
now that we have that ready we're going
to be starting to dive into app that Jas
and AB dot J s is where we're going to
start defining our components and we're
going to then be breaking out those
components into new smaller components
we're gonna start talking about how you
start thinking and developing in
components you know parent-child
relationships that sort of thing so as
always the Scott would level up tutorial
so if you have any questions or comments
if it come in the video hit me up at
Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials I'd love to hear from you
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
