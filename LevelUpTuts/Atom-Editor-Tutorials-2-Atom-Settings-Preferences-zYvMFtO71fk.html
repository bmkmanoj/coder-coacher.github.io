up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be doing sort of a walkthrough
of different settings and preferences
available within the Preferences menu of
Adam let's get started on that right now
Adam installed and we've opened it up
and we've seen some of the intro screens
and some of the nice things it has to
offer here so let's check out some of
the Preferences and options that you
have available in Adam now what I really
like about Adam is if we head to
preferences
you have a nice visual preferences
screen now that's always been a pet
peeve of mine and something like sublime
text where you're simply just editing a
JSON object which is great but it really
doesn't beat a nice laid out interface
or anything like this where it's all
organized and you have all the options
available here you don't have to go
copying and pasting settings from JSON
files so that's definitely a plus for
atom and you can see we have some core
settings you can trigger the system
audio beeping you can remove that
destroy empty panes so that when a pane
is removed the pane is removed as well
we'll get into that more with views and
you can see some default encoding stuff
a lot of the stuff you're not going to
want to change you can have ignored
names by default it's going to ignore
get dot SV NDS store underscore and then
anything else thumbs dot DB because
these are files that you're pretty much
never ever ever going to want to touch
when you're editing a project so I have
them show up in your sidebar and that's
the setting I'd like to have on sublime
text as well so having these in here by
default is great thing that we don't
have to do ourselves manually and we
have project home this is going to be
where projects are assumed to be located
now of course you want to change that
based on where you're actually storing
your projects
for instance mine is in flesh users /
Scott talansky
/ sites /
that's where I keep my sites in
particular okay so now we also have
editor settings like auto indent auto
indent on paste which we'll want here I
really like Auto indenting on pasting so
then we also have backup before saving
which is unchecked we have confirmed
check out head revisions this allows you
to change the font family that you're
using for your editor that way if you
want to have a new font for the editor
you can change it in here and like I
said we'll get into some of this when we
get into actually customizing now here's
a feature I like scroll pass to end this
is a feature I use on all my tech
scissors allows you to scroll past the
end of the file it allows you to scroll
past the end of a file we also have
things like software wrapping there's a
lot of stuff in here and we're going to
go over it a little bit more once we
start customizing some of this now it's
nice here we have all of our key
bindings here so if you don't like any
of your shortcuts you can quickly and
easily find them now it's nice that they
have this whole searching interface I
know I've been in some applications
where the amount of key bindings is
absolutely massive and just totally
unjust really hard to find what you're
lookin to modify here so for some reason
if we wanted to change paste we could
just simply look at paste and you can
see that paste is of course command V
okay in addition we have packages which
is another thing that's great that some
sort of package manager is built into
atom by default so no longer do we have
to download a third-party package
manager and the interface is quite a bit
nicer because it gives you access to
seeing how popular packages you can
quickly enable/disable packages you can
see community packages you can filter
your own packages stuff like that here
and so these installed packages are all
of the ones that we have installed right
now out of the box and we can add more
with this install plus down here
likewise with themes these are are the
themes that we're using one dark light
we can see installed themes to see which
ones are actually here and you can look
at some core themes in addition we can
install some new ones with this install
updates checks for updates just like
you'd expect and install allows you to
search for new things for instance if we
wanted to find some material design
stuff we could type in metier
and let's check this themes and it's
going to look for some things like a
syntax theme based off of material
design we also have atom material UI we
have a bunch of these but what's great
about this is you can quickly see just
how popular these packages are so the
fact that this atom material UI has a
200,000 downloads will show you that
this one in particular is quite a bit
more popular than some others however if
you'd like to learn more about any of
these you can just click on the name and
it's going to take you to essentially
what is a repository page on atoms own
website you can see a preview of it you
can have access to the github page bugs
version numbers stuff like that so when
the best part about atom is just how
painfully easy it is to use you can
install all of your packages and themes
through its own interface you can modify
just about anything through some sort of
visual interface and you have the
settings and everything you need at your
fingertips to turn atom into the perfect
text editor for you
so the out of box experience with Adam
is certainly something that all text
editors should strive for and it's just
a really great project so these are the
Preferences in Adam feel free to modify
these settings and preferences as you
like with things like soft wrap and tab
length for instance I like tab length of
4 spaces and Auto is soft tabs or hard
tabs I like soft tabs which is using
spaces so like I said these are just
nice little things that you can tweak in
a visual interface come in here and make
this editor just how you want it so
these are settings in Adam I hope so
these are settings and preferences in
Adam as always this is Scott with level
