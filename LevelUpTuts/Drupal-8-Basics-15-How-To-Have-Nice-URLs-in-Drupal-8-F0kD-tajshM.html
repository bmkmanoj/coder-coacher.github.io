of tutorials and in this video I wanna
show you how you can get better looking
and better functioning URLs within
Drupal now previously we've seen URLs
that look like forward slash node
forward slash a number and that's not
great for SEO it's not great for
usability it's not great for a lot of
things so we're gonna show you now how
you can create your own custom URL
aliases so let's say you're on your site
and we click this about Us link now the
URL path here node forward slash one
doesn't really instill some sort of
level of structure that most websites
have in fact node 1 tells us nothing
about this website and that's not really
good for anything it's not good for your
users they're not gonna be able to find
this page simply just by typing it in
and more importantly Google or whoever
isn't going to be able to properly
really index this I mean they're gonna
see that this is node 1 and so what are
people going to Google your website node
1 or are they gonna Google about this
company so really we want not only our
headers and everything like that to
really align with what this page is
about but we also want our URL and paths
to as well so how do we get this page to
have the slash about us that we want
well we can click Edit on this
particular item and what we can do is
let's close menu settings here but let's
head to URL path settings and what we
want to do is set up our URL alias now
for each individual page you do you're
gonna want to go ahead and set up a
correct alias so we could say about - us
now keep in mind with your URLs you're
going to keep these lowercase and one
word so no spaces here notice how we're
using a hyphen to hyphenate about us and
all lowercase so now that we have this
alias we can click Save and what this is
going to do is make it sure that it
updates our menu here analysis about us
we click home we click back it says
about us if we actually were to go to
let's say node forward slash one the
unless it allows us to view this page
however a menu and everything still will
take you to about us that's because this
just functions it has an alias like a
shortcut on your computer when we click
it it tells you to go to node - one but
luckily for us it always keeps that
masked so we see about - us cool so
we've now created a nice URL for this
about page just like we have for the
contact page and the home page doesn't
need one because it's the home page
however first post first post still says
node forward slash - I suppose we can
come in here and change the URL setting
but that would get tedious if you have
hundreds of posts and hundreds of pages
so in future videos we're gonna show you
a module that you can add to set up a
pattern that's going to automatically
generate these aliases for you it's one
of the most useful things you can
quickly setup in Drupal and it's
something I always do when I first start
a site so keep following along as we
start to add our first module and then
get that going with some URL settings as
always this is Scott with level up
