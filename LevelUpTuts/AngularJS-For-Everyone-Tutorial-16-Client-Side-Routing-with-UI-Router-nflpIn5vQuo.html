love-love tutorials and in this video
we're going to show you how you can get
going
using ui-router to ahead routing to your
angular project now this is going to be
client-side routing however ui-router
does allow you to enable something
called html5 mode that helps out with
your history State and things like that
so check it out let's get started with
ui-router right now so in the last video
we got started by adding ui-router to
our project and we didn't actually get
started with anything other than the
simply adding the JavaScript code and
adding the ui-router
to our dependencies here so if you skip
the last video because you didn't want
to use Bower or anything like that go
ahead and download ui-router install in
your project and then go ahead and edit
here now what we're going to be doing is
we're going to be adding some routing
now the first thing we want to do is we
want to head to our HTML where we had
our index.html and we could scroll down
and before we had just this body where
we have the controller the controller as
syntax here and everything like that we
had our HTML inside of here we even had
a person which was being added via and
ng-include
now we can continue to do that however
what we're gonna want to do on this body
is we're gonna want to have this be a UI
view so we can do this directly on the
body we can just take a main element
here and on this main let's go ahead and
add the directive UI - view now this
lets our project know that the content
in the view is going to be added inside
of this UI view here now for now just in
this example to get rid of some of the
complexity here I'm going to go ahead
and just simply comment this code out
here and what we can see is that when we
do that we have a blank slate but if we
look into our HTML we have our body with
the controller as syntax and we have
this UI view and it has a class of ng
scope which you can see we didn't add
too
however that's just being added by
angular itself now also what we want to
do is get rid of this directory
controller as der lists now I want to
keep this code around just so we have
this usually don't comment a lot of
stuff out in my normal work but just so
we can reference that later and I'm just
going to have a clean body tech here
we're going to show you in a later video
how you can add your controller as
syntax directly to the route itself
okay so let's head to our directory j/s
now that we have that going and after
this top line where we have the
controller method we can have a period
and then config now inside of here we're
going to have parentheses and inside of
the parentheses we're going to have a
function now this function is going to
be unnamed so we can get rid of that and
the argument is going to be two things
we're going to have a dollar sign a
state provider and camel case and a
dollar sign URL router provider and
those are both in camel case with the
dollar sign starting match and as you
can see we have our curly brackets and
the body of our function here now in the
body of our function we can do sort of
things like defining a route in case
none of the routes are have been issued
however we're not going to do that just
yet we're gonna actually create our
first route what we can do is go ahead
and give this a new state now to give
this a new state we can say dollar sign
state provider like we had added before
and we're gonna have a period state I'm
using this state method and the state is
going to be given a name now the state
can just be home and we can have a comma
and let's put another curly bracket here
and open and close curly bracket and now
inside of this object we're going to be
having some properties here the one that
we're going to be using is going to be
template colon and now instead of here
we can do a couple of things we can
actually reference a template by using
instead of this template tag we can
actually use a template you
well tag and it's going to or a template
URL property and that's going to allow
us to reference another template however
we can simply just say actual HTML in
here which reply not going to want to do
but for this example we can just say
hello and then we can close that up just
like so now we have our first state in
our application where we have a state
provider of home and it's going to be
using a template just of these H ones
now let's head to our document here we
can refresh and you can see that
absolutely nothing happens now that's
actually because at this point we need
to actually give this a URL if we want
to use it like that so to give this a
URL what we can do is come in here and
say above template or pretty much
anywhere in this object we could say URL
: now inside of a string we can have
Fulford slash home and this is going to
be the URL that allows us to access this
page now you can see we can actually
visit that URL by typing in forward
slash pound forward slash home and you
can see were immediately greeted with
this hello so we've now actually defined
at this URL path as home it is getting
the URL a forward slash home and it is
saying hello now let's actually go ahead
and delete this because we want to hire
a home to just be with no information at
all we just want it to be this forward
slash so let's go ahead and set this up
as our default route we can do that by
having dollar sign URL router provider
and we can say period otherwise now
otherwise is going to redirect to a
specific state so we can say otherwise
yeah go ahead to the forward slash that
we had here and let's use colon here so
now if no other routes are picked it's
automatically going to take you here so
in that case if we just say just to our
our website here you can see what it
does is it actually adds the pound
forward slash here directly and takes us
to where this says hello awesome so we
now have ui-router with some basic
routing so let's go ahead and add
the route just so you can see this sort
of in action here and let's go ahead and
add a another state so I've just copied
this state provider dad state now
another way you can do that is by
getting rid of this initial state Vidor
getting rid of this and semicolon here
and just sort of tacking on this
additional state now some people like to
have this set up by having this all
indented you could have a space here and
having state provider on its own line so
we can go ahead and do that like so and
now this keeps all your state's sort of
together here now we can group this and
we can just say about now this is going
to be an h1 saying about ok and now we
can go ahead and change this URL to be
about now when we come to our page you
can see that when we browse to the URL
about it changes the title to about here
now there are all sorts of ways that you
can add in linking to this so you can
have an ui-router
directive that actually writes your href
for you you can write your href to
yourself when you want to be linking the
pages just make sure you include these
pound signs for now but as you can see
we've got a router setting up it's
actually giving us some basic states
when we change the URL and it's changing
the text here and the next couple of
videos we're going to show you a lot
more functionality with ui-router
there's sort of all sorts of things like
nested views you're going to be using
your templates this controller as syntax
so you'll be defining your controller as
in the router itself
all sorts of really cool stuff so keep
watching as always this is scott with
level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video or in decebet or our facebook
@ level up tuts we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
