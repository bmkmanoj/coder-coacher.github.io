up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be showing you Google Page
Speed insights now PageSpeed insights is
a great way to as it says get insights
on the speed of your page not only for
desktop but also broken out into desktop
and mobile specifically and it's gonna
give you tips on how to fix these things
to increase your page rank with Google
so let's get going on that right now
next on our list is after covering yslow
we're going to be talking about Google
PageSpeed tools now although there are
extensions for your browser for
PageSpeed it does say on their site they
have been deprecated so I wouldn't
necessarily recommend using them however
you can use this PageSpeed insights
URL bar you can copy your URL here and
you can come in and just simply paste it
in here and click analyze so now what's
awesome about PageSpeed is that they
give you ratings for mobile and desktop
so for speed looks like I have a 65 out
of 100 on the mobile experience and this
is something that's going to be fixed in
the next iteration of the level of Tut's
website that's being built from scratch
however as you can see we have mobile
and desktop and we get a 98 out of a
hundred on user experience so it's great
about PageSpeed insights it's it's
really what Google is looking at so if
Google sees that your site has like a 0
out of a hundred for user experience on
mobile or something like that
you're going to be penalized in Google
rankings because your site isn't going
to be mobile optimized so you can really
get an insight as to what Google is
looking at when they're looking at your
site and what's nice here is that say to
fix the speed I can eliminate render
blocking JavaScript and CSS in
above-the-fold content and enable
compression if you notice that enable
compression was us on the list of yslow
so that's definitely something that's
going to need to be fixed to improve the
speed
now in desktop I get an 80 out of a
hundred now the enable compression has
now been moved to the top and it'll
eliminate render blocking JavaScript is
now the second recommended thing now the
consider fixing is leverage browser
caching and minimizing the JavaScript
now some of these things are things that
should be being done by the content
management system itself and is maybe a
statement about the system that the site
is built on rather than the code itself
but it should give you a good idea of if
you're using something like WordPress or
Drupal or if you're coding your site
from yourself it should give you a good
idea for things to search for and look
at to find either modules or extensions
to compress the right things or minify
your scripts appropriately or it will
teach you that you need to develop a
better build process to create a gulp to
create a workflow that compresses and
minifides and puts all things in one
files to limit your HTTP requests if we
run the level up store through PageSpeed
insights let's check this out I'm
betting I'm gonna get a low mobile score
for speed due to large images but this
one's going to be a little bit tougher
because it's built on a front-end
framework rather than it rendered
server-side like a Drupal site or
something like that because the site's
built with meteor and react it needs to
actually run the site and analyze it
more so than just load it so as you can
see the optimized images is giving me a
huge penalty on mobile and that's
certainly something I knew going in
because I'm really just loading one
image size the next update of the site
does contain a responsive image loader
to greatly reduce the size of these
large images and you can see it only
actually gives me a 66 out of a hundred
for speed on mobile so again it's
eliminate render blocking JavaScript
above the fold is the big one and
prioritize visible content however I do
get a hundred 100 on the mobile user
experience now this is really super cool
it tells me all of the things that I
passed on it says congratulations no
issues found so as you can see Google
likes my mobile user experience on this
site and if we come to the desktop you
can see in this icon I get a big red
explanation mark and that is telling me
that my images need to be optimized
which I which I've mentioned a couple of
times is something that I know going in
so that's certainly something that's
going to be fixed very soon and the
score should be going up accordingly in
addition I need to leverage browser
caching and prioritize visible content
now let's go ahead and click this show
how to fix what's cool is that it now
gives you an explanation similar to why
slow setting an expiry date on maximum
aged HTTP requests okay so leverage
browser caching so these are these same
things that we saw on yslow but they're
presented a little bit differently and
you're getting a nice score because you
now know what Google's looking at when
they're ranking your site according to
its page and mobile experience so this
is Page Speed insights it's an
invaluable tool and one I highly
recommend you run all the time in your
development process so run your sites
through PageSpeed run them through yslow
and start to find out what is making
them slow in the next few videos we're
going to dive into dev tools in your
Chrome browser to really get a good idea
about how your site's loading and how it
could be running faster we're also gonna
be talking about how to fix a lot of
these main issues talking about content
delivery networks talking about
responsive image loaders talking about
all this stuff that's going to make your
page fly and we're gonna get these
scores way way up so as always this is
