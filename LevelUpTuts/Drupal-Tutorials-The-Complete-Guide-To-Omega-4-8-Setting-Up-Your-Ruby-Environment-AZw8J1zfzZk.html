of Tut's and today I'm gonna show you
how to set up your environment to use
Ruby and sass and all the wonderful
things then omega4 has to offer and now
this is gonna be done through terminal
but it's not hard right so we need a
couple of things and now the first thing
we're gonna have to install are the
Xcode command-line tools and if you have
Xcode then you're gonna want to there's
a way that you can actually download the
command-line tools from within Xcode so
maybe just give that quick we'll go
download command-line tools with the
next code if you don't have it it's
actually look like a four or five
gigabyte download so you might not have
it you don't actually have to download
the whole thing to get just the
command-line tools in fact if you go to
and I'll have this link in the comments
if you go to developer.apple.com slash
downloads you can actually get access to
a page that allows you to download these
command-line tools so let me actually
sign in to my you actually have to have
a developer account it's no big deal you
don't have to pick pay any money or
anything so I've signed in right and in
here there's access to some things and
you'll see command-line tools
here's one for iOS X Mavericks I'm on
mountain lion right now with this
machine at least and I'm just gonna
click this and I'm gonna download this
one so you're looking for command-line
tools here here got a 96 megabyte disk
image instead of like a 4 or 5 gigabyte
Xcode I guess this is only two for
version 5 but either way this is a much
faster download and if you don't
actually use Xcode why download the
whole thing so we're gonna get our
command-line tools downloaded and then
once those are in I'm gonna install it
okay so that's downloaded I'm opening
these command-line tools I'm just going
to install this package now and it's
gonna go through and do all this stuff
okay so that's done let's close that we
should have command-line tools installed
and everything's alright now when you do
install our VM which is a ruby version
manager now you can get there by our VM
do and if you're doing anything in Ruby
our VM is really the best way to control
your Ruby installations so let's go
ahead and copy this install our VM with
Ruby let's click this and now come here
we can type I'm just going to do sudo
and make sure that I have correct access
for this into my password and it's going
to go ahead and install our VM okay so
our VM is installed now I think it's
important that we close this window out
if we were to continue in this window
and we were to try to use in Harvey M
command it would say command not found
so those closest terminal out and let's
open up a new one okay so we have our VM
installed and if we type our VM - V we
can see that we're using our VM and it's
now installed so if that installation
went correctly and you open a new
terminal window you should be seeing
something here if not something went
wrong with their our VM installation but
make sure you close that window if
you're you trying to check this out
so now let's actually change directory
into our our theme folder so I'm gonna
change directory into I have this
insights level level up and then Drupal
and now inside of my website the path
we're gonna go to is the root of the
theme so it's gonna be sites all and
then uhm themes and then level up okay
so you'll notice instantly because I
have our VM installed it's going to be
telling me that the version we want 193
is not installed and in fact that's
correct if I type Ruby - V it's gonna
say 187 and that's actually for a reason
because I'm using the system version of
Ruby I believe our VM has a higher level
version installed that we're not using
but this is the one we want and it says
it's not installed so let's go ahead and
run this command I'm going to do it as
sudo our VM install Ruby and it's going
to find Ruby and install it for us and
it looks like I'm running into some
errors
and that's probably not uncommon based
on what your environments like and it's
very possible that your install went
fine and didn't have any issues I'm
running mountain lion which is known to
have some issues so I'm actually going
to paste in a github gist that basically
just says the correct way to install
Ruby our VM on mountain lion and you can
just follow the instructions there to
make sure everything is properly
installed if you're having some of these
errors otherwise you're gonna want to
Google maybe whatever a particular error
you're getting and I would try to go
over all of the different things but
without knowing your environment
specifically it's gonna be hard for me
to troubleshoot so now I've installed
some things based on the gist that I was
looking at specific to mountain lion
which was really just running this
command and it was our VM PKG install
OpenSSL and now I'm going to try running
our sudo our VM install 193 once more
and it looks like this time it was
successful and installed everything it
gave me no errors installed this
particular version we're looking at and
I'm seeing a lot of green
so therefore I can reasonably say that
this worked exactly like we needed it to
but as you can see immediately after
installing I ran Ruby - V once more and
it still says 187 ok well there's one
more thing we have to run we have to say
our VM and then two hyphens for space
than two hyphens default use and then
whatever version we just downloaded we
just downloaded 193 so we could say
1.9.3 so our vm default use 193 and what
this is going to say is use on our VMs
version of ruby in particular version
193 instead of the system version ok
it's now say we're that using the 193
that we just installed and we can type
in Ruby - V now and we can see we're
getting the correct version
we wanted to have in addition we needed
the version of gems that was higher than
I think it was 1.3 that we had installed
in gems is just a part of Ruby that
allows you to install different gems
which are really just small little Ruby
applications or programs that can do
things for you so we can say gem - V and
you can see that we're now using version
2.1 0.11 where before we were using
version 1.3 or something so ruby is no
good right so we now have the correct
version of Ruby we have our VM we have
our command-line tools and we're ready
to go in the next video we're gonna take
it one step further and we're going to
install all of the gems that you need
and then we're gonna be using brush
guard to start compiling your files so
we're almost there
if this was tough for you then don't
worry about it it's easier from here on
out this was just maybe the difficult
part because everybody's systems are so
different but really all you need to
know is that you need to have at least
version 193 of Ruby and working for this
of course or else your theme will
complain like it did for mine when I
went into our theme so like I said in
the next video we're gonna go over
getting the gems you need and getting
running so as always this is Scott with
level of touch if you have any questions
or comments please leave a comment the
video I can't promise that I'll get to
all of your comments especially if
they're heavy troubleshooting about some
error you're getting but hopefully
somebody else who's more experienced
noobs use these things before can also
comment and help you out if you're
having any problems or getting any
errors but of course I'm gonna be
pasting in some resources in the
comments too so check those out and see
if any of that helps you so as always
this is Scott Olinsky and thanks for
