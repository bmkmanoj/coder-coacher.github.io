up tutorials and today we're gonna show
you how to install Magento quickly using
a shared hosting solution in this
particular example we're gonna show you
how to install on Bluehost which is a
hosting service that you can get for
pretty cheap it's like 395 a month and
if you register with the link that's on
the screen right now and the annotation
or in the link that's in the description
of the video
you'd be help supporting level of
tutorials so if you're looking for
shared hosting I'd really appreciate it
if you signed up using either of those
links just to help out after you have
your Bluehost account what we're here is
basically the home page which is sort of
like a cPanel you also have a cPanel
with more options just up top here but
from here we have the ability to install
a Magento so if you scroll down you'll
see under website we have installed
WordPress but we also have this one
click install so this one click install
is what we're going to be finding are
things like Magento or Drupal or
anything like that
so now we have a list of all the blogs
and websites available if we scroll down
past blogs past classifieds client we
have e-commerce here where we have four
we have Magento version 1.9 so we want
to go ahead and select the logo here and
now it's gonna take us to this page
where it tells us a little bit about
Magento we can go ahead and click
install so now you're gonna want to
select a domain that you have on this
account which is most likely the domain
that you want your store to be in if you
want to be of a subdirectory you could
of course put a subdirectory here let's
say maybe you have a store section of
your website and this isn't the entire
website itself since I'm live one site
on this hosting account I'm gonna go
ahead and click check domain it's gonna
make sure that it can use this domain
and after it's done checking it's gonna
give the option to install with one
click so now we can click install and
it's going to choose a lot of things for
us or we can click show Advanced Options
which I kind of want to do because here
allows you to enter your first name and
last name just sort of administrative
stuff along with a username and a
password now now all you need to do is
click the I've read the Terms and click
install now I'm gonna go ahead and click
install now however I'm going to change
this
or say you don't have access to my
password after clicking install now
you'll notice we have this blue bar that
says your install is underway we have a
progress bar and once this is done it's
going to flash - I believe orange or
something and it's gonna allow you to
see your login credentials and all the
area in which you can log in to your new
Magento site which is going to be on the
internet at the moment that this is done
installing ok we now have this your
install is complete let's click the view
credentials and that's gonna take us to
a page where we have this notification
section where has some alerts and you
should just have this your Magento
installation is finished alert right
here so we can go ahead and click view
now yours is gonna look just like this
except for mine has the password blanked
out so you can't see my password what we
have here is the URL to your site which
should be your domain and the admin URL
which we can click and open both of
those and we go to your site you'll
notice that visiting this URL from any
computer you'll now be able to access it
like any normal online web site so we
now have a Magento store up and running
in no time at all with a couple of
clicks the admin section you'll be
presented with this login you can type
in your username and password login and
now I can get started administering your
website like any other Magento site if
you come back to the Mojo marketplace
here you'll see that down here at the
bottom they have some themes and stuff
like that you can check out if you're
looking for a theme and template you can
you can see them on here they're pretty
standard pricing probably something
around anywhere from fifty to a hundred
dollars based on how good the template
is so check that out if you're
interested in templates otherwise you
can always design or find your own
template somewhere else so we now have
in no-time a Magento site up and running
on the Internet
in fact if you were to visit this domain
right now you'd see this site as well
over I can't promise that this same URL
next year and a couple months will be
this site because I don't plan on
keeping this domain it was just a
freebie that I opened this account with
so don't necessarily get your hopes up
about browsing to this Magette
to a site and seeing it up here it's
it's most likely won't be there in the
future great so that's installing
Magento on a shared house using Bluehost
so as always this discount level up
tutorial so if you have any questions or
comments have become in the video head
of stuff at Twitter or Facebook at level
up tutorials will be here from you
