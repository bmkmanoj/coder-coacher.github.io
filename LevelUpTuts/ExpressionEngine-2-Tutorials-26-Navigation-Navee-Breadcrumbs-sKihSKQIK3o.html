shaft level up Todd today we're going to
keep continuing on with the na'vi module
we're going to make one change to our
nav and then i'm going to show you
breadcrumbs so in the last video i
showed you the na'vi custom tag pair but
what we're going to do is we're going to
go back and actually reinstate the na'vi
nav single single tag so let's go ahead
and do that and one thing that i want to
point out that we didn't cover in a
different video but i had sort of
commented out using expression engines
comment tags which is similar to HTML
but instead of like carrot like those
type of no greater than less than
symbols they use the curly braces just
as a side note like this is the way to
comment things out an expression edge
and this is what you'd want to do I
won't output to the page right like it's
just expression engine comments it out
and so it doesn't like you can't be what
if someone's viewing the source or
something like that anyway but the tag
that we're what I want to talk about is
the only display children of selected
and this is by default not on but over
setting this to true and so for this i'm
going to show you what that means so i'm
gonna hit update and then i got to go
back into the snippet i don't think i've
done this yet and tell tease this
includes nab instead of that custom one
that we had just previously created so
let's go ahead and do that I can't
remember I maybe just did that like two
seconds ago but strike
well let me let me grab the crumbs out
of here for safe too spoiler alert and
crumbs coming up all right so update
let's give this a refresh okay cool so
I'm on the about page so within the
about page notice we're seeing this
level up tot remember that was a page
that I added to the nav so if i go to
home we don't see that so once we're in
that section then and only then do we
see the child page so what we're going
to do now is I'm going to show you
breadcrumbs and so this there again
there's two tags for buoyant breadcrumbs
and letting pieces one back in there's
just like the nav tag there's a single
and then there's also a custom tag pair
but this is just super simple I'm just
keeping this default and I'll show you
but its expression engine Nabi crumbs
instead of nav and then we're gonna give
it the title that's the only thing that
we're going to give it we get it go
ahead and give update oh you know what
the I should say is I don't have what
this means is only show my nav one were
you know basically when we're not on the
homepage so this means if segment one is
not empty okay so go ahead and update
now if I go to the homepage we don't see
anything different here we're just
seeing the normal nav if we go into
about we're now seeing this that we're
in the about page now what I want to
show you is once we get down to another
page but this was an external link so if
I click on that you know what do you
know it opens our totally dope website
dope in progress anyway but so what
we're seeing here I'll just view this
real quick down
below is we're seeing an odor list that
just has about so let's add another page
two hour nap real quick so I'm gonna go
ahead and go into pages and create a new
pitch about this would be about me then
is a web developer okay so let's go
ahead and we'll just split that and I'm
going to go into the modules no and I'm
going to just add this going into my
main navigation i'm going to add it to
the about so about that this is going to
be there it's a page oh I think I didn't
give it a path so let's let's hang tight
um let's let me go back to pages
what did I do come on content edit
oh right okay so let's just say about
Ben oh alright and you know whatever
okay so now that it has a you now that
it actually has a path I should be able
to assign it to the nav so sorry about
that it's a little live troubleshooting
all right so it's add this new item open
this is going to be to the about pages
come on here we go cool so let's button
you know i'll add a class just we
haven't done that yet oh well I'm sure
alright so let's do that and I remember
you can only drag within sort of the
same level and then it just
automatically saves and gives you this
message cute stuff alright so now let's
go ahead and just refresh here we see
about Ben's let's go into this and now
what we're looking at is um you know
about I then Ben and just notice now
that this isn't a ul that's something
that you can change within your code but
to make your bread come a little bit
more flexible you can use the XP or the
expression engine na'vi custom
breadcrumb tag alright so what i did i
did add a class to this nav eyes wanted
to see if that actually worked yeah here
we go so as you may recall back on the
menu page i add a class of been to this
i just wanted to show you that that did
in fact work there you go that is how
you helped put the bread crumb to the
page in the next video we'll cover using
the custom breadcrumb tag and how we
could make this look a little bit cooler
without even doing any CSS but obviously
once you start doing CSS on your site
you can look really really good alright
