of HUD's and today I'm going to be
starting a small series on the Drupal
feeds module and all of the impressive
things you can do with that so to get
started you want to head over to
drupal.org slash project slash feeds to
grab feeds and you're also going to need
jobscheduler the project is jab
underscore scheduler now this one
actually doesn't have a recommended
release for Drupal 7 but there's no bugs
in the issue queue and if you look
through the issues people are sort of
wondering why it's not in you know
recommended release yet and so I I
haven't had no issues with it so you can
go ahead and grab the alpha version if
you'd like and of course if you have any
issues post it on to the job scheduler
issues page but for the most part I
think this modules pretty pretty good to
use I haven't had any problems ok so go
ahead and install those modules on your
you know your modules folder and let's
come to our Drupal modules page here I'm
just going to refresh this okay
let's type in job scheduler okay and you
can also enable this trigger but I'm not
going to we don't need it for this
actually so let's add this and then
we're going to add feeds next
okay now that that's in look up feeds
and now I'm going to grab feeds you're
also going to need feeds admin UI and
then your this an example of a node
importer and a user importer you can
grab this if you want to see one of
their examples I don't really need one
of their examples right now so I'm not
going to grab it feeds news as a news
aggregator built with feeds crates knows
we're not going to use that right now so
basically just feeds and feeds admin UI
if that's what you want if you want to
install the other two in play with round
them go over it ahead okay let's say
this and then I'm going to clear the
cache and we should all be good so what
feeds does is it's able to grab a feed
pretty much from anywhere it can grab
you know an RSS feed an XML feed it can
grab a CSV that you've uploaded yourself
and it parses that information and
creates content with it so you can do
all sorts of stuff you can import a lot
of content at once if you have that
information in like a CSV file like this
if you want you could just hit go and
it's going to create those nodes you can
also do things like pull videos from
YouTube using the YouTube and media
feeds which we'll get into later but not
yet and you can basically pull in
anything from any RSS content okay so in
this lesson we're really just going to
get set up and sort of look through
feeds to really understand it in the
next lesson I'll show you exactly how to
do the CSV import but till we can
understand let's go to structure and
then feed importers if we go here you'll
see that there's no feed importers
unless you had enabled that demo content
so let's click Add importer and so you
can see exactly what this importer is
going to be doing and we'll just call
this simple CSV in the description you
don't need anything so I'm just not
going to okay it's a now it's going to
create and this is a this is your feed
basically this is your feed settings and
it kind of tells you a little bit of
getting started information but you're
going to go through all of these things
here and it's nice just to start at the
top here and go to the bottom and pretty
much just check off what you want to do
but let's look through each of these and
see what's in here like I said the next
lesson we're actually going to go fill
out
information and create this feed so the
name description the selected source is
going to be imported by creating a note
of that content type we're actually
going to be using this use standalone
form which basically all up in this page
a new tab if you go to this page which
is just your domain slash import it
gives you an option and you're going to
select your importer and then you run it
that way so of course I'll just show you
that when we do it but right now just
know that we're going to leave this on
you standalone form and you can have it
choose to periodically import let's say
if your feeds changing a lot
you can have it import every 30 minutes
because we're just uploading a CSV of
course we would only want to have this
be off of course more on that later I'll
just check off right now and if you want
to import it on submission which we do
you'll have this check processing
background that's probably better if
you're wanting to do periodic so let's
go to fetcher here let's click change so
you can have a couple of different
fetchers right so HTTP fetcher or file
upload file uploads where you're
actually going to physically import
select a file that's on your computer
and upload it to the feed and have it
import that data HTTP fetcher is where
you're going to download the content
from a URL this might be useful if
you're importing from an RSS feed or
something okay
so depending on which one you select
here it's going to give you this options
let's just for now check out the HTTP
one so here's a two options Auto detect
feeds so if you give it just a URL and
not a feed itself it's going to try to
extract the feed from the URL in the
document I think you're better off just
using the feed itself if you can find
out that information this is use pub/sub
hub bub as you can see here in essence
it provides for pushed atom RSS update
notifications instead of requiring
clients to pull whole feeds okay we're
not going to using that so we're not
going to worry about it back here we're
going to go to parser so the parser is
pretty much what kind of document you're
dealing with so XML format feeds opml
feeds CSV RSS here's a XML RSS RSS one I
mean this is pretty much would be you'd
be doing if it was an RSS feed you're
from the internet somewhere atom format
whatever so so the parser is what type
of file you're giving it and again since
we have common syndication parser the
first one selected this option is going
to be whatever you select here and this
is going to be the settings in
particular for that as you can see
there's nothing in here we're going to
get into that more later once we
actually build out our feed
okay processor processor is what kind of
up what you want to do with this feed we
want to be creating nodes with this one
you can also create taxonomy create
users so this is the node processor when
you upload things from here it's going
to create nodes out of them and this is
going to be the settings for that so
just like each of these heavily headings
the settings right below it are right
down here with the settings and this is
basically what you're going to want to
do when you're creating these nodes you
can have it update existing nodes you
can have it not update existing nodes
you can never replace existing nodes so
every single time it deletes it and
creates new ones you can select the text
format of the of the body field um of
course this is your content type so
product project article webform and when
we get into it we create its own content
type just so we can see how that works
and this is be the author if you want
them all authored by you you can do that
as well
expire nodes never up you can also have
them expire after one year one hour
whatever mapping is where you physically
tell Drupal hey in my XML file or my my
CSV file this column is coming into this
node field so like I said when we get
into the CSV thing we're going to show
you all that so this is really what
feeds is like you make your feed
importer and then you will go to slash
import if you would like and run your
feed okay well I hope that helps you
understand feeds a little bit more in
the next lesson we're going to get our
hands dirty and build a feed ourselves
using this simple CSV I wrote feel free
to make your own and it's pretty easy to
follow along okay
once again this is Scott with level up
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
