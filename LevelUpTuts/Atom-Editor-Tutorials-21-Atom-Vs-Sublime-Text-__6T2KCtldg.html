up tutorials and in this video I'm going
to be doing a comparison from Adam to
sublime now this isn't going to be super
in-depth and it's not going to cover
every little bit of thing that you might
want to know it's just my sort of
personal thoughts on using sublime verse
using Adam so let's get going on that
now so here we have two applications
side by side both of which look very
similar with the right tweaks now so now
these applications are both using
different UI themes and they're both the
material design theme so now this isn't
going to be necessarily a review of the
individual UI themes here because
there's just they both have a lot of
options this is more just going to be my
general thoughts on both of these
editors now I really like sublime text
and I really like Adam so let's talk
about recommendations I would recommend
Adam for you if you have not purchased
sublime text already as a free editor
Adam really stands up to what you get
with sublime text now there are some
little differences here and there in the
package ecosystem some package might not
be available for Adam unzoom might not
be available for sublime text if you've
purchased sublime text already there's
not a ton of incentive to switch over to
Adam chances are you've already had
package control installed at this point
and you are in a workflow where you can
quickly add packages if that's you then
by all means continue using sublime text
it's a very performative and it's a nice
application there's not a ton of reason
to directly switch to Adam if you've
already purchased and are using sublime
text 3 now this is just my personal
opinion if you feel like Adam is
bringing something totally different
then feel free to leave that opinion in
the comments I'd love to hear it now
let's talk about some of the things I
don't like about Adam vs. sublime text
now I want to tell you this list is
going to be very short Adam has a
tendency to be slower now there can be
some latency in the key
typing basically you're going to see a
little bit of a lag that you won't see
with sublime text now I know some people
say that they don't notice this other
people say they notice this a lot
I personally notice this pretty
frequently and enough to sort of annoy
me but not to put me off from using Adam
entirely now I should also note that
this bit of lag is probably getting
better all the time and it is going to
be a matter of what packages you have
installed maybe there is a package
that's submitted by the community that
has some sort of non performative code
and it's causing your application to be
slow that's certainly possible and I
know that in the time that I've used
Adam it's got quite a bit faster till
the point where that leg is not
certainly as noticeable as it used to be
so since I have these two side-by-side
here I want to just show up some things
that make Adam a better application for
somebody new to text editors we have
let's go to Adam preferences and as you
can see we have settings key bindings
packages themes and it's all clicking
and searching from within the
application you don't need to install or
download anything to get this
functionality and sublime text we can
come in and we can say preferences
you'll notice we don't necessarily have
a preferences page we have some
preferences and it might be even
confusing if you have never looked at
this sure we have settings default user
more if we come into settings user yours
might not even have anything if you
don't have any user settings to even set
user settings you need to come to
preferences default find the setting you
want copy it and paste in here or know
what the setting is already and modify
it yourself now I have no problem doing
this I've been setting my sublime
settings like this for a long time but
if you were asked me to choose between
this and this over here with Adam I
would pick Adams interface every single
time it's much nicer now in addition
having a package control or install
packages built-in to these settings
rather than
having to go to a third party to get a
package control is another feature of
Adam that certainly trumps that of
sublime text
so this is where what I said before if
you're new to text editors or you have
never purchased sublime text and you're
you haven't used a whole lot Adam is
going to be much friendlier to you and
the package ecosystem is certainly large
enough that it's going to pretty much
contain everything that you would
possibly need now once again if you
already like me have a ton of settings
set up in sublime text and your package
control is working fine your projects
are all here there's not a ton of
incentive to switch just for this nicer
interface after you download at them you
would have to then go ahead and fish for
all the packages that you'd want to find
and you'd have to know the different
names for instance I use a package
called get gutter on sublime text it's
called get - diff or the same
functionality and on Adam here so you
have to do a little bit of research to
make sure you get your work flow back to
where it was so that said in my day to
day I'm probably going to be opening up
sublime text more often only because
like I said mine's fully configured the
way I like it already
and there isn't necessarily a killer
feature driving me over to adamant just
yet
however if I'm setting up a new
environment on a computer I might be
tempted to just install Adam and use
that because there is a lot of momentum
behind it there's a lot of great people
working on it and it's free it's a nice
little ecosystem here so to pick between
these two you can't really say blanket
yes to one or the other
in fact there's other smart choices that
aren't either of these at the end of the
day use what works best for you if you
have a favorite text editor posted in
the comments of this video or tell me
what you like about sublime verse Adam
Adam verse sublime if you've used both
as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials thank you for watching the
Adam tutorial series there's going to be
a lot more videos coming very very soon
thanks for watching and I'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
