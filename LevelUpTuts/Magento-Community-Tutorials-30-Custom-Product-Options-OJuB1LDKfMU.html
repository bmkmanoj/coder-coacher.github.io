up tubs and today I'm gonna be
continuing our Magento series with the
fifty-fifth Magento tutorial and this is
going to be on using Magento so if
you've noticed I've set my theme back to
the default temporarily and you know you
might be wondering why we're going back
and forth between theming and using
Magento and really there's just enough
topics for both things that I don't want
people who are following one or the
other to get bored here so I'm gonna be
going back and forth and as you can see
some of the things from our theme
English series aren't going to be
translating quite right like we have the
slideshow but we never added this
javascript to the default themes some
things like that will be weird but for
the most part these templates are set up
better than the ones that we were
creating thus far in our theming
tutorial so what we're going to be doing
today is we're going to be doing
something that's really interesting and
it's going to be custom options for your
products so you might be wondering um
you know if you have a configurable
product that's cool that but maybe you
have a t-shirt with medium small
whatever we went over configurable
products and a tutorial a long time ago
I think it was let's see
it was tutorial number 12 and the
Magento series and a configurable
products allow you to set up multiple
SKU numbers and have those all connected
so you'd have a drop-down for a small
medium large but what happens if let's
say maybe it's a one time off thing or
let's say we have this phone here that
we're selling but this particular phone
has a certain option but now the other
phones do need you know with is it gonna
be worth creating an attribute and then
creating a configurable product well my
opinion no I there's a there's a better
way to do it I'm going to show you what
that is so go to our catalog manage
products we're actually going to search
for this phone right here I'm just gonna
copy the name the name of it so I can
search in this and it's gonna come up
here cool
so in here at the very bottom we have
this thing called custom options in
is it really useful so often it take to
videos to just talk about custom options
and the first ones we're just going to
go over some of your option types so
let's add an option and this option is
going to be let's say color this
particular fountain comes in multiple
colors so the title is going to be color
and we want this to be a drop-down you
notice there's a whole bunch of other
inputs and we're going to go ahead and
and go over those so is this required
we're going to say yes this is required
we want this to show up very first
amongst our custom options and we're
gonna click add a new row and I'm gonna
add a few rows here and we're gonna say
blue and black
well not in all caps black and then
we're gonna have a special edition red
option and the red option is going to be
let's say 10% actually I don't need the
% this is going to be 10% more so let's
add a sort order of zero one two and
believe it or not these have the same
SKU or now note we're gonna worry about
SKU for this option this option does not
change the SKU of the phone where in
some instances it probably would but at
this one it's not if it did I could add
a new SKUs here and it would not be no
big deal so let's click Save and ok so
we have our phone let's go to our phones
page and I'm going to refresh it and we
should see these custom options become
available and you'll notice here oh we
have we still have a sale going on but
if you'll notice this red phone is $12
more so it's 10% more than the other
phones if we select this our price is
gonna update and here in here if we move
the serum price is going to update back
if we leave this as please select and we
try to add this to our cart it's gonna
tell us this is a required field that's
going to get all mad so this is really
nice
specifically so you don't have to do all
this attribute set up in the back end if
you just have a one offer even maybe
specific things you know just
if it's not gonna be on every single
product then there's no reason to not
use this and another right we could
actually even come back into here and
let's add something different let's add
something totally different so we'll go
to custom options and let's add another
one so we can add as many of these
custom options as we want so this one is
going to be let's see so we're going to
actually have a checkbox here let's say
this was something very important you
wanted to make sure that there's like a
disclaimer so we're gonna say this claim
a claim er okay yeah okay spelling and
typing and talking is really hard so
let's uh let's have this be sort order
one so it's gonna go below our drop-down
and notice how we're gonna say is
required so this isn't going to change
the price it's not gonna have a SKU and
it's not going to have a sorter because
we're only gonna have one option and
we're just going to say hi agree so this
is maybe saying - you agree to the Terms
of Service let's even just say terms
disclaimer and this way your customers
are going to have to check this box
before purchasing and notice how it
doesn't do anything different to the
product but maybe you wanted to have
just a verification that they want read
something you know terms disclaimer I
agree yes I agree with the terms and I
had the card if you didn't check I agree
with the terms and we still have our
color selected it's gonna say you know
you have to agree to these terms so
let's click a green Add to Cart and we
have our new phone in the cart perfect
so these are just some of the things we
can do with custom options in the next
video we're going to be going over a few
more of the options you have with custom
options and some of the cool stuff you
can do as always this is Scott with
level of Tut's if you have any questions
or comments if you come in the video
