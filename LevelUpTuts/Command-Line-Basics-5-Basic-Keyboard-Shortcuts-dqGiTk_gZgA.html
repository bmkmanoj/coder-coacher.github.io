up Hut's and today I'm going to teach
you some really useful keyboard
shortcuts to use while you're using bash
in your command line and these keyboard
shortcuts are things that many people
might overlook when you start and then
you get into a situation and you find
yourself not you know knowing the best
way to do it and you could become way
more efficient with a couple of very
basic keyboard shortcuts so for instance
you might find yourself typing some code
or typing some commands right and let's
just say you're typing CD and then var
maybe I don't know let's just say we're
going into sites
level up and you realize that this isn't
actually where you want it to go and you
find yourself holding back backspace
okay and more importantly let's say you
wanted to delete this if this was a
longer command but that's just gonna be
a huge huge pain to just hold the the
backspace key and just watch it delete
so what you can do is you can type a or
you can use control U and what that's
going to do is take it from where the
cursor is and it's going to clear from
wherever the white cursor is all the way
back to the beginning so for instance if
we're at the end here where you're
normally typing you can type control U
and it clears it all likewise if you
were to just have it starting maybe you
didn't want it shown whatever this file
was this wasn't the right command but
you had the right file you could also
start with the the cursor at the H and
then do control you and you can see that
it's deleted everything before the
cursor now you can type freely as you
would normally okay
well what happens if let's
say let me just get rid of this with our
control you just like that let's say we
are going to do a command and we're
going to change directory into sites
level up I'm just using this as an
example but let's say that the command
that we're gonna run actually required
sudo before it and we know that it's
requiring sudo if you don't know sudo
basically allows you to use a root level
permission so basically if you don't
have access to modify something as long
as you have the password you can use
sudo and access or modify that file so
you type that in before your command
right well we want to add that to the
front of this and again we could hold
left like that and just manually tab all
the way to the front of our line and
start typing or you could do ctrl a ctrl
a is going to just jump you to the very
beginning so ctrl you to delete up to
the very beginning ctrl a to jump to the
very beginning now you might want to
write these down in a little cheat sheet
until they're second nature but once you
do them a lot they just become sort of
what you do now
what about getting to the end of the
line right now we want to add something
to the end of this line now that we've
modified let's edit we've added sudo
here we want to jump to the end
well that's ctrl e jumps to the end so a
II I'm sorry just hit are there let me
get out of this ok so ctrl a ctrl e
control u to clear it now we just have
one more that we're going to go through
and let's say you did a command a few
commands ago and you can't remember what
it was or you don't want to retype it
outright and so we went over before that
you can hit up to tab through your
previous commands but let's say it's
like ten commands back you don't want to
have to hit up
10 times so let's say we're searching
for this touch command right so let me
just control you this so it's gone and
we're searching for touch what we can do
is do control R which I accidentally did
last time
it allows you to search for your command
so I can type touch and you can see that
it's telling me touch hello dot txt was
the last touch command we ran and
likewise if I hit up it's going to go
through the command before that so we
can say yes touch hello dot txt let's
actually control this you out of here
when you do control R and let's say we
say touch you could hit enter directly
from here and it's going to run this
command so you don't even have to do
very much looks like to even run this
let's do control R yeah okay and hit
enter now it's ran this touch yo HTML
and it's touched this file it's created
this file for us so now we have a few
keyboard shortcuts that are going to
make your life a little bit easier and
quicker when working in command line you
don't have to hit forward and backwards
hold the lead hit up a whole bunch
you just have control you control a
control e and control R I'm gonna post
those commands in the comments or in the
description of the video so you can have
a reference in case you don't want to
just watch his video every time you
remember but like like I said write them
down use them all the time and you'll
get used to them in no time
so as always this is Scott with level up
tuts if you have any questions or
comments so to come in the video or hit
us up at twitter or facebook on LevelUp
tuts love to hear from you see in the
next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
