tutorials and today I want to be
starting a new series on web developer
lifestyle now I really wanted to start
the series for a long time I've been
planning a lot of videos I've been
planning a lot of topics to cover what
life is like day-to-day as a web
developer and some of these issues that
we all face and maybe don't realize that
everyone faces and at some point I
realized that this series at some point
would just be my opinions and ideas
about these things that that's not as
effective as it could be so what I
decided to do is I decided to bring in
my lovely wife dr. Courtney talansky ok
who's a doctor of educational psychology
with a background of clinical and school
psychology so she has a lot of
experience giving therapy and just
working with people for all sorts of
different issues and I feel like
bringing her into this and getting her
thoughts on all of these things that we
all experience is going to bring so much
more value than me talking about my
experience because it's actually like
science-based instead of you know just
personal experience yes right right I
hope that's that fact yeah so again if
there's like the Q&amp;amp;A if there's topics
you want to see address we already have
lots of plan but if there's topics you
want to see addressed within these
developer lifestyle videos about maybe
issues that you face or co-workers face
or anything like that leave a comment in
the video you can shoot me an email if
it's personal and you want to remain
anonymous or anything like that
and and we will cover as much as
possible because there's a lot here and
there's a lot of problems that we all
face as developers all right people
Ezri people professionals right it's all
yeah it's all the same here yeah so I
know you wanted to give a quick
disclaimer yeah yeah and you'll probably
see this in every video but just as a
reminder and he had
that I give it's it's evidence-based but
it's coming from a very general
perspective so if if you're having
trouble with excessive stress anxiety
depression if you suspect that you
really just need to talk to someone that
I would recommend that you see a
licensed professional yeah
absolutely and I feel like is sometimes
people don't want to make that jump but
it's it's easy from you know even just
being around you I know how easy it is
to go to therapy and and people should
really more people should should do it
and feel like less of a stigma about it
if there is one yeah that's often that
you feel that way I look I don't I
definitely do that
ya know you should look yeah so
absolutely so it's great that the topic
we wanted to talk about today is what
some people have referred to as dev rate
but it could also be thought about as
like work frustration because let's face
it developing anything websites apps
designing anything whatever it can be
this tedious process and and you know
I'm reminded of a situation even like a
couple days ago I'm not going to name
this person by name to embarrass them
but they were just Sam really having a
hard time with this and a night to just
give me the code I'll look at it because
I know that uh you can just bang your
head against something and I believe he
was looking at this thing for like hours
and just like why isn't this working
there's no no error and we all do this
and I look at it and and there sure
enough as a fresh pair eyes it's not
because I'm Annie or something anybody
could have seen this it would be used
when he was importing a script into his
HTML he used SCR instead of SRC yeah
nothing no spell checker in the world is
going to find that there's you're not
gonna notice that and you've just thrown
you know two three hours of your life
out the door on this thing that you felt
like was a totally different issue and
and that right there is so rage-inducing
you could you know
flip a table over I think you get to
that point
yep and once or twice yeah I've I've
definitely been at some point in my life
I was a chair chair flavor
I had co-workers react a really
negatively to really frustrating
situations and at the end of the day
it's not gonna make a great professional
impact so it doesn't help you alleviate
that anxiety or frustration and maybe
it's like a temporary fix may be
cathartic at that time but in the grand
scheme of things it's not beneficial
exactly yeah
so the the first thing I want to talk
about is one this this pole to solve a
problem so like anybody who can who's
probably had an issue with your code you
you make a change you get an error you
make a change you maybe get the same
error or a different error you make a
change and you feel like this process
has only happened like ten times right
but each each time you make a change and
it doesn't fix the problem you get more
frustrated and it builds but it else is
at the same time as a problem solver
which we all are
it pulls you in more you want to solve
it more so what's the best way that when
you feel that pull to like be able to
handle the stress of that not only that
hole that pulls you back in what did
what are your thoughts on on being able
to get out of that yeah well I I think
the problem starts even before you get
to that point right because that's the
point to where things can go one of two
ways right maybe even more so to where
it can go off to the left and you're off
in the deep end right where you just
sort of lose control and and that
frustration explodes or you're kind of
at that point where you could deescalate
right and go back to sort of a Commerce
State but what I would say is to really
to get to know yourself mm-hmm
and what what triggers you
that kind of suggests you might be
frustrated okay right and I say that
because everyone's triggers are
different right we don't all experience
frustration or anxiety in the same way
physiologically or internally and it's
different for everybody so for me I know
my thoughts just really kind of get
jumbled and are like just not very
coherent they're not clear I I start to
like panic a little bit I can feel like
my my heart increasing and I feel really
tense like my body just feels really
tense do you would you say you feel
differently when you get frustrated for
me I when I when I I'm getting like that
I get tunnel vision and like if anything
is is impeding in that tunnel vision
like it makes me want to lash out at it
like let's say I'm like really tunneled
into trying to fix this issue and then
the dog starts barking I'm going to yell
at the dog you know I don't I don't mean
to be yelling at the dog because it's
not the dog's fault that yeah she heard
something outside and started barking
but it's it's a reaction that happens
because I really like I like maybe get
more or tightly-wound right right so if
you could back up a little bit where's
the point where you would say you'd
start to notice that your frustration is
increasing because it has to be before
you have extreme tunnel vision sure I
would say if I'm if I'm trying to fix an
issue and the the reason for the issue
isn't clear so maybe I think I've solved
the issue and then I've refreshed and
maybe the error message isn't correct or
it's not telling me the right thing
right I'm at that point I think is when
I'm starting to get frustrated because I
suddenly have lost control of the
situation right right yeah and it is
frustrating when you're not in control
and like you said you're problem solver
and you don't have a clear solution
right so I would say at that point is
really the clear indicator that you need
to stop what you're doing just take a
little break right whether
get off your chair right or out of your
office and just grabbing a drink of
water
just really quick thirty seconds it
really helps to just kind of clear your
mind and give you that physical break
from the source of frustration I always
tell people and I I think people have a
hard time buying into this but it's so
effective it's just taking really great
deep breaths right being a really good
deep breather is really beneficial you
know so being able to inhale and I don't
see count for at least four seconds
right and then hold it for at least four
and then exhaling really slowly so I
breathe in through your nose out through
your mouth
right taking a set of like ten deep
breaths okay really beneficial and you
know what I've always even had a problem
deep breathing like it doesn't feel
comfortable to me today like I almost
feel like I'm short of breath and I
oddly enough I was listening to like a
Tim Ferriss podcast yeah and he had
somebody who was like a diving champion
or something oh yeah they would really
know yeah and they said a great
technique if of course it's not
comfortable for you to deep breathe is
to breathe through your teeth because
you get less oxygen in so if you close
your mouth and breach the brute breathe
through your teeth you get less oxygen
or you get less air in at once so it
makes you have to breathe slower yeah
and that's the big thing too with deep
breathing is you really have to do
controls exhalation you know if that's
effective for that and I could see it
yeah and some people have like sinus
problems or no issues with that and hey
look close to home uh-huh so sometimes
you're right it might not be comfortable
to breathe through your nose but
whatever way you can find to just take
some deep breaths and you know like
we're saying it doesn't have to take
that long it can just be like a
30-second break but it makes all the
difference when you're at that point
right which way do you go do you go off
the deep fed and you're frustrated and
things explode right or are you able to
come back down and look at it from a
fresher perspective so you're saying we
get to a point we have an error we think
we have it we write the code
we hit say for whatever refresh error
doesn't go away
you can feel it start to rise a little
bit at that point maybe stand up go get
a drink of water
yes refill refill your your mug of water
and then take some deep breaths at that
point and yeah and that can like bring
you back down but let's say we sit back
down we try a few more things and it
keeps elevating okay if you find that it
keeps elevating then I would either
repeat that pattern again and take a
longer break so maybe you need like a 5
to 10 minute walk outside get some fresh
air get some movement you know do
something that is physical and again
gets you out of that space that mental
and physical space but if you find that
it's still frustrating and just really
difficult to get a hold of then I would
say stop yourself and switch what you're
doing right because I know you have a
thousand things going on that you could
be working on yeah you have a tendency
to focus on that error like there's
nothing else right that's on your your
right your agenda yeah it so the I think
the hardest thing is having self-control
and not feeling like a failure because
you will come back to it and you know a
lot of times when your brain is in
consciously thinking about something
it's still kind of unconsciously
processing that right so sometimes you
can even come up with a solution or
think of an alternative way to come
about it
just by doing something different all
right so stopping yourself and just
switching your activity and saying you
know what I'm gonna come back to this
later because right now I'm not
clear-headed and I'm not thinking
through everything I could be yeah and
in that actually I mean it hits close to
home for me because I'm always of the
opinion that I can solve whatever issue
that I can solve this you know in and I
just Jaco in some aspects right that
perseverance but when it comes to like
frustration management that's only gonna
do you work I know and yeah she always
tells me to stop working on something
even if it's like 11 o'clock and I'm I'm
banging my head against something she'd
go to sleep I said I'm not I'm not gonna
be able to go to sleep until I fix this
I'm not going to be able to stop until I
this yeah and every single time I don't
listen to her and I try to fix it I
don't fix it or I stay up all night and
it's like 1:00 a.m. before I fix it and
then I just feel like garbage the next
day or I listen and I go to bed and I do
fall asleep and the next day like 9:00
a.m. 9:30 or whatever
first thing I do it then the thing fixes
itself somehow it I I feel like every
single time she tells me to go to sleep
it's not going you know it's the
problems gonna be there whatever you
have a better approach the first thing I
want to say is no like I have this
digging in this here but it it works it
works like every single time and I had I
hate admitting it because it always
feels so wrong to stop when you're in
this rut here yeah I understand but but
it definitely works
and if if you're at work and you can't
just like she said you can't just stop
working on something if you're if you're
building you know structural aspects of
it go to CSS work on something creative
and fun all right
we're got something just totally
different that's not going to get you
into these bugs or whatever like that I
mean and in and the going outside for a
walk thing is is a huge huge thing yeah
coworker and co-founder of level up
tutorials Ben and I used to work at an
agency and we would work on stuff and
there be not every day but some days and
you know you you know tap on my desk so
that my phone's on and just say hey I
need a walk or or I would say hey you
know let's go take a walk because you
could just feel it coming on that you
were so frustrated you couldn't work on
anything we would go for a walk and talk
about you know maybe even web
development stuff but not the issue or
whatever we'd come back inside we both
have a fresh fresh brain and it would
just feel totally different yeah and you
have to remember you're working on a
computer right so not only are you doing
a lot of like mental work with your
brain in terms of like you know figuring
out how to code I mean I'm probably not
using the right language but but it is
it's a lot of like mental effort
thinking about what you're doing but
it's also exhausting on your brain to
process all that visual information and
it's kind of straining and taxing yeah
you know just being on a computer screen
all day long so I think your brain is
kind of working double duty yeah
absolutely so it is it's a lot and
probably stress is amplified because of
that yeah okay so we now have before the
point of breaking we have past the point
of being frustrated but like you know
the chair hasn't flipped yet
let's say we're at the other end you've
been unable to pull yourself away yeah
you flipped your chair over you've
punched a wall yep
yes planned you're stopped on you you
slam the door whatever you do that's in
like a reaction to this this aggression
that you have to get out how do you cool
it down at that point where you are
already at the like the Hulk smash point
yeah well I hey I'd say the first thing
is to take some alone time and sort of
process what's happened because I think
a lot of times after you release that
energy then you're able to think a
little bit more clearly about what
happened and how you responded and how
those two reactions kind of weren't
coherent writer correlated things that
make sense yeah okay yeah so I think I
think kind of spent telling your spouse
or you know whoever's around you know I
I need some time right I'm feeling
really frustrated I just need to take
some time be by myself calm down and do
something fun it's totally unrelated to
coding right whether that's you know
hopefully not playing video games
because they guys oh well I was talking
about the like the I'm coming from the
screen perspective sure this doing that
I know sometimes for you video game it
depends on the game if I'm playing like
Mario maker an expert and I'm dying
every single level it's frustrating
yeah it's not gonna call me yes
light yeah if you're playing something
that's fun and light and maybe
non-competitive versa like that didn't
yeah dude there's some good meditative
but I would say tap more into your other
interests or whether that's exercising
exercising is a huge one it's a good
serotonin boost and it's good for
relieving that stress yeah so exercising
going for a run working out whatever
playing basketball outside whatever is
comfortable for you or just you know
engaging in a hobby whether you're an
artist you like to cook you do yoga yeah
I'm like reading you know whatever that
is I'm just have some me time
if that's you know allotted in your
schedule but I think it's better to take
that time than it is to kind of
reimburse yourself in your life right
because I know sometimes and you get
frustrated about something it affects me
I can feel that energy and I react to it
yeah the negative energy goes both ways
and races everybody had nerves in it out
of everything yeah I mean your problem
just escalates even further because now
you've got other people and right now
you're not happy angry spells angry dogs
are yeah yeah yeah so I I would say
always take a break as much as you can
and try to make that in a loan break if
possible yeah cool
yeah what helps you when you're at that
point um for me when I'm am I most
frustrated I think that is the point
where it becomes immediately obvious
that I need to slow things down
yeah so for me it's almost like uh how
did how did it get that far where I was
like did that frustrated and to be
honest um it hasn't gotten to that point
in a little while now I'm more likely to
stay up all night working on something
than I am to like really rage out there
was a point maybe like four years ago
where she could hear my like chair
flipping or something yeah when I think
that comes with the experience
yeah right you've really
learned a lot about yourself I think
through your career yeah absolutely and
that internet it for me like if it's
really getting getting difficult the
going for a walk is the number one
biggest thing for me that that helps
things yeah there's a lot of people to
get me away from my computer and I have
a hard time doing get like separation
anxiety or my computer when you go and
your walkie peur phone at home - oh
nothing yeah that's that's actually the
good part about having two dogs is I
can't like check my phone the whole time
I walking or else I probably wouldn't
look up yeah and they would just make
things worse
yeah no phone no SmartWatch nothing yeah
about that yeah cool yeah so I I mean I
think we covered like a lot of the
spectrum right we covered before the
middle after yeah any sort of other tips
you might say for when that frustration
is rising or or do you think we we did a
good job covering well I I'd save to
other tips awesome um the first is to
take as many like regular regularly
scheduled breaks as you possibly can
okay
as I've been trying to implement this in
my own life and it's certainly not easy
but finding some time each day where you
know you can take like ten minutes and
just meditate right or take a deep
breath take a series of deep breaths or
just kind of like relax and slow down a
little bit I think at the start of your
day is a great time around lunchtime is
excellent and then maybe around like
3:00 or so and you're starting to get in
that like afternoon slump yeah that's a
good time and maybe when you're home - I
usually recommend to clients like three
to five times a day you're feeling
really anxious or stressed just to take
time for yourself schedule it and really
relax right so I have an app called calm
that I really like calm yeah and it's a
free app some of the aspects aren't free
you have to purchase okay they have like
guided and on
and meditations that are free as well as
body scanning so I use that and it's
really helpful it has like it has a nice
visual imagery on the back I think I've
used it yeah I don't know I'm not
positive but I have a picture in my
brain yeah I think you can change the
background change the noises but the
person who does the guided voices their
voice is really tolerable and that's key
with the presentation yeah I'm sure
headspace I really love I subscribe to
that for a year so there's a bunch of
them out there but I would say taking
scheduled breaks whatever feels
comfortable for you and is relaxing is
really important awesome and then the
other tip I would say is to use positive
self-talk and amusing like psychology
terms here but reminding yourself and
you come up with an error or something
that feels like you can't fix it taking
a step back and looking at what is
reality right zoom in your mind when you
feel that way what are you saying to
yourself about this error like just that
I'm not able to solve it or I'm not I'm
not I'm not able to have control over
the situation or the code or what right
right so I don't have control I can't
solve this it's really self-defeating
and it gives you a very negative
perspective and sends you into that
aggressive more aggressive and
maladaptive behavior right yeah so if
you're looking at it from a calm
realistic perspective what's the truth
about that error uh just that I haven't
discovered what it means yet yeah yeah
yeah so it's solvable right but you're
just not there yet yeah right you
haven't quite figured it out doesn't
mean you're not confident does it mean
you're failure right yeah what it means
is that it's gonna take more time than
other other issues that you've come
across right but you will solve it
eventually when you remind yourself of
that I'm frustrated now but I will get
this eventually that's really key right
because it shifts your whole your whole
thought process and and really how you
feel about your work and what you're
doing and as a
developer note with this point if it's
something stupid like a couple letter so
you forgot a a semicolon or a bracket or
something every buddy does it and the
best way to eliminate things like that
is to use code winters and enters and
stuff in your text editor with those
does is it finds like either likes to
Ava's script stylistic things or
potential problems in your code and lets
you know that they're there and says hey
you used the wrong type of quote did you
mean to use this type of quote or like
hey this is missing a bracket here and
that can save you some of those those
headaches so they never even happen and
turn into these frustrations when you
feel like it's a trap you're like
editing your work as your girl yeah yeah
exactly it's almost like it's about the
chatter right yeah yeah so that's
exactly yeah so use linters and hunters
for that aspect of that yeah and there's
even some style guide there's there
called the J SCS which is like a it's
more of like a code style thing rather
than a you're doing it wrong it's more
of like you're not adhering to this
style and if you follow these particular
style ones then you your code always
looks a certain way and it's like way
easier to see if something looks wrong
so hands off yeah yeah so definitely I
think those are those are some really
really key points I mean you will solve
it everything's gonna be solvable and if
let's say you bang your head on oh you
can always get a second pair of eyes on
it yeah I think that's a key point to it
is it's somebody somebody adds or if
somebody else notices of mistake in your
code it's not that you you couldn't do
it or you were good enough to do it and
they were it's just that they're seeing
it with completely different eyes than
you well yeah
and likely if you could take a break
from it for like we grieve in a couple
of days exactly they are - exactly huh
yeah cool so I I think this was really
really successful
I hope so let me know if there's other
questions you have about this dev rage
yeah I have lots of relaxation
strategies but these are just a few of
the biggies yeah
so if you want to know any more about
this we can definitely go
on any of these topics like I said if
there's other like lifestyle or dev life
whatever questions they you have for us
we're gonna be going like really deep
into a lot of these things so you know
please let us know whatever you want to
see more from this but yeah so I think
that was super super helpful awesome I
know every time I have issues corneas is
amazing
at at coming up with the right the right
sort of solution so not everybody has a
corny a doctor corny here so hopefully
that this series be that dr. Courtney
for everybody yeah cool so as always
this is Scott and Courtney thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
