of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to add a static page without any
products at all to your main navigation
here so if it's not super intuitive and
you may not have found it which is I
don't really understand the decision to
not be able to create pages and add them
to the navigation but there's a easy way
you can get around it by creating a new
category so we're gonna create a new
will click on the root category catalog
first and then we're gonna add a sub
category and this categories name is
going to be about us and so we're gonna
add this about Us page to here add to
this category so what we want to do is
under display settings we want to check
this static block only it's gonna ask
you to please select the static block
we've actually haven't created our
static block yet so I'm gonna just leave
it like this for now and it's not going
to be an anchor I'm just gonna save this
category and while we're doing this I'm
gonna open up a new tab under stead of
blocks and I'm going to create a new
static block and it's going to be about
us
okay now we can just save this block and
I don't really have a huge ton of
content in here I apologize for that but
no if we refresh this page on your
static blocks are about us block will be
here and so now it's not going to show
any products
if we select static block only and about
us against oh I'm sorry I'm just gonna
select 2d break and ago category we also
want to change it to being active down
here display settings static block only
about us save this category and now if
we refresh our page you're gonna see
about us in our navigation here we click
on it it's going to take us to a page
with our static content saying hi this
is a little uptight about us if you're
like I don't want all this crap on the
side on the left on the right here all
this extra blocks this looks too much
like a product page well we can even go
into here and we can say custom design
this about us is going to have a custom
design and it's going to use the one
column layout update so let's save this
and let's refresh our page here and we
should have a one column about Us page
perfect it's in our navigation it's in
get good bread crumbs going here and
yeah that's it perfect so now this is
how you create a static block and
reference that static block onto a
catalog page to create a static page
within your main navigation alright
once again this is Scott with level of
tuts as always if you have any questions
or comments please leave a comment the
video how to step on Twitter let us know
what you're thinking we got lots more
videos coming and all sorts of different
topics it's gonna be a great year
