tutorials and in this video we're going
to be having a parameterize based route
so you can pass in and ID into a route
and it's going to give you a specific
piece of data so let's get going on that
right now
so in the last video I mentioned that
we're going to be making detailed routes
now these detail rots aren't going to be
anything fancy here but it should show
you how we have X has two parameters in
flow router so let's go ahead and head
to our sublime text here and let's head
to our routes and let's go ahead and
make a route and this is just going to
be scrolled down here resolutions and
then forward slash now this is the easy
part right this gets really cool because
this should show you do how nice flow
rudders we have access to a parameter by
saying just colon and then we can say ID
now this this value right here can be
anything this is setting the parameter
in the URL to whatever you want now
instead of our action we have to pass in
params but now we have access to params
so for instance we obviously don't want
to do passing this about what we
actually want is we want to grab we'll
need a new resolution single wrapper or
something like that what will one is a
resolution detail so we can go ahead and
have a new file and we're just going to
name this resolution detail dot j sx and
i'm going to simply copy this about page
paste in here default class resolution
detail extends get rid of this setvar
get rid of this stuff and what we want
here is going to be the name of the
resolution let's just go ahead ahead and
save this as res right now because we
haven't done any data stuff we're going
to be needing to use tracker react for
that now let's head back to our routes
and let's import this route actually
makes more sense to import resolutions
wrapper ok we're going to import
resolution detail from resolutions
detail or resolution detail jsx now we
can use the component resolution detail
but what's great about this is we can
pass along data
directly from our parameter with access
to that by params the dot and then this
value so params dot ID so let's go ahead
and actually have something where we
have where ID is equal to and then we're
not have brackets because you remember
this is JavaScript params dot ID so now
whenever we go to an individual ID it's
going to throw the / am ID into the prop
ID now will have access to that prop
within resolution detail will then be
able to use that ID to actually display
an individual one let's hit two
resolutions wrapper and grab some more
code we used tracker react so we're
going to want to import tracker react
make sure we do okay so we have our
tracker react wrapped around component
now you'll remember that we need to
subscribe to a bunch of data let's just
actually copy and paste this entire
resolutions wrapper in here we're going
to continue subscribing to all of the
resolutions here however let's grab both
of these as well the resolutions and the
component will unmount taste them in
here and let's go ahead and head down to
this resolutions which I'm going to
change to resolution and we're going to
have resolutions that find and inside of
this find we're going to have a bracket
now we're going to be looking for a
resolution where the underscore ID is
equal to this dot props dot ID so let's
take a look at the flow here the flow
here is going to be the route comes in
with resolutions and an ID that ID gets
passed through params then as params ID
into a prop of resolution detail now
inside of our resolution detail were
then able to use that prop which is this
dot props ID we're able to use that in
our actual Mongo query to pull in the
data for ace
engl resolution now you might be
thinking well is this query really right
we could actually we're doing a find
here we could actually do a find one and
we can get rid of all this stuff so find
one and just pass in this dot props ID
now let's come to our render and let's
console.log this dot resolution as a
function and I see the problem we had
this Deb perhaps tidy we pass this in
here we didn't get rid of the brackets
so it's thinking this is an object but
obviously there was no to property
property value so I'm sorry this is
resolutions dot find one and then in
parenthesis this props ID fetch cool
we're now should have access to this as
console dot log however we're not gonna
be able to get to this page just yet
however i'm going to show you a good way
to do so let's go ahead and do control m
and will help to our resolutions and
let's just go ahead and grab this ID
here now we can come to this page do
forward slash now we can come to forward
slash resolutions forward slash and then
just paste in this ID we hit enter and
hopefully everything doesn't break up
and again we get an error now this error
is a good one so it's saying fetches
undefined now that is good if you've
ever used Mongo you would have noticed
that our resolutions dot find one is
actually not returning a cursor at all
it's returning an object so we don't
need the fetch if we're finding one so
now we should come back to our page and
see that this works our Council log here
outputs the correct data which means we
now have access to text so let's come
back to our page and say instead of res
here cut this out add some brackets this
dot resolution dot txt get rid of this
council log save this head back to our
page so now let's actually changes
Council log to just say let r as equal
to this dot resolution now we can use
resin here by saying inside of brackets
res dot txt and I oh we've met we even
met with some more resistance now this
is one that you would get regardless of
what technique you are using if you are
using the get meteor data mixin if you
were using tracker react any of this
stuff the problem here is we're using
text res dot txt right that's the big
problem we're using res dot txt but at
this very moment the win this component
mounts and it goes to render this rest
is equal to nothing so obviously res dot
txt is going to get you an undefined
issue now we can do is do some sort of a
loading screen now a lot of these sites
have like a nice little loading spinner
I don't have anything like that prepared
so let's go ahead and fix this what we
want is if res is not existing right so
we want to say if the res is going to be
equal to false here then we want to
return and then in parentheses we can
just have a simple div that says loading
now you could have this be a fencing
loading jif or something or gif or
however you want to say it I have one of
those on my site I like the way it looks
but for this particular and since I just
need to output a div that's as loading
now it's not going to happen here is
we're not going to get this res dot txt
error anymore because our sites going to
come and it's going to read this render
its going to say hey rez doesn't exist
so I should return this and since this
render is a function we only have one
return in the function it's only going
to return this and it's never even going
to get here so it's never going to see
them res de text does not exist so let's
head to our site and you can see do
handstands I didn't want to do anything
I can it refresh as many times as you
want you can come to this route at any
given point and resolutions that this ID
is now going to give us do handstands
let's actually make this a little bit
more fun here so now let's get back to
our resolutions page and let's go ahead
and just make a
link inside of here so we want to come
to resolution single and now over the
text here we just have a simple H ref is
going to be equal to and then inside of
brackets close off this a tag I'm going
to do this before I write the actual
bracket here and we could say this dot
props dot resolution dot underscore ID
ok so it's going to give us the
individual ID for the single resolution
but if you remember our route just
simply wasn't the ID it was resolutions
so we can do this a couple of ways since
this is just straight JavaScript we
could have a string that says
resolutions forward slash like this
actually it's going to need another
forward slash here and we could Plus
this dot props but let's actually check
out a way you can do it with the new es6
syntax we can actually have this in here
all in one actual string by having the
back tick character which is in the top
left-hand side of your keyboard next to
the character one looks like that and we
can have one those at the end so instead
of a single quote or double quote we can
use this tick right here now where we
want our actual variable we can wrap
this in a dollar sign bracket and then
closing bracket so this is the new
string interpolation syntax in
JavaScript allows us to use this type of
tic to say hey there's variables in the
string identify the variables by this
okay so let's say that and you can now
see we have some really ugly links and
if we hover over them you can see that
we have a forward slash resolution CID
let's go ahead and just click on one of
these dance in the office you see dance
in the office we can go back do yoga go
back so as you can see we have our
resolutions and there's some super ugly
links I'm going to get rid of the links
in a minute just because we don't need
them but i just wanted to show this for
the routing and what we can do is we can
click on one of these like do yoga and
here we are do yoga let's go back
resolutions
an office cool now this is great I mean
even the back button works if you want
it to work right dance in the office all
this stuff and look how lightning fast
this is obviously this isn't having to
load a ton of stuff but it's not really
having to load a whole page at all it's
really just just lightning fast right
and what's great about this is we can
accomplish the same stuff with
server-side rendering now I'm going to
show you that in a video that's only
available for download on level up
tutorials or if you're a level up pro
but the server-side rendering stuff is
really cool with reacted meteor so I
would definitely recommend checking it
out we now have parameterised based
links now I'm going to delete this link
because it's ugly but I'll just do that
after I save the code off for the code
examples but so the next video get
started we won't have this link in here
but you can check this out to see how
it's going to work so we have certainly
come a long way and the sites looking
great to be honest it's looking and
functioning really well we've done
parameterize based routing that actually
grab content from a meteor database so
as always this is Scott level of
tutorials if you want to help support
the creation of these free videos have
to store that level of tutorials com and
purchase this series along with any
other series you would like to help
support the creation of these free
videos thanks so much for watching and
I'll see in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
