the past to be sort of a streaming you
noob here so if you notice anything
weird or wrong or anything with this
dream let me know in the chat I'll be
monitoring it I think I have things
figured out this time there should be
stereo audio and things that are
actually good this time so okay so I
apologize if there are any bumps like I
said I'm pretty sure I've learned from
past streams at this point so before we
get started here I wanted to take a
minute to call out my new series
mastering figma the topic of this
livestream is going to be talking about
figma why I like it so much I'm gonna be
showing off some of my own components
and design sort of workflow within figma
I'm going to be taking some things that
are not good in my Sigma file and
showing you how to make them better in
various ways and just gonna be talking a
little bit about the general things I
like about it and why it makes my life a
little bit better every single day so
yeah so mastering Sigma is available for
level up pros right now or you get a 5
video preview on the YouTube channel or
you can purchase it outright link in the
description of this livestream so yeah
like I said Sigma is a great application
and one of the best parts about it is
you don't have to pay anything to get
started so if you download figma and you
want to learn it just download it or
even use it in the browser and just play
around with it I can guarantee you're
going to like it good so yeah so check
it out um see here this is my Sigma file
here and this sort of just started out
as like a way that I I sort of just
throw everything into a a file I started
with a screenshot of just the site here
and then I threw a giant white rectangle
over to the top of it so I could start
to manipulate this and obviously things
are changing now so I'm going to be
doing much more of rebuilding the entire
site in figma now one of the really cool
things about
that is that my site is react based and
react and many of these new web
frameworks they think about everything
in components and in figma you really
end up thinking about things in
components as well so what I'll be doing
is essentially talking a little bit
about how I'm reinventing components on
my site via components in figma so as
you can see here I just have this blank
page here this is sort of how it started
and then I would take this and I would
do things like just throw stuff on top
of this so this is that that really that
same shell somebody says broadcasting in
480p I don't think I am but I should
keep broadcasting in and let me double
check audio bitrate yeah this is I am
it's like I have this wrong
so everyone is saying it is 480 okay
again apologize if there are hiccups
here this is my first time streaming on
this computer so I thought I had things
set up here maybe not
hold on one second
let me uh let me do something real quick
Oh God okay OBX let's see her OBS is
telling me that I can let's change this
okay once again apologizing for this
livestream sort of 480p issue I'm trying
to figure it out here if anyone is used
to using OBS tell me here what I can be
doing to get this to change to something
not 480 because I thought I had it set
up correctly in the meantime while I'm
looking for these settings I can talk
while I continue to look I'll do a
little bit of double tasking here really
so let me talk a little bit about why I
use figma over something else maybe the
differences between sketch or some of
these other other applications some of
the biggest reasons why I use Sigma over
sketch
besides the just general interface of it
and stuff like that is that it it allows
for like really great collaboration
tools it's like Google Doc like
collaboration tools where people can
have both of their mice on the screen at
the same time people can edit the same
document you can leave comments about it
it's also cross-platform so if you're in
a design agency or something like that
where people want to use their own tools
whether that's Windows Mac whatever your
developers are on it Linux platform
instead of a Windows or a Mac everyone
can use the same files and be super
happy so really there's a lot of great
things about it being cross-platform
that they come along with that but the
collaboration tools are really second to
none it's a it's just absolutely
excellent stream streaming service like
I said if anybody knows how to use OBS I
can't get this to output in anything
other than 480 so we might have to deal
with 480 right now I have no idea why
it's making that happen
yeah hold on hang tight I'm trying to
get this video not be 480 give me one
second let me see if I can just pause
this and come right back here
okay can everybody see things let me
make this fit in here in the middle okay
so are we now better than then four
eighty I set it to ten eighty okay
perfect
okay I promises the last time I have
stream issues because it's officially
set up on the speeder not to touch
anymore okay super cold okay so back to
figma here so yeah so I mentioned before
it's collaboration tools are just really
unrivaled it's it's absolutely excellent
you can see I have my like little
thumbnail up top here in the top right
and that shows my view if as many people
are working on this though I'll show up
along the top here and you can even view
the file as them it's it's pretty darn
magnificent
not to mention but your stuffs all
stored in the cloud like if you cooked
your your files here I have a whole
bunch of files and this stuff's all
available to me anywhere and if I were
to share any of these files other people
could have access to them and it would
be excellent right okay so here here's
my file right and as you can see it
basically just took a screenshot of my
site and just started overlaying some
stuff on top of here and for the most
part this app looks a lot like sketch
and all sorts of stuff like that but
there's a lot of like little p
differences and stuff in the interface
that make it really super nice and yeah
so let's talk a little bit about
component based design so in components
whether it's reactor whatever you start
thinking about these either small or
micro components macro components and
stuff like that and you can build this
system that moves up from there and then
you if you think about it you can map
these components one two one two
your react components whether you're
using styled components like I am or
something like that you have this
component based workflows and for
reasons like that components in Sigma
work very nicely so let's go up top here
you can see I'm building out some of my
components so I have like basic
typography stuff you may recognize some
of this from my home page where I have
like my main zone
in my subtext in my paragraph text and I
have these card headers and then I have
my collection of buttons right I have
all sorts of different types types of
buttons I have badges I have cards I
have all sorts of stuff over here
now what's cool about these components
and figler these reusable components is
that after you create one of these
components changing them and
manipulating them and whatever is is
just super easy especially compared to
sketch right so in sketch you had your
master symbol right and then if you
wanted to change something on that
symbol whether it was text or whatever
the interface for that wasn't
necessarily the same as the interface
for everything else for instance I have
this button here and like if I make a
copy of it by holding option and
dragging I can treat this even though
it's a subcomponent right it's a child
of this master component I can treat
this as sort of its own thing and I can
come in here me slick be selecting the
text right now when I'm sucking the
rectangle you can change the color on it
to be like this big red button with
white text and and that's all fine
you're treating it like it's it's own
thing right I can even change the
dimensions or size of this thing and
based on my what's there are constraints
that you have set up for it it's gonna
know what to do like right now it's
keeping this sort of margin at a certain
point so when it hits here it goes to a
second line now I can mess with those
margins a little bit so it can go a
little bit further towards the edge but
that's super nice here
oh broadcast cursor that is a good point
to do sorry I totally new to this
broadcasting thing that seems my only
like fourth one so I might need to
figure that out
always having issues
sorry looking for where to do that
yeah I honestly have no idea where to
turn on that cursor thing so at this
current moment I'm just going to hang
out and try to do my best by maybe
moving things around to let you know
what I'm talking about
so uh so here like I mentioned before in
sketch the interface for modifying this
component isn't necessarily the same
right you have to go into a text box
over here and change things to say you
know what the actual text is but here I
can double click on the text itself and
I can just change this text as if it
were totally it's its own thing
so I could just say stop you know and
now all of the sudden this button has
changed the text to stop and I did it to
the same interface that I would
typically do anything else and the
component systems really super super
great for that reason alone right
because you can take this sort of same
workflow and and manipulate these child
components while still maintaining some
of the important stuff that makes them
what they are like for instance if I
were to select this master component
here this this big blue one and I were
to change the dimensions of its box to
scale directly to the edges maybe let's
Center this here
that's much if I were to just hold
option and do this okay
so if I were to change the dimensions of
this text box to actually match this
then all of these all of a sudden have
that same constraint attached to it and
now when I resize this stop button I can
resize it all the way until the text
touches the edge here so the constraint
system is just super nice there's a
whole video on constraints maybe even a
couple of them to be honest because it's
jada there's two videos on constraints
because it's such a cool feature and I
mean it's a similar thing exist in
sketching sort of pinning things in
different places but for the most part I
found this interface to be a lot nicer
and I think that this sort of holds true
in Sigma for a lot of things the the
interface is just really super great so
so I'm thinking in components here right
I have these components and I say here
are my buttons or you
my variations of my buttons and if I
want to start turning these into styled
components and react or something I can
select my button and I can hit this code
tab in the far right and then select
these code brackets let me select this
rectangle here and I can actually get
real CSS code that I can copy and paste
out of here and throw directly into my
styled component so more just thinking
about components it allows you to build
in components and then take that
information that you gained through this
component and move it directly into your
code so I come as someone who does a lot
of react based stuff I found just a lot
of these little niceties to be big time
savers in my life especially thinking
about components now from a totally
different way because when you when you
write your CSS especially in a dig site
it can just grow and grow and grow and
grow and grow and eventually get totally
out of release so what this sort of
design system and building at a
component based system is going to
really allow you to I think it things
for a more global sort of perspective so
me come out here you can see I've built
all of my typography one thing that
figma is currently lacking is text
styles because currently just doesn't
have textiles but I'm confident that
textiles will be coming to figma you
know I this this team like is is one of
these things that were like I mean I
don't I don't know that but everything
that you ask of this team they're like
on it like crazy so you should see the
amount of features that are like
constantly coming to figma somebody
saying it's 480p I think that's a
setting that you might need to change
I'm broadcasting up to 1080 60 frames so
then for he's not coming from for me
here so there's no textiles right now
but hopefully they come soon hopefully
they come at all I can imagine that they
like I said that this pigment team is
adding new features to the site or this
app every single day I like come in here
and see something new so also check it
out I have a few more components here I
have my card component I have this card
a different kind of card and then I have
my badge I have like a little icon here
and these things can all be made of
components and subcomponents and stuff
like that and I show some examples where
we actually build some of these card
type things where you can build these
really really complex components that
offer a whole bunch of different things
and you can resize them and everything
stays and looks nice so so yeah here you
can see I built out some zones these are
all what's cool is that these are
components of components right so this
paragraph text is a component itself the
subtext teaser text is a component
itself this is a component itself this
button is a component and then I turn to
this entire zone into a component so
this zone has now become a component and
then I've duplicated this and these are
all sub components you can see I changed
the colors and everything like that
no biggie but what's cool is that they
all retain their component quality
features so if course if I wanted to
just all the sudden move this button
over to the right side for all of these
because it's the same button you can see
it updates nice and easy and everything
like that so it's really super powerful
to have components and subcomponents and
sub sub components and stuff like that
now you can see here I'm starting to
work on some some new designs and what
this allowed me to do was clean up some
stuff so I was basically working with
some some text or some designs that
didn't necessarily you know you're
designing in things and it's really easy
to sort of get out of your components
because you just start tweaking things
and manipulating things and then all of
a sudden you have a whole bunch of new
styles and maybe that doesn't
necessarily fit your type hierarchy or
your your component hierarchy so it's
really nice that you can build up this
component library in figma and then only
use those LEGO pieces they
belter your teams built together okay so
yeah so you can see use the live
streaming video player I'm working on
this update right now this obviously is
very rough but it's a it's going to be
really cool when it's done not yet
here you can see the shopping cart which
is live on the site right now I designed
it within figma here again a lot of
components sub components and what's
really cool is being able to take these
with you okay so again this this is this
document here it's just a bunch of
design ideas
it's available for when like I said
before it's available for Mac Windows
Linux because it's available in the
browser so you can use it in the web app
or there's a desktop app for Windows or
Mac so I usually just stop that because
it's nice and I like desktop apps but if
I'm ever somewhere I can always log into
my Sigma account online and use that
love it love it love it so yeah so this
is pretty much how I'm using figma but
let's talk about some ways that I could
be doing things better here right so for
instance let's say I came into a new
document let's go ahead and actually I'm
gonna head to the file browser and I'm
just going to create a new file for this
stream and I'm going to just let's say
this is an entirely new section of the
site I want to keep this separate
because that other documents getting
kind of unruly let's talk about
designing a new we'll just talk about
designing a new product page or
something like that and I want all of a
sudden start using my buttons components
and anything like that and how do I get
them in here you could always copy and
paste them and stuff like that create a
new component and then have this
component live there but if you're
paying for a team account on figma you
get access to this team component
sharing features that I use pretty much
constantly within projects so for
instance if I wanted to bring this let's
call this it's right now it's name group
it should be just called card if I
wanted to bring this card with me to the
other file I could come in here to this
components tab in the bottom left
see all of my components and I can right
click on this and I can select to
publish this component and what this
does is it publishes it to this team
library and everyone has access to this
team library and these these components
can update across hundreds of files or
as many files as you like right so if
you start using these components in
other files and you make a modification
somewhere to the master component there
you can filter those updates out so here
like I said I have this new page here
I'm going to create a new frame which is
the thigma version of artboards and I
wanted to just use this new component I
can come in here to my team library in
the bottom left I could it had to level
up design ideas and you can see I have
my card right here I can just drag it
and drop it on here and I now have this
component in an entirely separate file
so from here it's super cool I can if I
need to edit this master component I
came to right-clicking and tell it to go
to master component and it's
automatically going to find me that
master component I can make updates to
it and stuff like that so the the team
the team like the component team stuff
is great even though I'm a one one-man
team here if I were to bring on other
people I could tell them to design using
these components I've already created or
I can give feedback on them and stuff
like that so what about this interface
here this interface is actually really
cool it offers you a lot of different
things so you'll notice right now this
is like background here on this card
header is this gray color kind of looks
ugly
with this card maybe a white would stand
out better or something okay you can
actually even change all that stuff
simply by putting these in a frame and
then changing the background color with
the frame like let me create a frame the
F key and I were to put these components
inside of this frame for her to change
the background color to white I guess
why it works best you can see over here
in this little update over here it's now
like the preview now has a white
background so it's super cool and the
components all get names based on
whatever the component name is or the
the the component name the folder name
and you had that stuff right and there
- underneath the name of their frame so
let's see here so you notice that over
top here the grouping says frame two and
frame two we could change this name by
my layers and now this is just card
components got spoke components
correctly I don't have to but and now
that if we come to our team library
stuff you can see there underneath this
header card components you can start
building this like repertoire up of
really awesome components and you can
see here I have a whole bunch of
unpublished ones and stuff like that and
if I had all of these card components
with this plus button they all get saved
in my team library I come back over here
I think I might need to maybe refresh
out of this oh I'm sorry I needed to
publish these changes it's gonna give me
a little dialog to let me know that ya
publish these changes okay I'll come in
here let's go to our components and now
I can use any of these components in
this new file just like that really easy
and let's see what else we got
like I mentioned grouping these
components is like a really important
and nice thing so I had all these other
ones under typography but if you'll
notice over here if I were to publish
each of these buttons they'd sort of be
on their own
so like a really nice way you can take
this and make this to be a organized set
of components is just by wrapping this
in a frame and giving this frame the
name that just says buttons okay and now
that this is named buttons every single
button I have is going to be underneath
the heading of these buttons I can add
these to the library and I can now have
access to any of our buttons I think I
need to publish again publish changes I
now have access to any of these buttons
in this new file and can you come in and
just throw in a button anywhere I'd like
so this is all vector-based it's
basically a competitor to illustrator
sketch it's very very web
forward-thinking web anything like that
native apps sort of stuff in fact
there's some really really cool features
in here like if I were to select my icon
oh that's actually not an SVG icon but
let's say I were to make an icon you
could copy the SVG directly from here
I guess this clock isn't I come yes this
clock is an icon and that screenshot
Mayhem's my layers here find this thing
so if I were wanting to like export this
clock see I have the clock selected here
I can right click on this and say copy
as SVG and then when I would to paste
this in I could actually since this is
just SVG and this is text this is a
terrible idea but I could just paste
this in here let's see if it actually
does this yeah it actually did so I
copied this as SVG and here it gives me
my SVG code for that icon that you could
paste into your text editor or whatever
if you were using if you weren't saving
things that has SVG and using inline SVG
like I often do so so that's really cool
right so basically this thing is is
pretty much a a cross-platform sketch
competitor with a lot of cool features
now it also has a bunch of interesting
prototyping features too where if you
wanted to do like a presentation this is
not a super great example I was coming
up with an idea for an animation and
it's just illustrated out different
frames of how I wanted this animation to
look but if I if I go into this
prototyping mode and I I wanted to
basically whereas my frames here if I go
into this prototyping mode and I start
to drag arrows from one of the next one
frame to the next frame you can build an
actual design comps like you would in
something like envision and and even
here here's a fun example if you
actually select an object itself rather
than the frame and connect
to the next one it turns that into a hot
spot so if I do this presentation view I
click present I can share people with
this link they can even follow along and
they can click through this I can click
click and then on this last example
you'll notice clicking and the white
doesn't take me to the fourth frame so I
can click in the purple and it takes me
to the fourth frame because I set up
that hotspot and there's a good way you
can even set it to drive right like if I
share this link and then you all were to
click on my icon you would see what I'm
doing rather than what you're what
you're doing so I can just think of a
billion reasons why this would work
really well in a design sort of
environment and even you can even leave
comments on stuff here like I hate this
I hate this text ok and then users can
see and comment on these and resolve
them and stuff like that oh just one of
the things I like so much about this app
is how web thinking it is right and
especially if you design and things like
a component based react angular or
anything like that it gets you really
thinking exactly the same way you
develop things cool so this is pretty
much how I use figma I create a library
of my own components right now in the
process of translating my entire site
into both styled components for react as
well as components in figma and then
that way any person who ever wants to
jump on and do some design for me has
all these building blocks to go off of
so yeah this is pretty much it like I
said I'm a one one-man team here so the
team features are excellent and great
actually let me even try to do something
this might be kind of funny I'll try to
do it off screen here I'm a new sign in
with my alternate figma account and I'll
show you the multiplayer mode they call
it multiplayer I have a fake fake name
here kisses
so let's see if this works this is it
cool see if I can make her edit this I
have this fake name
Krista K Brown I got this off of a a
name generator so hopefully
hopefully people don't mmm have that
actual real name see exactly what I
can't do here
hold on one second I'm just ad accepting
this invite that I got and we should see
okay cool okay so you can see here I
have a new little icon up top here and
this is Krista it's fake name fake photo
well it's a real person in the photo but
I got it from a photo thing and yeah you
can see check it out
this purple cursor has their name next
to it and hopefully you can see that
with this is this not showing cursors at
all well that sucks but oh yeah there it
is okay so as you can see there's like
this purple cursor and this is actually
Krista Kay Browns cursor and she can
come in here and manipulate stuff and
move stuff around and this is missing
the document and this is seeing her
manipulated in real time it was really
cool and she can she can do anything not
in here and share it whatever if I
wanted to see this through her eyes I
can just select her icon here and now
I'm seeing the site as Krista I'm doing
this on another monitor by the way so
you can see as crystal zooms and I can
see exactly what she's singing and what
she's working on just really really cool
stuff right like I don't know how many
design apps can do this so this is sort
of like in my opinion this is just like
the most forward-thinking design app
that's out and not to mention like I
said they they update features on this
thing like crazy this whole team
component library this interface here
didn't even exist when I started the
tutorial series in fact if you look at
like the first ten videos it's not even
there so like I said this app is
updating all the time but yeah that
that's pretty much it this is how I use
figma like I said I really really enjoy
using it a lot to me think component
component based workflow and everything
like that so yeah now I can take any
questions if anyone has me about Sigma
and I will do my best to answer those
well what is a good work below for
taking a finished component and then
created creating a hosted style guide so
I guess it depends on if you want the
style guide to be like code based for
visually based right for instance for me
I translate all of these these
components into react styled components
and then I can actually I built this
thing that iterates over all my styled
components and then how it puts them
into a style guide in a lot of ways
figma can be used as a style guide and
so to illustrate that let me let me show
you something really cool here so for
instance if I start making a style guide
page like this that has my typography on
this and stuff like that you know you in
the past you may be used something like
sketch measure where you could come in
here and measure everything and you
would have to have everything output
visually that way but if I was somebody
who this document was shared with and I
was just viewing this and I was sent
this as a style guide check this out if
I select this text instead of it being
plastered on the design itself I come
here to my CSS or my whatever and I can
access to all the properties I get the
font family I get the font size the
color you can or the positioning stuff
obviously because it's you you know you
want to absolutely position everything
but this functions very much like a
style guide
except for you have the ability to
really interact with it and actually get
these properties in it in a really nice
way other than that I would say you know
turn these components into code and let
the the style guide maybe work for
itself and in the code you could always
output some of these values copy and
paste from here and stuff like that but
it gives you the option right you don't
have to handwrite this stuff and you
have to do any that it's right here is
there a way to create curved arrows
struggling with one lately so if you're
referring to like a
an era where there's like a curved face
to it like Adeline is curved you could
always use the pen tool let's see okay
me bump up the that is ugly okay
apologize for this ugly ugly line here
let me bump up the weight here so we can
see this in action and we could actually
come in here to these three dots and you
could give it a cap which is in here oh
I think if we double click this and
select one of the vector points I think
we can give this a kappa which would be
a triangle arrow or line era there we go
cool so yeah so that's pretty much a
curved arrow right here you just make a
line segment and you make the line
segment curved then you would select the
individual vector point you click the
three dots on the stroke menu and then
you would be able to change the cap of
it so that that is that so I showed the
the prototyping tools a little bit ago
basically you turn on the prototyping
mode which is just in this tab and then
whenever you select a frame like frame
four here it comes up with a little node
and you can click and drag and that's
where it's going to move to when you
click on it or if you were to select an
object on the frame you could do the
same thing and when you click on that
object it'll be a hotspot okay so let's
see are you using this primarily to
design components you plan these as a
testbed for assembling components yeah
so basically all of the above I'm
designing whole pages components here
I'm using this as a test fit for
assembling components into page layouts
so yeah I'm definitely doing all of that
and then the process of rebuilding my
entire site within Sigma here as
components so when that happens it'll be
a lot more like just drawing LEGO pieces
around here and see how things work and
then I can
Design Systems it's almost like
designing in browser because you're
designing with these components and it's
much easier to just move stuff around
with so yeah really cool and if you keep
that one-to-one relationship between
your figma components and your react
styled components then man then then you
always know exactly what things are
gonna look like if you make changes here
and there would you recommend Adobe
Illustrator or figma for icon design you
know what I do
very minimal icon design I do like
really really super basic icons and then
that regard there you're not missing
anything I don't think from Sigma you
can do all of your your same sort of
like you can do your your Union tools
you can do all of your the same kind of
stuff you would do in within illustrator
right you can do all that same stuff you
the pen tool is actually really super
good there's a lot of really nice
features to it you can do this like
bending like if I make a straight line
here let's get out of this select this
vector bump this up I don't know where
this thing went I lost it
oh it's white that's why you could
select this line segment this is sorry
it's being a baby right now okay I don't
know what I'm trying to do here I was
just trying to bend this line segment
but oh I'm sorry there's like a bending
Bend tool where you can bend line
segments and stuff like that of course
you need to select the tool before you
can use it it's safe
apparently an issue so let me let me
show you this in action then Bend tool
and grab one of these line segments and
then just bend it really cool stuff so
in reality I don't I honestly don't know
like I said I don't do a ton of icon
design but for me if I was creating an
icon this the pen tool and
the output to SVG features like I showed
before where you could simply come in
here and copy as SVG like those things
are great the exporting features are
really nice I could just select this
click plus SVG export an SVG just toss
them out like nothing so for me yeah I
think it would suffice
especially because for an individual
license it's free right and I don't want
to pay for Adobe if you saw my video on
how to mostly get off at Adobe
she'll you'll notice I'm not the biggest
Adobe fan myself but that said if
whatever you're competent in and your o
worked nice and is cool with me well
just figma provide an API of any kind
code output I don't think they do know
I'm gonna say no um but there's this
little question mark box down here that
says help and feedback and I found them
to be really super responsive so if you
send them feedback through the app and
say hey would be really cool if there
was like an API to extend maybe export
these these components directly maybe
there's there's some way that that would
work I actually really like that idea
would you want to take screenshots from
your style guide to be the finalized and
fully rendered version of your
components yeah I don't know like I said
if you're keeping your components
one-to-one with your solid components
and stuff like that then everything
should like really really connect really
well where are some useful settings
change from the default settings I
didn't change anything I I don't I
haven't I haven't changed any settings I
use everything the way it is for the
most part your keyboard shortcuts work
the same right for instance in sketch
you hit a to do artboards and that's one
of the cool things about figma is they
know a lot of people are coming from
sketch so sure enough the a key makes an
a-frame or the F key makes a frame 2f a
frame and a four artboard just cuz they
know that people have that muscle memory
engrained so yeah I haven't changed any
defaults everything out of the box since
my needs really well do you still use
sketch for anything or do you only use
figma I only use figma I don't know if I
open sketch since I got figma and one of
the cooler things you can do is actually
drag and drop a sketch file directly
into figma and it imports it so so yeah
I can open all of my sketch files and
figma no problem and like I said this is
free for a single license so you don't
have to pay a yearly fee like your hard
for sketch like that might have been the
big reason why I jumped off sketch I got
the thing saying I all the sudden had to
pay a yearly license to get updates and
no thank you to be honest I mean I like
sketch a lot everyone knows I like
sketch but um yeah this this this fits
my needs very nicely and it can edit and
work my sketch files so yeah thank you
epic and for full component in figma
does the generated CSS also can include
potential or positional CSS based on the
constraints you set up I don't think so
but that would be awesome right now what
I've noticed is that
go to something that has constraints
that I'm paying attention to so this
text definitely has constraints if I
were to go to the code mode yeah the
position stuff right now is is
position:absolute stuff so I'd pretty
much always just ignore everything and
they separate it out which is nice too
they keep your text stuff here they keep
your color stuff here and your position
stuff here I almost never copied
anything from the position part but it's
nice that you don't have to build
picking that stuff out so it doesn't
look like any of that constraint stuff
but it'll save you time with things like
font weight font size colors and text
align font style all that sort of stuff
I think they're they're poll take on
this this sort of section of the code is
to not make it like straight up so that
you can 100% never write code but more
or less that you can just save a little
bit of time by supplementing your your
code writing with this and in addition
there's also Swift if you're an iOS
developer there's Swift code in here and
XML on text views and stuff for Android
if you're an Android developer so
they've really thought about it all
another thing that I like about figma
compared to sketches just their
attention to cross platforms and be more
than half the world I mean so many
people use Android phones right so the
fact that they're including Android in
their mirror app like there's the sketch
mirror app where you can see your
designs on the app well the figma mirror
app is for Android as well and the
artboard presets also have Android
presets as well so besides being
cross-platform they really think about
other platforms and that's one of the
things I like about it it's not sort of
this iOS and OS X garden of only Apple
stuff so yeah love it for a full
component in figma does the generate ok
I heard a sound oh yeah so that's pretty
much it if there's any last questions
I'll answer them otherwise this is this
is pretty much take my here also uh
maybe a quick sneak peek at a let's see
this I'm working on a new rack series
for
everyone and this is a little sneak peek
so this is sort of what I'm working on
right now it's going to be hitting api's
it's gonna be teaching reax 16 it's
going to be having all of that cool
react stuff I'm gonna be doing a lot of
really interesting stuff in here for a
beginner course there's going to be
there's there's going to be really just
I don't know more interesting stuff in a
beginner course than normal like I'm
going to show style of components I'm
going to show the latest version of
react router hitting api's and doing
sort of nice stuff so I'm really excited
about this is going to be the next
series for subscribers the the codes
going to be really excellent but it's
going to be react basics but doing
excellent excellent stuff and react
while making it super easy to understand
so yeah just a little sneak peek there
but yeah that that's pretty much it if
you have any more questions yeah I'll
answer them otherwise that's it
check out mastering figma become a pro
on level of tutorials and get access to
all of the the files from this you get
all of the thick my files you get access
to all the videos everything like that
super appreciate it and yeah super cool
so thank you so much for watching and if
that's it I'm going to end this
livestream and get back to work here
great thanks so much for watching and I
will see you in the next one and next
time I will promise I won't have any
resolution issues we're gonna be 1080p
the whole way so thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
