up tutorials and in this series we're
gonna be going over gatsby j/s which is
a static site generator both using a
bunch of really cool tools like react
graph QL web pack and basically a whole
bunch of the new cool stuff all wrapped
up in a really excellent static site
generator with a ton of great plugins
and really really cool ideas so in this
video we're gonna be showing you how you
can install gatsby how you can create
your first site and how we can get
started
so let's get going right now hey what's
up this is Scott with level up tutorials
and in this video I'm gonna be showing
you gets bjs now we've gone over gets
being a couple of the live streams and
stuff like that you've seen it a little
bit however we wanted to do a full-on
tutorial series and this is going to be
a totally free one on the channel here
and we run cover all sorts of stuff
building even up to a blog using some of
the different plugins that gatsby as
available maybe I'll even try doing one
of the WordPress example later on if
there's enough interest for it so as you
can see here we're at Gatsby j/s org and
you might be wondering what is this
what's it about why do I want to use it
well it's as you can see a blazing fast
static site generator for react so if
you're a react person you like working
and react which I I certainly do myself
it's a great way to build fast fast fast
static sites without a database or a
back-end now one of the most prominent
comments I got on the previous videos
was why not just use Jekyll which is
another static site generator well it's
really just different flavors it's
different flavors of the same type of
thing right so Jekyll is actually a ruby
based generator here so that means you
would have to be a little bit
experienced with the Ruby platform you
can see we're installing with using ruby
gems and then you're generating it that
way it's not a huge distinction and not
a huge problem there but it is something
to notice this Gatsby is entirely
based an edition Gatsby is entirely tied
in really tightly to react so if you
like using react and you want to build a
static site I don't think there's a
better option then then using Gatsby
here especially with the different
starting kits and stuff like that you
have to get up and running what else is
awesome about it well if we scroll down
here you can see that we have a whole
bunch of nice little graphs and diagrams
here basically we have several different
ways we can get data into Gatsby very
easily so content management systems
like content folder oopall WordPress or
markdown where you have just straight
markdown files or even api's like JSON
API and whatever and it's coming in
through graph QL and then coming into
your HTML CSS and obviously react and
this whole thing it generates the site
into actual static files that use the
JavaScript when it needs to but loads
really quickly because it's initially
loading just straight-up HTML files now
keep in mind there is no database
associated with this so you're going to
want to if you have some sort of data
requirement you're gonna want to have
some sort of ability to add data such as
through a CMS back-end like content
folder pull WordPress blah blah blah or
even just these markdown files so it
really depends on what you're after but
if you're building a blog and you're
techie this is a great way to do it if
you're building a blog and you're not or
your users are not techy then maybe you
could use something like content folder
WordPress to bring in data either way
here it's a really great way to build it
really awesome fast progressive web apps
with just basically the tools that
you're used to in react web pack react
router all that stuff ok so as an intro
here this is basically why we're going
to want to use it it's tied in really
nicely to the tools that we know and
love and it's very super fast uses all
the fancy new stuff so let's go ahead
and get started by installing it keep in
mind this too
going to assume that you have a little
bit of react knowledge I can sort of
explain what I'm going and doing as I'm
doing it it's also going to assume that
you have node J s installed on your
computer so go ahead and install node if
you are not running the latest version
please upgrade because I believe gets P
needs the latest stuff so upgrade your
version of node good to do anyways and
let's get started
the first thing you need to do is head
to the docs page on Gatsby J s org and
we want to run NPM install glow - -
global Gatsby CLI you just copy this
directly from here right so you just
copy this head to your terminal paste it
in and this will install Gatsby globally
for you so go ahead and run that pause
the video and wait for it to finish okay
so now that we have Gatsby installed
here wherever you're interested in your
site living we can run it just basically
now that we have to get to B CLI or
command line interface installed we can
run get B new and then whatever the name
of our site is going to be so we can
just say Gatsby lol u t you can name
this whatever you want this is a level
up head site basically I'm just going to
just show off how awesome this little
build tool is here so Gatsby new gets
beat whatever you want your site to be
named it's going to create everything
for you
and again just sort of hang out all this
downloads and installs everything and
restart the video once years it has
finished installing okay so we have
everything you could see it added a
whole bunch of packages and took 42
seconds it's okay because it did a whole
lot for us so what we want to do is
change directories into our site now so
I'm going to CD and then level or I
believe it was gets B LUT okay okay so
now I'm inside of my project directory I
can just simply type gets B
and then develop okay this is going to
start up our server and get everything
all running you could see is loading up
our files it's basically it's just
getting everything up and running you
can see it's done compiled and we are
able to view our site at localhost port
8000 and our graph QL debugger is at the
same the forward slash underscore
underscore underscore graph QL now we're
not gonna be doing any graph QL stuff
right now but we will be soon so no
worries there I'll go over a little bit
about that as we do it as you can see
here on localhost port 8000 we now have
a new website that says Gatsby
we have hi people welcome to our new
Gatsby site back to home page you can
see how blazingly fast this routing is I
mean this is just really really awesome
stuff here obviously we're doing a mix
of JavaScript using react to generate
these pages as well as loading up
statically generated HTML so basically
here's how it goes when you arrive at
the site this site is actually an HTML
page just like it would be if you
hand-cut it in HTML simultaneously the
site is also loading your JavaScript
bundles so that it knows how to handle
things like page routing and rendering
of other pages so basically you get the
best of both worlds where you get a
really fast static site as well as you
get the dynamic ability of react in fact
we could throw standard react components
all over this thing and we're still
going to have it work correctly as it
statically generated so you don't you
can have dynamic content within your
static site part of the reason why this
platform is really super nice okay so
now that we have this up and running in
the next video I'm going to go over the
code sort of what you get when you get
up and running with Gatsby and what we
can expect going forward maybe make some
modifications here there but basically
just give a lay of the land here and
understand what's happening so as always
