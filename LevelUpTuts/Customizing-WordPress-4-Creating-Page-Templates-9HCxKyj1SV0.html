up Tut's and today we're going to be
taking our template income template for
a particular page so let's say we have
our about Us page and on the about Us
page we've decided that this entire
sidebar needs to go in fact we don't
want to see it at all and let's just see
exactly what that would look like I'm
going to inspect down here and I'm
inspecting and the main div the div idea
of secondary of course if we were to
just have this completely disappear I
could select this and click delete and
this is what the site looks like without
it now I don't want this information
here so I'm just going to get rid of
that entire sidebar on this page now
whether or not that's a good idea
is up to you but the point is here is
that we have a modification that needs
to be made to only the about Us page now
in the last video we showed you that by
copying and pasting or copying and
moving a template file over from our
parent into our child theme that we were
able to successfully override it now for
this we want to do the same thing
however we're going to change the pages
name slightly just or the templates name
slightly so that it only affects the
about Us page now again like I said
before you might take you long before
you know exactly what templates these
all are but because we're modifying a
page you can probably guess that the
page that PHP is going to be your best
guess and now if I you know click
spacebar or whatever on the Mac to get a
preview you can see it just has our main
page content and stuff like that so
let's go ahead and copy this page that
PHP file into our child theme just like
we did before now let's come into
sublime text here and let's open up our
page dot PHP and like I did before I'm
just going to throw and oddly placed a
CH tag just to see if we are in fact
using this correct template
come back to our site give it a refresh
and I think we have it up here just
maybe white or something let's come back
and actually move that inside the main
content let's grab this and I'm just
going to throw it inside of this primary
content div just so we can make sure it
we can even see it okay cool so here's
our test right we only now want this on
the about Us page however you can see if
we go to the donations page and this
other sample page this test is still
there where it's not is if we come to
the home page or any of these individual
posts because these are using different
templates which of course we'll get into
later however we're just talking about
pages right now and remember there is a
distinct difference between a post and a
page so now we want this to only show up
on our about Us page and one way that we
can do that is by simply stating that
this template is for the about Us page
now we can come into the page itself and
look at our our URL here for the page
what the pages permalink is this about -
us and we can rename the template so if
I click rename page and then - and then
what our pages actual URL name is so
about - us now this is going to replace
that page dot PHP so our other pages are
no longer going to be looking for this
template file or looking at this
template file however about us is still
going to look here so now I'm going to
come back through my page I'm refresh it
and you'll notice we still have tests
here on about us but what we don't have
is on donations and we don't have it on
sample page either so now we're
targeting specifically this about Us
page well you might be wondering how can
you make a template that targets more
than one page well that's actually a
really interesting idea and it's
actually really super easy
so one thing that we can do is let's go
ahead and rename this once more if you
want to be targeting and having this
template available to select whenever
you use it you can give it a different
name something that's more applicable to
what the template actually is so we can
say no sidebar we can save that and then
what we want to do is come up to the
very top of our template and in the
comments here notice how I have these
asterisks here what we can say is
template space name and then a colon and
then what we want the template name to
be so we'll say this is no sidebar so
keep in mind this is within the comment
here and if you're using syntax
highlighting you should see that it is
grayed out just like the rest of your
comments so let's actually go ahead and
remove the sidebar as well if you want
to find out where the sidebar is one
thing we can do is always as we can
right click and inspect and you can see
that it looks like it starts just below
this ending main content comment and if
we come to our template let's scroll
down to the bottom you can see that this
main content template ending us right
here and we have this get sidebar PHP
call so what we can go ahead and do is
simply remove that entirely now let's
click Save and let's come back to our
page you'll notice we refresh and
obviously none of our page changes have
been made so what we can do now is
because then at the top of our template
way up top we said the template name was
no sidebar we can now come in to the
Edit Page screen come over here and
under page attributes you'll be able to
select no sidebar now or whatever you
named your template now we click update
and let's come view the page and of
course we now have none of that sidebar
content likewise if we wanted to come to
donations and do the same treatment we
could of course just click Edit and now
select that this no sidebar template is
also used on the donations page
let's click view page and there we have
it these two pages are now not using the
sidebar however the sample page and any
of our other posts will awesome so you
now have a little bit more flexibility
when modifying page templates in
WordPress
