up Tut's and today we're going to be
giving you an introduction to sketch
threes interface and we're going to be
showing you exactly what the tools like
so if you've never used schedule your
opening sketch for the first time then
this video is for you it's going to help
you see where some of the tools are
maybe things that you're used to working
with in other software and then and then
in a few videos we're going to start
getting into some really cool techniques
so these first few videos are going to
be for people who have never used this
before and people who want to want to
learn more about what it's like and then
after that we're going to be getting
into some of the unique features that
sketch has and just generally how to
make awesome things with sketch so go
ahead and download it if you haven't
check out the free trial I'm going to
open it up so if you've used sketch 2
before you'll see that with sketch 3 you
now get this nice loading screen it's
something that you might have seen with
some of the versions of Photoshop when
they come up and they give you sort of
like a an initial menu before I think in
sketch 2 was just sort of like here's
your workspace so this is really nice
that it gives you a little window you
can uncheck this check box if you don't
want to see this window you can um you
know check out some of these the manual
support if you're new to sketch stuff
you can start from templates here we
have a web design template iOS design
template or an icon template and they
even have a thing to let you see what's
new or sign up for a newsletter so we
can just hit OK and what it's going to
do is open up your basic workspace now
this looks like anything you know it
looks like a pretty standard OSX app and
compared to Photoshop you don't see the
big toolbar or anything like that but
everything is in a nice easy way to find
it in fact let's get started by just
adding a basic shape by coming to the
top left and we have insert when you
click here you can see some of your
tools but let's go ahead and just add a
shape just a basic rectangle now just
like Photoshop you can click and drag
you can hold shift to make it a square
you can just create a square and then
modify the size using the number values
and the inspector over here on the right
so if we wanted this to be 400 by 400
there it is so nothing really crazy
there basically any of the properties
you're going to be working with
including shadows and in layer styles
and things like that are going to be
over here on the right in this inspector
area and then anything like layers like
you're used to having layers in groups
of items are going to be over here on
this left panel so this is basically
where your objects are going to be this
is going to be where the configuration
for your objects is going to be and this
insert up top here is going to be where
you're going to go to start creating
things
so in this insert menu here we have the
ability to just make a vector line like
you you're used to with the Bezier curve
tool in Illustrator we just have a basic
pencil we have the ability to create
some shapes here we can add some image
some text we can have multiple artboards
that way you can easily export or just
have various working artboards you can
even run select in your slices and you
can add a symbol if we were to have
symbols defined and you could add style
to text if there was text Styles defined
we're going to go over exactly what that
means in further videos now next up here
is we have group and ungroup if we had
another object here let's just go ahead
and do another rectangle su-mei right
here we could select both of these by
clicking and dragging and then clicking
group now they're within a folder so
that whenever you click one it's going
to select both of them now you could
edit these individually by opening up
this folder and then selecting one and
then you can move it here but usually if
you're going to be clicking around in
your document and you click off of these
and click back it's going to select the
group
so if you of course wanted these to not
be in a group anymore you could select
the group and click this ungroup button
now you could also hit command G to put
them in a group and command shift G to
take them out of a group now we the
ability to create a symbol we're going
to go over exactly what that does we
have the ability to zoom in and out and
as you can see because these are vector
shapes we're not seeing any pixelation
or anything just like Photoshop if you
hold spacebar you can click and drag the
canvas around you hold space bar and
then click with the mouse and drag the
mouse wheel takes you up and down if you
scroll that and command + - zooms in and
out also so does this magnifying glass
like we just shown now you can select
your shapes and you can edit them and
have access to the actual points here
these are all things you should be
fairly used to and you could even
transform and skew your shapes and
rotate them so basically your
transformation tools are all just right
up top here now if you wanted to select
something and scale it you could scale
it using these uh using these tools
right here or you could just scale it
with by clicking and dragging or of
course you could change the size over
here in your inspector now if we wanted
to select these two shapes we also have
the options to make a union subtract
intersect or difference of course if you
don't know the differences between these
are a difference is going to basically
carve out any area where they're
overlapping let's undo that an
intersection is basically only going to
show you where they're intersecting and
subtracting is going to take the layer
that's on top and subtract it from the
layer that's on bottom and a union is
going to add them together now what's
nice about this is it's non-destructive
you'll notice that they're essentially
put into a group which is really just a
folder here and you still have access to
them individually
where you could move them around
unclick and then they're still in a
union here okay so let's take these out
of that and just have them be normal
shapes again you can take click on a
shape and tell it to go backwards and
all that's really doing is the same
thing as clicking and dragging it in
this panel over here and moving it into
a different layer just like that but
either way you select a layer and you
can send it forwards and backwards now
mirroring is going to mirror to your
device it only works on iOS devices so
if you're an Android user like me right
now you are out of luck hopefully that
isn't permanent
but who knows sketch seems pretty pretty
like Apple centric so you might not have
that opportunity now under view you can
show things like show pixels which is
something you're probably used to in
Photoshop you can see our our content
instantly becomes rasterized in here we
now see these aliased sort of edges and
now we can turn on rulers just like
you'd imagine with Photoshop however
rulers act a little different you can't
click in drag from a ruler and bring a
guide in to bring a rule to bring a
guide in you actually double click on
the the ruler itself and that's going to
bring a guide in here and then you can
click and drag now you can also click
and drag this ruler to sort of change
your your context here if you wanted
this to be like point zero or something
you could change this rulers context as
well ok now in here we can tell it to
show the grid which is going to be a
normal style grid or show layout which
is a web style grid here we have columns
and gutters you can come into grid
settings to change those columns in
gutters so here it's a basic 960 twelve
column grid with a twenty pixel gutter
and a sixty pixel column widths might be
something that you're used to although I
doubt very many sites are building with
the width of 960 nowadays and while
there is more to the sketch 3 interface
that's pretty much it except for this
export but
here where we can simply click this and
it's basically going to export this
selected area by default sketch 3
decides to select the borders of your
content if you don't have any artboards
defined since we don't it's basically
going to say okay here's the borders
your content this must be what you want
to export let's export it and it brings
up this menu where you have some options
you can change the format you can change
the size of it if you'd like and you can
give it a background color trim
transparent pixels and then click export
here so that's all the stuff you would
sort of expect from an application like
this and just because this has a simple
interface doesn't mean that this
applications for completing only simple
tasks sketch 3 can handle tons and tons
of complex operations of which we're
going to get into some of which are
really exciting and a lot of fun to use
so as always this is Scott with LevelUp
Ted's and stick around for the series
we're going to get into some really cool
stuff using sketch 3 thanks for watching
and I'll see you in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
