up tutorials and today we're going to
add icons to your project using the
polymer core icons now it allows you to
import them using a simple HTML import
like we have been using and then after
that you have access to a ton of SVG
icons that you can style resize and
shape how you need to these polymer
icons are super easy to use and really
easy to get started so let's do that now
so in the last video we introduced some
core layout elements and what we did is
we built this header panel that allowed
for a toolbar at the top and then a
Content area below as you can see we
have our toolbar up top and our content
area below and now we want to add some
life to this and what we're going to do
is we're going to be using these polymer
core icons and now these core icons are
just a really easy way that if you're
already using polymer that you can
import these SVG icons so it's really
great about that is that you can use CSS
to modify these icons and you don't have
to worry about changing them if they
were some sort of an image also you
don't have to worry about font rendering
because they're not a font they're going
to be SPG's so let's go ahead and import
what we need to import to get these
icons working now if you didn't install
everything like we did at the beginning
you're going to need to install these
core icons since we installed everything
already in our bower components you'll
see that we have core icons core icon
set or icon buttons core icon and core
icon set - SVG now if you don't have
those installed you can want to go ahead
and do so using the bower install
polymer core icons command and I'm going
to go ahead and paste the link into the
description of the video from the
polymer project page that shows you the
exact bower commands on how to install
those so the first thing we want to do
is import like we have been already we
want to import our core icons so I'm
gonna have another link here let's
actually make the sidebar much smaller
instead of core toolbar its core icons
so again core icons HTML so we have
but our component score icons core icons
HTML now we're ready to use polymers
built in core icons for instance if we
wanted to use the polymer logo we could
go ahead and drop it in here just by
with a core - icon element tag and then
we have an icon attribute where we're
going to pass this a string this
particular string is going to be polymer
since we're going to be using the
polymer logo okay now we just want to
close that element and let's go ahead
and refresh our page to see what we have
now let's actually inspect this to see
what we have here and as you can see we
have this core icon but if we open this
up into our shadow Dom you see we have
an SVG tag with some properties on it
here so that's really great what's cool
about this is now that we can have this
property here we can actually style this
with CSS now what's great about this if
we want to actually style this all we
have to do is in our CSS say we want to
style the core icon and we can actually
drill down a little bit more by using
the attribute by having brackets here
and then we can say the icon attribute
that's equal to polymer just like that
now we can style this icon specifically
so let's go ahead and give it some
properties we're going to say color blue
it's going to be this really ugly
standard blue and then we can say height
of 50 pixels and a width of 50 pixels
now let's check out our HTML and as you
can see we have this big image here and
it's an SVG so we're not getting any
weird scaling things going on we have
the colors being blue and you can see
our height in with our overriding the
core icon height and width now this is
awesome and totally useful we didn't
have to waste any time installing any
icon fonts we didn't have to have any
extraneous markup we basically just have
one tag that is the icon and it says
what it is
so viewing your HTML it's immediately
obvious what that icon is however you
may be wondering what are the icons we
obviously the polymer icon isn't the
only icon that we want so we can come
over here to the demo page where they
have all of the core icons on the
polymer projects website I can make this
page available for you in the comment
section or you can get there through
that same other page that I have listed
in the description section of the video
and as you can see here we have all
sorts of icons and they're listed in
different types we have the default set
which is what's going to be available
through your core icons and if we scroll
down you'll see we have some other icons
like AV icons and it says here that
you're going to have to import AV icons
dot HTML so before you could use these
you would have to import AV icons HTML
and scrolling down you see we have
communication icons we have device icons
so it gives you out access to things
like a Bluetooth of charging editor
icons hardware all sorts of stuff in
here right so we even have these social
icons which you would have to import
with social icons HTML the way you'd
have the access to things like Instagram
Facebook github the typical icon sets
that you'd see in things like font
awesome are all here and the icons look
really great I've actually been using
these a lot on polymer projects anyways
lately just through Google's own github
repository of them so let's scroll up
here and for fun let's just add some
more I'm going to add this Android icon
because I like Android and let's scroll
down here for core icon I can just copy
and paste this and then you can see all
it takes is just changing this to
Android saving coming back to our page
refreshing and we have another icon
there we're free to size and style
however we please okay so now we want to
try to use some more icons from a
different icon set let's say we want to
use these social icons so let's go ahead
and copy this core icons import
statement that we had before here
instead of we're going to keep this
first path the same so it's still in
slash core icons however now it's going
to be slash social icons dot HTML and
now we have access to
the whole host of social icons so if we
wanted to add one of those let's just
paste in a new core icon just like we
had before now we're going to be using
this social tag so for icon it's going
to be a social and then colon which icon
you want it to be so let's say we wanted
the Instagram and it's actually not just
Instagram its post Instagram so a social
colon post - Instagram refresh and we
now see we have this nice Instagram SVG
here that we can do whatever we want
with it great so we've now been able to
just drop in an icon set using polymer
using the basic core polymer icons feel
free to check out the core icons a page
that we showed you here to see all of
the awesome icons there are in the next
video we're going to explore these
layout attributes that we talked about
briefly in the previous video like full
bleed layout and vertical so keep
watching and learn more and more about
what polymer has to offer as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials thanks
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one
