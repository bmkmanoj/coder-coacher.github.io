up tutorials and in this quick level up
tip here I'm gonna share with you a tool
and they by Pavel Gucci Beck and what he
made here is something that's really
dead simple but just super duper nice
right I've already used this thing a
hundred times so what this is is a
snippet a generator for any of your
three major text editors we have vias
code sublime text and atom which I love
that it's platform-agnostic because it's
like so there's this great tool that's
been made oh but it's only for one
platform that sucks right here we have
it for vias code sublime and atom which
I'll have a little bit slightly
different snippet syntax so I'll include
a link to this in the video description
but as you can see here if you know how
to do snippets you'll know that envyus
code you actually have to have each line
of your snippet be its string in an
array and the tabbing and spacing has to
be dead-on and is really just super
annoying to have to write out the syntax
to do the snippets so what I like to do
is just come in here and drop in my code
and copy it straight out of es code or
whatever I'm working in and you'll
notice nice and nice here we have our
all of our tabbing and spacing correctly
with the array and you'll notice that
sublime text has a completely different
set acts entirely I do like how I
changed the color here so you know which
one you're looking at or it's it's like
hey if it's not the right color that
you're looking at then you'll know that
you've selected the wrong one and
obviously Adam here is pretty much the
same as vyas code in a lot of ways
however it allows for this triple quote
that allows you to have basically a
multi-line string so I use Villa's code
here and wait we can make this a little
bit better is by using placeholders
right so it says declare placeholder and
then more info shows you basically how
you can declare a placeholder in each of
the major different ones so if we wanted
to have a placeholder for component name
with the default value of component name
we could have dollar sign bracket 1
colon component name and
and this off of the bracket and now what
this is going to do is have the
component name be the default part of
these snippets now check it out this is
our snippet we want to have maybe a
description here it's tend to be new
react component Kim now the tab trigger
is going to be what triggers this
snippet from displaying and because I
already have a bunch of react snippets
that I want to have this be another RC
whatever I just want to show this in the
demo this is a PHA I'm getting this from
the first three letters of Powell's name
here so as you can see here PA W and we
can copy this snippet directly simply
just by clicking in the snippet selects
us all for us and you could do command C
from here or without doing any of that
you could just click copy and you'll see
it's been highlighted now we can head to
V s code and I'm going to throw up a new
snippet here you can do code preferences
user snippets now I love using snippets
because they can just make your life so
much better and you see we have just an
object here I can go ahead and just
paste the snippet directly into this
object you see my prefix PA W let's go
ahead and try this out in a file and
just have a random file right here and
let me give some space here at the
bottom I can type PA W you can see it
recognizes snippet pasted it out and
component name is now highlighted PA W
whatever you want to say to call this
snippet so as you can see here this
works
SuperDuper well it basically takes all
of the pain of having to write all this
garbage out every single time and
especially having to deal with all of
the spaces and array of strings and
stuff like that and as far as the other
syntaxes go it makes the atom one a lot
easier by eliminating the having to
write out this object or the C son or
whatever it is and then for the sublime
text to be honest I never learned the
sublime text snippet syntax so it's nice
that you don't have to learn the syntax
for a snippet right because a snippet
should be saving you time not making you
learn these specific syntax of that
platform to write a snippet so I'll post
a link to this snippet generator and
they come into this video you want to go
ahead and
Pawel website follow him on twitter give
him lots of likes and lots of stars on
github share this on Twitter all of the
good stuff this is some excellent
excellent stuff that I already have been
using all the time so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments if you
come out of the video let me up at
Twitter or Facebook a level up tutorials
thanks so much for watching and i'll see
in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
