tots today we're gonna cover embedded
templates so let's get to it
so an embedded template works like this
we're gonna head and create there's
loops tag called embed which perceives a
path and the path is going to be to a
template group and then to a template
name so this is going to be to a temple
that doesn't quite exist yet that's
gonna be in the includes template group
and the name of that templates gonna be
footer and the content that I quickly
snipped out of there was the JavaScript
body and body and and HTML tag so let's
go ahead and put that in this template
group update and finish I'm gonna create
a new template group and this is gonna
be called them cludes
whenever you create a temple group it
also creates an index template for you
but we're not gonna use it and we're
gonna call this one footer Creek and I'm
gonna go into footer and just paste in
that bit of code and just to prove to
you that it's working embed did okay
so didn't finished if I go over here and
refresh it's actually showing up and
here's the coat so here we go so now
what we have here is a snippet that I'll
put some PHP and it's also outputting
some standard global variables here we
have a global a custom global variable
being outputted and below that we are
using the embedded template method now I
already talked about the advantages
excusing snippets but just to review a
snippet can include expression engine
code PHP variables it doesn't matter
anything the another advantage to
snippets are that they are parsed very
early when expression engine is actually
building the page and so that's sort of
why you would want to use it I mean
that's definitely why you'd want to use
this snippet embedded templates the
reason why you'd want to use an embedded
template is embedded templates we have
their own set of permissions and their
own set of permissions as in you can
assign who can access this template or
not which group by default you know it's
always sort of like everybody but that's
you know something that you can tailor
to your site also each template has
their own set of preferences you know is
it a web page is there caching is PHP
allowed etc so you know if you need
those types of settings then you know
you're definitely going to need them to
use a an embed the embedded template
method and then again for global
variables you don't use that for static
content they're parsed pretty late and
they actually don't run through the
expression engine template engine
process so you can't include expression
engine tags or you know PHP or stuff
like that so you know but they're but
they're still good
for static content so right
so he maybe now might be thinking well
then what I understand that snippets and
better templates are good but why would
you not want to just always use an
embedded template and that's because
when you embed a template inside of
another one it's actually the way that
expression engine works is each template
is parsed separately or is parsed
individually so basically what that
means the more embeds that you have on a
page the slower the page is going to be
drawn snippets are just parsed as part
of a page so this is just included as
part of the page versus you know being
it's a whole separate entity so you know
that's why expression can really
encourage you to use snippets one when
you can one other feature of embedded
templates that I want to point out is
that you can actually pass variables
through the embed code so for example
what I can do is write just I can write
make up any name of a variable so we'll
just say I don't know year and just that
year equals 2012 and I'm just hit update
and finished and I'm gonna go back to
this footer tag and because this is
embedded I should be able to just say
embed and I think I said here
and it updatin finished and there we go
so that's actually a really cool very
powerful function of the embed language
that I just wanted to point out and this
is certainly something that will be
useful when you are building more
complex sites go ahead and just get rid
of that for now this code doesn't really
make a lot of sense being there but
again just know that you can embed
variables or assign and embed variables
using the embed tag all right well
thanks a lot for watching and learning
about global or embedded templates
please stay tuned for more expression
engine videos and again please also
subscribe to our YouTube channel we
really appreciate it thanks a lot bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
