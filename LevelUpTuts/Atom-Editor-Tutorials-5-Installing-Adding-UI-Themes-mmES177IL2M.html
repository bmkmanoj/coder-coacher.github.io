up tutorials and in this video I'll be
showing you how you can install and use
different user interface themes with an
atom so let's see going on that right
now you've used text editors before like
sublime text you I'm not that changing
your theme in something like sublime
isn't necessarily that easy I mean it's
easy but it's not something that is
totally painless first you'd have to get
either some sort of theme by downloading
it and by driking a folder into another
folder in finder or you'd have to get
package control and install some sort of
theming or maybe and just install the
theme that way and then enable it by
editing a JSON file now an atom it's
much different in fact out of the box
with like we already saw with color
schemes you have a tab for themes and
here we have the syntax theme but we
also have the UI theme now UI themes are
great because they also come with their
own settings when you click the Settings
it takes you to the page that will show
you some more information about that
theme where you can have some little
tweaks here to a particular theme
in addition you can actually see the
readme for the theme which often gives
what it looks like itself now what is a
UI theme the UI theme changes all sorts
of things that aren't essentially with
your basic syntax colors it's going to
be changing the overall look of your
editor and even some little small things
in the interface so let's go ahead and
install by clicking themes and I'm gonna
look for I'm gonna look for a material
design UI theme to go with the color
scheme that we've already enabled
now you see we have atom material UI
this one has two hundred and eighteen
hundred thousand downloads so that's a
lot which should mean that it's pretty
good now we can come here now that its
installed and head to our themes and
just like with our syntax theme you know
should find atom material in it to your
list right here
upon selecting it we've seen some things
change we now have what looks like
different icons we have different
highlighting we have a different font we
have different overall spacing and
padding and you'll notice we select
things we even get some animations that
didn't exist this button animation this
animation of the line right here now
it's cool here as we can head back to
themes and let's select this atom
material UI and we can see we have some
settings we can just disable animations
if they're taking up too much of our CPU
or anything like that we could have slim
scroll bars instead of heavier scroll
bars we could use an accent color in the
ripple effect now you could even show
the file type icons in the tabs I
actually like to have this in the active
tab sometimes I like to have it in all
tabs however having the file type icon
is just nice to have we could make tabs
have a minimum width I don't need that
so I can leave that normal we can set
the size of the tab bar I'm gonna like
set mine to small I don't need them to
be big you just sort of need to see them
you could set the UI font size regular
is fine with me
now it's asking if you want to use
Roboto mono for the font and the text
editors or use the Roboto font in the UI
I like this font if you select it it
looks nice in here however I've known
about the mono because I sort of liked
the font that atom comes with by default
in addition you can compact the treeview
get rid of some of the padding there
that's a nice thing to save you some
space if you need it
we can add some depth to the UI which is
basically adding shadows which
personally I enjoy as well when you have
these sidebars it's sort of all blend
together it isn't as nice to me as when
you have some sort of a distinction and
the drop shadow is a nice subtle
distinction now you can also add
contrasting panels which takes that
further and it turns this color a bit of
a less saturated more of a grey color
now in addition we can actually set our
accent color ourselves so right now it's
a two teal we have all sorts of options
depending on what you like now
personally as a level of tutorials fan
purple would be nice but really this
color scheme is really nice because it
allows you to really take control over
how it looks and how you would like it
to look yourself
oh I'm gonna leave this as purple here
and as you can see now in our changing
tabs we get that nice accent pop into
the ripple
cool so this is how you change the UI
theme in Adam and as you can see Adam
material allows for a whole bunch of
nice settings that allow you to totally
tweak it and a lot of these themes are
going to come with their own settings
packages to further allow you to modify
what they are looking and interacting
like so if you're enjoying these Adam
videos and you want to get them before
they're released you can purchase them
at store that level up tutorials calm as
a pre-release and help support the
creation of these free tutorials as
always this is Scott with level of
tutorials if you want to hit me up at
Twitter or Facebook live to hear from
you thanks for watching and I'll see you
in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
