up tuts and today I'm bringing you your
second CSS tutorial today I'm going to
go over basic CSS syntax and we're going
to make something change its color okay
so what we're going to do is hop on over
to our styles that CSS I'm gonna get rid
of this comment I wrote it last time
and so the basic CSS syntax is it goes
something that you're going to style
let's say an h1 and then it goes
brackets and then you're going to have a
property a property could be you know
its color its background its text
decoration so to say okay let's say a
color would be its property so color and
then we're going to have a colon and
then a value so for color values that
might work is sort of blue green yellow
CSS has a bunch of basic colors you can
also use hex colors so if you have a hex
value you can do pound and then five
five five five five five four gray so
let's actually just write this blue
because it's obnoxious and it's loud
okay so this is your entire line of CSS
this is pretty much what it's going to
look like h1 the color of it is blue and
a lot of times people write CSS in
different ways some people write it out
in a line and you can just add another
one here you could say the font size is
12 pixels so you could write it like
this however I would personally
recommend doing it a little bit
different and it's pretty easy to read
so if you space it out like this you
have your bracket here your bracket here
and then you can have your properties
here I think this is the easiest way to
read CSS but someone else's CSS I think
it's easier to go into a document and
sort of see and know exactly what you're
you know to expect if you see this
when it's all in one line maybe not so
much it might be a little bit more
difficult but that said everybody has
different ways of writing your CSS and
if you're the only person that's ever
going to be seeing the CSS then I may be
do it how you want but I would stress to
sort of do it a way that if anybody is
going to go into your code they can sort
of know what's going on okay so this is
the basic CSS syntax notice how I have
h1 here
you could also pretty much do anything
if you have like a paragraph it'd be a P
list item B Li but let's say you want to
target a particular paragraph let's
actually copy this paragraph here I'm
going to make a second one I'm going to
make this some obnoxious text but she
goes okay and and here I want to only
style this yellow one if I give this P
let's say a color of red and then now
I'm going to go to my HTML I'm going to
refresh it you see that both our
paragraph tags are red okay we only want
this yoyoyo
so what's a good way to do that is to
give this paragraph a class so let's
give this class of and we're just going
to have this be an alert so now that
this is the class of alert we want all
of the paragraphs that are alert we want
those to be read so what you can do is
you can do dot alert so now it's going
to be only looking for the class alert
and it's going to color those things red
let's go back to our CSS or HTML we
refresh it and yoyoyo is the only one
that's red cool what if you only wanted
paragraph tags with the class alert to
be read let's say on this h1 we give
this a class of alert as well what's
going to happen here if this h1 also is
a class of alert what's going to do is
it's going to first read
h1 and it's going to give it a color
blue but then it's going to see this all
this thing has a color alert I guess I
should be red so let's go to our HTML
refresh this and now you can see it's
actually red even though we told it to
be blue it's going to say oh the alert
is red 1 let's say you only want to
target paragraph tags that are red you
would type P dot alert so now it's going
to ignore everything except for
paragraph tags that are with the class
of alert awesome so this is the basic
CSS syntax you can key up of all sorts
of stuff you can Kiev the tag you can
key off the class you can key off an ID
by doing pound I would recommend using
classes to key off of and then sometimes
you're going to want to say all H ones
are this way all h2 through this way in
fact I would recommend doing it that way
in fact CSS follows a philosophy of
don't repeat yourself so let's say you
have a couple of different paragraphs we
have this alert paragraph and we have
just a normal let's say you will just
call this a yes paragraph and then I'll
go ahead and give this other one a class
of yes
so let's say we want all of the
paragraphs on our site to have a font
size of 24 pixels what you don't want to
do is say are ok this the P alert in the
PS those both have a font size of 20 24
pixels because if you noticed we've just
written this code twice and sure enough
they're both 24 pixels but the smart
thing to do here if all of your
paragraph tags on your site are going to
be that size we just have a paragraph
font size 24 pixels now we'll come back
here refresh and it nothing happens
because it's the same okay so don't
repeat yourself and CSS it's something
that we're going to be talking a lot
more so don't worry about it
we'll come back to it all the time but
this is the basic CSS syntax and now you
know how to change the color of
something as well
for fun let's just make this green
refresh okay cool so you can now now you
have your CSS file attached to your HTML
document and then you know how to attach
styles to elements on your page great in
the next lesson we're going to be going
over some more different kinds of
properties and values and what you can
do with them and that's the way it's
going to work for a little bit we'll get
you some cool techniques and some good
skills ok once again says Scott with
level up tuts as always a fairly
questions let us know hit me up on
Twitter level up Tut's or just shoot us
a you know a comment on the video thanks
