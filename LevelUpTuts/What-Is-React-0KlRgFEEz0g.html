up tutorials and in this video I want to
be starting a new series called what is
and we're gonna be doing these on
Wednesday so it's not gonna be a what is
Wednesdays where we cover an individual
topic through a course of a video where
I simply just describe in plain English
what the heck this thing is because web
development stuff has so many terms
thrown around left and right and you
just kind of get lost in it all
sometimes so to honor my new react
series I'm going to cover react in this
video the topic of this video is hey
what is react what is it exactly and how
does it sort of help me in my day-to-day
life if I'm not familiar with it so if
you have any more topics that you want
to see covered under what is Wednesdays
where I do a dive into what exactly this
thing is let me know in the comments and
I'm gonna get to them so let's get
started right now so this is going to be
the first of many of these videos where
I'm going to essentially break down a
topic now this is videos gonna be more
about what actually is react and what
it's going to do for you more so than
how can you use it if you want to learn
how to use react I just put out a new
series react 16 for everyone you can
check it out the playlist is on the
front page of level up tutorials right
now or you could just head to level up
tutorials calm there's a premium series
so you'll get 6 episodes for free see if
it's for you and then if you want you
can purchase it or subscribe to get
access to all of that but so the point
of this video is really to just talk
about man what is react so if you know
what react is this video is not for you
ok this video is for the people that
have seen it being spouted off here and
there right they've seen all of the hype
about react they've seen a lot of people
talking about it and they've seen the
code maybe they just don't give what the
heck it is right like why would I need
this what is the point of this and the
simply put react is a a JavaScript
library for building user interfaces
they say it right up front here and to
me this is the best description of it
now people like to maybe claim it's a
framework
or or say it does this and this and this
and this but at the end of the day you
just really need to think about this
you're building a website and you need
something to be interactive or
potentially a dynamic interface right
and it doesn't necessarily have to be
crazy interactive it could just be a
general interface I mean they make
static site generators out of react now
so either way the whole point of react
is just for building interfaces whether
that's interfaces that you click on
something and something else changes and
data loads and stuff like that
that's all great but at the end of the
day you're just building interfaces and
you can drop in if you want it to right
you could have a module of your site
that is react and they may be react is
just rendering a very small portion of
your website it could be an entire HTML
website and using react you could drop
in an interface maybe if this interface
needs to be dynamic or something like
that so usually I think the
misconceptions about react are that it
does more than you think it does right
people might think that it's a whole
framework it has all this sort of stuff
in it in reality
react is just code that makes it dead
simple to interact with elements and
build dynamic components and buy
components
I just mean areas or things in your
website right a good way to think about
it would be to even just look on this
page overall like what could be a
component here well this search area up
top here search docks this could be a
component so if you think about it this
particular user interface requires that
when you click on it and you start
typing that a list of search terms just
start coming up and then allows you to
select one and then go on to something
else but this thing's a sort of doesn't
happen with basic HTML right and you
couldn't necessarily do all of this in
the same way server-side or something
like that this requires that when the
user in the browser starts typing
something some dynamic stuff happens and
some interfaces change or load or or
something like that and so that's really
the purpose of react right it's to build
cool stuff like this stuff
that is dynamic now let's talk a little
bit about what react looks like and if
we kind of scroll down here we can see
some examples and you may confuse code
that looks like this
with well react itself and that's a
major turnoff for some people is the use
of HTML in JavaScript and the hits it's
not necessarily HTML it's a language
called JSX which by the way is optional
you don't even have to use jazz if we
were to uncheck this check box you could
see that this is what react looks like
without JSX now honestly it's
recommended to use JSX and I personally
do it's a nice way to work in it but it
shouldn't turn you off because honestly
one of the benefits of using JSX is that
you're able to interact with the Dom in
the way that you know how right the way
that's very familiar you've been writing
HTML for all of these years and now well
we can write HTML in a way that's 100%
connected to JavaScript and it's really
connected in a nice way that you can
interact in them Venson have state and
have encapsulation and all sorts of
really great stuff that you can't have
with HTML not only that but it provides
some sort of structure where a component
sort of encapsulates everything that a
component would do instead of writing a
bunch of jQuery right because when
you're writing a jQuery you have your
code that's interacting with the HTML
and sort of does its stuff but at the
end of the day those two things are
entirely separate and they're
interacting with each other here this
whole thing is encapsulated in one
little thing here and it just makes it
working with it just one-to-one
SuperDuper easy
in addition components also have
something called state where well you
can change their state and I had someone
ask me that to do a what is video on
state which I'm going to do like what is
state but in in the essence of this you
can think of it like a toggle the toggle
has two states on or off right and with
react you can set that into the
component this on or off value and you
can trigger it change it whatever and
then do something with that value
further on
it's nothing groundbreaking in that
regard but the fact that this state
lives within this component is again a
nice way to encapsulate everything now
lastly we have some really cool stuff
the fact that you're building components
I like to describe these I don't know if
this is a great metaphor analogy you
know but as Lego blocks right you have
these blocks that you're creating with
your components and you can connect them
together to make things and the reason
why this doesn't hold up entirely is
because react has this parent-child
relationship obviously that Lego blocks
don't but what's cool about this is is
that you can grab these different
components from elsewhere from NPM from
the internet right something someone
else has written and you can drop it in
your project and use it without having
to write it and they can be these macro
things that generate full-on tables and
charts with it can be very micro like a
simple toggle component that simply just
makes it so you don't have to write
those state changes all the time and
these kind of things that allow react to
be so flexible it's one of the reasons
why it's really had just an absolutely
blown up in the community now another
great feature of react itself is that
you can use react code on the client
server or both for instance level up
tutorials has this code right and this
is all built in react and this is
front-end and react but if we were to
look at the code here you could see
everything server-side rendered as well
right this code is coming straight out
of the HTML that's loaded in this page
but here's the kicker I wrote the same
code client-side and server-side that
means I didn't have to write let's say
if you're talking about WordPress or
sunlight I didn't have to write a
wordpress theme and then write a
wordpress theme in PHP and then write
some JavaScript to interact with it in
the Dom those are all together in one so
these are just some of the things about
reacting reasons why people like it for
the most part it's a fairly small
library for working with user interfaces
and it's extremely capable one of the
cool things that react did when it came
out was well instead of trying to do
everything it tried to do just one thing
really well and because of that the
community is extremely flexible and if
you want to use other things in
coordination with react it's extremely
easy reacts not trying to do everything
it's not trying to it's just basically
handling your user interface and how its
displayed and updated on the screen so
I've gone this far without talking about
the virtual DOM which is one of the
features that is it one of the things
that people really really like about how
react performs and essentially what the
virtual Dom is is well it's if you well
the Dom which is the document object
model is essentially what the browser
sees as HTML as a structure of your
website and it's how you interact with
your website in the browser
well what react does is it basically is
it creates an in-memory data structure
cache so it's caching what it looks like
and then it's computing differences and
then it's only changing what needs to be
changed right now one thing that's great
about that is you get some really really
fast page updates right when you change
things and move things around the only
thing that needs to be changed is
changed and everything else stays put
and therefore react can be extremely
fast again I mentioned this parent-child
relationship as well basically where
data comes down from one component into
the next and it greatly mimics how you
generally think of HTML structure
overall if you look at some of my code
right here you can see we have something
like a toggle that wraps around a user
menu wrapper that wraps around a user
menu icon that wraps around a Gravatar
now what's interesting about this whole
flow is that data can come down where I
have the user passed into this component
and then I can then use this same user
and a child component whether it's in
the same file or not pass through
something called props now if you want
to learn about all this stuff again
check out the react course but for the
most part you always have this sort of
top-down data structure where stuff's
going in from parent to child and it
makes knowing what's going we're
extremely easy now
another thing that came about with react
is react native allowing you to write
it's it's basically react code you can
write essentially code that looks just
like this the only difference is you're
using custom components built by
Facebook that interact with native api's
to build real like native applications
not a a wrapper around an HTML site put
into an app but a real application and
that is something that's extremely
powerful and really you couldn't do
before right you locations with
JavaScript you just couldn't so again
all of this stuff you hear the words JSX
you hear virtual Dom you hear state you
hear things like Redux which actually
isn't part of react itself you hear all
of these things and think gosh react
seems complex and I don't want to write
HTML inside of JavaScript but at the end
of the day like I mentioned that react
is simply just a way to write user
interfaces you can use it as much or as
little as you want you don't need to
build your entire app and react however
like I said before because react can be
server-side rendered building your
entire site in react is not a terrible
idea in fact I think it in fact there's
a reason why it's really absolutely
blown up now another great thing about
react is that it teaches you some actual
legit JavaScript skills that you don't
get from other frameworks one thing I
really like about react is that things
are just based on JavaScript for
instance we have a component which is
essentially just a class right instead
of being something far out of JavaScript
world we're defining a new class and all
it's doing is an extending an existing
class in that class comes from react
that's what gives us components some of
its powers right and even though there
is some jargony stuff here we still have
a constructor we have we have methods in
here and we're using just straight-up
JavaScript for instance it doesn't try
to do looping or anything like that for
you
there's no ng for for loops and stuff
built-in to react you actually use legit
array functions from JavaScript and you
see things like map and that filter and
reduce being used and those things can
be scary for
javascript developers or even web
developers and all right if you haven't
used that stuff it looks scary
error functions all the stuff looks
scary but the great thing is is that
these are skills that you take with you
outside of react they're not react
specific skills this is straight-up
JavaScript skills so another reason I
really love working in react now let's
talk about something else you can take
with you you can take your JSX and react
code with you as well there's a lot of
other libraries that interface with Reax
api for instance we have pre-act which
is a three kilobyte alternative to react
with the same as with the same es2015
api so what's cool about pre-act is that
this library aims to be able to be not
necessarily a drop-in replacement but a
replacement for react nonetheless that's
not going to make you feel locked into a
facebook project but more or less luck
but more or less feel right at home
building your components and another one
is inferno which is a super-fast library
although I don't know what the current
speed comparisons to the latest version
of react as they do say it's five times
faster than react but honestly I'm not
sure if this has to do with the latest
version of react witches a notable
improvement on performance and some
quick things about the history of our
react just so you know a little bit here
it was created by Jordan Wolk an
engineer and face book basically he was
influenced by angular and some other
stuff and created react where it was
first used in Facebook's feed in 2011
and so it had been around for a little
bit before it was open sourced in 2013
and when it was open sourced in 2013 is
really when it started to catch on then
in a 2015 react native came out and that
sort of blew the doors off again sort of
blowing people's minds that the ability
to create native apps in JavaScript and
most recently in 2017 react released
their latest version 16 which is also
known as react fibre basically it's an
entirely new core algorithm that makes
this thing run super fast and became and
is going to be the foundation for a
whole bunch of future improvements and
things that fix some of the issues that
the
we'll have with maybe some of the way
that we write react components so that's
pretty much it if there's one thing you
can take away from this is that react is
not this big scary beast it's not this
giant foreign alien it's not something
that's going to destroy the way you
write HTML or understand websites but it
will completely blow your mind in terms
of how easy it is to build excellent
user interfaces one of the reasons why
it's so popular although it is
polarizing when people see things like
HTML and JavaScript as well as the
general look of react Akande it can
definitely put some people off but for
those people because I was certainly one
of them you know I was initially put off
by the way react looked and felt I would
recommend that you plow through that and
learn it because honestly nothing has
made me a better developer than learning
react and I feel like I can say that
confidently so check it out react org if
you want to learn more about react head
over to level up tutorials com where you
can become a pro and get access to the
latest react 16 for every one series you
can check out the preview videos here
and see if they're for you I teach you
how to build a really cool app so check
it out thank you so much for watching
let me know what other topics you'd like
to see me cover Donna what on what is
Wednesdays okay just leave something you
would like to see covered in the
description below and I will get to that
when I can I'm going to try to do one of
these a week so hopefully as we go here
we end up building a huge library of
what is sort of definitions about stuff
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
