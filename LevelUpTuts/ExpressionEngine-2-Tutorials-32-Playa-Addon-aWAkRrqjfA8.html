level up Todd's thanks for coming back
and checking out one of my expression
engine tutorials in this tutorial I'm
going to cover the playa extension by
pixel and tonic the playa extension is a
add-on for expression engine which
allows you to relate one or more pieces
of content to each other the playa is
currently at version 4 33 as of this
recording and currently also sells for
$69 it so it's on the more pricey end I
guess for add-ons but you'd be
hard-pressed to find a better one and
definitely they don't pay us to say this
this is just our in my personal opinion
so we're going to cover sort of the
basic terms and uses of this extension
and there'll be a couple other follow up
videos that's sort of going to take us
on and on and on until we've really got
it mastered alright so here we go I've
been using this band site that I
developed a little bit ago as a example
and so I want to highlight one of my
uses for playa so here is an album right
and an album is made up of multiple
tracks and in this case there's ten
songs on this album and each one of
these songs is actually its own entry in
the database so the album as a whole is
one entry and then each and then each
track is its own entry that we've
related back to this album so you would
say that this album is the parent and
these tracks are the children there's
another term that is used in plant and
that is to describe these children are
siblings of each other's
and then also one last term which is a
co-parent so that would be if like this
track of time also belong to another
album and in some cases that's true
right because a song could be on an EP
and then also then released on a LP or
on a greatest hits album or something so
anyway so I'm going to go ahead and walk
you through basically how I set this up
so I already have paid for course
downloaded uploaded and installed this
extension on my site and so we're not
going to go through that process goes
near third-party folder just like
everything else and once you've
installed it you need to go and create a
field you're going to have a new field
type available to you and this is in my
album and that new field type is called
play up so you would add a new field I'm
going to go into my existing one and
select play up give it a label and short
name as usual scroll down this is where
you'll see this sort of the unique playa
stuff under the field options and here
we have the option to allow for multiple
selection using a shift click for
example or command click to show expired
or future entries so maybe we're not
talking about songs on an album but
maybe we're talking about events and you
are trying to maybe you know there's
events that are tied to a particular
artist or something like that and you
want to tie those but you don't want the
expired the previous titles to show up
only the future their future shows
another example well one thing that is
handy is your ability to further filter
the content that would show up in the
playa in a phase interface so here what
we can do is we can limit the entries
that are available by their channel
category author or status could also
does limit the number total overall and
then the last one doesn't really have to
do with limiting but then the order that
that list is outputted so let's go ahead
now so right before I should before move
on I only want tracks to show up so what
I'm building an album I don't care you
know about images or news items or
anything like that I only want the track
so that's what we're seeing here I'm
just only limiting my player results to
tracks so now let's go into an album
you know speed of life over here
though the site's not moving at the
speed of life that's for sure it's
dragging so I apologize for that so
scroll down here's my tracks field and
what we're seeing are all of the entries
that belong to the tracks channel and
that's what we're seeing on the left and
on the right we're seeing the ones that
I've already dragged over so let's just
do this so I'll drag one back and all
I'm doing is just dragging and dropping
alternatively what i could do is select
and then hit this arrow and it'll put to
the bottom and i can just drag this
around the order that you'll see here
the art is the order that items will be
output on the screen but that order can
be influenced through the tag pair so
it's not entirely necessary that you
have it this all in the correct order
but it will depend on what you're trying
to do the option that we saw on the
previous screen about the you know
multiple select or whatever it is you
can see what i'm doing here is I shift
held down shift and clicked two items
that were apart and now I can drag those
over and throw them on the bottom
but in the rhythm now that we have our
child entries assigned to the parent you
can hit save or submit and now it's time
to show you guys how to put this into a
template I'm go ahead and close that
take a look here album tracks was the
short name let us copy that close that
down and I've created a new template
which is just like my page template and
the only thing that's really to notice
here there's a lot of other stuff
happening but don't worry about that we
have a channel entries tagged and i'm
just going to output the title and this
is will say yes parent
so imma hit update and that was site
album and here we see the parent and
then the title but we don't see the
child entries yet that's where we are
going to do right now over to the
template again which is for some reason
not loading so I'll try to give this
refresh oh thank goodness coming up
alright yeah so alright so now what we
need to do is put in our tag pair oops
again this is just the field name that i
copied and pasted and now between this
tag pair what we can do we'll put child
and then the title of that child then
I'll close that I'm going to just wrap
the whole thing in ordered list and so
what this does is now we have available
within this pair we're going to have all
the children print it out and I'm
choosing to print just the title and in
this little tag but I could print
anything hear anything that's available
to you in the channels entries is
available to you within this playa tag
pair playa also has some other module
tags it will cover in another video so
we're only going to cover this but
what's great is you can
you know say that you're only interested
in open maybe you're only opening eight
inches an open or featured and it's a
good filter further by status you know
you could change the sort or the order
by or you know pretty much anything that
you can do up here so this is pretty
great so I'm gonna go ahead and just
save this I loaded fast now and oops we
put a typo somewhere but here we go
here's all so here's the parent and
here's the children and yeah there was
ten and here they all are but not great
so there you have this is your
introduction to play at the
relationships extension by pixel and
tonic and check back to level to level

publishing you know as many as we can if
you have any questions on playa or
expression engine or anything else you
