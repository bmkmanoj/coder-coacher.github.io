love tutorials now the last video we
created our contacts list at had
basically the styles we need that laid
the foundation for moving forward now
what we're going to do with this context
list is we're going to actually be using
we're going to be using a JavaScript
object and then we're going to be
looping over that data so we don't have
to repeat all of that HTML every single
time so let's get going on that right
now okay so in the last video we
basically just set up this template that
had a three list items in it and it was
essentially just pulling this data from
this HTML here and you can see when we
use this contact list element is just
outputting these names and faces like so
so let's go ahead and actually modify
this so instead of having to repeat
ourselves over and over again we can
actually be using data that comes from
JavaScript object in that way we can
iterate over it in our HTML so the first
thing we want to do is come down to our
JavaScript here and we had our
properties which we're not using and we
had this compute full name work sure
you're just gonna get rid of that stuff
and so we just have this polymer is now
the next property we're gonna have here
and our javascript object is a ready and
this is just going to be a function and
it's out of this function is going to be
our data so we can say this dot contact
okay so this contacts is equal to an
array now inside of this array we're
going to have JavaScript objects now
each of these objects is going to be a
name so for instance we had Scott comma
and there's going to be an email which
is going to be Scott at level up tuts
comm okay and then we're going to have a
comma and we're gonna have an image and
this image is simply just going to be
the image Pat that we are using up here
now I can just go ahead and grab that
like so
now I'm gonna go ahead and paste this in
here okay so we now have this javascript
object and it let's go ahead and add in
the rest of these so I'm just gonna do
like so hand complete this array of
contacts that we have gone here and we
had Tim and because I just used some
random numbers up there just go ahead
and make these sort of whatever numbers
I want and it's just gonna be working
fine because like I said these aren't
real images or anything okay so we don't
have this dot contacts which is an array
full of objects which have a name and
email and an image okay so what's next
is really we want to iterate over this
object in our HTML and how do we how do
we necessarily do that you might be used
to angular where we use an NG repeat
like PHP or something or we just loop
over it well well polymer actually has a
template tag that's going to do this for
us so I'm gonna go ahead and just delete
everything but one of these list items
and then inside of this unordered list
I'm going to have a new template tag
okay and I'm gonna put this list item
inside of here now we're going to have
on this template tag we're going to have
a dumb repeat so it's going to say is
equals and then inside of quotes dumb -
repeat now we can use the attribute
items to say items is equal to and then
in quotes double brackets like so we're
going to actually have the contacts so
it's just contacts referencing this dot
contacts right down here so this dark
contacts is being able to be used with
these double curly brackets as our items
now we haven't thrown any of the data
into here yet but
we should see when we come to this page
is the data that we had here this image
the name and the email you can see it's
just repeated three times because
there's three items in that array if we
were to add another item in that array
let's go ahead and head
Bobby E to the list we can say Bobby and
let's come out here and give this
another number like so you can see it's
just gonna reiterate for x so it's
looping over this now what we want to do
is go ahead and use the actual data from
this contacts list so inside of here
where we had this source we can get rid
of that and now we can use our double
curly brackets and we can use our data
so we can simply just say item dot image
okay
now let's verify this is in fact working
so we come here and refresh and you can
see all of them but one are working it
looks like I think maybe this 15 okay I
missed a period here okay so we're now
getting four different images we can
come back here so we now see that item
dot image is in fact working the way
this is working is that we have items as
equal to contacts and then it gets item
now item isn't specifically stated
anywhere we're not saying item in items
or anything this is just sort of how you
do it in this system so we can now say
item dot name and item dot email here
okay
so let's head back to our page refresh
and as you can see we now have all four
names all four emails everything's being
output now we can do anything we want to
that array and every single time it's
just going to use this list item as a
template and reiterate over it so to
recap we have context which is
referencing this context and that is
being set in items items
equal to contacts and we have this is
dumb - repeat which is letting the
template know that it needs to repeat
over this and then we can use item dot
to get the property out of each of these
objects here so item name item dot image
item dot email perfect okay so we now
have a repeating template over some data
and we have a contacts list that we can
drop in here and use over and over again
so in the next video we're gonna make
this even more modular we're gonna pull
out this list item contact and we're
gonna put it into its own element as a
single contact and then way you can it
reuse a single contact or a list of
contacts based on how you want to do
this so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments they've become in
the video area Sabet twitter or facebook
ad level up toriel's we'd love to hear
from you thanks for watching and we'll
see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
