of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
about setting up texts on your Magento
store and first before we get into this
I just wanted to point out uh we make
all these videos that level up tutsis
sort of on our spare time Ben and I we
really just do it just so the community
can have some good documentation some
good visual tutorials so um there's by
by all means there's no obligations but
if you feel like you've gotten a lot of
these tutorials and you you know you
want to give something back
we do have a donation button on our site
level of touch com
it's right here um one thing I should
point out is this site is not really
done at all in fact we've been spending
so much time on other stuff we haven't
put any time into the site so you know
you can go around the site but it's not
really worth it right now
so just we just have it up so you know
there's something so you know if you
want to donate feel free to click the
donate button and help out if not no big
deal we're not expecting it we're not
doing this for the donations or anything
and we're going to keep bringing as many
tutorials as we can possible without
donations
regardless ok so what I'm going to do
first is we're going to go to
configuration just like usual almost and
we're going to come down here and it's
right by you're shipping stuff it's text
and so you can set up different tax
classes and so tax for shipping is set
to none and this is something I think
you're going to have to just know if
you're if your company does tax on
shipping then you're going to want this
to be set up to be a certain tax class
but we just want this to be none okay
and calculation settings so this is
going to say your tax calculation method
is based on the total which is pretty
standard which is why it's all filled
out in fact a lot of the stuff that's
filled out you won't need to change
unless you have very specific in
particular tax situations for your
company you might not have to change a
whole lot here so total yeah text
calculation method is based on the total
text calculation is based on the
shipping address you could also have it
be the billing address but like I said
shipping addresses by default and you
should know how your company is planning
on taxing who's purchasing
you could say by the billing address if
you wanted to but you know shipping
addresses is fine for this for this
purpose and so catalog prices are going
to be excluding price so if you check
including price that means all of your
catalog prices that you've entered by
the admin already include text so it's
going to do that calculation for you to
do it a little bit easier I think it's
easier to just have your products be
without text and let magenta will
calculate the text for you you know
that's just a personal thing and notice
it's by default so it's probably what
most people are going to want and so
this is whether the shipping amounts
entered by admin or tan from gateway
include tax so like we said we have no
text class for shipping anyway so we're
just saying excluding text no big deal
like I said before the other one before
it's default for a reason apply text
apply customer text so this is if you
want to have before discounters after
discount it's pretty standard to do
before let's say they have a coupon or
something it's going in and that that
the coupon is taking the value up before
the tax is added up which I would assume
is how most people coming to your site
would expect it to work
apply discount on prices excluding text
so this is just saying if the discounted
price is including text is calculated
based on the store text I mean like I
said if you have this selected then
didn't worry about it
applied tax on custom price of available
original price only you know if you have
the product marks down and markdown is
like a custom price you're going to want
the text on that so I would leave this
as custom price but the great thing is
is Magento gives you the options to
change anything any of these things if
you you know feel so if you feel the
need to or if that's how your company
works so your default tax a destination
calculation so if you are um let's say
your company based out of Michigan
that's where I'm based out of if you
want to only text people who are buying
things and shipping it to Michigan sales
text because that's all you're you know
that's all you have to tax then the
origin state is going to be Michigan and
the default postal code
is this asterisk which is just a wild
card you can I mean this just means
Michigan you can have this be a zip code
or postal code if you want but I'm going
to leave it as the wild card okay price
display settings this is if you want
your prices to physically show with the
text on your site so if you're visiting
the site you know you have the tech the
price value that will be including text
it's a little bit different from this if
you're entering taxes if you're entering
your price with the tax this is just how
its displaying so we want this to be
excluding text because like most stores
you know I think that's what your
customers would expect to see and then
okay so shopping cart display settings
so display prices excluding text
displays subtotal excluding text display
shipping amount excluding tags in this
way it will separate it out and then it
will have so you can include tax and
grand total actually when I have this vs
like I said these things are all sort of
personal preference it's how your store
is working I would like the text
included in the grand total so that
people can see what the final amount is
before they hit go and that's including
text so if you want them to have a full
text summary yeah this will show the
text for shipping the text for you know
the goods everything and display a zero
text subtotal no I don't think you need
to do that so one more thing we have
orders invoices credit memos we want
them I would probably have this to be
the same thing we want them to see the
tax summer you want them to see the text
the final price and the grand total but
like I said you can configure it
differently in fixed product texts fixed
product test involves a little bit more
configuration if you would include this
or enable this it's basically a way to
say that this particular type of product
is always going to have a fixed text so
if your region has a fixed product text
for a certain type of product you can
look into setting this up basically if
you turn this on you're going to have to
add an attribute there's a little bit
more of a process for it which we'll
probably get into in a later tutorial if
there's the need for it it's a pretty
particular case if you want fixed
product text
I think that's a little bit outside of
this tutorial itself but we'll go over
that at a later date so this is really
the basics to setup text and after you
have everything filled in here your
default state and everything your text
should be completely configured so now
that we have that all configured let's
go to our sales tax and we're going to
set up our tax zones so we're going to
go to tags owns and rates and this is
who your taxing looks like by default
they have the tax rate for New York and
California in here I'm going to add a
new one and this is going to be from
Michigan so I'm just gonna have a my
state Michigan zip post is in range no
we just have an asterisk here this
saying any zip code and the percent here
is 6% so we're just going to use ticks
even like that and you know we don't
need to have any different titles here
so we're just going to have this be
empty so now we have just Michigan you
can get more specific with it here but
and you can set up as many as you want
that this is just Michigan so next we're
going to change our text rules and that
you have different products be set to
different things I'm going to because
this is default
I'll set default to Michigan and I'm
going to set uh just this one to
Michigan as well this taxable goods
because if we go to our products manage
products they're going to be set to
different things so let's click here and
if you're doing this all from yourself
you know from the start without this
additional info brought in then you
won't really have to worry about this
but um so this one it has so this test
album that we made before it has no text
class um so but if you notice here
there's default taxable goods and
shipping well we just edited taxable
goods for Michigan right so let's save
this and now this is going to have the
Michigan rate that we just said we just
had we can go edit something else too
let's say let's add something that we
can buy it later
so this HTC diamond touch Dimond it has
a tax class of taxable goods so we
should be all set to buy that to try it
out
and also under sales text you'll notice
you can import export tax rates customer
tax classes product tax classes really
the only things you'll need to set it up
is really just right in here if you want
to import a rate I would recommend
exporting first if you export this CSV
you can edit modify it and then
re-upload it with the values that you
need and what that's going to do is it's
going to create all this stuff in here
so you don't have to do it through
Magento's interface it's a nice way in
fact we'll be doing a lot more importing
and exporting later when we get into
importing and exporting products so also
under a text there's customer tech plus
retail customer if you're doing like
wholesale and have different tax rights
or something
everybody's going to re retail on this
site so we're not going to modify that
another product tax classes you saw this
before we have default shipping taxable
goods these are our actual tax classes
themselves and just there's no editing
in here that you really have to do okay
so it looks like it's telling me that I
have to flush my cash so I'm going to
click and do that really quick and then
we're going to add that HTC diamond
touch to our cart and we're going to see
that it has tax applied so I'm going to
add this HTC to my cart and I'm going to
put it up it actually already has my
information here so estimate shipping
cost you can get a quote and since I
haven't selected to show the text if you
notice here it has text is $45 on this
if you click to expand it shows the deep
the like the information so Michigan 6%
so now if we proceed to checkout at blah
blah blah it's going to have all that
information but luckily it gives the
customer a little breakdown so they know
exactly what they're paying and why
they're paying it ok so that is the tax
section under configuration in Magento
if you have any questions or comments
it's up at you know in the comments or
Twitter I level up tuts you can hit me
up at Twitter @s to Lenski if you want
you know just say stuff that you're
interested in seeing you know some
people send us out tweet saying they
want to see this or that and we read
everything we take it into account and
even though we have lots of tutorials we
want to get
done it does go on the list and so we
want to teach you what you want to learn
and what you want to see okay so as
always this is Scott and thanks for
