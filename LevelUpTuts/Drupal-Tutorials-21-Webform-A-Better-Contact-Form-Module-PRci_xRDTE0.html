of Tut's and in the last tutorial I
showed you how to create a contact form
using Drupal's built-in contact module
in this tutorial I'm going to show you
how to use a different module called
webform that's a community module that
is a much more robust contact system
that allows you to create multiple
contact forms and create your own fields
within them so to undo what we did last
time I simply went to modules and
unchecked the contact module and then
click Save now I'm going to go to Drupal
org and I'm going to search for webform
it's the name of the module so webform
is the first one and as you can see
there is a version for Drupal 7 we'll
click the zip and opening up my finder
install it just by dragging it into our
modules folder as usual now we're going
to come up to our site and click modules
and then down down down we're going to
be seeing webform
here's webform at the very bottom and
we'll click Save so where contact form
created a contact form for your site
webform is a little bit different web
form is more like creating a content
type it allows you to create your own
custom fields and configure it
specifically per contact form so as you
can see in the configuration options
there's a lot here but this is not
necessarily where we're going to be
going over most of our are setting up
our contact form like we did in the last
one in this case if we go to contour if
we go to add content and then we're
going to select webform we're going to
create a new webform just like we would
create a project page or article and
we're just going to call this contact
and you can have body text here contact
me and we'll click actually let's
provide a menu link and put this in the
main menu
I'll give the way to four so it's at the
bottom
and I don't want comments on this
contact form okay and we'll click Save
okay so now it's going to ask us what
form components we want and the last one
that just sort of assumed that we'd want
somebody's name and you know what they
were contacting about and then a body
text well this you can add as many as
we'd like and you can have them set to
anything you can see you can have it
sent to a time a text field a text area
all sorts of stuff so we're going to say
text field and this is going to be just
their name and we want this to be
mandatory we're going to click Add okay
and it gives you even more options if we
can give it a default value we can give
it a description we can make sure that
all they enter all the enter values are
must be unique we give it a max length
we can give it a width but of course I
want to do all the stuff in CSS we can
tell it where the label goes above
inline or none I'm going to say inline
and you can have it disabled or you can
have it private so we're going to take a
look save component and then the next
one we just want to know we want to know
where they work so we want to say
employer okay and this is going to be a
text field again we'll click Add this
one won't be mandatory because I don't
feel like people need to know okay let's
actually even I have labeled the in line
again I want to keep that sort of same
safe component we're going to do one
last one we're going to have this be a
text area actually let's do something
different because the other one added
text area so let's have select options
and we're going to stay let's make this
be oh why why are you contacting me and
it's going to be mandatory of course you
know you can add any of these as many as
you want these are just sort of examples
that we're doing here
okay so if either can check multiples
would sure that sounds good to me
and then here you can do like pairs
where it's your key and then a readable
option so we're going to have projects
and then the pipe and then projects okay
higher and that's going to display as
higher me okay great so that's fine for
these two we're going to make it
mandatory we want it to be let's see so
it if we want it to be a list box
instead of radio buttons or checkboxes
I'm going to leave it as check boxes
because that's nice and easy display
actually for this one we'll have it be
above and just click Save as you can see
you can usually even drive drag these
around just like you could other fields
you can clone them if you have a whole
bunch of the same so you can just edit
them later we're just going to leave it
at this for now and click Save let's
what I I'm sorry I might've done that
too quickly next we're just going to
click over to this emails tab right here
and this is going to say who it's going
to go to so let's just to my email
address
okay and we're going to add this okay
and you could actually have this
component y-you can have that be who is
sending to so there's all sorts of
options this this contact form module
webform is really configurable so in
here we can change the header details so
here we want the header to just say
custom my site contact form so this is
what the email subject that you receive
is going to be the default from address
is going to be my own address and
usually what I would do is fill out a a
format item that is their email and make
it mandatory and then you can set that
component to be emailed but we didn't do
that for this one so that's fine email
from name we're going to set to name and
then here's your template if you notice
there's token values in here so it says
submitted on date submitted by a user
name submitted values our email values
and Submission URL so if we click this
token values you can see what all of
these things mean and you can use all
sorts of them you could throw in their
IP address there any of the stuff in
what this with this email values is is
this is all of the values from the
contact form if we click this included
email values it's going to say you can
select which ones you want to include if
you want to check these they won't be in
the email and they will not be included
under this email values we're just going
to click this save email settings
because that's all we need to setup now
if you want the form to go to different
people then you can add more people here
and then change the options per person
now we're going to click form settings
and now you can see a confirmation
message this is going to be displayed or
you can have them send to a custom URL
I'm just going to say thanks for filling
of the forum period of course I might
want to write a little bit nicer
message or create my own separate page
for this but for now just for
demonstration purposes that's fine
again we again we can use token values
you can have total submission limits per
user submission limits status of this
form I mean all this stuff is really
robust comparison to thee you've created
your contact form here it is so if you
need more robust options webform is
definitely the way to go however if you
need a simple contact form this takes a
lot more time to setup and you might not
need to go through all this advanced
settings you can have this contact form
available as a block in case you want to
put this on a page maybe throw it in
your footer or something you can you can
do all sorts of stuff so let's just
click Save okay our contact form has
been created let's just click view as
you can see here it is
you name your employer projects hire me
I can select multiple multiples of these
and if I were to have this on my server
and then click Submit it would send that
email that we configured for it to send
if you'll notice I also edit it to the
menu this time the main navigation and
the URL is just a contact ok well that's
how to set up a contact form using
webform a Drupal module that makes
contact forms more robust if you have
any questions or comments please feel
