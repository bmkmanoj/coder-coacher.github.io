love-love tuts and today we're gonna
show you how to modify the menu in bolt
and so you may have created your first
page and you would think your page is
worthy of being in the menu and I agree
so we're gonna want to modify this menu
well I think it's a good time to start
checking out what the template system in
bolt is like so for simplicity sake
let's go to the main page and I've
thrown my entire bolt project into
sublime text 2 right here and you can
see here's all our folders and so if we
go to theme and then base 2013 because
base 2013 is the theme that we're using
let's check out the index dot twig file
and so if you haven't popped through
these twig files already there's one
thing you might notice is that it's not
using really PHP anywhere in here I
think this is a templating language and
it's an it so it's easier to really get
around it and make what you want happen
if you've ever used anything like
expression engine you know that uses
CodeIgniter or something like that then
you'll be very familiar with a
templating language like this or if
you've done anything and you know really
any other web framework or something so
this might look familiar to you and it
might not but that's okay because well
go over in more detail the only thing we
have to know is that we're looking for
the menu and so it's the very top thing
at the top of the page and this is the
index so right here it's showing that we
have main blog content well that's too
low here's the sidebar okay well up here
we have an include header so this
include header is using this partial
header and we're going to go to this
header dot twig and if you notice it's
underscore header dot twig
so this is the header itself we have our
script tags or CSS all the stuff you'd
normally find in a header the reason why
this is in a separate file is because
it's not going to change between pages
and your site so why make it more than
once just have it as a header and you
can include in all sorts of pages well
again we'll go over the templating logic
and stuff like that in more detail in
future tutorials
we're talking about modifying your
creating our own theme from scratch so
let's go in here and we're looking and
we find top bar and then we just find
this menu code so here it says include
the menu as defined in config slash menu
dot yml so this is a gamma file that is
for the menu and that's how you edit the
menu itself know that this theme comes
with its own sub menu twig file and it
says if this wasn't themed including the
current theme the default menu that is
going to be the one that's being used so
let's check out that menu sub menu twig
and here we have an if sub menu is
defined then make it a drop-down go
through and loop and grab it otherwise
just display each item in the menu so
you won't have to touch this really
unless you want to change how it outputs
the drop-down maybe change the classes
or something we're not gonna have to
change this to change the menu
so let's come back and on our file
structure here let's click app config
and then we have these four files here
and the one we want is menu dot yml and
if you'll notice this this is going to
follow very closely to exactly our
site's menu notice how we have a label
home and the title is this is our first
menu item fo-shizzle
and its path is the home page so the
home page is a path that's always going
to exist in the site it's just the
shorthand for the home page and it has a
class of first so if you'll notice this
first one it has a hyphen here and then
it has the information about the link
and so we come across this - again with
a new path to entry number one
and so it's grabbing the first entry and
the label is going to be a second item
and then we have a submenu which is
going to make this a drop-down
automatically and we see that - as well
and we have a label sub one with a path
of entry - labeled - with a path of
entry 3 and it has this clasp on it so
you begin to see a bit of a pattern so
we have our label all pages is going to
path pages our label bolt sight is going
to this outside link oops okay well
let's say we wanted to add our page that
we just created in the last video and
let's come back and it was our first
real page and this is page number 6 we
know that because when we created it in
the both admin it says number 6 right
here let's refresh this you have page
number 6 so we know that's how we can
access it is by slash 6 page / 6 so
let's go to that path itself and you can
see it takes us to the same spot what
happens if we go to these you can see it
actually pulls in the right name for us
so to prove that it works let's go to
our menu and we're going to add a new
path here we're gonna put in the - and
make sure the spacing is the same as
this file has it because that is how
this file make sure it works correctly
so we're going to have the label be our
first page and this can be whatever you
want really and okay
feels like it needs to correct it for me
whatever and in the space here I'm going
to tab over and we're gonna type path
make sure this is in correctly in line
okay that's where it should be and this
is going to be page / 6 hit let's say
this and now let's go to our page its
refresh we now this menu item our first
page and not only that it links to the
correct page but it also fills out the
browser or the
SEO friendly URL here that we got cool
so this is modifying the U of the menu
here and let's say we didn't want this
drop down together at all
check this out you can just grab from
here right out down to here delete all
that stuff
save it come back it's gone and you'll
notice as you can get in an active state
perfect it does so much for us it makes
it really nice and easy but at the same
time it gives us complete control when
you need it so this is how you modify
the menu with bolt if you have any
questions leave a come in the video or
hear something Twitter level up tuts
we're also on facebook with level up
tuts you know leave a comment whatever
and as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
