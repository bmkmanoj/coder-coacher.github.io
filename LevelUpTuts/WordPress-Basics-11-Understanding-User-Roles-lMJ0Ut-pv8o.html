up tuts and today we're gonna be talking
about user roles and illustrate this I'm
gonna take this user that we created in
the last lesson we made them an editor
and I'm gonna explain a little about
what about they're able to do with
different roles and what they're not so
because we had them we had to have an
administrator you've seen one of the
administrators capable of doing if we
were to bump up Scott to be an
administrator his admin section of the
site would look the exact same accepted
me whatever color he decided to have it
however as an editor and editor is
really just somebody who can publish
post and manage articles and pages right
so they're not going to be some of you
is necessarily administrating the site
so that becomes immediately obvious when
you see that they don't have any of the
other settings here like they can't
modify plugins they can't change the
appearance tools and settings they have
some tools here but it's it's really
nothing and they don't they don't have
any settings profile of course is just
their profile and you notice if you
scroll down somewhere they can't modify
their role however an administrator
could modify their role for them so if
somebody maybe is a an author which is
another role and they need to become an
editor you would have to get an
administrator to make that decision that
way you don't have anybody who doesn't
have proper access coming in and
destroying your site now you'll see what
they can access they can look at all the
posts if they wanted to they can come in
here and edit a post just like that and
they can edit pages if we look at posts
again they can even delete them so this
person has complete reign over the
content of your site but not the
configuration of strip or structure so
let's check out another role I'm gonna
turn in edit Scott so by clicking edit
this is my account the orange one keep
in mind is logged in as an administrator
and then I can then
changed the role and I'm gonna make them
an author which is the next down the
line now if I update this user and tap
back to Scott and refresh you'll notice
they have significantly different
options when you hover over you no
longer have the option to edit or delete
because Scott didn't create this post
the admin was the author and therefore
Scott has no way of controlling this all
they can do is see it they also cannot
create new pages really what an author
can do is create new posts and edit
their own posts so not there is really a
lower level somebody who's just going to
be adding blog posts so we can say
author post number one and you'll notice
that after I published this like some we
can view this and this is going to be
viewable however when we come back here
you'll see that we'll be able to edit it
or delete it only because we created it
and not anyone elses
notice how we even have this selector up
here that says mine and it's only
showing my posts if I click all it's
gonna show you all and notice how this
one's gray you clearly can't do anything
with it so next down the line this is
back to the administrator I'm going to
change Scott's role once more and I'm
going to make them a contributor which
is the next level and if you've gotten
the pattern here you'll notice these
people basically are getting less and
less and less features available to them
so now if we come back here now what
Scott can do is he can write and manage
his own posts but he cannot publish them
so if I add a new post test author post
right and
I come in here and I submit for review
who knows how this button no longer says
publish so if I come here and submit
this for review it's not going to be
available on the front of the website
and we can confirm that by coming back
to the front of the website and I
refresh we see author post one we see
second post
but we don't see test off their post
however the administrator can come in or
the editor can come in look at all of
the posts and see this one that's
pending right so now they can click edit
and go to takeover and publish this
thing cool so this is what a contributor
does notice how they can also look at
comments here too they just really have
access to the stuff that's theirs but
they don't they don't really have any
administrative rights over it at least
the author can delete their own posts
okay now we have the last rural setting
and I'm gonna go to users again and it's
got once more and I'm going to
completely demote him to a subscriber
now if we update the user and then we
come back to Scott you'll see they don't
have permissions to edit this edit page
just goes just WP - admin and all they
have access to do is change their
profile so and a subscriber is pretty
much just a user on your site and
somebody that could have a profile on
your site but not something that's going
to be editing or working with any of
your content or the management of your
site so these are the user roles there's
also an additional role called a super
administrator but the super admin
doesn't really come into play unless
you're using what's called a multi-site
now it's not really worth explaining
that right now because for all intents
purposes right now the super admin is
the same thing as the
admin on a single site so no need to
worry about that we'll talk about that
more once we get in to multi sites so as
always this is Scott would love love
tuts if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment on the video
Twitter Facebook we're at level up Tut's
everywhere we have a level of touch
forum that you could post in so thanks
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
