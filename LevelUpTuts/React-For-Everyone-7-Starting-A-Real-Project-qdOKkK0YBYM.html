and in this video I'm gonna be creating
a new react project from start now this
project is going to be sort of a more
real-world example to be using webpack
we're gonna be using react and babel
just like we were
however everything's gonna be loaded
locally through node modules instead of
importing javascript files that are
being loaded from a CDN so let's get
started by creating our project adding
our node packages and installing them
okay so now we're actually going to
start our project and to do this we're
gonna start from scratch now we're going
to be using a really basic web Peck
config and a dev server and this isn't
going to be anything we need to know a
ton about in fact I'm going to tell you
sort of what we're doing as we're doing
it and this isn't going to be a full-on
web pack the toriel series or anything
like that
this is just going to be a really basic
example so let's go ahead and start off
by creating a project I'm simply just
going to head to where I keep my sites
and I'm just gonna make a new folder now
this new folder is just going to be
called react
- or - everyone okay you can name this
whatever you'd like for your particular
project and I'm just gonna drop this in
to sublime text here just so we have
this project as a folder open even
though we have nothing going on in here
yet
let's go ahead and just create a really
basic index.html file we're gonna say
index.html
and in here we're just going to
basically need our sort of standard HTML
we need a doctype
like sublime sort of auto-completed that
for me we have an HTML egg we have our
head tag and some weird indenting here
that's all right I'll fix it up now the
title can just simply be whatever you'd
like we're just gonna have this be
react or everyone okay so now that we
have that let's just go ahead and add a
blank div now this div is going to be
where our react app is going to be
rendered inside of so you don't have to
worry too much we can just give this an
ID we could just give this an idea
something like app and so our entire
application is going to be rendered with
inside of this div of course we're going
to have to tell react to render it
within that div now in addition we also
want to load a script now this script
does not exist yet so let's just go
ahead and add a script tag at the end of
the body here and we don't need to say
type JavaScript because that is the
older HTML syntax we can just say SRC
for the source and in quotes we're just
going to want to go ahead and have this
be app
fj s now we can save this well like I
said app dot J s doesn't exist so don't
try loading this in your browser you're
going to get an error saying that that's
not going to work next we need to add
our node packages we need to basically
get this set up as a node project so you
can head off your terminal make sure I'm
in the right project let's change
directories into react
or everyone okay now we're gonna want to
run npm in it now this assumes that you
have no js' installed on your computer
already if you don't take the time
install it note that we're gonna need
that but I assume since you've gotten
this far you do already so we have npm
in it
we can just
really breezed through this just hitting
and turf we would like is this okay yes
even though I didn't have to type yes
there okay so we have our NPM we want to
go ahead and install some packages now
let's actually just head back to sublime
I'm going to edit the package.json file
manually here
and down beneath license
and have a comma and inside of here
we're just going to have dev
dependencies like so colon and then an
object now instead of our dev
dependencies we need a couple of things
let's just first go ahead and grip
babble - core
um miss the - their babble - core and
the version for that we're going to use
the up caret arrow thing and we're gonna
say five point eight point anything so
anything that's at least five point
eight here I'll have a comma now I'm
just gonna paste this in here a couple
more times - so I have this basic format
here now we need other than babble core
in addition to that we need babble -
loader and we want web pack and we'll
want web pack dev server as well now
I'll go through the versions for these
in just a second obviously we don't need
the same version of all of these
so it's webpack - dev - server is gonna
be a really basic dev server for us okay
so we need babel loader we're gonna want
version at least five three and four web
packets at least one point twelve and
then web pack dev server we're going to
need version one point ten so we can
just say up one point ten
okay so five point eight five point
three one point twelve and one point ten
now we want to go on to our actual
normal dependencies which will be react
so the dev dependencies are just what we
need for development and stuff that's
not going to be in production here and
our dependencies we have dev
dependencies needs to become just simply
dependencies I'll copy and paste a lot
just because it's easier for me it's
less likely that you're going to be
making mistakes
and we're just going to want react now
later on in this project we're going to
be adding things like react router and
we'll have to add to this dependencies
we can just simply do that with an NPM
install command anyways boolean just say
react and the version that we're going
to be looking for here is zero thirteen
asterisk okay so you're a congested look
very similar to this or exactly like
this let's go ahead and run NPM install
make sure there's no errors here and it
looks like I have an error line 16 I had
a comma here on line 15 when it was the
last item if an object you may have
noticed that now let's go npm install
once more I can type NPM install and
it's gonna go ahead and grab our
packages okay so everything should be in
there if we just simply have to sublime
text we can open up the node and modules
folder and just make sure the stuff that
we need is all in here babel and all
that good stuff okay so now that we have
our packages all installed and ready
we're now ready to start our web pack
configuration now like I said this next
video is not going to be an in-depth
video on web pack but I will explain
what we're doing for each step so you
can follow along and we're going to get
started by the end of next video we're
going to have our dev server up and
going and then we're going to be able to
start working on our application so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video hurt
me up at twitter or facebook at level up
tutorials I love to hear from you thanks
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
