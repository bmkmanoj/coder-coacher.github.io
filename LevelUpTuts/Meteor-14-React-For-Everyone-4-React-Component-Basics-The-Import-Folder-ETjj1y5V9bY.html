up tutorials and in this video we're
going to talk a little bit about the
imports folder which is new to meteor
1.3 and we're going to be talking about
how that relates to react while in fact
building our first react component in
discussing a bit about react so let's
get started right now okay so here we
have our Hello component absolutely
nothing going on special here now let's
go ahead and actually talk about the
import folder before we've only worked
with this client and server folder where
everything automatically gets imported
like I mentioned briefly anything in
this client folder doesn't necessarily
need these import statements but we want
them right we want this this sort of
style where we import something it keeps
all our code organized it lets us know
exactly what we're using all the time
and it could seem a little verbose but
it's definitely worth it let's go ahead
and now let's create a new folder new
folder at the root that's just called
imports now instead of imports we're
going to create two new folders this is
going to be one that is client and one
that is server now this can be a little
bit confusing here because we already
have a client and server folder however
basically these import client and server
folders the difference here is that one
these do not automatically get imported
if we do anything within these folders
we have to explicitly import it into a
file that is automatically compiled like
this main j/s and the reason we still
separate them out a new client and
server is because if we didn't we would
still have to wrap our code if it was
client-side code and a meteor is client
statement rather than a meteor is server
or anything like that to specify whether
it's client or server side however just
like with the auto compiled folders
client and server if we named a client
folder and a server folder inside of our
imports meteor knows that the code
inside of this folder is going to be
client-side code now let's go ahead and
hand
create a new file and this new file will
simply just be app dot J s now I am
capitalizing the app in here because
typically what I do is a code style is I
name the file after the react component
itself and the react components the
standard is essentially to have them be
just uppercase like this
so app starts with a capital A okay just
some explanation there now let's go
ahead and cut out app here I'm just
gonna cut it out completely and I'm
gonna paste it into here now let's go
ahead and let's just say save some of
this stuff you'll notice immediately
you're gonna get an app is not defined
okay so how do we make app defined well
first thing we have to do is export app
because app Dodge is is not
automatically exported we have to say
export now we're going to say default
export default class app extends
component you're going to be seeing this
a lot so export default means that when
we import it we don't need to use these
brackets and we can say let's go ahead
and import app notice how there's no
brackets from and then the path to that
particular file
so the path to that file is going to be
relative from where we are currently
we're gonna back out of the client
folder by doing dot dot then we're going
to go into the imports folder then we're
going to go into the client folder and
then we're going to grab app notice how
I don't have to say app dot J s here I
can just say app it assumes that it's
dot J S or JSX you can see that we have
import app from imports client app ok so
apps should be imported we should be no
longer giving app is not defined but now
you'll notice that we're getting an
error that says component is not to find
an app dot J s line one
okay what we want to do is we want to go
ahead and grab this react component
import statement that we have at the top
line and start off our file with that
basically any react component that you
ever make is going to need to import
react , component from react this is how
pretty much everything I have ever looks
okay so let's save this and now you can
see our hello is back instantly super
cool let's go ahead and actually head
back to atom and if we were to remove
the default from our export statement
just to show you a little bit you can
see there's now some issues here and
what we would want to do inside of our
main is you could wrap this in a bracket
because this is no longer the default
it's just being exported and you'll
notice everything works again the reason
why you might do this is if you have
more than one export per file it's
unlikely that we're going to have stuff
like that in this series but it's good
to know sort of why you see things often
I see brackets or whatever and people
don't necessarily like to take the time
to explain why they're using them or not
okay so we now have something inside of
our imports folder it's being imported
into main jas and this is auto compiling
right so the process goes our our app
starts up it looks at main Dodge is it
imports this stuff it finds app from our
imports folder and then it renders app
into our render target nice and easy
right
super easy now let's go ahead and
actually do something a little bit more
interesting within this this app
component right because right now it
just says hello let's talk a little bit
about react now react you can have
things like components state where you
can modify essentially a variable that
gets updated and saved within the
component as its State you can have all
sorts of events you can work with stuff
and it's really just JavaScript remember
that so if we were to do something like
let which is a different version of
are essentially that changes the scoping
but I pretty much use let for everything
unless it's a constant variable so we
can say let Hello is going to be equal
to and this is just going to be a string
that's just going to be my name hello
Scott now inside of our h1 here we can
actually use this variable anytime you
want to use JavaScript within your
render return you can do so with these
just curly brackets so we can say hello
like this and this is just going to
simply reference this variable and it's
gonna output this string it's absolutely
nothing crazy it's just JavaScript and
you can see it now says hello Scott and
that's one of these things I love about
react is that it gets you better a
JavaScript right because everything is
really just JavaScript it gets you
better at the basic principles of
JavaScript okay so now we can say hello
Scott and because we're using JSX we can
output this in an h1 okay so let's go
ahead and let's keep that hello Scott
but let's go ahead and add something
like a click function right so inside of
our h1 we want to say when you click on
the h1 let's just Council log something
so we can say on click is going to be
equal to and then inside of this is just
brackets so you're to be seeing
properties like this a lot within JSX
where we have everything camelcase and
it sort of looks just like a standard
HTML data property or anything like that
but we can say on click and then we want
to run a function we can just say this
function will be named heading click to
access this function where well you
could do this a couple of ways let's go
ahead and up above our function here
above our class we can say let heading
click equal to a new function that just
is going to account
oh that log hello okay just like that
and now inside of this unclick here we
can simply just say what we want to do
is heading click ok so on click use this
heading click function that's going to
hit this function and just counts a log
hello see this in action with my council
open I'm gonna bump up the size here so
you can see how exciting this is okay so
a council logged hello easy stuff but
let's say we want this heading click
function we want this to be scoped in to
this component right what we could do is
actually above the render function we
can add the heading click function just
like this heading click parentheses and
just like that we now have our heading
click function as scoped inside of this
component so let's remove this class
let's delete this one actually you know
what I'm going to I'm just gonna comment
this out so I can keep this in the code
that we had and let's go ahead and paste
in heading click hello now one thing
you're gonna notice is heading click is
not defined but heading click is defined
right well not really because we're
calling heading click in sort of a
global sense we want to call this in in
terms of the component which we can
access with this this dot heading click
so now this heading click is inside of
this component no more error and when we
click our heading we do get our hello
okay so this is some JSX or some react
basics here right we have a basic on
click function and it's really just
outputting a console log ok super cool
this is nothing groundbreaking this is
nothing but it should get you used to
the sort of feeling of working within a
component inside of our component you're
going to have functions that you can
access and soon we're going to talk
about state as well so in the
next video we're going to be talking
about the internal react component state
and after we get through some of this
basic react stuff we're going to head
into meteor stuff where we can actually
start saving things to the database so
check it out as we get going further and
further with our application as always
