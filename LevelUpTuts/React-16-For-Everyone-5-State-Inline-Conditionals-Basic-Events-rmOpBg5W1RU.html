up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be covering some basic
foundational things for react we're
going to be covering state we're gonna
be covering a basic event and we're
going to be covering basic conditionals
in JSX
all of which are things are going to be
using constantly and react so let's get
started right now okay so in this video
we're gonna be talking about state
within react components and state can be
used in a whole lot of ways sometimes
it's keeping track of the value of an
input other times it's toggling things
maybe you're opening a navigation or
something like that maybe it's turning
something on or off but at the end of
the day state is really super useful
because it allows you to have dynamic
components within your react components
without having to pass along props and
have props be the cause of that dynamic
functionality basically anytime you're
doing something like toggling something
you might want to be looking towards
state to make that happen
now obviously there are different sort
of situations where you might not want
to use state in fact some people have
gone a little bit overboard and they've
decided to stop using State entirely
however I cannot recommend to do that
and I definitely think that state has
its place within your react components
is a very very useful part of react so
let's talk about how we can start to use
state now we're gonna do this in a bit
modern way here so if you do not see
some examples like this don't worry this
is a nice new way of doing state you may
have seen a state being an initial state
that is being set within your
constructor and here we're not going to
do that
so this video is going to be talking
about a lot of interesting things and
it's going to be a little bit more
exciting than the past few videos so
what we want to do is well we want to
toggle something on or off whether or
not we're pushing a button that seems
like a fair way to use state right so
let's head up to our app component or
it's app extent and I'm going to go
ahead and first have some text here
instead of a
graph tag and I'm going to simply just
say this should show and hide okay and
next just below it I'm going to have a
button and this button it'll be Lachelle
slash hide now we'll get over a little
bit of why we're doing it this way in a
minute but at this point on our page we
should basically just see this show/hide
button let me bump up the zoom level of
this so we can see this a little bit
more clearly
okay show/hide look at that nothing's
doing anything just yet now we want to
go ahead and have a state on this
component so to set the initial value
for State we're going to go ahead and
say just above our render method we're
going to just say state state is equal
to an object and this is going to set
the initial State on the creation of our
component like I said you may have seen
this being set in a constructor and that
certainly works however this is a newer
way of doing it that's only going to
work with the correct latest syntax and
latest Babel configurations now if those
words don't mean anything to you don't
worry about that just yet okay so what
we have here is state is equal to and
I'm simply just going to have the state
variable named toggle okay now this is
not a great name because it's pretty
generic but this is going to be generic
functionality so we don't need something
very specific
so the toggle the default state of
toggle will be true because let's say we
want this to be visible by default okay
now keep in mind a state can have well
not just a boolean values it can be
strings it can be anything right so
setting our toggle here to true doesn't
mean you always have to use a boolean
value true false that is so check this
out we have our default state set to
toggle to true and what that gives us in
a side of our component is access to
this dot state and then that is only
within this component that means that if
we were to head to welcome
start typing this dad state we don't
have access to this that state that
toggle because that refers to the
component above that doesn't mean that
we can't use the start state that toggle
within welcome in fact we can I will
show you that in a minute here but what
we want to do is head back up here to
our app component and see how we can use
this so we want this to be a show and
hidden by default right this should show
hide and we wanted to show hide based on
the value of toggle so we can access the
value of toggle let me put some brackets
here and say this that state that toggle
like this okay now this will be a
boolean I'm not sure if this will output
as a string and in fact it looks like
it's not because it's a boolean both one
thing we learn about here and react is
how we can do in-line conditional
statements so if else whatever and you
don't have access to the words if and
stuff like that inside of here in any
sort of way that you're used to so if
you come from angular land or I think I
don't know view does it this way but
angular you would have you know ng if or
whatever and react you don't really have
that sort of stuff but what we do have
is the ability to have inline
conditionals just by simply using a
little trick and this little trick is
ampersand ampersand like this and you
may know this double ampersand from
conditional statements if you're saying
if this and this right and the way this
works is that it checks to see if this
value is true says if this state toggle
is true and and then it hits the next
thing because it is true and the next
thing will be something like this should
show and hide like this okay notice how
I have a curly bracket curly bracket
this dot state toggle ampersand
ampersand and then our paragraph so this
works right now it's going to actually
show it because what it's doing is it's
saying if this is true which it is and
this it will output this okay so it
seems a little weird
it's not totally it's it's correct
JavaScript right but it's not the way
you normally do things but this is how
we do inline conditionals within react
now we want to talk about this show/hide
button because we want to be able to
change our state that's part of the
appeal of using state is that we have it
here and we can change it and our
component will trigger a rerender and
our component will render once more we
mentioned about wind components render
it's something that we're going to have
to learn a bit about but what we want to
do on our button is add an event Z I
mentioned we're going to be learning a
lot of important stuff in this video so
so far we've learned inland conditionals
we've learned settings state default
state and now we're going to learn about
events so this button has an on click
event available now as opposed to a
normal unclick event we have on and then
click is in camelcase
okay now we're going to have an equal
sign and then brackets now in here we're
going to want to run a method of this
particular component okay so this is
where things get a little bit
interesting because this syntax is
pretty new here so you may not see a ton
of examples about it and you may see
sometimes people using some different
syntaxes which I'll go over but what we
want to do is call a method which will
just be this dot toggle okay and this
dot toggle is going to be defined within
our component here in a minute but
notice how I'm not using parentheses at
the end of this that toggle I'll explain
why in a minute
so let's head up top here and just below
state we can define this toggle just
simply by saying toggle and toggle is
going to be equal to and get this it's
going to be equal to an arrow function
so we have parenthesis equal sign
greater than and then curly brackets so
like this now you may see some people
writing their methods like this just
like we have our render and that causes
some issues
of which that are maybe a little over
the top floor learning right now but
just to know that if we're going to be
using a state as in this dot state
inside of this we want to do this as an
arrow function like this okay so we have
our toggle function and inside of our
toggle we're going to say this that set
state now set state is a method on our
react component that updates our state
and it simply takes an object inside of
this object will just be the property we
want to change and the value we want to
change it to you know the value we want
to change this to if we're toggling this
is going to just be the opposite of what
it already is so we can get that with
exclamation point this that state dot
toggle okay so we've defined a method on
our component which we can access with
this that toggle and inside of this
method we're saying hey change the state
of toggle to the opposite of what it
currently is and then on our button
we're saying hey when you click this run
this function now a common misconception
is to do something like this now check
out what happens when I have the
parentheses here and I load my app see
if it's I'll repeatedly calls the state
component will update okay so things are
messed up here it's causing an infinite
loop let me undo this to prevent this
infinite loop here and what's happening
is is this component renders when it
renders it runs this function because
having the parentheses there causes this
function to run so the function runs the
component decides hey the state changed
I must rerender myself it runs again and
when it renders again it hits this
function it toggles the state in an
infinite state of toggling an done
toggling until you know you tell it to
stop so by not using the parentheses
here we're
this method here to not do anything
until we tell it to okay so let's come
back here and we should have this
toggling working now click show/hide
show look at that I mean this buns
jumping is a terrible user experience
but what we have here as a working state
machine and what's cool about this is is
that we can use this dot state toggle to
do anything now we simply just have a
variable with a value that's changing
and if that value changes it's going to
trigger a rerender now what's fun about
this is that welcome our welcome
component can even get access to this
state and it's changes simply by passing
in as a prop so if we were to put some
sort of prop like toggle is equal to
this state that toggle then you can see
here that this value anytime it updates
will also update inside of our welcome
component causing a refresh re-render on
this component so this is something
that's really important it's something
you'll probably do all the time at least
passing state or props into other
components so you would now have access
to this state and here but we wouldn't
access it as this state because this dot
state refers to the state of this
particular component we would access it
as a prop as just like we access text we
could say toggle and then we would have
access to toggle here let's go ahead and
do a council log CLG here and we can say
toggle okay check this out when I come
to react here I'm gonna open up my dev
tools if you don't know about dev tools
here I always simply need to do is right
click and inspect element well all we
need to do is right click and select
inspect here you can see our default
value has been passed and on the initial
render it's set to true now it's been
triggered a rerender set to false true
false true and keep in mind that this
logging is coming from this dot prop
step toggle and not this dead state
granted they are the same thing but you
can see that it is staying in fact one
to one in tune and every single time
triggers a rerender of our subcomponent
so check it out this is very very basic
but we have working state here and
that's excellent like I said we can use
state for all sorts of stuff and many
times you'll use it just to simply
control an input you know you use it
maybe for your navigation hamburger
menus you use it to toggle things all
the time and it's definitely generally
used for stuff like that but in addition
in this series we're also going to be
using it to store our data once we hit
an API so you'll definitely get a lot of
practice setting and unsetting state so
that's not the last we'll see of State
and certainly not the last we'll see of
inline conditional statements like this
we'll even do some fancier ones later or
what we'll see of actually writing
methods on our components or setting
state initially so as always this is
