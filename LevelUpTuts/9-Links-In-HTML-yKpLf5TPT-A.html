of tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you how we can start working
with links in our website we're gonna be
talking about the basics of linking to
other pages in your own site as well as
linking to off-site we'll even show you
how to link things to open up in a new
tab so check it out we're gonna be
talking about links right now so today
we're going to talk a little bit about
the a or the anchor tag the anchor tag
is how you build links in your website
now we did a little bit of that when we
wanted to link to a specific section of
our website where we just linked to an
ID however now we want to link to an
actual another page remember we made our
page this about page we made about HTML
and then we want to link to it now
instead of our header let's go ahead and
add our first link we're gonna do so
with an anchor tag which you saw before
so it's just an a now the attribute that
allows us to link to another page is H
ref and href is going to be equal to the
location of another page we're going to
be browsing to now we're gonna leave
that as an empty string right now and
now we can go ahead and write about and
then let's close this this link off
right now so if we can come to our
website we have nothing in there however
you can see that instantly this link has
been giving some default styles if it's
underlined and it's currently purple so
there's some stuff that we're gonna want
to change but as you can see we have a
link in our website now although when
you click it it does absolutely nothing
okay so let's go ahead and add a path to
that so what we want to do is we want to
link to about dot HTML okay now let's
come to our page and refresh once more
now when we select this you can see it
has taken us to our about me page okay
let's click the back button on our
browser so you don't have your first
working link now what are some gotchas
some things you need to worry about well
in this example the about dot HTML
this files in the exact same directory
as our index so therefore it's looking
on the same level for about HTML now
some things you might see in links are
forward slash now forward slash about
would say go all the way to the root
level and look for about dot HTML
however one thing you'll notice is that
our website right now is just running it
as a file right this isn't running off
of any sort of web server so the root
isn't our first site folder it's
actually way back over here so when we
refresh and we select the about link you
can see it's looking for a file at the
root of our file system named about HTML
now we'll go over this a little bit more
once we talk about web servers and
things like that however for now since
this file is just in a root directory we
can go ahead and just say about like so
if this was going to be in this folder
let's say this is going to be in a pages
folder we could do pages forward slash
about now that would look for within our
first site it would look for the folder
pages in the about HTML so forward slash
by itself means essentially go to the
very root of the directory structure if
we have a dot dot here it's going to say
go back one folder so this would look in
the folder that contains first site so
again we don't need to worry about this
dot dot we don't need to worry about
this forward slash we can just have a
bout dot HTML now what about linking to
another website entirely let's say we
wanted to link to google.com for some
reason so we wanted to let's copy this
line put google.com in here so you'd say
Google ok now the a chareth in here is
going to be the entire URL so this is
going to be HTTP colon forward slash
forward slash google.com now if you're
linking to pages within your own site
you don't necessarily want to have that
full URL on there all the time it's
probably best to have the relative URL
here if you're just linking to another
file however let's come to our page now
and let's check out our Google link we
select this link it changes our page to
google.com the the problem is here is
that when we selected that link it took
the user off of our page now it's sort
of common practice to whenever you're
linking to an outside page you open it
up in a new tab and if you're linking to
an inside page you open it up in that
same window so how do we open up a link
in a new tab now this is something you
don't want to abuse you don't want to
throw this on every single page like I
said if you're linking off your site
it's a good idea we can do that with the
target attribute by saying target and
target is going to be equal to one of
four values those four values being
underscore blank underscore parent
underscore shelf and underscore top so
blank is going to be opening your link
in a new tab self is going to be opening
it in the same tab that was it was
clicked in parent will be linking from
the parent frame in top will be linking
in the entire the window that you
clicked it in now some of these are
totally antiquated because you may have
heard the word frame in there and last
time I checked websites have not been
using frames in a very long time so if
I'm going to be honest the only one I
ever really use is underscore blank like
so and that's going to open this up in a
new window so as far as target goes you
can memorize the other ones and what
they do
however target underscore blank is
really the only one that you really need
to know let's come to our page refresh I
only select Google here you can see it
opens it up in a new tab while
maintaining our previous tab cool so
that's all about links in HTML you can
link to other pages you can open them up
in new tabs and as we saw in a couple of
videos ago you can link to content in
your site so as always this is Scoville
level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments if a comment the
video or hit me up at Twitter or
Facebook
at level of tutorials I love to hear
from you thanks for watching and I'll
see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
