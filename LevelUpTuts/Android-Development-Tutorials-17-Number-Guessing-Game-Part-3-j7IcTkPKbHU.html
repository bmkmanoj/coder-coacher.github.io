up tubs and today we're going to take
our get a number guessing game one step
further and we're going to add some nice
little visual elements and make it just
an all-around better experience for your
users so first thing this space right
here is all sort of funky we got a big
space here we have big space below this
we want this button to take up a lot of
space because we want people to be able
to click it so let's check out our
button in our XML and right here you can
see already we have a large margin of
top of 68 device pixels I'm gonna make
that 20 and right here where it says
layout height instead of wrap content
we're gonna say fill parent and what
this is gonna do it's gonna fill all the
space it has available so from where it
is in down notice that it's not taking
up anybody else's space it's not filling
the entire window here in fact if we
were to edit this let's say the edit
text and we were to give this a height
of fill parent watch what happens here
when we give this an edit text to fill
parent because it's above that button
it's gonna fill all of the space it has
left so we don't want that we'll leave
it here like this great so now we have
this buttons a lot larger perfect
another thing that was a problem was
this text was unusually it was like
small and dark it wasn't easy to read on
the purple so we're gonna take our text
that is text size 26 SP and then ffff
we're gonna have our white text and
we're gonna put that on our edit text
and just to make that styling a little
bit more and it's gonna be a little bit
more similar to what we already had cool
so that's going to be looking quite a
bit better and now let's go to our main
activity and let's let's make this a
little bit better if you remember I
wrote quests again instead I guess again
it's a easy typo and we had a one issue
where when we ran the program you could
just keep guessing the same number over
and over again until you got it right so
before it runs again but after it does
that does everything
we want to set our userguess textbox to
equal to a blank string so we're going
to say user gues dot set text just like
we're setting the text of any of these
other text views and we're just going to
set this to blank screen and that's
going to clear it out essentially so we
now have this user guest being reset so
let's see that in action I'm going to
run our app just so we can make sure
that it's all working so let's ask me
for a number I'm gonna guess a number
I'm gonna guess two and let's hit press
me
not quite guess again so now it's making
me actually guess again hmm I can't just
keep guessing too so maybe I'll guess
one and let's see how this works
not quite guess again I got three again
cool so that's just a little feature if
you want to make your users guess every
single time sure maybe a little bit
knowing you have to come in here it's a
nice much nicer interaction than you
know on your phone actually so what
happens if there's nothing in here what
happens if you guess and not you know
nothing happens well let's let's check
this out so let's press me and our app
stopped well it's because there's no
value and it's checking it's trying to
see if that value is equal to another
one or not
so what's one way we can get around this
well instead of setting our number two
or setting this to a blank string we can
set this to zero and since we're only
going to be having numbers 1 through 5
that's going to be great because it's
never going to come up with 0 and we
want to actually have our main.xml
we want to have this default text just
be 0 so the edit text we can just say in
here Android
text equals and then we'll just throw
zero in here so now this is going to be
zero by default it's gonna say you
should really have the zero and a string
resource I mean sure
for this rib net this particular example
it doesn't really matter but now let's
boot this up and nice to make sure that
it doesn't crash when we press the Go
button because we want to have a user
experience when it doesn't crash sure
somebody should be entering a number but
if they don't we don't want it to you
know blow up so now it's gonna keep
dying you know and not crash however
it's telling them that they guess this
is not quite guess again but they never
guessed so really what you want to do is
wrap this all in a another if statement
so what we want to do is adjust our if
statement here we want to say first we
want to say if we want to say if user
number is less than one or user number
is greater than five then we want to
have them do something so we're gonna
put the curly brackets here and I'm
gonna bump this if back on to the last
line here and this is going to now say
else if so first it's going to check to
see if the user number is greater is
less than one as in zero and lower or if
the user number is greater than five and
then if it is one of those two cases
we're going to change the set text and
we're gonna say please guess a number or
please guess one through five let's keep
it short and concise follow it up with a
semicolon
and now where a statement is checking to
make sure that their input is valid
first that it's something that we can
use
and if it isn't it's letting them know
they need to guess one through five so
they know what's wrong
gives them some feedback and then in the
case of their valid input is valid it's
going to check just make sure that the
number is equal to R and O if it is it's
going to let them know that they got it
right and if it's wrong it's gonna know
that they got it wrong so let's run this
app and let's see this in all of its
glory our number guessing app so let's
guess the number and we're gonna guess
five
well let's guess eight please guess the
number one through five please get to
number one through five
okay now let's cuz it number four you've
got a right perfect that was cool that I
got it right and it seems like I got
pretty good luck with this game although
it is just one through five so awesome
we now have a number guessing game it
works it does everything that lets a
user know and most importantly it's not
gonna crash if they goof up for some
reason so it's always you know feel free
to leave a comment the video like I said
we just do this part-time so I really
appreciate people helping out in the
comments if you know how to fix some a
solution if you don't no big deal
I always try to read the comments when I
have time and and try to answer them
some ones that I can answer but all the
times it's just really hard to get to
every question we want to keep making
videos we want to put our emphasis and
time in making videos and we'll answer
questions when we can but really thank
you to anybody who stepped up and
answered questions for people as always
is this Scott will level up Tut's and
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
