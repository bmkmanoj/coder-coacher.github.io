up tots today we're going to level up
our expression shin skills and cover the
pages module where the pages module will
be able to create static content that
will be managed through the site just to
note about the word static static to me
normally means like my clients wouldn't
be able to edit it or they would need me
to edit it but in this sense it really
it really doesn't mean that at all so
we're just going to sort of use that
term static but we're going to use real
loosely before we start with this
tutorial like always I want to encourage
everyone to subscribe to our YouTube
channel we'd really appreciate it and we
want to thank everyone that's watched
and subscribed this far we really
appreciate it's great okay let's go to
our control panel so I'm already logged
in if you're not remember as always
admin dot PHP and enter your login
credentials I've already done that I'm
give this refresh real quick here we go
okay so the first thing that we would
need to do is install the pages module
now you may have already done this
during your installation process this is
one that by default is not turned on to
install it you to go under admins two
modules locate it my it's already
installed but you would just here let me
remove it real quick here galv d install
it I don't know why doesn't say on
install but so we now we're looking at
the same screen here not installed all
those hit install and now that I've
installed it the module name column is
now clickable so I'm go ahead and click
to go into it no pages currently exists
that's true we haven't created any pages
we just started before we create any
pages which we can do from this button
here or like any other piece of content
we could do by going under content
publish page we are going to look at the
module configuration now there's not a
lot of configurations that you can do
with this module the display your eyes
on module
module home page in which method would
you like to do nest it or not nested I
like seeing nested and all that will do
is it's going to you know show the about
page and then it will show the child and
dentin under that and that child has a
child that will be indented and so on
default channel for creating a new page
this we actually I actually plan for
this in the very beginning and that is
why we created a second channel called
page so let's go ahead and select that
base basically what this will do is just
save you a step if you don't designate a
default when you say create a new page
it will first ask you which channel
would you like to tie that page too so
you don't have it you don't have to do
what I did but for me I try to lead put
all my static pages on one channel type
we are in this case I'm not going to
bother setting a default for the news
channel but I and I would like to set
one for the page channel but we haven't
created that channel I'm sorry that
template yet for for the page channel so
we'll come back to this later let's go
ahead and hit update and let's go ahead
and create a page so we can do it from
here great new page alternatively we
could go like we're used to saying
content publish whoops content publish
page it brings us to the same exact
place so this is a static page and this
is the body so before we hit submit
there's one new thing that I need a
point out here and that's the pages tab
so under pages we now have two new
fields that we didn't have previously so
we have the pages URI and so that's
going to be the like they give here
the URL where this page will live so
this is 2 is going to be on the about
page will say and the template
unfortunately i didn't set up the
template yet and we're actually going to
do that in the next video but that this
is a important part so let's go ahead
and just hit detail and hit submit even
though again that's not accurate but now
what we can do is we go back to the
pages module screen this is a very
roundabout way to go here so here we now
have a page inside of our pages listing
and we should be able to say or we can
click on view page but again it's not
going to work it's going to show us you
know it's missing the main entry then is
showing this these other store these
other stories in the next video I'm
going to cover creating the pages
template and then we'll wrap this up
