up Tut's tonight I am starting a new
tutorial series on wordpress in this
tutorial series what we will cover as
installation getting familiar with the
word press control panel and all the
features what we are not going to cover
in this particular series is writing
custom mod custom plugins or themes that
will be the next series so hope you
enjoy so the first thing that we need to
do when starting a new wordpress site is
go to wordpress org not com but gorg
it's two different products and this is
the one we want and we go ahead and
click on download there's several links
to it take it all takes you this page
and then from here what we're going to
do is click the big blue button and as
of this recording is 341 is the latest
version I'm go ahead and click that when
download pretty fast it's pretty tiny
file and before we go on to the next
step of like uploading these files which
I've already actually already done what
we need to do is create the database for
WordPress so as I've seated in other
videos I use media temple for hosting
and I have one of their products that is
the dedicated virtual server not the
grid servers not the shared hosting plan
but the little bit bigger plan you may
have GoDaddy or you know whatever
there's a there's a plethora of hosts so
whatever one you have I'm going to be
looking for buttons like this they might
not look the same but basically what we
need to do now is create an empty
database so on media temple square
server what you do to do to where you go
to do that you click on websites and
domains databases add new database and
then what you need to do is give it a
name
depending on note your host again you
may not get to choose the name it might
just be some random thing it doesn't
matter but what does matter is that you
need to save that these names and the
database user and their password off to
the side because we're going to need it
in about 20 seconds so let's give it a
database name I'm gonna call mine WP
time up and I need to give it now a user
so once I've created by database I need
to assign a user to it this is the same
in every day hosting environment again
you're going to want to you should be
secure they shouldn't be easy to guess
and you but you're also going to want to
like save them off the side I need them
right now so we've created a database
we've created a user we've download the
files I've already super secretly upload
of these files I haven't done anything
else yet to them so you can pause while
your files are uploading but I'm just
going to keep on going so now that your
files are uploaded the next step is you
need to tell wordpress how to interact
with your database or need to tell
WordPress where your database lives so
the first thing you need to do is rename
WP hyphen config hyphen sample to just
WP hype and config go ahead and open
that file up I'm using sublime and what
we need to do is we need to fill out
this section here so we're gonna need
that database name from the one screen
ago
never mind that here your your host may
differ depending on where your database
is hosted on my server my database and
my files all live on the same box so
it's locos and a lot of instances maybe
most instances you wouldn't have to
change this but if you're in a shared
hosting environment you may have to your
host to make this pretty obvious to you
in fact I'll even show you what happens
when you have something wrong in the
content in the config but before I do
that and so I guess I'll do is I'll just
remove a letter here so that it won't be
able to find this database the last
thing that we need to add to this is the
what we have here called the
authentication unique keys and salts
what this does is secure your site I
don't really know a whole lot of the
like how and all that stuff but you
definitely need to do this and so I just
go to this hit this address it's going
to give you some random stuff you can
hit refreshed to you know if every time
it refresh it gives you something
totally random so again this is just a
way to secure your site you definitely
need to do it so okay so I have my salt
I have my passwords and all that stuff
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to bring up my site and what we should
hopefully see is it there here we go
error establishing a database connection
so if you see this know that something
in your WP config is wrong so in my case
right I intentionally botched the wp or
the database name
go ahead and correct that and hit save
come back here give it all refresh and
there you go so now we are going into
the installation process I'm going to
give this site a name if it's a password
don't you put my email address privacy
I'm going to not allow search engines to
index this site you probably would
depending on I guess what you're trying
to do so let's go ahead and click the
install WordPress success that's it guys
that's all that's all there is I'm on
like drupal and expressionengine you're
not having to monkey with no file
permissions and all that stuff it's just
easy so we're going to view the site
there it is and I just clicked out of
the sort of dashboard area so let's go
back to the dashboard and this is the
dashboard we're going to go over this in
detail in the next couple Syria videos
