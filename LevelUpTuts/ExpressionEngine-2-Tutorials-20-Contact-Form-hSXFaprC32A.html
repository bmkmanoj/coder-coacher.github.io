level up tots today we're going to cover
creating a contact form and we are going
to use a module called free form which
is written R which is authored by a
company called Sol space so let's get
into that alright so on our site what we
want to do is we want to create a
contact form what that contact form will
do is once that form is submitted its
going to send off two emails one to me
as the administrator and one to the
individual that submitted the contact
form in the first place so again what
we're gonna do is we're going to use a
company called Sol spaces software
called
free form and I actually I've already
downloaded it but to download it all you
need to do is go to Sol space.com select
free form under software what it's a
free download you will need to register
for their site just create account
almost no big deal it's fast and the
nice thing is once you create that
account once you know if you use their
free software or purchase some of their
their license software you know it's all
sort of under one account so that's
pantie for future usage so I've already
logged in and downloaded and also then
uploaded the the module if it's just
your first module what you'll see is
when you download the item and then
unzip it you should see two directories
expression engine one so if you're doing
a special engine in one side and
watching tutorials good for you more
likely yours using expression 2 and so
the way that this works I'm going to
fresh energy Boulder the way that they
most developers lay this out is they
sort of provide the file structure of
where this directory needs to go to so
the freeform
directory should be luck uploaded to the
third-party directory that's inside of
the expression gin directory that's
inside of the system directory so if we
go ahead and look on FTP we're the
breadcrumbs work this way
on transmit so third-party expression
engine system and then right inside here
we have freeform once you've uploaded
that file you're the same location where
I'm at to install it you go to patents
modules and you should see freeform it
should not be clickable because it's not
installed yet so we're gonna go ahead
and install it and now that its
installed it's just real quick just
blinks it installs create some tables
now we click on freeform and we're now
at the freeform landing page this page
right now and it's current state is
empty this really will be a repository
for all of the entries for in our case
the contact form but on your site's case
maybe you're gonna have multiple forms
maybe you have or having in the bench
and you want individuals to RSVP well
you can use freeform for that it's not
just for contact forms or anything like
that don't get that that's the idea it's
incredibly flexible and can handle a lot
of form cases so this again well this
screen will do is you'll be able to see
all of your entries we have none yet you
can filter by a couple criteria which
we'll look at later but before we get
into any of that I want to talk through
these three tabs right here
so under fields
under fields we're going to see our the
soul space freeform default fields that
have been created so we're seeing you
know name email website Street one
Street - you do not have to use these
you can delete them all and create your
own if you really wanted or you can
delete the ones you're not going to use
I'm in my case we're not going to you
know use street 1 and street 2 and
street 3 this is just a contact form
where I'm really only interested in
their name their email address and you
know and a text area field for common
which we actually don't see here so I
could delete the ones I'm not going to
use or I can just let them be they don't
it's not bothering me if they bother to
you can go ahead and delete it but to
add a new field to this list what we
need to do is go in a create new field
I'll go ahead and call it a comment this
should be as it says here a single word
with no spaces underscores are allowed
comment fits that bill the label that's
just for you know typically the same
name or something close this can be
spaces if you need to and instead of it
being a text type as soon be a text area
they create and now we're gonna see that
option here so all we've done now is
added this field to the system but what
we haven't done is like told the output
to the page we haven't built that form
out and what may be misleading or what
you may be thinking is that we would do
that under this tap and that's actually
not true what what this word templates
is referring to is the template of the
email that is sent out so not template
that we are used to seeing this design
template template manager had it just
you know this stuff it's not that at all
it's really just what format
or you know what's the subject line etc
of the email that is sent by expression
engine so let's go ahead and look at one
you can't actually do anything with the
default one it's just sort of in the
system so we're gonna go ahead and
create a new one great new template and
really this is what the default one
looks like really it just sends an email
message that has all of the custom all
the custom fields which is every field
actually it's just every field in here
and so this email format is probably
good for an administrator or site
administrator like myself or yourself
but where it doesn't really make sense
is for the individual that submitted
that contact form so for that what we
can do is I think I got something no
what we can do is let's go ahead and and
start filling this out but so in this
case what we want this is again the
email that's going to the recipient so
you know basically what that could say
is name because we're gonna ask them for
their name so now we could use that
field in the email so we can say name
thank you for you know your interest in
and then you know our site name so say
if I want time we have received your
message we will follow up
accordingly you know whatever this
message you could say anything and then
I'm really what I'm just trying to point
out is what you'll be able to do is use
custom these custom fields that you are
gathering when they're actually filling
out the form you can actually use that
within the email message and you can
also do it up here as well so anyway so
now what we're going to do is let's see
here finish creating this so the first
thing we need to do is give it a short
name so I'm gonna call it just I'm gonna
just call it yes anyway
the from name what is that's again this
is the from name and the email so let's
go ahead and just say that's from email
let's put my email address and the email
subject wordwrap
yes or no HTML I guess for now so go
ahead hit submit so now what we've done
is we're gonna use the default template
as the template that will be used in the
email that is sent to the administrator
me and the recipient template what we'll
use that for is again the individual
that submitted the form and then under
preferences there's some basic basic
preferences for for freeform all of
which I sort of just leave as a default
I haven't really had a big issue with
spam or anything like that but you know
what you can also do is you can add
caption to these things as well to cut
down on that but you know these are just
the basic preferences and then they also
link off to their documentation so what
I'm not going to go to but that's just
on their website so I didn't change
anything but I'll hit save anyway just
for good measure
and we'll see here that's that's it for
the sort of administrative side now
we're going to create a contact form
page and add the free form template tags
but we're actually gonna do that in the
next tutorial so please stay tuned to
watch that and hopefully the next
tutorial we'll do is like I said will
actually submit a a contact form so
thanks again for watching please follow

a lot take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
