up HUD's and today we're going to show
you how to update a module with Drupal 7
so if you remember in the last tutorial
when we were in one of our menus here
there was a read error message that came
up here it is and it says security
updates are available so this will pop
up if there's little minor updates for
your modules but if there is a security
update available this error will pop up
so if we click here for available
updates it's going to show us what needs
updating so a lot of times there might
be a big old list and some of them will
be read and others will be not and of
course the red ones are going to be the
security updates and the ones you need
to handle urgently so typically you're
going to want to not update this module
on a production site because there's
always a chance now let's say you update
a module and either you did it wrong or
a module it was buggy for some reason
which it shouldn't be no let me just
state the Dead is a rare rare case but
let's just say something happens when
you're updating this module and your
whole site goes down that is a problem
because when you update these things
it's going to write to the database and
it's basically you could be setting
yourself up for a lot of headache if you
update something and it breaks your
whole site and you don't have a copy
so let me strongly urge you to take a
backup of your site before you do this
and do not update the module on your
live site so since this is a copy on my
local system and let's just say I've
already taken a backup of the database
so the strictly updating a module what
you're going to do here is from this
page you can click to go to the chaos
tools page or this is the module that
needs updating and then you can click
zip and download the latest version so
we'll just click down download for your
module this is pretty much the way I
always do it anyways unless I music
something like jarash which is a a
extension to like add
man line extension to Drupal that allows
you to do things like make installations
of Drupal and download modules and
everything really easy all sorts of
stuff I mean I would Google around for
drush we'll be getting into some rush
tutorials eventually but that's more on
the advanced side of Drupal
so let's browse to our site and Esty
okay we're going to go to sites all and
then modules and then here we have just
the modules that we've installed and
just like when we installed them you're
going to click and drag your folder into
the module page or the module folder so
we're going to ask any if you want to
replace this you're going to want to
replace the whole file as your password
gave ya okay so this is replacing the
entire CTools
module now if we go back to our site and
we browse to the page update dot PHP and
enter it's going to take you to this
updating page and this is going to
basically update your database with the
changes in the module okay so sometimes
let's say you've installed a new module
that doesn't require database updates it
will say no pending updates perfect okay
that's nice and easy because now that
means we don't have to run anything
however because some modules do require
database updates it's always good to
check this update dot PHP after you've
installed an update and then in this
case they'll just be a click to continue
button you click continue it will run
through the update and that'll be it so
if we browse back to our site it's going
to say we're in maintenance mode let's
go online because this module has been
updated
save configuration' okay okay our sights
no longer in maintenance mode and if we
go to modules you receive we are no
longer getting an error about ctools
needing an update okay
well that's how to update a module
manually with Drupal 7 if you have any
questions or comments please feel free
to leave a comment on the video or hit
us up at Twitter at LevelUp tuts once
again this is Scott with level of tuts
and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
