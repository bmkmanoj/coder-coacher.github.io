of tutorials and today we're gonna
introduce to you the controller in
angular
now controller is going to allow you to
essentially control your template and
your data in a way that you didn't have
access to without using javascript so
while this is our first time getting
introduced to controllers we're gonna
start small and then we're gonna build
you up to some best practices including
using a controller as syntax to make
sure that your controllers our names
based correctly so let's get going on
our first controller right now so now
that we're going to be getting into
controllers and things like that we're
actually going to be getting into more
of the JavaScript part of working and
angular which is gonna be where you're
spending almost all of your time right
so the first thing we want to do is
let's actually give our applications
instead of a name so we have this ng app
directive before what we can actually do
is hit equals and then two quotes and
then give our application some sort of
name so this can just be direct three
app links though so I'm just using a
camel case here to say directory app let
me copy this to my clipboard so then
when we actually need to use this I have
it available and I'm gonna make a new
file in here that's just by
right-clicking say new file and this is
just going to be directory J s now at
the top of this directory J s we're
going to type angular dot module and
then we're going to have parentheses and
then inside of quotes the name of our
application comma then we're going to
have sumit empty brackets okay now what
we can do on the next line over notice
how we're not finishing this off for the
semicolon because what this is going to
be is it's going to be a method on this
angular top module so we can say period
and then type controller
I'm not going to use this
auto-completion so we can type this out
now we're going to give our controller a
name so we can just call this directory
controller and then we can have a comma
here and then a function now inside the
dysfunction in the argument we're going
to be passing in a dollar sign scope
like so and now we're gonna obviously
finish this out with some curly brackets
here and end that all off with a
semicolon so now let's actually take
some of our data out of our template
here where we have this ng init with a
list list is equal to all these things
so we can just cut that directly out of
here okay and let's paste it into our
directory like so okay and I'm going to
go ahead and say instead of list this is
now going to be dollar sign scope dot
list now there's a lot to learn about
scope and controllers and all this and
in fact in this particular example we're
just getting a controller up and running
however in future videos we're going to
show you a better syntax called the
controller as syntax we don't end up
putting things on to the scope variable
itself but for now to get going it's
good to see exactly sort of what this
does okay so now we have an array with
some objects in it
you can make this look a little bit
nicer if you want when I go ahead and do
that just so it's a little bit more
readable and we can save that okay so
now that we have this scope dot list how
do we start to use this controller right
so we have this JavaScript here it's
defining up this list of people on the
scope and we're defining controller name
directory controller but we're not
really using anything yet in fact if we
were to come to your page here you were
to refresh you begin a whole lot of
problems because we deleted that ng in
it so first thing we need to do is add
the script so just below our other
script we could say script like so and
then the s source
just going to be named directory jeaious
okay now again once we get into some
best practices in terms of application
folder structure and stuff like that
this is going to change however for now
it's fine to just leave it in this home
directory and declared like so okay so
directory dot J guess can refresh I'm
going to open the council log here and
as you can see we're not getting any
JavaScript errors so it means it looks
like it's finding everything and we
didn't make any typos
okay now let's head back to our template
and before we did ng-repeat item in list
and now what's cool is that this is
going to work pretty much instantly the
moment that we actually declare that
we're using this controller so on our
body here we can type ng controller and
then pass in the controller's name which
is directory controller I'm gonna give
that some space there so you can see so
now that we're saying the controller of
this content here is directory
controller it now has anything access to
anything on the Skov area below which is
if you remember this list because we
have scope dot list with the list items
therefore just simply using the list
variable now becomes an option for us so
if we save this come back to our page
and refresh you can see just like we had
before our list is working just fine in
fact if we search everything works fine
on that it's still filtering based on
this search bar it's just checking list
which is this list right here okay so
that's your very most basic angular
controller now in the next video what
we're gonna do is we're gonna show you
how the scope variable can be used just
for more than plugging in data we can
actually use the scope variable to
complete functions and things like that
so what we're gonna do is we're going to
create a form and we're to be able to
add names directly to this list in
action so as always this is Scott with
love-love tutorials if you have any
questions or comments they've become in
the video
gonna set that Twitter or Facebook ad
level up tuts we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
