level of Tut's and today we're going to
be going over menus in Drupal so to get
started I'm actually going to get rid of
this test block that I put on here last
time because we don't really want this
in the site anywhere so I'm just going
to set it to none for its region click
Save it's no longer there okay so to get
into menus there's a couple ways we can
go to structure and then we can select
menus and then we can add it to our
shortcuts if you want or you cannot um
you know I'm just not going to add it
right now cuz I don't really feel like
I'll be in here a ton but in some
instances where you're building lots of
menus and the site gets a little bit
larger you're going to have to be in
here a little bit more often
so if you notice Drupal gives you four
menus to start there's the main menu the
management menu navigation and user menu
so let's see what they are dug into the
main menu and click list links here and
you'll see the links and in their order
so I actually notice this is home
projects and about this is our main
navigation so I actually want projects
to come after about so let's actually
drag this one down here and when they
click Save it's going to keep it in that
order okay let's go back to menus to
check out the other ones if we check out
management there's all sorts of
administrative menus these are where you
can you can you know edit these but
personally I never touch these
administrative menus unless maybe you're
changing it for a particular user or
something but I mean I don't really go
in here to change anything leave it the
way it is navigation this is also the
navigation if you noticed on our main
page and shows up as a block this is the
navigation that Drupal comes with I
personally usually take this off build
my own whatever I don't usually have a
ton of sites where people are adding
content other than these site
administrators but if you are this menus
pre-made for you and you can take this
and turn it into something else if you
want okay and if you come down here user
menu this is the links is basically my
account log out of course if you'll
notice this one's unchecked it says
disabled if we were to check this it
would be renamed old
I'm also not planning on using this menu
if you come up here here it is but you
know really uh when the site's done I'm
going to be the only person who I really
want logging in so to access that I'm
just going to have to go to s T slash
user and I don't really need to log in
my account button but if you're building
these sites out for sites that other
people are going to be accessing you
know you know you might want to use this
or expand on that menu or change it so
let's say you wanted to have an item be
a child of another item in a menu so
let's go to structure menus and then
let's grab this navigation menu because
it's not one that I really care about if
you notice here this one is a in its
normal place however these three are all
slightly indented to the right that
means these are children of this content
or children of this menu link so if we
slide this basic page 1 or any of these
out and down you'll see that it's moved
and it's no longer a child of this but
click Save here go back to our menu
you'll see that this project is now
actually showing if you notice here this
triangle here is signifying that there
are other menu items within here so
let's go back to structure menus and
then navigation let's click Edit on this
add content link so this is a menu link
edit screen this is where you can change
the name of the link the path this path
is auto set to add content because of
this this is a default one however this
is a menu item you created this would be
a field where you could put the path in
the descriptions what's going to be
shown when your mouse hovers over the
link it's enabled so it's going to show
up and you see that show is expanded is
unchecked if we check this the children
of this menu item should be shown and in
a list below it okay so we're going to
click Save here and we're going to save
this menu play click the X here and you
can see now that the children of this
menu of this menu item are now featured
below it let's say you want
add more children to the children well
that's just as easy let's click here you
can just drag this basic page or any of
these to the right a little bit more and
this is now a child of that article
however I won't show up unless the show
has expanded is checked in this as well
so we'll save this exit out and you can
see it's now shown as all of them are
expanded okay so this is a good
introduction to menus if in the next
lesson we're going to show you to create
a menu item from the menu screen and
then you can get working on building
your own menus instead of just adding
and changing the ones that are built in
the Drupal if you have any questions or
comments feel free to leave a comment or
