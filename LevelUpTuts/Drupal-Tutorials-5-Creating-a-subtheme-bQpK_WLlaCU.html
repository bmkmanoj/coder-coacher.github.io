Tut's and today we're going to be going
over creating a sub theme for Drupal 7
with Omega so creating a sub theme with
Omega can be a little bit different than
some of the other themes and we will go
over creating sub themes of different
themes if there is a demand but for the
most part there installation processes
are all sort of either unique or there's
a readme file that will tell you how to
do it this is just basically going to
show you the basic process now Omega
actually has a module that will create a
sub theme for you when you give it the
specified parameters that it asks for
we're not going to do it that way in
fact we're actually going to do a whole
nother tutorial series on omega
specifically because this tutorial is
more about Drupal we're just going to
show you the the by hand method so what
we're going to do is we're going to go
to appearance here and then you'll
notice this brings up our appearance
menu where we were before and you'll see
Omega our default theme is enabled if
you click here you'll see how to create
an Omega sub theme and they'll tell you
how to do it with the module without the
module and it gives you nice basic
instructions but that's actually we're
going to show you here so this is a four
step process the steps include you go to
Omega browse to your file structure
actually let's go to HT htdocs here so
our folder is st so this fault this is
located in sites all themes Omega and in
here there is a starter kits folder and
Omega offers a few different starting
off points the this is alpha XHTML this
is omega XHTML and omega html5 we're
going to use Omega html5 the other two I
don't think people are really intended
to use alpha it says something about it
on their on their install and then the
XHTML is just a not html5 so we want the
site to be current we want it to be
html5 so we're going to copy this Omega
html5 folder into our themes directory
so that it sits next
right next to Omega so you see here and
we have now have Omega and Omega html5
what we're going to do is we're going to
rename this we're going to rename this
to what we want our theme to be named so
this is going to be my own site
everything so far has been st so we're
just going to call this st again makes
it nice and simple so that step one is
renaming this to be the name of your
theme next we're going to want to go
into what we see is starter kit Omega 5
HTML 5 done info so we're going to
change this also to be the name of your
theme this will be st info now okay now
we're going to want to go ahead and open
this STD info file up and use sublime
edit it's sublime text to my favorite
text editor
okay so we'll come in here so this is
basically where you're saying to Drupal
hey I got a new theme this is its name
this is what it does this is where to
look for files the st info or your dot
info file in your theme is where you
specify a lot of things where you
specify regions which we're going to get
into zones optional style sheets and a
lot of other themes you'll actually
specify your style sheets here omega
likes to handle that a little
differently and we're going to show you
that so what we're going to do is we're
going to change the name to BST the
description well we can make this what
we want it to be so theme for Scott's
site okay core is so the next okay we
don't need to change any of this if we
want to give it a screenshot in the
admin which we probably will once the
the theme is finished we'll change that
here and then of course the base theme
is omega now as you'll notice here is
this important delete these two items
from your sub theme not every theme is
going to have these items that Omega if
you're doing it the manual a you have to
delete these lines so we're just going
to delete I'll delete the other line
just to
and let us know that there's nothing
else to delete we'll save it okay well
now all we have to do is two more things
we just have to go through our CSS files
that have your theme we'll see I'll show
you right here and their CSS folder
under st it says your theme - alpha -
default narrowed CSS so what you need to
do is all you need to do is change this
your theme to your themes name on all of
these like I said other themes you'll
want to change the CSS or you don't even
need to change the CSS because that will
be declared in the info file however for
Omega this is a step that you have to do
to get this working okay so that is all
set there so now we're going to go back
to Drupal here and before we do anything
well let's go ahead and clear the cache
so I'm going to open up click on
performance remember we added this in
the last tutorial clear the cache and
then when this is done we'll come back
here and refresh this and you'll notice
that we should have our new theme here
it is st seven-point x - 3.1 we're going
to enable and set as the default so now
we have omega is enabled as you're doing
what the sub thing you're going to want
to keep Omega enabled and then your sub
theme is st so what the sub theme is
going to do is it's going to use its
files whenever they're here so if we
take and we duplicate any D files from
Omega and edit them here and this
templates we put them in here it's going
to look for at st first and if there's
nothing in st it's going to go to omega
next to find those files so this is why
theming is really powerful with creating
a something because you don't want to
change the you don't want to change the
base theme if you do and let's say you
break something or let's say there's an
update to the theme you won't be able to
really get very far so creating a sub
theme and overriding is sort of the way
to go here if you'll notice throughout
these tutorials
I'm going to start filling in the CSS
I'm going to be using compass and sass
for my CSS so if you want to learn
compass and sass please we're doing
compass and sass tutorials I level up
Tut's they're already up we got maybe
about sixteen seventeen up already so
check those out I'm not going to be
going into the CSS of this so if you do
notice CSS change your style changes I'm
going to be doing that outside of the
tutorials okay well that's it for this
tutorial in the next lesson we're going
to go over creating your first piece of
content in Drupal 7
once again this is Scott with level up
tux if you have any questions please
