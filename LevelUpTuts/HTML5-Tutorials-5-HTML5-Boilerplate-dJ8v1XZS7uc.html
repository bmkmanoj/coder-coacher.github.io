love-love tots and today we're going to
be showing you html5 boilerplate and
this isn't going to be getting into
everything about html5 boilerplate but
what it's intended to do is to show you
why you would use it and essentially
html5 boilerplate gives you a lot of
stuff to start out with and a great way
to start building your html5 site
without starting from scratch so let's
see exactly what it contains well it
contains a Google Analytics snippet
which is nice because I don't know how
many how many times you do a project
without Google Analytics at this point
it's really something that's a necessity
and it comes with normalized CSS and
normalized
I used to come with the reset CSS reset
but normalise has become sort of the new
reset I guess people are using
normalized because what it's doing is
it's giving you cross browser
consistency and I would recommend
reading more about it you can always
click on this link right here and get
this information but yeah it even gives
a normalized first reset so includes
normalized it also includes jQuery using
Google CDN and I think it's unknown 1.9
something right now in fact we could see
the changelog of html5 boilerplate it's
using 191 so this is also great because
their hosts on github you can see their
change log and what they've updated
another the last update was in April 8th
to 2013 so that was just last month at
the time of creating this video it also
includes modernizer and if you haven't
used mod Nezzer yet it's something you
want to get on moderniser
is really a basically just a utility
that's going to be adding classes to
your site that tell you what the support
so instead of keying off of what browser
you're using you're keying off of what
feature your browser supports so that
way if the browser doesn't support you
know drop shadow you can write a you
know a
fall back for it whichever way you want
to looks like this sites taking a little
bit time to load but here it is
moderniser is a great tool it's done by
a lot of the same people as html5
boilerplate so it's another utility that
I use really on every project and what's
great about moderniser is that it
actually includes the html5 shift for
you so you don't have to go and get that
and now we just talked about that you
can actually even configure your own
production build and with the stuff you
want on it and the stuff you don't
however this just includes just
moderniser two feature detection there's
also a build script and stuff however
we're not going to get into that too
much so what you're going to want to do
is you just click this big download
button and get yourself some html5
boilerplate and we're going to throw it
into our project and you can see what it
contains so many of my projects actually
start off with me just getting html5
boilerplate in some way so whether
that's whether that's getting it from
you know a package manager or getting it
with some sort of project startup tool
or something like that it's always
starting with html5 boilerplate so I've
thrown this into sublime text and you
can see exactly what it comes with it
comes with a whole lot of stuff it even
comes with icons that are used for
apple's ipod touch or their iphone so
that when you have a bookmark on this
page it has an icon and everything it
also has a 32 by 32 sized favicon for
Retina displays and it comes with your
folders even though they're not
populated like your image and your j/s
has your plugins main also as vendor
which includes a local copy of jQuery a
local copy of moderniser
and let's click here we can actually see
some of the stuff this is the htaccess
file that comes with it it comes with a
404 page these are icons that's where
they're showing up is and let's go to
this humans txt which i think is a
really great idea you know how you can
give crawl settings in robots.txt keep
txt is for humans to look at so that way
if you're on a site and you want to see
you a little bit more about the site
itself you could test type in slash
humans Dada txt then you get the thanks
you get
you know what technology they're using
the team and it's a really great idea in
fact I think usually when I go to a site
and I see they're using humans txt I'm
like wow okay these guys are these guys
are with it and it's really helpful at
UPS you learn a lot about the project so
let's check out the index file and then
in here you can see it includes our
doctype HTML it's giving classes to our
body based on what version of ie it is
and it's basically giving us everything
we need to start our project out
something you know - where to place the
favicon gives you normalized dead CSS it
also gives you main that CSS which just
has some base styles you can see here
including this selection color and
basically you can read the notes here
exactly why they made these choices but
it's really nice that they offer these
little styles here and they even have
some basic mobile-first media queries
which is very helpful when getting a
project started and it also has some
good print style stuff so next we have
basically if you're on this old version
of ie it's going to give you this chrome
frame notice that's going to allow your
users to install this Chrome Frame
plugin that lets the browser use more
modern features which is a great thing
and then we have basically just a
paragraph that says hello world and then
we're loading Google's version of jQuery
will their Google's hosted version of
jQuery and then with a backup of our own
that's in the vendor folder our plugins
jsr main that jeaious which both have
nothing in them however we want to put
our plugins in here and our JavaScript
or jQuery code in here and then we have
Google Analytics at the bottom where
we're going to want to put our site ID
so this is really it it's not a ton of
stuff but it's really really helpful you
can up you can also check out there read
B if you want to see some more features
or just a little bit more about it here
but
is html5 boilerplate I use it constantly
and I you know it's as its fitted and
it's frequently updated so it's a tool
that is staying current and the people
behind you're all just really great so
as always if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment on the video
below and Assefa to our level up tuts
let us know what you're thinking we love
to hear from you as always this is Scott
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
