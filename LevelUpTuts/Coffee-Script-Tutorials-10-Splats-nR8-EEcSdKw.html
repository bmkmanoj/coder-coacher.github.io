huts and today I'm going talking about
splats in CoffeeScript I'm having a
great day I'm having a great month so
far I got married this month one of my
honeymoon and I've been super busy so
there have been no tutorials so far
however I back and things are a little
bit more in control and so you're going
to start to see a lot more tutorials
come out in the next few weeks here ok
so I just wanted to you know throw that
out there before we got started but uh
so today we're going to be talking about
splats and what splits are is pretty
much a way that a coffee script you can
pass a whole lot of variables to a
function that doesn't necessarily have a
set amount of arguments so what the
splat does is it's going to take you
know one argument as your first argument
your second argument is your third and
however many you pass through it's going
to have it's going to be able to
accommodate for those arguments okay so
that sounds sort of weird but maybe once
we see it in action you'll get a better
idea first I'm going to add some types
of ingredients here to our list so now
right here we're going to have your rice
crab in cucumber we can have seaweed we
can have tuna and then put one more we
can have salmon okay so this is our list
here this is our array what we're going
to be doing with it is we're going to be
passing it through a function and so
it's going to say I like rice the most
crab the second most but i also like and
then it's going to list the rest of them
okay so let's write this function go
down here we can see what this looks
like okay so you're going to write this
just pretty much how you would write a
normal function so we'll just call this
I like and it's going to equal
we're going to pass in notice how we're
going to put one argument which is going
to be rice so it's what you like the
most i'm going to have most second most
and rest and then after the rest i'm
going to put three dots here okay so
what this is actually doing is it saying
the first variable that comes in through
your array here is going to get assigned
to most the second one that comes in is
going to get assigned a second and then
the rest are going to get assigned to
the variable rest as an array so what we
can do here is inside of our function
let's put our arrow so right down here
we can alert we can say quotes I like
and then i'm going to use interpolation
them to do pound brackets and then i'm a
tech most okay the most okay so if we
save this let's actually just look at
our our script at its output over here
so the function is going to say it's
going to create these variables for us
most rest second and most is going to be
equal to the first in arguments okay
second is going to be equal to the
second item in arguments and then rest
is going to be equal to the arguments
that's sliced okay so that you have the
remaining arguments put into rest you
can also see we're returning an alert
that says I like a space the most Edward
is going to be rice the most okay so if
we were to run this function it would
output I like rice the most so let's
continue this on another line I just do
I like pound second
the second most okay and then we can
also say I also enjoy the rest okay we
can save this and now let's take a look
at the script so it's just like before
the most second and then it's going to
output the rest cool so now we just have
to run this function and to do that
we'll just run it like a normal function
call still do I like and then you're
going to pass it the array which is type
and when you pass the theory you want to
do the dot dot ok ok so to illustrate
this code what I'm going to do is I'm
going to drop it into the chai coffee
script section of coffee scripts page so
i don't have to load this onto a page or
anything let's uh copy this code i'm
going to slide this over here and get
rid of what we have ok so in here i'm
just going to paste in our code as you
can see it's already uh you know
rewritten our code here and now we're
going to run this and we're going to see
it's going to First Alert I like rice
the most I like crab the second-most I
also enjoy cucumber seaweed tuna and
salmon ok so let's run this ok alert one
I like rice the most I like crab the
second-most I also enjoy cucumber
seaweed tuna and salmon cool ok so this
is perfect ok so this is working
perfectly as you can see it's accepted
the first one the second one and then
it's added the rest as an array of
course in practical situations you're
probably not just going to be alerting
them like this but now that you have
them saved into these arguments here you
can do anything you want with that data
ok cool well that makes it nice and easy
to throw an array into a function and
have it do something and you don't have
to have the exact amount of arguments
ahead of time or anything like that ok
cool well that's splats in CoffeeScript
if you have any questions or comments
leave become in the video hit us up at
Twitter level up Tut's let's note you're
thinking there should be a lot more
tutorials on the way very soon I
thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
