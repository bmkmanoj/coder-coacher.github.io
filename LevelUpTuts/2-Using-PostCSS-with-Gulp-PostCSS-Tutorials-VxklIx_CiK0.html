of tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be showing you how you can add
post CSS to your gulp workflow now it's
super easy we just have to add a couple
of packages and then we can get going
and more and more packages and just
adding a post CSS to our already
existing workflow using gulp so let's
get started right now so to add
something like post CSS to your workflow
it's really easy to get started with
something like gulp and if you're using
gulp already it's super simple to just
add post CSS and PO CSS packages to
wherever you're working now if you're
not working on gulp the process is super
similar for other build tools like grunt
and whatever you're using in fact on the
post CSS page under the usage section
you can see that there's plug-ins for
our gulp
grunt web pack broccoli brunch ENB and
they even show you the basic example of
using post CSS with something like gulp
or you can even use it with something
like stylus using post to stylus or
there's also a command line tool that
you can use just by installing post CSS
- CLI that you can use to watch files
like you might be used to with like the
sass watch or something like that so for
this example we're gonna be showing you
gulp because it is my build system of
choice at the moment and it's really
nice and easy to get started so let's
head over to sublime text and as you can
see I have this really super basic gulp
file it's just only thing it's requiring
is gulp it's watching some CSS files for
changes and we just have this Styles
task that's looking at styles.css right
here and essentially just returning that
file directly to this destination folder
right here so to add on to this the
first thing we want to do is go ahead
and add a post CSS to this so I can on a
new line require post CSS now I have the
post CSS gulp processor right here so as
you can see we can install it just by
this command npm install
so we can do NPM install - - safe dev
gulp - post CSS and that's going to add
this to our packages file and add this
to our project now we can go ahead and
simply require this post CSS just like
we have any other gulp sort of package
we need so we have post CSS equals
require quotes gulp - post CSS end quote
and and then we're finished that all up
so now we can go ahead and use the post
CSS processor in our gulp task now we
can simply do that simply by having
period pipe post CSS like so and that's
a function so we can have some
parentheses here like that now if we go
ahead and run this gulp test we can run
gulp styles enter and as you can see it
doesn't like it because like I said in
the previous video post CSS is really a
package that allows you to use other
plugins so because of this it says
please provide an array of post CSS
processors so the way that post CSS
works is it requires you to have some
sort of other additional processors so
let's go ahead and grab a one we're
gonna grab this CSS ring here like so
and we can just copy this directly from
the require statement and let's head it
to our command line and type NPM install
- - save - dev and then the package
we're installing is CSS ring here like
so you can it enter now we can add that
to our require statements up here
CSS ring is equal to require CSS ring
which we just installed now one way we
can define what type of processors we're
going to be using is simply by inside of
our task saying something like VAR
processors is equal to and then we can
have this be an array of processors now
the reason you would want to do this
if you're having a whole bunch of
processors it's just gonna be easy to
define them all on a list and then pass
in this variable directly into our
function here so to use one of our
processors like this CSS ring we can
just simply paste this in like so now
other processors like autoprefixer might
have more options that you can define
and in that case as you can see in this
example it's passing this not just the
not just the variable but exactly a
function not just passing this variable
but a function that takes some
parameters so we can say CSS ring here
like so now on processors we can just
pass that directly into the post CSS
function in our gulp file now the CSS
ring all it does is essentially allow
for minifying with source maps however
we're not using any source Maps right
now so it's just going to minify our CSS
now if we go ahead and run gulp Styles
you can see it compiles our stylesheet
and if we check out our new styles that
CSS file you can see it it has in fact
used this processor it's simply by just
minifying this code that's amazing so in
the next video we're gonna show you how
you can forget about prefixes all
together using autoprefixer and then
after that we're gonna show you how you
can use post CSS with your sass or
stylus pre-processors that you're
already using and then after that we're
gonna get into a whole bunch of really
great functionality that comes with post
CSS including my favorite grid system
and rucksack and several other key
features of post CSS and eventually
we're gonna get into how to write your
own post CSS package so a lot of stuff
coming up very soon as always this is
