up tutorials and in the last video we
showed showed you all about shapes in
this video we're gonna be taking that
sort of approach but for images now
images are something that you can work
with really nicely in figma not all
vector design applications handle images
the same way or even a nice elegant ways
but figma offers a lot of really cool
things that some other applications
don't like actually being able to adjust
things like brightness and contrast and
actually slightly manipulating your
images so let's get started with that
right now
okay so in this video we're going to be
working with images now images in figma
are done really well there's only one
complaint I have and that's that you
can't at this moment like at this very
moment drag an image from your browser
into figma now I don't know if that's
going to change
I would hope it would it's not something
you do all the time but it is something
you occasionally do what is here though
however is you could drag an image into
your canvas from the desktop so let me
shoot everything away here and let's go
ahead and grab an image I just have some
stuff sitting on my desktop need to
clean it off and you can see let's go
ahead and just drop this right on our
canvas and as you can see here it is it
shows up and it's full size and all of
its glory it's even in our our layers
over here now first glance this looks
like it's just an image right it looks
like you've just placed an image but if
you look a little bit closer you're
gonna see something kind of interesting
here we're not working with an image
we're working with a shape with an image
as a fill which is an important
distinction to make because we have
access to the shape as it would if this
was a normal shape let's actually zoom
out a little bit here let me zoom out
and move this over so we actually have
this in its own space and maybe let's
make this whole bunch smaller because
yeah it's kind of huge so let's go ahead
and hold shift to make this way smaller
and here we have our image you'll notice
that the fill of the background was
contained within that shape you'll also
notice here that if we adjust things
the border-radius it cuts and masks off
the background itself and that's because
like I said this is a fill this is a
background set on a shape the same way
if you were to take a shape that already
exists and say hey that fill should be
an image so actually let's go ahead and
do that I'm going to create a square I'm
a head are I'm going to click and drag
and make a square here I'm now going to
come to my fill and I'm gonna hit the
minus button this deletes the fill
that's currently there let's set the
plus button and you'll see it brings it
back now we didn't have to delete it
because it doesn't give you an option of
what type of fill on your deletion and
addition you can have multiple fills by
the way and change their blending modes
however we're not doing that at this
very moment what we actually want to do
to change this fill is to click this
square right now it's just the color C 4
C 4 C 4 and you'll notice we have our
basic color properties there's some
really cool stuff going on with colors
here we're not going to talk about right
now but we will talk about a little bit
more when we talking about team stuff or
creating your own personal color library
so what we want to do here is click
where it says solid in the top left and
you'll notice we have some options of
linear radial angular diamond image now
all of these are gradients except for
image or solid obviously so let's go
ahead and click image and you can see by
default it gives us this image what's
cool about this is also by default the
image is set to fill we also have
options to fit and crop and tile now you
won't notice a difference in ton of
these right now with this very
symmetrical image except for with tile
which you can see it's at 250 percent if
we were to increase this percentage size
it's gonna get a lot bigger now this is
something I love about figma many times
when you're working with tiling and
images it's not super obvious exactly
what the sizes and percentages are that
require this to be 100 percent or even
anything here we can see that
very clearly the bounding layer the
bounding outline of the original image
that we're working with is right here
and so because of that we can see hey
this shape is growing at this size and
this is the original here it's also
important to know that when I click away
from this tile that dark background
rectangle with the blue arrows it's
gonna go away so don't worry too much
about that now of course this checkered
pattern is just the base image that it
provides you now that doesn't give you
any additional images to work with and
that doesn't bum me out
I mean Photoshop Illustrator sketch
they'll give you bases to work with in a
lot of situations and how many times do
you actually use those I personally
don't use them I usually maybe download
some simple patterns from simple
patterns dotnet or something
let's go ahead and click Choose image
and I'm going to set this again as I'll
just pick a different image to
differentiate it and you'll notice
because our tile was set to tile at two
hundred and seventeen percent this thing
is huge so let's bring this way way way
way way down okay and as you can see
it's tiling looks super ugly but it's
tiling right we can also change this to
fill in which it sets the largest
property so for instance if this is a
square and we have a rectangle image
here that's wide then the height is
going to fill and then the rest is going
to be centered what's cool about this is
if we grow this shape you'll notice it
remains centered and reveals more and
more of the image while in fact
containing the height if we were do this
the opposite way where this is long and
skinny you'll notice that it does this
the exact opposite way it's just super
nice right this is just doing a lot for
you here in addition we can do fit where
no matter what it fits inside of the
square you'll notice that we now have
transparency in the square so it does
the exact same thing except for without
cropping now we have crop which allows
you to actually have some crop tools
where it's basically acting like a
little bit more of a
visual crop tool right you can see if we
were to do this it's actually it's it
will be showing this image right now but
when we click off it's only going to
show what's inside of the crop okay
let's go ahead and go back to fill
I like fo the most and let's click off
of this now in addition we can also
again change the border radius here any
of that stuff we can add a stroke to
this just like we would any sort of
other shape right this is a big old
stroke on here obviously this is getting
kind of ugly and we could do things like
add a drop shadow or any of that stuff
but let's say we wanted to manipulate
this image well we can add blending
modes on this layer with another fill
let me go ahead and delete this stroke
because it's ugly and we can add a plus
and you can see it automatically for our
second fill it decided to add a linear
gradient now this is kind of useful
because we can take this linear gradient
and if we select this looks like a water
droplet here we can change the blending
mode obviously multiply is not the right
option here but we can say something
like overlay and you can see we're now
getting a much different effect here
where the white is actually adding to
the color and for a non image
manipulation and application I mean this
thing is in Photoshop these are great
tools that you know you're occasionally
going to want to work with images and
manipulate them add filters and blending
modes
I mean CSS has blending modes right now
so why should in a vector application
have a really nice tools for adding
gradient overlays and stuff like that on
top of your images okay so check it out
we have now added two images and two
separate ways we've created our shape
first and that we added it as a fill we
dragged an image to our canvas and saw
how it was the exact same thing as the
other way it just saved us some steps of
having to create that shape of the same
size now lastly let's go ahead and check
out this last one this is going to be
place image which we didn't cover in the
last view but you may have seen and I
believe I briefly mentioned it let's go
ahead and create a shape first actually
better yet let's create a more
interesting shape I'm going to create a
polygon it's going to be
hexagon because there was a little while
when hexagons were like all over every
website ever just because people could
do clip masks and CSS now they just
wanted to start using hexagons and fun
shapes which is cool and what I want to
do here is I want to actually drop in a
photo I'm gonna use a photo of myself
because I have one on my desktop and
typically you saw this kind of thing in
that manner also it's beat sort of these
thumbnails that don't really fit here
and what I want to do is I want to come
in to my shape tools again I'm gonna
click place image now a place image is
really the same thing as dropping an
image onto your canvas except it gives
you an interesting little tool here
which we're going to be covering right
now when I select this photo is a
screenshot for one of my videos and you
can see I can just drop this anywhere I
want now I could click place all which
would actually place as many images as I
selected or I could click and drag to
place or I could just simply click and
it drops it in here just like you would
if I were to drag and drop this from my
desktop it's undo this and let's go
ahead and once more and click the place
tool our place image and let's select
that image again and this time I'm going
to show you what's one of my favorite
features with images I have already
created my shape here and I can hover
over the crosshair over the shape and
you could see this image of me
mid-speech with teeth out kind of thing
is now inside of this shape and you
might be thinking well it added a fill
which was already the shapes fill not a
big deal if we click the white space
next to the square for the C 4 C 4 we
can hit the minus key and delete it in
addition we can click our image here and
we have our image tools now I'm going to
change this instead of Phil going to
select crop now you might be wondering
why well we actually get this access to
pan around now so we can place this
anywhere we'd like you'll notice though
if I get down too far it's actually
ruining the shape of our Pentagon here
and I can move it over here it puts me
in the center a little bit definitely
wish I would have chosen a better photo
no big deal as you
see here I'm going to know that this is
centered inside of the shape click off
of it or at least close this dialogue
and you can now see I have my image here
directly into this shape so as you can
see you're working with images in figmas
pretty darn awesome we have several ways
of getting our image into figma we can
place it with the place image tool we
can drop it in we can drag and drop it
in and we can set it as a background of
a shape the important thing to note here
is that all of these are essentially
shape masked images and this is really
cool if you were doing a web design here
and let's say you wanted a billboard
you'd essentially maybe let's say this
is your header let's do another
rectangle I'm gonna have some overlap
here and this is your background image
let's change us to I have some working
level up Hutt's colors okay so this is
the level of Todd's header here and this
is the billboard background we can now
take the shape and we can add an image
in here and really truly make this a
billboard let's go ahead and grab an
image I'm gonna show you basically use
something that the level up taught site
is doing which I actually designed in
figma here so if we do place image I'm
gonna head to my sites director we're at
the level of Ted sites exist I'm gonna
grab the exact image I'm using here this
was created and designed in figma let's
go to public and let's grab my and let's
find my image here not the one I'm
looking for here we go
background PNG and we can essentially
click to place this anywhere I'm going
to place this right here you'll see this
on the pro page this is a tiling image I
made this to tile so if we select our
image here select tile you can see we
now have this tiling image let's bump up
the size a little bit there we go and
then I'm just going to delete the fill
layer the extra c41 for good measure
don't need it anymore and as you can see
here we have this tiling now background
image and I can really see what this
thing's gonna look like in the site
design now I'd also probably throw an
inner shadow on this about box
our header and obviously you would see a
little bit more but now that we have the
set as a tiling fill you can adjust this
as you see fit and you'll see one of the
reasons why figma is so powerful once we
get into components and constraints and
this kind of technique is going to come
in very handy so as you can see working
with images in figma is really super
easy they give you a lot of tools and
really just you know take a take away
some of the guesswork as to how this
functions because it functions the same
way vectors do so as always this is
