love-love Tut's and today we're going to
be talking about text properties in CSS
now I explained this a little bit at the
beginning of the first video but I just
want to make it sort of clear we are
going to be covering the CSS basics
starting at the very beginning all up
into the brand new you know css3
properties and all the great stuff you
can do with that but we're starting at
the very basics because not everybody
knows CSS so we want to take it from the
from the very beginning until the more
advanced stuff so that way everybody can
really be on the same page or you can
pick up where your skill level starts
off okay
so this is going to be CSS text
formatting and we didn't maybe a little
bit of this in the last lesson if you
remember let's look at our code you can
say we we can see we gave our font our
text a color of white here or paragraph
text as well as our H ones likewise if
we were to change this to something you
know like this ugly blue let's refresh
you know it's going to be blue so that's
a color as you can see here color is
just one of the many text properties
that you can format with CSS so other
things you can do let's say the text
alignment right so our paragraph let's
make our paragraph a different we can
call this the C text align text - align
colon and then you can do a bunch of
things you can use center and let's have
our h1 text align and you can have this
right left or justified so let's go back
here refresh this and you can see our
little tiny header up here in this
corner is just as a text align to the
right and our paragraph is a text align
TD Center really quick I'm just going to
make this let's put this up to like 32
so it's nice and big there we go okay so
this is the text alignment
you know you'd use this in paragraph
four
but I wouldn't necessarily recommend
this to use to position your elements on
a page it's really just for formatting
your paragraph text and stuff like that
okay so let's talk about one more and
called text decoration and this say you
couldn't have things like an underline
or strikethrough so I'm going to
actually bring this h1 to the center as
well just so we can see a little bit
better and I might change this to yellow
just so it's brighter and more obnoxious
so let's have this let's have a
strikethrough through this h1 just
because we feel like it and we can do
text - decoration so just like that text
- decoration and we can have this be
strike we can have this be line through
and that's just going to cross it out
kind of and then our paragraph we're
just going to underline the entire thing
so let's do another text decoration and
then this is just going to be underlined
now let's go back to our chrome here and
you can see we got this is strike
through and this is underlined so this
is just a couple of things that
underline text is often used to signify
a link so you know you may want to be
careful with how you're coloring your
text if it's got an underline you don't
want to be confusing people so that
people might think this text is a link
so that's why it's good to have like a
link color or sort of like a style that
signifies what's your links you want to
make those really obvious to your users
a couple of other ones would be an over
line or which one I really would not
recommend using is blink and I mean
people haven't used that for like I
don't even know forever so just don't I
mean you can use it if you want but you
could also do tech tech text decoration
blink and it's going to make your text
really obnoxious a couple other things
you can do is transform your text and
this is something you might use all the
time because you you know let's say your
users are
typing in their text through a WYSIWYG
editor and you wanted to always look a
certain way or something you want to
have control over that so what you can
do is you can say we'll make this h1
we'll make this whole thing uppercase
the entire thing so we're going to do
text - transform and then the value is
uppercase and for our paragraph we're
going to have this beat um I'll have
this be capitalized which is something I
use a whole lot but it is useful because
what capitalized does is it capitalizes
on the first letter of every single word
so let's go to chrome refresh and you
can see every single word is capitalized
the first letter I mean that'd be useful
for titles or something like that this
is all capitalized because that's just
how I typed it
level up Tut's right here is in all caps
so that's because I use text transform
uppercase and same thing if you were to
have this be lowercase refresh I all
your text is lowercase regardless of
what I type here this can be illustrated
by coming into here in our HTML and I'm
going to type level of Tut's in all caps
we refresh our page you can still see
that this is all lowercase simply
because CSS is transforming that text
itself and it's not using the style of
which you typed it and then another one
you can use is text indent so let's
indent let's give this a class of first
and this is just going to be our first
paragraph and come down here I'm gonna
say first and then I'm going to say text
- indent and then this is going to be
will give this 100 pixels to make it
obvious
and then go back to our chrome and now
you can see the first paragraph is
pushed
indented by 100 pixels now there are
other text properties like line height
and letter spacing you can even use text
shadow but tech shadows something that
really came with css3 and we'll be going
over that later so this is enough to
really get you started transforming your
text with CSS alright this is Scott with
level up hugs once again if you have any
questions please leave a comment the
video is up at Twitter level up tuts let
us know what you're thinking what you
want to see ok great thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
