level of Tut's and today I'm going to
start a new course on a CoffeeScript and
if you don't know about CoffeeScript let
me give you a brief rundown so
CoffeeScript is basically a language
that compiles into JavaScript and what
it does is it makes it really easy to
write code quickly to write code cleanly
and you can basically get a lot done
with very little so it's really cool and
one of the things I really like about it
is some of the elements from like other
languages where indentation really
matters it's there's some more more
strict rules so that most of your code
will look the same so sometimes you jump
into somebody else's JavaScript and
let's say they're not really following
sort of the maintainable JavaScript
philosophy and they're not necessarily
writing the cleanest code well you might
find yourself completely confused even
though their codes functioning correctly
it could produce bugs if you try to edit
it CoffeeScript is really good about
everybody's code is going to look out
really pretty similar so jumping into it
it's going to be a lot easier to
maintain and go into somebody else's
code to have an idea of what's going on
I also just really like how it works
basically as you can see here you're
writing less code and it's outputting
basic JavaScript it's outputting
JavaScript in general
okay so we're going to do in this first
lesson is we're just going to install
CoffeeScript so if you scroll down here
under installation on this is
CoffeeScript org by the way so if you
look down here under installation you
can see the CoffeeScript is available as
I know das utility it the code the core
compiler does not depend on node but can
run on any JavaScript environment or in
the browser see try CoffeeScript above
but to install CoffeeScript on your
computer you first have to install
nodejs and then npm which is node
package manager so I would go into
CoffeeScript org click these two links
and first we're going to install
no js' just download it really quick
select the Mac installer and when this
is done I'll open up this package okay
and just follow these prompts and the
gree agree agree okay install okay so
this is going to install node back in
one second once this is done okay so
that finished and we also need to
install NPM however if you'll notice to
your if you install node.js it says NPM
comes with it so we already have it
awesome cool that's all we need
okay so now we need to install
CoffeeScript so let's go to our terminal
and we're gonna just do sudo npm install
and then we're new - g which is going to
install globally if you don't want to
install it globally then by all means
you don't have to have that - g and then
a coffee script okay now just enter
password okay it's going to go through
get everything and now you can check to
see if coffee scripts been installed if
you actually come down here you can see
what some of the coffee commands are but
if we just do if we just do coffee let's
just type coffee here you can see that
it actually exists if we didn't have
coffee script installed right now if you
typed in coffee it would say coffee
command not found so it's going to
control c out of that cool so now you
have coffee script installed and we're
going to be ready to get started in the
next lesson I'm going to show you how to
compile your coffee code in to
JavaScript and as always if you're new
to level up Tut's just a heads up these
tutorials are free they're all free so
if you have any questions or comments
let us know if we're doing something
totally wrong let us know we just like
to do these in our spare time and we
want to just keep bringing free
tutorials to anybody that wants to
listen to them so as always this is
Scott will level up Tut's and thanks for
watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
