of Tut's and today we're going to take a
look at responsive email templates and
we're going to be doing a newsletter
template for Magento so we can take
advantage of the newsletter function
within Magento here so by default
Magento even throws a little block at
the bottom of your page allowing users
to sign up for your newsletter I think
I'm going to turn those off already but
either way there's a block to allow you
to sign up for a newsletter well you may
have either turned this off like I have
or you left it on and had some people if
your sites live you might have had some
people sign up for your newsletter and
then they would have turned on to this
newsletter subscribers list in fact
looks like here's me a couple of my
emails and John Doe at example.com are
three subscribers to this newsletter so
that's pretty cool
so let's talk about newsletter templates
the way this works is you're going to
create a newsletter template in here
you're gonna add a new template and then
this template you're gonna put your HTML
code here and you're going to put your
CSS here you're gonna give your template
a name a subject to sender from in to
email and you're not going to fill in
the exact content that you want this
newsletter to go out with this is just a
template so you can put your lorem ipsum
texture you can put just like blank
content into this template and then once
we have this in the second part of this
tutorial we'll go over the newsletter
queue and everything like that and how
you can then put your actual content
this way you could make a template once
and reuse it reuse it reuse it and just
change out the content month to month so
to get a template for our HTML email I'm
actually going to be using a responsive
email template from zerp so this is herb
comm slash playground
slash responsive email templates and
this link will be in the comments of the
video or the additional information in
the video and you could just go through
and see which layout you like you can
even check out
demos here's a preview of one of them
and the cool thing about these templates
is they're built to be responsive
already just like your site so it's
gonna look good on a phone it's gonna
look good on the desktop well as good as
an HTML email can look and so the thing
about HTML emails different clients
support HTML email all sorts of
different ways and you can use countless
amount of services to test what those
are going to look like so that's by
using a boilerplate like the serb HTML
email template is good because you know
they've tested it and it's going to look
as good as it can just as long as you
don't go changing it a ton it's it's
gonna look pretty good so a pick
whichever layout fits your optimal
layout and then we can edit it from
there okay
so let's come back to here and there's a
couple of different ones I'm actually
going to pick this in newsletter
template this one this might have been
one we just hit open I can't remember
but as you can see it's sort of a just
click and you click all this stuff
there's even Facebook links and all this
stuff it looks great so let's come back
to this page and I'm just going to
straight up download this click the
download button and some give me a zip
file and I'm gonna throw that in my
desktop and you actually have to bear
with me here
I've recently just absolutely crashed my
computer so I'm starting fresh and
everything is sort of out of out of
sorts so in this newsletter template
I've given you a newsletter on HTML and
your style sheets so it looks like it's
just email that CSS method for this into
my sublime text and we're throw this
newsletter into my sublime text as well
yeah see this is even telling you my
sublime text is unregistered so it's
pretty clear I have a lot of work to do
to get this computer back up to running
so if there's a neat walk eNOS or weird
things I can just blame it on that so
check this out
so we have our CSS and we have our
newsletter template cool let's open this
up in our browser and then we can see
the edits that we make live when we
refresh I'm just gonna grab this
newsletter HTML so right right here in
Chrome
oh it has my name here okay so cool so
here's our template I'm gonna shrink
that down in size a little bit and you
can notice some things about this we
have a body with a background color
white this is some stuff you might want
to you know if you wanted this to be
black or something in our instance I
think white is fine and for the header
we want this header to be the level up
heads purple so I'm actually going to go
right from our home page and grab this
purple color because I actually don't
have this hex value memorized by now Kim
just gonna copy this I'm gonna throw it
in here and then save this refresh okay
so you can see it's just it's just this
little bit right here so we have more
things to change in fact the I think
it's right here coal's - now that's
purple up top here you might be
wondering where this text header text is
this color might be in the CSS I
actually haven't used this ZURB template
in production before but it looks really
good and I'm pretty sure I'll be able to
find it under exactly what it is so this
just says newsletter it's an h6 let's
see where this is getting this right
here you can go down and we can see
exactly where it's giving the color it's
getting it from a line 117 117 here we
are it's giving it this color here I'm
just gonna go straight up white on this
and refresh this okay looking better I'm
gonna replace this with our logo because
you know that's what we want there so
let's go to our newsletter die HTML and
notice how it's giving it an HTTP you
know it's actually linked into this
placeholder that a website that's going
to give you a fake placeholder image I'm
actually going to wait till I get into
Magento to change this link right here
you'll see why in a second we're going
to be using Magento's image editing to
do that and you know what it would say
with any of these images and this text
is all pretty good only thing is here I
want to change some of these buttons
these clickety click buttons I'm gonna
change these to be purple just to sort
of match our our level up huts theme a
little bit okay now I can probably see
things okay so I'm looking for these
aren't media queries by the way I'm
looking for another BTN BTN okay and has
this background color here I'm going to
change it so to be the purple as well as
you can see I'm not doing a whole ton of
crazy stuff this template it's pretty
much like it as is and I'm just gonna
leave it like that for now and so I'm
gonna take this and I'm gonna throw it
into our Magento so let's just straight
up I'm just gonna do a command all and
copy all of the CSS and down here on our
Magento site under template Styles I'm
gonna paste that in there
and then I'm gonna click show/hide
editor since this will give me the HTML
I'm gonna delete that I'm gonna grab all
of this newsletter code every last bit
of it and paste it into here and this is
going to be main level of email hello
from
I can't okay level up okay and it's
under name it's gonna be Scott I'm just
gonna be my email hey so now that we
have all this stuff we can actually
preview and it's gonna generate a
preview here for us looking good you
notice it looks the exact same don't
mind these lines through it it's just
sort of something that happens from
scrolling in their preview but even if
we shrink this down shrinks down
perfectly just like we want it great
perfect okay so let's close that and now
that we know that our templates gonna
look good let's click Save template okay
so when we now have a email template in
the second part of this tutorial I'm
going to show you how to take this
template and set up a newsletter queue
and have this newsletter go out to all
of your customers as always if you have
any questions please leave a comment the
video hits up a Twitter level up tuts as
always this is Scott and thanks for
