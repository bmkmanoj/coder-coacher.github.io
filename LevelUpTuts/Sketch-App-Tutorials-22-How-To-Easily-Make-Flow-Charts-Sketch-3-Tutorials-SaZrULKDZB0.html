up tutorials and today I'm going to show
you how you can make a flowchart easier
than ever using a plug-in for sketch now
this is just going to take essentially a
little bit of a setup a few clicks and
you're to be good to go with a flowchart
that you can custom tweak the style how
you want so let's get going on that
right now so to grab this flowchart
plugin we're actually just going to open
up sketch toolbox where we've been
getting our plugins from this whole time
if you've been following along if you
haven't go ahead and grab sketch toolbox
it's a great application
so this first plug-in on the list at the
time of recording this video is AE
flowchart a plugin that makes it fast
and easy to draw flowcharts and sketch
so this may not be the first one when
you open up this sketch toolbox when
you're watching this but if it isn't
just go ahead and search for flowchart
it's going to show up right here as AE
flowchart okay
so we're going to select this now and
install it so we have here's basically
some simple text where we basically have
a start we have a couple of different
endings which could be whatever text you
would want to say and we have a choice
and several outcomes right so the choice
might be how do you pronounce jiff and
one path could be with the J sound like
jiff and the other path could be with
the G sound like graphics or gif and
that the end result can be whatever
happens because of your decision to
pronounce it that way so let's go ahead
and select our ends and our start just
by holding down shift and selecting them
then we can select plugins a flowchart
and then come to start end this is
basically just going to turn these into
starting and end points just like this
now what we want to do is select our
choice and we can come up again to
plugins a flowchart and what we want to
have this be is a decision or we could
do ctrl shift D okay so this turns this
choice into a decision now we have our
two
outcomes which we can select both of
those and we can then do plug ins a flow
chart and this could be something like a
process so we can select process which
is going to be what we're going to do
after before the ending and now let's
actually make our flow chart so let's go
ahead and select everything on the left
here and if we come up to plug into a
flow chart or if we just simply want to
do ctrl shift C you can see it's drawn a
line in between all of our items here
now again if we want to select from
choice outcome to end just these three
we can do the same thing again ctrl
shift C and you notice it draws the line
off of choice and into the outcomes now
even if there's only one ending let's
say we get rid of these endings here and
we just have one ending now let's say we
want to get rid of these lines here well
they're under AE connections so we will
unlock this and let's find the
connections we want let's click it and
delete it so you can see it puts all of
these in this AE connections folder on
your left here we can either choose to
lock that or not once more now what we
can do is select our outcome and end do
control shift C and then our other
outcome and end ctrl shift C so as you
can see what this plugin is really doing
besides as styling these two look a
specific way like the diamond with the
lines coming out it's essentially just
connecting these nodes for us let's say
you wanted to modify these lines well we
can always come in here and we can
change the color of these we could make
them black we can make them bolder than
they are we could do all sorts of stuff
with them and you can see this one even
has a weird little bit coming out of it
here at the end probably because the
color is a little different so let's
zoom in here and we can take care of
that simply by deleting that extra
little bit here and you could modify
this chart as you need from this point
forward so inside of all of these are
different folders or we essentially just
have a shape with a fill if this
gradient isn't doing it for you you can
just remove it entirely
you can turn off any of the stuff and I
mean you can style these to fit whatever
you're looking for now this text again
is just a text layer so we don't have to
worry about anything other than you know
we can change the font the shadow or
anything like that it's essentially just
drawing these connections to different
nodes for us it's not I think that's
perfect but it could save you a lot of
time having to come up with these shapes
but also just making sure that these
lines are getting drawn in between
everything if you have a whole bunch of
items in your flowchart that you're
making drawing a line between all of
them is going to get really super
tedious after a while especially if you
end up changing anything
so from here so as you can see we easily
and quickly not only created a flowchart
with interesting shapes but we've also
connected the lines and everything like
that
using this ae flowchart plug-in so check
it out let me know if you think if
you're making flowcharts or anything
this is a really super easy way to do it
as always this is Scott with level of
tutorials thanks for watching and we'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
