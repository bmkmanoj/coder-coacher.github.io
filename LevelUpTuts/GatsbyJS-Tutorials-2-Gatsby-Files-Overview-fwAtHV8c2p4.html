up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be diving into the code of what
you get when you first install Gatsby so
we're gonna be going through all of the
folders file structures everything you
need to know about where things are to
get started so let's get going on that
right now
okay so wouldn't we left off in the last
video we had our site installed we're in
our Gatsby developed command and we were
greeted with this on our localhost port
8000 if you don't see this then you need
to go back and watch the first video or
just keep watching because you're not
following along whatever so as you can
see here we have a nice basic site with
two pages in this video we're gonna dive
into the code which is actually running
these sites and see what's going on here
I'm also gonna help it on my inspect
element over here my dev tools so I can
just check out the council while stuff
is going on just in case we have any
bugs so let's go ahead and head to our
code I'm using vs code as the text
editor the theme is material theme pale
Knight you can get it I believe just by
material find it here material theme
right here the most epic theme you can
config to make it look like this to be
pale Knight which is the purple urgent
okay so as you could see here out of the
box this is what we get we have a dot
cache folder which you never touch and
don't need to touch now we have our node
modules folder which is where all of our
installed modules and packages end up
again not something you need to touch
you should be familiar at that by now if
you're running note if this is your
first node site ever or first a working
time working in node J s this is when
you install things into your site like
node packages they end up going in here
and you reference them but we don't need
to actually access this folder and then
we have our public folder which is where
our static site is actually going to be
generated into and
have our source folder our SRC folder
this is where all of the code that we're
going to be editing is going to live
really now next we have our just
standard get ignore which ignores some
stuff the dot cache folder or the node
modules folder the public folder and the
DS store files cool cool cool
okay next we have our gatsby j/s config
which tells us what kind of plugins
we're going to be using as well as the
site title we can configure this to just
say gets B LUT or whatever you want to
name your site okay so as you can see
this is just basic site metadata right
I'm gonna show you where this comes into
play later next we have plugins right
which is we currently have react helmet
for the Gatsby plugin this makes a react
helmet play nicely with the static site
generation so that you don't so that
your actual react helmet is generated
completely there's a lot of different
plugins which we'll go into later tons
and tons and tons of plugins which is
one of the reasons why I guess be so
nice and by default we do have react
helmet in here which we're gonna go over
what that is if you don't know next we
just have a basic license which you can
read on your own time our package lock
file which we don't need to access our
package JSON file which explains
basically all of the dependencies the
scripts everything just sort of about
our package you can see that some of the
stuff like name gatsby starter default
all that sort of stuff author this is
stuff you're gonna want to change but
not something that's like necessary
right I mean if you're just generating a
static site does your package that JSON
really need to have all the correct
information I don't know I would
probably be the last thing I did but you
can do it as you can see here we also
have our dependencies which right now
are just simply gatsby which includes
react by the way so we don't need to
import react separately gatsby link
which is actually very it pretty much is
the react router link so we're using
react router in this whole thing and
we're going to be using gets
the same way we would normally use react
router link okay next we have gets me
plugin react helmet which we mentioned
before and if we scroll down here we
only have one dev dependency which is
prettier which is a formatter
which I typically would install es lint
and a whole bunch of es linting good
stuff on here but for another time
lastly we just simply have a readme
which is the Gatsby starter readme you
can certainly update this to be whatever
you need it to be and the yarn lock file
we're not using yarn on this project and
PM has gotten really good lately if in
version I believe 5.3 so I'm back to
using NPM pretty much all the time so we
could just ignore this yarn lock file
let's dive into our source folder where
you can see we have a layout to folder
as well as a pages folder our pages are
simply just index page two and 404 now
we can see all of these pages in action
right now go to page two here it is if
we were to say hey maybe go to page
three we're gonna see the 404 so here
are those and then we also have our
layout which is basically the main
layout of the site you'll see things
like if we check in to this file here
you'll see things like scroll down here
is our header just as gatsby if we
change this to gatsby lut or whatever
your site name is you'll be able to see
that updating almost instantly in your
browser okay so back to our files and
lastly we just have our indexed at CSS
which you'll have some base CSS now I
intend on using things like styled
components and stuff like that so I
don't know if if there is interest in
setting up your sass or stylist or need
that stuff let me know in the comments
and I can certainly make a video on that
as well no problems there so as you can
see here let's actually dive into the
first most important file which is our
index j/s file and this is the one
within layouts not the one within pages
like I said this is our layout as you
can see we're just importing some of the
basic stuff link helmet
prop types react we're importing our CSS
right here actually so this is actually
what makes our CSS load if we were to
remove import index CSS here you would
see that our base CSS is now gone
we saw some of it which is defined in
the react but our base the CSS needs to
come in with this import indexed at CSS
now we can go over what this means here
because you import a lot of things this
way now check it out
we have our first component which is
simply a header component it's a
stateless functional component here so
we simply just have our standard
function definition here where we have
an error function and it's returning
within parentheses a div a div and h1 a
link inside that h1 and then closing out
those divs now you can see we have some
inline Styles here with react this is
cool I prefer to use things like styled
components or a CSS preprocessor rather
than this style of things but you can
certainly just vanquish this code if you
want start to do things your own way
whatever we will certainly be doing a
little bit of that so this is our header
component scroll down we have our
template wrapper which is doing the same
thing and you know I honestly don't even
prefer this syntax here I like it like
this right so you can see we have our
constant template wrapper which is
bringing in children as a props
outputting the div we have our helmet
which is setting our metadata right then
we have our header component and we have
a div which is basically acting as a
container and outputting our children
that the children of which are going to
be pages now check this out this is part
of the magic of gatsby there's a little
bit of magic here because we don't have
a routing file we're not saying hey page
one go inside of children anywhere
neither are we saying page two however
if we were to make let's actually make a
page three right now by do pages new
file page page - 3 G not cages
dot J s okay now let's turn a copy page
to second page whatever page three okay
third page this is just an example here
okay so what i'm doing here is all i did
was make a new file inside of pages
folder with the title of the file page -
3 j s and i'm exporting this component
as the default component and i'm
exporting this third page as the default
export ok so now all that does is that
makes this page exist if we were to go
to page 2 page 2 exists if we were to
now make this page 3 you see actually
page 3 loads and it loads correctly so
that's awesome right we didn't have to
find any grouting wouldn't have to do
anything like that I mean if you're
building a static site with like 4 pages
you know maybe like a home about contact
that stuff whatever it's as simple as
making 4 files in your pages folder and
then browsing to them I mean that's as
easy as it gets you can instantly see
why this thing is so nice right I mean
this is just a big big big time-saver
you can still end up writing your HTML
as you like it you can add a lot of
dynamic content as you need to and
things generate nicely as you can see my
site here is actually built on Gatsby
fairly recently and again this is just
four pages that's it there's nothing
dynamic here going on it was generated
into static HTML and it's flies this
site's beautiful it loads an under half
a second which is just awesome
and that's even with this video I'm sure
if I didn't have this video this thing
would be up instantaneously ok it's dead
simple to create new pages we just
simply create a new page in the page
folder export it as the default export
and that's it even if you don't know
react you could get by by copying page
to whatever changing h1s you know just
writing straight up HTML the only thing
is here your
your tags become link tags instead of
anchor tags right link - it's a little
bit different than an anchor href
whatever but I mean how tough is this if
you don't know react this is not tough
you just copying and pasting and
changing some stuff right writing
straight up HTML so that's part of the
reason why I like this platform so much
is really it's the low effort right low
effort to get up and running but a ton
of additional complexity if you'd like
it and of course as we keep going we're
going to be adding layers of complexity
and layers of complexity until we
totally know what's happening when and
where and what inside of Gatsby and we
can completely control it and we can
even start bringing in some data from
some api's depending on how we want to
do that okay so this should be a nice
introduction to what's going on in the
file structure and the initial files in
Gatsby as you can see here nothing
really crazy and there's only a handful
of stuff you can even see out of the box
here so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video hit me up at twitter or
facebook a head level up tutorials if
you want to have to level up tutorials
comm forward slash pro you can sign up
to become a level up pro and get a ton
of exclusive content streaming and if
you do it now that is in this is august
4th i believe the price is gonna be
going up in mid august so if you do it
now you're gonna get locked into the
$8.99 a month or $95 a year price
infinitely until you cancel so if you
want to go ahead and do that now it's in
your best interest to do it before the
price jumps up because of all of the new
content coming so thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
