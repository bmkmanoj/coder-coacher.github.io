up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna build our very first react
component now this isn't gonna be
anything fancy it's gonna be a hello
world type example but it's going to be
our first react component and an
introduction for you to write code in
JSX who essentially some HTML inside of
your JavaScript which might feel foreign
at first but this is a nice basic
introduction so it's not going to feel
too scary so let's get started on that
right now okay so we now have our basic
template ready and we're ready to start
writing some JavaScript but first we
need some sort of a container here let's
go ahead and just make a div and I'm
just gonna have this div with an ID and
it's just going to be area this isn't
gonna be anything official we're just
going to be using this div essentially
to render our content and notice how
there's nothing in here and we're not
going to have anything in here now below
this div let's go ahead and write a new
script tag now this time we're going to
do something a little bit different
we're actually gonna be writing
JavaScript here however we want a
certain type of type here now before
html5 used to always have to declare
type in this instance we need to declare
a types of that babel will actually
transform this we could say text -
forward slash babel now instead of our
script we can first write some code
that's going to render this to the dom
we can say react dumb and dumb is in all
caps dot render now we have an open
parenthesis and close parenthesis all
autocomplete for you and we'll wrap that
off with a semicolon now inside of here
is where we're going to be actually
rendering something in fact we're going
to first just put an h1 here I can just
be simply like hello and we can have an
h1 closing tag and now we're going to
have a comma so the first thing we're
passing into this render method is just
an h1 and hello inside of the closing
age-1 now at first you may be thinking
already
well I have HTML inside of a JavaScript
method this is getting weird
okay well it's going to feel a lot more
natural once we get going so don't worry
about it
now we can say document dot get element
by ID now you should be very familiar
with this method is essentially just
grabbing an element on our page based on
this ID we can say area and that's going
to be the end of this so we're passing
into this render method hello and we're
going to tell it to render into this
area so when you're refreshing our page
we should be seeing an h1 inside of this
div now I mentioned react components now
we haven't actually made a component yet
we're essentially just rendering HTML to
our page using javascript so let's head
to our page let's refresh and as you can
see we have hello here notice how in our
HTML we never actually had this hello
it's just inside of this react dumb
render so react is actually taking care
of that rendering here and as you can
see we have hello okay so that is
absolutely nothing thrilling at all
that's you know pretty lame so let's go
ahead and actually make our first react
component and now this react component
itself isn't going to be anything
special in fact it's largely going to be
outputting the same amount of things
however it should give you an idea about
how we're going to be proceeding here
we're going to be essentially building
various components they're going to have
their own properties their own events
and they're gonna be able to talk to
each other through a parent-child
relationships as in the parent is going
to talk to the child and send data down
to the child and not the other way
around of course all of that will make
more sense once we actually have some
code going so let's go ahead and
actually create our first react
component now this is really super easy
to do we can simply say var and let's
give this a name now the convention here
is to use camel case with the first
letter capitalised so we can say say
hello world like so so we're gonna be
having a hello world component and we
can say equals react dot create
eight class and this is going to be
passing inside of this method we're
going to be passing an object so let's
have curly brackets there because that's
what we do with objects and let's open
it up like so now you might be thinking
okay we have a hello world what does
this create class doing well this is
essentially allowing us to use hello
world as a component now what does that
mean well it means we'll be able to do
something like hello world like so and
you if you've used something like
polymer where you add web components or
angular you might be used to the snow
where you can actually define your own
HTML elements so react a credit class is
allowing you to then now use this syntax
however inside of our career class we
need a render function so that we
actually know what to output so we can
say render now remember since this is an
object we need a colon and that we're
going to have a function here so we can
say function like so and now we're going
to return some HTML so let's return and
once more we need parentheses here and
you don't need them but I kind of like
to split this up you could return this
all on one line if you'd like but for
building this out I think it's more
important to see things a little bit
more clearly now we can say one h1 hello
world like so now one thing you'll
notice is if you ever tried to do
something like this with a paragraph tag
and whatever like so racks gonna get mad
about this because we essentially need a
containing wrapper around our render
function so for instance if we were
going to have a h1 and a paragraph in
here you'd want to wrap everything in a
div tag so again this is the second time
now that we are outputting HTML inside
of JavaScript here once we break these
components out into their own files
their own separate component systems and
things like that it's gonna feel very
nice ok so let's head to our
page where we should now for the first
time see hello world output on the
screen when we refresh and as you can
see hello world so basically our hello
world is defined here its render
function as saying to render this h1 and
then on a react dum render we're saying
hello world and insert that into area
now this seems like it was a lot of work
to output an h1 with hello world on the
page but don't worry things are gonna
get really cool really quickly so as
