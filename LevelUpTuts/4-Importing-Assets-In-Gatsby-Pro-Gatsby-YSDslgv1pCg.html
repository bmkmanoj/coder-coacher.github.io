up tutorials and in this video we're to
get started by importing assets into
Gatsby as and we're gonna be bringing in
images and it might be a little bit
different than you're used to in
standard HTML so let's get going
right now in this video I'm gonna be
talking quite a bit about images in
Gatsby now images are something that are
a little bit funny and Gatsby and
they're so maybe different ways that you
could think about doing it but the
absolute best way to work with images
and Gatsby is to import them just like
you are used to importing things in
JavaScript so the first thing I want to
do is go ahead and grab a logo you will
find this logo in the files for this
site however I'm just going to use the
level up tutorials logo I'm going to
move it over here now yours will be in
the course files if you need it if not
you can use any sort of logo whatsoever
now where am i keeping this logo which
is the level up tutorials logo if I can
get my keyboard to behave here it is you
can't see a lot of it because it's on
the purple and well how do we get this
logo to show up in our app where do we
keep the file so one thing is you could
keep the file into your public folder
you could just drag it into your public
folder throw it into maybe the static
folder and access this image just like
you would link to any other image
however that's not necessarily how we
want to do it what we really want to do
is have a web pack which is the bundler
take care of this image so we're going
to take this image and throw it into our
source folder from outside of our source
folder we can make another folder and we
can just call this images and from
inside of here I'm just going to drop
logo SVG now at this point I can come to
my application here and I'm going to
head into the index header so the header
file that we had here that just says it
Gatsby and instead of saying Gatsby I'm
going to come up top where we can import
things now just like any other
JavaScript anything this import path is
going to be where this file is low
if we want to find our file that's
located inside of images logos SVG we're
going to import and then the name of
this comes from simply whatever we would
like to name this right in this case
we're just going to say logo because
it's a logo dot SVG from and then we're
going to have dot dot forward slash and
that puts the sense out of our header
folder our components folder we can do
dot dot forward slash and then find our
images from at this point we can do
forward slash and do logo dot SVG now
you're autocomplete er might not find
this logo exactly but it will actually
work if your path is correct now at this
point we can do a simple counsel log and
see that it imported our logo path
correctly let's head to our application
here let's fire up our inspect element
here I'm gonna head to my Council and
you can see in our console you can see
that we do have our image path which is
located now inside of a static folder
and that logo dot number and then not
SVG this little e Stella is telling us
that well web pack is compiling and
making this image available to us it
gives it a path here and what we can do
with this image path is now use it just
like any other image source so I'm gonna
cut the logo variable we now have this
stored in the variable I'm gonna come
down here to my link and instead of the
word Gatsby I'm gonna replace this with
an image tag the image tag is simply
just going to have an SRC or a source
and that's going to be now equal to the
logo variable that we just imported
notice how it's not a string here and
then we can just say alt level up logo
and this is a self-closing components
that we do need that forward slash okay
let's save this and we should be able to
see our image outputting and it's loud
right here wow that's a big old logo and
this is mostly my fault because the SVG
that we're using is giant here or the
one that I am but it's a nice big logo
for this blog now if we wanted to tune
this up we could certainly do that with
some different style properties and just
hey hey
make this this size in this size but we
are going to be getting quite a bit more
in to style in the upcoming video in the
next video where we talked about using
styled components now you do not have to
use styled components you can use sass
you can use glamour you can use any
other CSS library of your choosing but
in the series we will be using styled
components because I I just happen to
like them quite a bit okay so as you can
see here we now have our image and it's
built into our application we didn't
have to worry about paths not lining up
we didn't even have to worry about paths
at all except for when we linked to
where the image was living here but now
whenever we compile or publish this file
is now going to live inside of public
static and then the logo however right
now it's just being built dynamically
into the app and you might be thinking
well why do I have to do it this way
well this way the bundler and everything
knows where to find your images and it's
going to reduce the amount of requests
that the browser has to make making your
images and your entire app load much
quicker what's amazing about this is
gatsby does some stuff automatically if
your image is less than ten thousand
bytes Gatsby is going to return a data
URI instead of a path and that's for
anything for SVG's JPEGs pings gifts
gifts mp4s WebM mp3 anything right and
that's going to save you extra HTTP
requests again making everything load
much faster so that's one of the reasons
why you would want to do this okay so
these are using images in Gatsby if
you're importing a lot of stuff like
video or anything like that you're going
to want to import it just like this
import it then use the path that it
generates okay so images in Gatsby you
can see are incredibly easy but maybe a
little bit different than you're used to
if you're not used to importing things
in a JavaScript style import okay so as
we continue to grow here this
application is only going to actually
start to look nice because right now
obviously this looks like garbage but
what we're going to be doing here is
getting into some CSS stuff we're
beginning in two style components and
talking a little bit about that as
