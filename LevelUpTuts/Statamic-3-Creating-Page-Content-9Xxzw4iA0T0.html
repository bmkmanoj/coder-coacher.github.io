tots thanks for coming back and checking
on another level up Tut's tutorial in
this tutorial I'm going to continue on
with the static introduction and before
we start as always i want to encourage
folks to follow us on youtube and on
twitter so in this tutorial what i want
to cover is the two methods for how to
create pages so what i'm actually going
to start on is i'm actually going to
know the homepage of this site which is
just you know the default denali theme
but what i want to do is I'm going to
add a page so there's two ways to do
this like I just said one way is you
know if this is your site and you know
this might be the easiest method for you
so you can either you know do this
through to your ftp client or through
sublime if you have SFTP add-on but what
you can do is well we can create a page
and create child pages right through the
file structure because if you remember
is data make is there's no database
right that's the that's the main thing
so everything is based on the files
within the underscore content directory
so what we'll do is I'm going to create
a sub page under the about me so what I
can do actually like the like a really
quick way is because this is you know
that it's going to look the pretty much
the exact same you know I just want to
title and the text what i can do is
really just duplicate this drag it in
here i'm going to rename this and this
is basically when to be the URL so isn't
about been and what this numeric digit
means here is about basically the weight
so the higher
number of the higher it's going to show
up so we can do this duplicate it again
oops you could you know if you did if
you actually skip the number that's
that's okay so now let's go ahead and
look at this is the template that it's
going to use within this folder and what
we're seeing are the two components of a
template file or a Content file and that
is the camel front matter where you can
define variables like we have here and
you know just basic you know system
fields like like these that have the
preceding underscore was just telling
you what page is it going tour which
template is it going to use so this page
is going to be about and and that's good
enough I'm going to just give this a
refresh the page and now we're seeing
about Ben go to it about then on Ben
let's this one still says about me let's
change that one go in here
about Scott I'm showing up first got
showing up second again that's all based
on this number here so what I could do
just to illustrate that is well actually
let me show you this so these um we're
both both have one so i'm going to
refresh this and you're seeing still me
up here because it's one it's the number
and then alpha so it's basically if
you're sorting by name you know you're
gonna see it in the right in the same
order but i was going to change me to
just a further illustrate this and now
she sees yep there we go now we're
seeing school Scott's move over me like
that so that is Method number one and
we're going to go into a lot more detail
about this EML front matter in future
videos once we get into theming so stay
tuned so now let's talk about the way
that our clients would probably add a
Content excuse me so once we're logged
into the control panel which I covered
in another video if you didn't see that
double back and check it out you know so
now I hit pages and we're seeing my
pages that I've created go ahead and
click on this or seeing that too about
so I can even remember things here this
is where I tell again which template to
use if you're wondering where these
templates are coming from I'll show you
real quick so it is coming from the
underscore themes then the theme that
you're using in this case like i said
i'm using just you know vanilla denali
and then templates and now we were
saying that same list repeated and again
once we get into theming and we're going
to create our own theme you know we'll
definitely be
taking into this a lot more but anyway
if you're wondering where this is coming
from or if this list doesn't look right
or something check that directory and
then we're seeing here is the markdown
language and so right let's just save
and publish to get out of this oops
actually I have a permissions issue on
my content folder so I'm just going to
pause real quick and fix that and then
be right back okay thanks for bearing
with me there yeah there I'm still
sorting out some of the permissions
issues so I know that there's some bug
fixes coming in 1.5 which will allow me
to run this the way that I want to above
web group but I've seen a couple folks
having issues assigning the template and
I'm on version like 142 yeah so 15 is
supposed to come out soon so anyway
we'll just sort of roll with those
errors and I'll just fix them as they
come up but anyway so I can make changes
here and you know and save and publish
again I'm just going to create another
no child page this about me go ahead and
get plus or this plus sign here it's a
standard page that's the only content
type that I have set up with the
exception of the default entries because
this is a let's just say junior I'm
gonna let the slug figure itself out age
i'm using mark down again
laughs whatever let's go ahead and see
if this works oops wrong button here we
go so here's my second page or sick I
owned lodge and you know it's following
up third here so let's go ahead and see
what this did to the file structure so
I'm going within my about and now we're
seeing number three been here so yeah
there you go so that's the two ways to
create pages using static thanks a lot
for watching sure to check out some more
of our tutorials coming up soon right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
