tutorials and today we're going to show
you how you can deploy eight your meteor
application to meteors test servers now
this isn't going to give you the option
of really having a full-featured
application online but it's a great way
to build out a demo quickly get it up
show it to people and have it working so
this is maybe a permanent home for your
meteor application but it's not a bad
idea if it's just working with something
that you're going to want to get up
online
so let's get started on deploying right
now so now comes the fun part we have
our basic app you have enough tools to
work with that you can really make some
cool stuff with meteor and you can get
the spark going so that you want to
explore more and learn more before we
take on our intermediate and advanced
meteor series so let's go ahead and
deploy this application to meteor
servers and then way you can pass it off
to friends you can show people you can
make little things and quickly put it up
somewhere now this isn't necessarily at
a place where you want to permanently
store things in fact we'll be showing
you how to do that with a dedicated
virtual in the intermediate series
however it's a great place to simply
just throw your experiments maybe you're
giving a talk maybe you just made
something really cool you want to show
off it's a great place to put it
so let's come to our command line and
you can see I have my meteor server
running I'm actually going to just stop
this you don't have to stop it but I
don't necessarily feel like browsing to
a new tab so it's I'm just going to
continue right here okay we have our
resolutions application I'm in the root
of this so you can see we have our
layout HTML or components resolutions
all that stuff so we're in the root of
our folder structure here now we want to
simply deploy this to meteor servers we
can do that by simply type in meteor
deploy and now we want to give this a
URL it's going to be LUT 4 level up
Todd's resolutions dot meteor
um okay and let's hit enter to instantly
deploy your app to free testing server
enter your email address
great I'm going to enter my email
address okay and since I already have an
account with meteor it's just asking me
to login so I'm going to go ahead and do
so now if you'll notice I actually got
an error the first time I ran this it
said something about not a track temp
directory if you're getting this error
you're on OS X I simply just re ran
meteor deploy the same exact command and
it worked the second time from what I've
read it seems like it's a it's a problem
with a certain version of meteor that
crashes during the build process and
therefore screws everything up if you
rerun this command I just ran it the
second time it worked just fine you'll
notice I get this now serving at HTTP
level up resolutions meteor comm I copy
this head over to my browser I head back
over here let's go to the browser come
here
paste in here and just like that we have
a resolution to application that I
created that you can come in and
actually you should be able to use this
right now and you can just mess around
with it you'll be able to log in and
things like that so check it out if
you're going to be pushing up something
go ahead and give it a unique URL here
because obviously we can't all be lut
resolutions meteor com but it's a great
little test server it's nice way to see
the fruits of your labor online and
things that you can share with other
people you want to say hey I just built
this really cool thing check it out here
it is cool so that's deploying to meteor
servers with meteor deploy as always
this is Scott what level of tutorials if
you have any questions or comments leave
a comment of the video or kiss upend
Twitter Facebook pretty much anything we
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
