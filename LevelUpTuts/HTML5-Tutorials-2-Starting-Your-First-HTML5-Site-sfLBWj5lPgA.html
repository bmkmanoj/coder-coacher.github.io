of Tut's and today we're going to be
moving on to creating your first html5
site and if you used HTML before this
code right here might look a little
familiar to you we have just a doctype
and it's given the type of doctype it is
we're using of HTML 4.01 and and
basically this is going to look pretty
familiar because this is probably how
you made websites I mean especially with
HTML right and then we have things like
our meta tags our script in our style
sheets that sort of stuff and then we
have our body tags like normal so this
is all looking pretty normal I mean
there's nothing crazy here right in fact
I actually just grabbed this you know
from some project building site I don't
really have a site going here I'm
actually going to get rid of some of
this stuff here just so we can keep this
bare-bones
ok and I'm going to get rid of the
comment on the script so we can see how
exactly this stuff is going to change so
how do we make this into an html5
document well if you recall you know
with the doctype up here all we actually
have to do declare an html5 doctype is
just do doctype HTML so it's exclamation
point doc type in all caps then HTML so
this is letting your browser know to run
in standards mode for html5 this is the
html5 doctype couldn't get any easier
than that well what next well we don't
really need this Lang Inc but we can
leave it in there no big deal and the
next thing we want to do is we want to
define its character set well in here
your HTML for version we had to use this
http-equiv content type content
text/html with html5 you really just
need to declare the character set here
by saying medic character set and then
utf-8 and we can do that just like this
here so this is our character set meta
character set and I'm just going to get
rid of these meta keywords for now
because they're just getting in the way
and our title tag will be
our html5 site so title is not changing
that's the same as it's always been but
what about these odds
you know these link types I'm late rid
of this favicon one as well here so now
we just have a link that's hooking up
your stylesheet and we have our script
tag that's hooking up our JavaScript
well in the past we've had to do type
equals text JavaScript then the source
and then it's JavaScript well I mean it
makes sense that if we're using a script
tag of since javascript is the primary
scripting language on the web why
wouldn't this always be text JavaScript
so with html5 we can completely omit
that and now we just have to say script
and then link it with the source and the
same thing is with this stylesheet here
we also don't have to specify anything
other than the relationship and then the
href so we can get rid of media screen'
we can get rid of type text/css just
like this and this is it so it's nice
and bare-bones here so this is our html5
site now if you'll notice we can put
anything in the body here and they could
be just normal divs
you know just normal everything right
and this is going to be rendering just
perfect fact let's throw this open in a
browser right now so you can see it in
action and it's just going to be a
pretty standard HTML site here all right
so here we have it here's our page and
it's nothing crazy
but your browser now knows that this is
using html5 and everything should be all
good so as you can see it's really not
hard to get started with html5 there's
nothing crazy there's nothing stopping
you so by all means start writing some
HTML and all you have to do is specify
doctype HTML and bam you know it's html5
this is the new doctype it's super easy
so you may be surprised but this is all
we need to start an html5 site and this
is your first
html5 site done perfect well this was
nice and short
you know these videos might be a little
short in being here because there's a
lot of little things but you know
there's nothing crazy here so in the
next video we're going to start going
over some of the new elements and we're
going to be introducing you to some of
the elements are going to be using quite
frequently and we're not going to go
into all the details both the basic
usage of them and then later on we're
going to come back and show you all the
cool usages of everything so as always
this is Scott with LevelUp Tut's if you
have any questions or comments leave it
come out the video or hit us up at
Twitter LevelUp tubs are on facebook or
pretty much anywhere we love hearing
from you you know we can't always get to
your questions because like I said this
is not our full-time gig this is a app
you know after working weekend's thing
so by all means please ask away and if
community members can help you enter
that that's really appreciated but we
cannot get to all the questions but we
do love hearing from you so as always
thanks for watching this is Scott and
