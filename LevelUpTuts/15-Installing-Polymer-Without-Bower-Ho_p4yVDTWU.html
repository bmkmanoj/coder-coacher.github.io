up tutorials and in this video I'm going
to show you how you can add polymer to
an already existing site and maybe one
that's not using Bower we're gonna take
a different approach we're actually
download the library and get it set up
as if we were just using a project that
already had its own library manager or
maybe you're just not using that and you
wanted to get something going quickly
and you weren't planning on using Bower
so let's get started by quickly and
easily adding polymer to your existing
website here I have a new project that
is basically just downloaded from html5
boilerplate and I have a whole lot of
code here where it's just real basic
HTML and stuff but let's say this is a
project were using maybe it's a new
project whatever but we don't want to
add Bower to this project because it's
not something that we plan on using in
this codebase so let's talk about how we
can download and install polymer so if
we want to head to the polymer project
org this is polymer - project org and
now we can come to get started and from
here we can download the zip file and if
you scroll down here you can see that
you can install it from this zip file so
let's go ahead and grab that now just by
selecting this it'll take you to the
link where we can download this zip now
it's going to just give us a zip with
the polymer project that we need in here
and what that gives you is this
components folder so let's come to my
without Bower project and I can just
throw this components into our project
here and you'll see that inside of this
components folder we have a bower
components and if you'd like we can go
ahead and just throw this into our
project like so get rid of this
components file folder itself and if
you're not using bower at all you can go
ahead and simply just remove polymer and
web components from this folder here and
we can get rid of that of course we're
going to be following this tutorials
you're gonna want to make sure that your
paths are correct when we're referencing
the files that we go to reference later
on and also if you plan on put
chillie using bauer later you can always
leave these in that bower components
folder and then when you start to use
Bower the Bower package manager will
just go ahead and use that folder and
add things to it so you don't have to
remove them from that and you can keep
them pretty much wherever you'd like as
long as when you are using them in your
project you're referencing those paths
correctly okay so if you don't want to
use Bower you can just straight up
download the Zips
and all we need is this polymer folder
and the web components folder and that's
going to contain everything that we need
to get running with polymer in the next
video we're going to start throwing
polymer onto our project and using an
element for the first time using this
new polymer 1.0 release so as always
this is Scott with level of tutorial so
if you have any questions or comments
they become in the video or hit us about
Twitter or Facebook at level up tuts
we love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
