up tuts and we installed PrestaShop in
the last video now for this video what I
want to do is give you a tour of the
front and back end of PrestaShop I'm
going to show you the front end what it
looks like after you've installed with
all of the sample data and everything
and then I show you the back end where
you can go to start configuring your
site this is going to be a brief
overview however we're going to cover
each topic individually in later videos
so keep watching I'm going to show you
that now so now that we've installed
PrestaShop we have like PrestaShop calls
our front office and our back office as
you saw in the last video we click both
of those links and we have the front end
of our store which is what customers are
going to see and we have the back office
of our store which is where you're going
to be managing all of your content where
you're going to be publishing your
product where you're going to be
determining how this site looks it's
also where you manage your orders pretty
much where you handle all of the
configuration and the day-to-day process
of the store let's take a look at the
front end of the store first and just
see what you're giving basically out of
the box here we have this default theme
where you have a promotional banner up
top here an area for your logo search
functionality our standard cart type
functionality and let's come back to the
homepage here main navigation with some
categories with some subcategories we
have a feature where we have some sales
and then some products where we can
choose between new arrivals popular
bestsellers that type of thing and then
some more category call-outs some social
integration newsletter integration and
then our footer content which has things
like about the store and some more
social items down here now your site
isn't limited to look like this you can
find themes online to download and we'll
go over that in another video however
for these first few videos we're just
going to be using this default theme
here let's click on a product and see
what it looks like ok we have the main
image and several other supporting
images that are in a little carousel
here you can't really tell because
there's only four images but if we were
to have five images
when you click this next button you get
the next one this view larger button
brings up the image in a lightbox
where you can move between them and we
can even share out this product on a
Twitter Facebook Google+ or Pinterest
print it or send it to a friend this
basic functionality rivals what you'd
see in most online stores and it's even
much nicer than many other free
ecommerce platforms so check it out it's
pretty much everything you'd want on a
product page ok we're not going to go
through the whole ordering process now
we'll go over that in another video so
let's head over to the back-office so
let's take a look at what we have here
on our left is where your main
navigation is going to be up top we have
some quick access items we can look at
orders placed we can look at new
customers we can look at latest messages
and we can even see things like
merchants expertise where they give you
badges for doing things like completing
your profile if you need help at any
point there's this lifesaver over here
with the words help if you open this in
a new tab you can see that it takes you
to some administrative area help
documents ok let's check out what's
going on here in our main navigation our
dashboard is simply this page that we
land on here with this basic information
next we have catalog now catalog is
where we're going to manage all of our
product items when you see when we enter
this or we hover over it it enters this
submenu where we have options for
products categories monitoring product
attributes product features manufacturer
snippets tags and attachments we'll go
over exactly what those are in a little
bit but as you can probably guess
products which is your main landing page
for categories is a listing of all your
products where you can search or filter
them now next up is orders and like the
name suggests it's going to be the
orders that are placed on your site you
can see that they have the reference ID
they have where it's going the customer
the total the payment type and we even
have the status whether it's canceled
payment error awaiting check awaiting
Bank wire and we can even look at things
like invoices merchant
returns delivery slips credit slips
statuses and order messages here as well
next we have customers any time a
customer creates an account on your
website it's going to add them to this
list you can see that I created an
account for myself already Scott at
level up tuts just for fun and with
these options here you can see that the
account is enabled but is not subscribed
to the newsletter up top here is some
facts about your customers like they are
100% male at this time now we also have
things like addresses groups of
customers shopping carts which is what
your customers have in their cart
currently customer service contacts and
titles we're going to be going over
customers in a complete video of its own
now next we have price rules and that's
where you create things like coupons or
sales next we have modules which is
where you can add on to your site by
searching in their own interface here
for different types of plugins or themes
now you can even look specifically at
payment type modules just by clicking on
payment here and you can see which ones
like this authorize net module which
ones are the official module now we have
shipping information which is going to
show you your carriers and your types of
shipping you can also modify your
preferences here next we have
localization which is as you can
probably guess where you manage your
localization settings for your users of
your site things like weight unit being
pounds distance in miles and things of
that nature if you're in the United
States these defaults that you have set
up here with your default languages
English are probably going to be good
for you now next we have preferences
which is some things for the site itself
where you can modify the theme you can
choose your theme here modify settings
for orders products customers SEO you
can do things with the CMS of the site
where you have basic pages that aren't
attached to products now we also have
advanced parameters which is things like
CSV import database backup logs and web
services and then administration which
is where your going to modify the
settings for the administers of your
site whether they're going to be users
with specific permissions and change
things like your quick access links
and lastly we have stats which is simply
where you can see the stats of your
website things like what people are
searching for what people have purchased
pretty much these sort of data that
you're going to want to get out of your
site you can go ahead and search for and
then you can even save your reports so
as you can see this is the back office
of PrestaShop if you're a store manager
or stone owner be spending a lot of time
here either modifying your settings or
adding products or even just seeing what
your statistics are who's buying what
and what's happening okay so in the next
video we're going to get started
actually creating some products so keep
watching and we're going to start
getting up to speed with how you can get
your site running in no time as always
this is Scott with LevelUp Tut's if you

comment of the video or hit us up at
twitter or facebook at LevelUp Tut's we
