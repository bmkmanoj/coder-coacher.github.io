love tutorials and today I'm gonna be
starting a new series that's going to
continue on for a little bit called how
to build a blog now this is a series
designed for beginners anybody who's new
to not only web development but working
in the web and you don't even have to be
interested in necessarily web
development for some of these videos
right like if you just want to create
your own blog this is a great starting
point because this very first video that
we're going to do is called level one
the easiest possible way to build a blog
so this very first video is going to be
talking about what my recommendation is
for the easiest possible way to get up
and running with a blog now in addition
to that I'm gonna be going through some
pros and cons about any of these
solutions that we'd go to cover and as
we go on from level 1 to level 2 we're
going to be taking this through some
more in-depth blogs that give you a
little bit more flexibility but require
a little bit more work and we're going
to keep on progressing on that timeline
until we get into some vlogs that are
very highly customizable but a little
bit more technical so you can follow
along and start off small if you like
and in this next video we're going to
show you the easiest possible way to
build a blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
