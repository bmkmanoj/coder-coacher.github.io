up tutorials in this video we're going
to be doing an introduction to redux I'm
gonna be telling you a little bit about
what Redux is and why you'd even want to
use it so let's get going now okay so
before we get started actually coding
anything I'm going to talk a little bit
about the what and why's of Redux and
specifically in relation to working in
react now Redux as it declares here is a
predictable state container for
JavaScript apps and well that kind of
makes sense right it contains your state
right
it doesn't necessarily give the easiest
picture of Redux which is really that
Redux is a big object with your
application state and some concepts that
confuse people are the implementation of
how you actually manage that state
whether it's via jargony words like
reducers and actions and stuff like that
all of which we're going to be covering
and making to be super simple or whether
it's the usage as an what goes into
Redux itself and what goes into
components states are where do you draw
the line there so there's a lot of
things with Redux kit can make it a bit
of a confusing trip to learn and so
while I hope to make some of these
things much more simple here what you
want to do is head to Redux EAS org and
kind of just leave this page open all
the time because the Redux documentation
is excellent and there's a lot of stuff
here for how small this library is but
if you get through it
you're going to have a good time really
just grasping Redux so one of the
advantages of Redux is while it's only
two kilobytes so it's a really really
small package and you don't have to
worry about it adding a lot of bloat to
your project and the benefits it
provides are going to definitely
outweigh anything there so let's check
out Redux in action here I have a Redux
on the level up tutorial site and you
can see through the Redux dev tools
which is
definitely one of the most excellent
aspects of redux is the usage of these
specific redux dev tools we can see that
we have some stuff here and some stuff
here well it says nothing if states are
equal right now but let's take a look
when I click the state tab you can get
basically what is an object or a tree of
the state of my entire application
what's cool here is I have things like
the check out is check out open false
right the orders the playlists the
products the tutorials and some of the
stuff is empty for instance products is
empty because we're not at any
particular product page
however tutorials is already loaded and
if we check this out is all of the
tutorial information that eventually
gets loaded here so in my implementation
of redux I'm actually using Redux to
load up the tutorials and the data of
the state as well as to determine things
like the active tutorial I'm also using
Redux to determine some various things
about the user such as the users
information the logging in state if
they're currently logging in if the user
is currently loaded or if the login
window itself is open so a lot of stuff
can go into redux and some stuff makes
more sense than others for instance you
can see we have a simple nav which is
set to false if I go into mobile here
and I click the menu you can see our nav
has now set to true now many times you
might think this kind of simple toggle
of toggling a navigation menu doesn't
need to be in a global state that should
be maybe in the component state itself
however I want outside events to be able
to trigger and change this navigation
perhaps when doing something on an
outside component it will affect this
navigation and close it or open it
itself and in that case being able to
use and manipulate and modify state
outside of the component becomes much
easier when using something like redux
as opposed to
I think to pass in a method into props
and have to deal with the location of
where that toggle is living so we'll get
into more of the specifics of when to
use redux and when to use application of
react state later on however as you can
see here we're starting quite a bit of
stuff into our redux tour and what's
great about that is we can trigger and
change any of this data from any point
in our application and we can access any
of this data from any point in our
application using some simple tools and
the best part is everything stays
organized everything has a nice flow
because see here we have what are called
our actions and and this shows you when
everything it takes place so at any
given point if I wanted to close the nav
I could just jump to that action and you
can see my navigation closes so
everything becomes much more organized
and you have a big handle on the global
state of your application now all of
these things look nice and it's easy for
me to say that this is nice however the
benefits really come once you start
migrating a bunch of stuff to redux and
really seeing it in action but before we
get learning how a Redux works within
react I'm going to take some videos here
to really Express the core concepts of
redux so that you get it in a very basic
sense before we move on to building
anything sort of complex like this so we
use Redux because it makes the state of
our application much easier to manage
and much easier to understand the redux
isn't anything more than a system for
setting that state and updating that
state and being able to control that
state there are numerous benefits to
using redux more than this that you'll
go into as we keep going however all of
them outweigh the criticisms which may
be that the code is too verbose and
stuff like that so we're gonna be
talking a little bit about why you use
the syntax you use and why boilerplate
isn't an issue and why you can actually
use tools to reduce that boilerplate if
it's a problem for you so let's get
fired up in the next
as we add Redux to a blank create react
app and get going or writing some very
basic redux code as always if you want
to complete this series and learn redux
inside of react that as absolute basics
and really have a good handle on what
you're doing as you grow to have more
and more advanced state then head on
over to level up tutorials comm forward
slash store and purchase react and redux
for everyone where you can learn Redux
completely fully like as a beginner and
gain clarity on some of these things
that have always been maybe a little bit
difficult to learn or mysterious so
thanks so much for watching ml see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
