up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you issue tracking and
milestones in get lab cee now issues and
milestones are a great way to keep track
of all of the issues that are going on
with your site and attach them to
various release schedules so let's
consider on that right now okay so now
that we've gone over some of the tools
that are allowed and administrative
stuff let's go ahead and talk about just
sort of what milestones issues and stuff
like that we now have available within
gitlab so let's go and head back to the
home and i'm going to select the just
administrator test project that we have
here and you'll notice we have one
single commits one branch and no tags no
change log no license
none of this stuff but what we do have
is if we head over to our sidebar you
can see we have an issue and we also
have a milestone now a milestone is just
this release candidate and you can see
it doesn't have a whole ton of
information if we select it we can see
that it's has 24 days remaining before
our deadline it has one issue one open
zero closed no merge requests just one
participant which is myself and no
labels now what's great about these
milestones is that we don't have to head
to issues and then attach an issue to
this milestone directly from here we can
just create a new issue and it's
automatically having it set to be
attached to this release candidate so I
can simply just say fix bug we're app
doesn't work stuff is broken obviously
you'll want better messages than this
but as you can see we have a nice little
edit screen here you can see it in
preview the reason why is because we
have access to markdown me space here
there we go you can see that we have
access to this and markdown and it's
creating our issues just like what we'd
expect so you can even get some markdown
it's down here Steph is broken and we
can say till they stop working okay so
nothing crazy here if you're used
markdown before this should all be sort
of standard fare but that's nice that we
have this in our issue queue that we can
quickly and easily write markdown
without having to do any configuration
and if you want if you want to do this
in like a big fullscreen environment you
can do this in full-screen and make this
your full priority writing this issue
not a huge feature but definitely
something that's pretty cool here and
now we can come down and select an
assignee I'm going to sign this to
myself so you can just click assign me
however if I wanted to assign it to
Cortney I could assign it to her as well
just by selecting her from this
drop-down now she's not going to be
fixing this I'll leave this as me and
you'll notice we have no labels now this
is going to be a bug and I would like
this to have a label so let's click
create a new label what's great about
this is it opens it up in a new tab so
we can assign this a color by selecting
red and then we can say bug you could
say bugs are broken stuff this
description is in show up unless you're
checking out what bug is if you need
more sort of descriptors for a tag or a
label itself
what's cool about is they have all these
default colors that are gonna look nice
but if you don't want a nice just
selected and you have access to a full
color wheel let's say we want this to
just be a little bit more subtle of a
red let's come in here something like
this not so saturated perfect okay let's
go ahead and click create label okay so
we now have this bug label that looks
just like this we can delete it you can
subscribe to those bugs whatever now the
only bummer here is is that if we come
back to our issue it still says we have
no labels which isn't ideal obviously
you'd want this to auto update when you
actually have one but it's no big deal
and you could even move this to a
different project from this screen if
you wanted but since we're already in a
milestone of this particular project we
can just click Submit issue
and you can see we now have this issue
now the issue page is really super nice
because not only can you leave comments
on it you can upvote downvote issues you
can add emoji reactions but let's say
this is you know something that's near
and dear to my heart I can add a heart
give it a thumbs up and now all the
sudden anybody looking at this is gonna
say hey this issue seems like it's a
little bit more important we can click
Edit here and let's scroll down and now
we can add our bug label Save Changes
and you see that we now have this update
that says 'add mr. added the bug label
you can come in here and say needs more
code has a issue we can click comment
you can see the administrator has listed
this on the branch you'll notice it says
master because that's the branch that
this issue is on if this was going to be
on a different branch you could always
select new branch here and what it does
is actually created a branch for us
it created a branch that is basically
based off of this issue and from here
you could have a merge request you could
pull this particular branch and you
could get going on that issue itself so
let's head back to our issues you'll
notice on the screen we can see now that
this issue as three comments one up vote
and it was created by the master or the
administrator and it has the broken
stuff bug tag right here we can see just
by hovering over that you know so
basically we have a bug where stuff
doesn't work now from here you could
actually say let's go ahead and change
the status to close in an update issue
or we could come in here and simply come
down and add a new comment we could say
I added the code and wrote comment and
closed issue so now the issue has been
closed and they comment is here I mean
all of this stuff should seem like
pretty standard fare if you're used to
github but it's nice to know that
system like this has this baked in so
easily now you can see it has closed if
we head back to issues we only have one
open issue to an all one enclosed we can
come now to our milestones and see
something new and fancy we know our 50%
complete for the release candidate and
that's awesome because we have this nice
visual indicator you can create all
these different issues and bugs and
features and all sorts of stuff for your
projects and you're gonna have a nice
visual indicator where you are for
different milestones or releases so if
you have a ton of issues this gets
really nice because you can filter by
milestones you can filter by labels you
can filter by assignee or author you can
even filter by name by searching up here
and you can even check it out if we open
this in a new tab we have an XML feed of
the issues so I mean this is all really
super nice and like I said this is your
own system so you can do anything you
want with this you can build this
however you want you can assign it
whatever you want to people either way
this is milestones and issues within
gitlab this is a great way to track all
of your issues and like I said if you're
used to using issue trackers on other
things this should seem like standard
fare but it's nice that there's a lot of
great handy features in here so as
