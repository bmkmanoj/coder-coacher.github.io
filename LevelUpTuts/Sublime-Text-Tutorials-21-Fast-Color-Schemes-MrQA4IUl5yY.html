up tutorials and today I'm gonna show
you how you can quickly and easily
transform your sublime text color scheme
using a package called color sublime now
this makes it really nice and simple to
not only quickly change your color
scheme but it also makes it easy to find
new ones without having to download them
and and browse through your folder
structure or something like that so
let's get into it right now so color
schemes are a topic that come up all the
time because I like many other people
change it all the time so frequently
when you watch these videos you might
see a different color scheme and I like
to try out new ones and just sort of see
how they feel for a little bit and then
if it's something I like I'll maybe
adopt it for a bit longer so it's always
been a bit of a pain to download a color
scheme or look through the repository in
the package manager for color schemes
now there's a really nice and simple way
of installing and using color schemes
with colors sublime so as you can see
here on color sublime dot-com I'll put
this link in the description you have
all these different previews even and it
starts off and you can see there's over
21 pages of different color schemes that
are in color sublime and as you can see
you get little previews and they're not
just image previews they're actually
code previews that you can actually type
in here and see what things look like
but it also gives you a great idea of
how it'll feel to use maybe paging up
and down and seeing how it highlights
things how it highlights the line so
let's go ahead and install color sublime
let's head over to sublime text and I'm
just gonna open up package control on
Mac its command shift P I believe on
Windows it should be ctrl shift P if you
have package control installed if not
head over to the level up test videos on
installing package control so now we can
type install and we're going to install
a package and that's going to be color
sublime so if you just start typing it
out it's pretty much the only one here
after you get 2 colors sub so let's just
hit enter okay so now color sublime is
officially installed let's try adding
and setting a new color scheme
so we can just enter our package control
once more and just do a color sublime
and you'll notice that the first option
is install theme so let's click install
themes and what its gonna do is it's
gonna give you a whole list what's great
about this list is that as you go down
you're getting live previews and this is
probably my favorite part about color
sublime because you don't have to
install it to see what it looks like and
you don't have to go there website to
see those previews you can actually see
it live in your code what it's looking
like at this very moment so as you can
see you can page down here and to see
some ones that you might like or not
like I've actually been using one called
wild cherry a bunch and it actually fits
this level up tuts purple sort of scheme
here so I'm gonna go ahead and search
for wild cherry which I have already and
I'm going to hit enter now that I've hit
enter while cherry is my color scheme
let's go ahead and add another one so by
seeing a color sublime you'll see we
also have more color schemes to install
and let's add this 3024 okay so now one
thing to note is that when we come back
into package control if we type color
sublime you'll notice that the only
thing you can do with color sublime is
browse and install themes to set your
themes you're still gonna want to do
sublime text preferences color scheme
and then you'll see your current schemes
under this user folder so now if we
wanted to go back to wild cherry it's
just right here and we can just select
it here perfect so in no time I've
previewed a ton of themes I've installed
a couple of new themes and I've been
able to change it nice and easily
so that is color sublime it's one of my
favorite new extensions for visually
modifying sublime text so check it out
and post in the comments if there's any
themes or color schemes in particular
you are going nuts over if there's any
color schemes that you just can't stop
using that you found maybe on the color
sublime or elsewhere let everybody know
what you're using i personally am really
into this wild cherry even though it's
like
super purple but it looks really nice to
me so as always this is Scott with level
up tutorials if you have any questions
or comments leave a comment the video
hurt us up at Twitter or Facebook we
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
