loved huts and today I'm going to be
showing you the foundation 5ui kit for
sketch 3 now if you're not familiar with
foundation it's basically like bootstrap
or any other front-end framework brings
you a grid along with some basic visual
styles and all sorts of great utilities
and awesomely enough there has been a
foundation 5 sketch UI kit already made
that features all of this the foundation
elements that you can use in your
project similar to how we have the iOS
UI kit so check it out it's going to
help you really quickly prototype
applications especially if you're using
foundation 5 in that application so to
go ahead and get this UI kit you don't
want to go ahead to stephen ways github
page here I have the repo I'll post a
link in the video description you can
just come here and download it but you
can see what it includes it pretty much
just includes this dot sketch file with
some images and readme but it has a
whole bunch of stuff in here from
buttons to typography to system things
so let's go ahead and download this
entire entire package here so let's go
click download zip I'm going to unzip
this and open up here and you can see we
have just this sketch file the only
thing you really need here is some
images but you don't necessarily even
need those because those are really just
to to give you examples of some of these
UI elements so let's go ahead and double
click this to open it okay so it's great
they already have it broken into several
different pages for us and if you zoom
out of this page you can see that what
we have here is several different
artboards already ready for us there's a
desktop HD a desktop a tablet portrait
and a mobile portrait by examining these
we can see that the mobile portrait is
320 by 1024 the tablet is 768 by 1024
the desktop is 1024 by 1024 and the HD
is
14:40 by 1024 so now these are our basic
sort of responsive web sizes that we can
get up and running with it's even great
that we could use this as a jumping-off
point for any project that we wanted to
and if you wanted to create another page
you could always just duplicate this
page itself now you might be wondering
where some of the UI elements are and we
of course could insert symbol and then
see all of the the goodness in here we
could come and grab some buttons let's
say we want to grab a basic large alert
button we have right here perfect you
could do it that way
or if you want to actually browse the UI
elements on their own they're actually
in a separate page here so we're going
to click this drop down and move on from
the Welcome page and go to the symbols
page now in here we can just see how
excellently this is organized he really
did a great job with this UI kit because
we have everything from the navigational
elements are in one artboard you can see
exactly how they work we have the top
bar dropdowns this this sort of we have
the filter we have pagination and over
here we have media so you have like a
slideshow you have another just text
slideshow we have some images maybe if
you're doing thumbnails and we have form
elements that you can just have here we
have form elements with invalid entries
I mean this is really really complete
now we can keep going over here and we
have our buttons we have all of our
buttons that way if you want to know
what you're getting into before you drop
in one of these symbols you can always
come in here and check to see what these
buttons actually look like now over here
we have typography styles and keep in
mind that these are the base styles from
foundation 5 so so the idea is that you
can drop these elements into your page
to create a mock-up nice and easy and
then you can then take those from there
and start designing with these elements
and modifying them and this way it would
action similar Tillie if you were like
developing a website using foundation
now you wouldn't sometimes you would
baby just use the foundation but chances
are if you're building a custom website
for somebody you're not just going to
use the foundation base styles and you
would take those foundation base styles
and build upon it like a foundation and
this works the exact same way only
within sketch and not within code so we
have all of our textiles here and next
we have some system stuff this is just
some extra things that you can quickly
mock up we have like a little browser
window and we have a cursor and maybe
like a click zone or something in a hand
so we have at our disposal all sorts of
good good tools to get us going and we
can start building a website it's
fantastic so let's come back to our
welcome page let's come to our desktop
and let's drop in a symbol really quick
I'm going to drop in from navigation the
basic top bar here we can click that now
this brings us our top bar which we can
now say that we want this top bar to not
be a thousand we want it to be 1024
because that was the width of our our
box okay and we want this to start at
the x position of 0 and the y position
of 0 and boom let's zoom in here we now
have this top bar at the top of our page
and now let's say we wanted to insert a
let's say another symbol here we can go
ahead and throw in a lightbox at photo
lightbox and perfectly we have this here
let's click and drag this over great and
so now you can see just how easy this is
to just start throwing in objects and
start building out your site using
foundation and it's going to be
especially useful if you're used to
already working with foundation because
all of the things that you're used to
being able to drop in with your code are
just right here for quick and easy
mock-ups so awesome
download this sketch UI kit I'm going to
post
the link in the description let me know
what you think of it and I'm sure
Stephen would love it too if you shot
him a message saying how much you
enjoyed using his kid I personally find
it to be just immensely useful so check
it out let me know what you think as
always this has got what level of Tut's
if you have any questions or comments
