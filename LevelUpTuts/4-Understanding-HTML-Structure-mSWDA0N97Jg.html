up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be exploring some of these
structural components and elements of
HTML also why it's important to be using
these elements in your HTML despite the
fact that they don't actually have any
sort of visual properties to them so
let's get going on that right now so in
the last video we got our Styles going
now let's talk a little bit more about
HTML and the first video we just had an
h1 in a paragraph text so let's come to
our text editor and you can see we had
this h1 and we had a comment and we had
a paragraph right here but that's not
really structuring our website in any
sort of way I mean technically you could
just throw everything into the body
without having any sort of wrapping or
any sort of structural elements in your
HTML however there are much better ways
and it's really nice but it's really
important for not only search engines
and browsers to understand but also
screen readers for disabled people and
computer programs to understand the
structure and layout of your website so
let's go ahead and get rid of this h1
and this paragraph here we can always
add them again later now let's talk
about what's restructure allel ament's
are available for us we didn't have
access to some of these elements but now
with html5 we have some new elements
that are very structural and semantic
for instance we have a new header
element we use the head for the head of
our document however the header element
like so is going to be where off of the
display heading information for our
website is available so for instance we
would have our h1 in here to say our
first website right just like we had
before so this is going to be the let's
say the name of our website and other
things that you might find into a header
might be something like a navigation you
could even maybe find a tagline social
links a search bar there's a lot of
common patterns that are available on
many websites let's take a look at some
popular websites and see what's in their
headers on the level up tutorial site we
have the name of the site which is also
the logo we have some links the main
links for the website so this would be
considered the main navigation
and we have a link to use the search
functionality now let's check out reddit
now if you look at the code for reddit
this layout was made before HTML 5 so
it's actually just using a div tag which
stands for a divider tag which is having
the class of header however in the
header of this site there is once again
the name of the site logo we also have
some key links to how you can browse the
site we have a want to join here's to
sign and create an account and we also
have the sub reddits that you are part
of at the top here now let's check out
Twitter and once again in the top left
we have the logo which is substituting
the name of the website and then we have
some main heading information see what's
happening right now
it's sort of like a tagline and there's
also a call to action to sign up or
login so these are the headers of some
websites so as you can see the header is
important information that goes in your
website and it's really stuff that might
be the same on every single page that
you visit but it's more or less letting
the computer screen readers know that
this content is content that defines the
rest of the content on the page so we
refresh you can now see inside of our
header is just this h1 so let's come
back to our HTML now another new element
is the main element so we can say main
just like so and close it off here no
perhaps this is where we want to add
some more content we can put a second
level heading which an h2 and we can say
something like learning with level up
tutorials close that out now we can have
a paragraph that says I'm learning build
websites ok so now this is going to be
main essentially body content of your
website this is gonna be where the meat
of your website is the majority of the
content a screenreader a search engine
is gonna look at this and know that this
is where it's gonna go to read
paragraphs and headlines and understand
more about the content that exists on
your website so now let's check out the
page and refresh now it's interesting
about
these elements like the header and main
element is that they have no inherent
styles so we had this h1 which you can
see gets all of these what are called
user-agent styles right here
however only select header you can see
that there are no user-agent styles
other than this display block which
doesn't affect how it looks visually now
again with main all it is as Jed is
saying it's a block level element
however there's nothing visual about the
main tech it's purely structural for
your site to let screen readers and
other computers know exactly what is in
this area so now let's come and let's
check out another of the main structure
HTML elements we have next is footer now
footer is what's commonly referred to
when you're talking about the bottom of
a website so let's check out some of
those websites again we had level up
tutorials on my site we scroll down you
can see in the footer we have copyright
information reiteration of more links
and we have some social links footer of
Twitter and as you can see it's very
similar we had the copyright down here
and we have sort of a listing of some of
the main links that people might be
looking for including ones that you may
not be looking for as an immediate user
but things like brand add info cookies
just sort of stuff that you might be
looking for as a not a main feature of
the site but if you need to find it you
can find it so let's go ahead and check
out our footer we can just go ahead and
write another paragraph tag here so we
can just say P close it up like that and
we can have our copyright symbol now if
you know the keyboard shortcut to the
copyright symbol you could of course
type it in that way however some
browsers aren't going to be able to read
that so what are called so in HTML they
have various entities that allow you to
have sort of a shorthand to make the
symbol appear you can look these up just
by typing in HTML entities we can use
the copyright symbol by typing ampersand
and then the word copy and then
finishing it off with a semicolon
now we can have a year we need to say
2015
now when the browser reads this it's
going to know to put the copyright
symbol there so let's check out our
webpage now we can refresh and it says
copyright 2015 and the symbol is showing
up and it's going to show up incorrectly
whatever font that you're using and it's
going to show up correctly because we
use the HTML entity so we've learned a
little bit more about HTML structure we
have our header we have our main body
and we have our footer now there's a few
other things like sections and asides
and articles that we'll get into it a
little bit later because they're new
HTML elements and there's a little bit
more of rules when to use them and when
not to use them however we have our
basic structure here and we're ready to
start actually making this website look
a little bit better because right now
we've paid really no attention to the
actual style of the website and how it
looks so in the next video we're going
to add in some basic CSS rules to make
our website look quite a bit better and
after that we're going to start
exploring how to write our own
navigation so that we can link between
pages as always this is Scott with
LevelUp tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video here does have a Twitter or
Facebook ad level up to Torres we'd love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
