of Hudson today we're going to go over
some more things in taxonomy so let's go
back to structure and let's go to
taxonomy so what happens if you want to
add a child to one of your terms let's
go to list terms under our product or
project type okay and let's say we want
to have a new term and this term is
going to be under development we're
going to have what CMS that I used for
under development so we're going to add
a term and this term is going to be
Drupal so like the others it's all good
let's go into relations here and we're
going to say this is underneath
development okay
so let's click Save here ok let's go
back to our project type as you can see
development is now a child of Drupal so
another way we could have done that
let's create another one add term and
this is going to be expression engine
because I've also made sites an
expression engine and we're just going
to click Save this like normal ok let's
go back to our project type so we also
want this to be under development we can
physically click and drag this over as
you can see you can even make it a child
of Drupal or you can make it a child of
whatever so we want this to be under
here like this I'll click Save cool so
now we have two children under
development let's actually click Edit in
one of these and see what the generated
URL path is so it's now project type
Drupal cool so if we go to this Drupal
one there's not going to be anything
actually sorry let's uh let's go back
let's go back to our text on me I'm
going to make one more and it's going to
be Magento ok and we're going to have
this be under development as well
okay under this perpetual project if
your call I built this in Magento so we
can scroll down here and we can select
it was developed in Magento so notice
how you can have just clicked Magento in
that development it's no big deal but
just notice that okay so now we have the
site it was built in Magento and it now
is categorized as development Magento
and design cool so let's go back to our
taxonomy term we can click on project
type here if you recall these were under
st project type and then whatever our
taxonomy term name is a solace type
Magento and this should list the site
that was built in Magento cool so that
now is a little bit more specific we
have a parent we have a child and you
can keep going with that so let's talk
about some more things let's go back to
our taxonomy under structure okay and
now let's click on under a project type
we'll just click Edit vocabulary and
you'll see under here there is list edit
manage fields and manage display so
let's look at manage fields so if you
see under manage fields we have name and
description it let's uh let's go to
structure taxonomy in another window
just so I can illustrate this if we edit
this project types let's go to well I'm
sorry let's go to one of our actual
terms and edit one of our actual terms
you can see there's name and description
well what if you wanted this to be a
little bit more customizable let's say
you wanted to output some information on
the screen when you're showing all of a
particular project type or something or
you basically you just wanted something
else so let's say you wanted to be able
to describe this taxonomy more than just
a description basically you wanted to
add another field but you you can do
that by actually adding a new field just
like you would add a
ten type so field typing can be anything
so if you want to have the date that the
particular particular taxonomy term was
created you can have a date field here
and we can that way we can keep track of
when tags were added to projects or
something like that if it's something
you're interested or really it just
offers a lot of extra functionality
something that you might want to look
into so let's add a date field right
here just so you can see it in action
we'll just call this tax date because
it's easy and it's just going to be a
pop-up calendar we'll save this
yep yep yep
okay let's um say this one's morning
okay and let's go and refresh this
creating or development one and we now
have a date field which is great cool we
can totally customize these taxonomy as
you can see it's almost like a piece of
content itself it is just a term that
you can use to categorize things though
but it's really flexible it can do
whatever you want okay well that's just
some of the things you can do with
taxonomy like I said in the previous
tutorial and future ones we're going to
be going over some cool things you can
do with taxonomy and views and it's
going to come up along the way and other
topics
