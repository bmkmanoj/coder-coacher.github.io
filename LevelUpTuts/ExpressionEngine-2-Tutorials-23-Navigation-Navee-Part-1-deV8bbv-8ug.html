Tut's today we're going to pick up on
some expression engine training and so
let's go ahead and start now in this
video what I want to cover is your
options for building out your navigation
and expression engine because part of
expressions in core there really isn't a
great way to do navigation other than
pretty much like hard coding it in your
templates so that stinks that's no
that's no good and so I'm going to talk
through two options and then i'm going
to show you will probably do a couple
videos on each one the first one I want
to talk about is my favorite it's a
addon from a company called buoyant and
they are totally great and they have a
couple fantastic add-ons that i use on
most of my expression engine products if
not all and certainly I use na'vi which
is like their their main one it sells
for $35 this is expressionengine right
so everything has a cost it seems like
and this is no different so it's $35
which is not a ton of money and
definitely for what it does there's
nothing better so they also have some
other modules and plugins that are
pretty cool better pages is another good
one that I use on a lot of sites as well
not necessarily all depends on the
project but na'vi without a doubt one
hundred percent i use that on every
project um before Nabi came out there
was another there's another module out
there called structure structure
you see ms I think it's bring up the
site here I think it's built with
expression here we go build with
structure so this is a different module
that works entirely different and it has
a cost I'm trying to look I want to say
it's like 65 bucks or something like
that yup 65 bucks it works totally
different than a v4 I don't really like
this one as much but we will go over it
i own it so we can we can look at it in
another video but they basically do sort
of the same thing and that is you can
build out your navigation and also your
breadcrumbs so let's go ahead and
install na'vi i've already downloaded it
from devotee which if you're new to
expression engine this is sort of deed
the de facto commerce place for paid and
free add-ons for expression engine so
you've probably been here but yeah
created an account you can do that for
free and then you can go ahead and
purchase your add-ons so let's go ahead
and do this so i'm going to close that
one down we don't need it anymore i'ma
leave Boing up because we might hop over
to their documentation at some point and
so okay i have like i said i have
already downloaded see here already
downloaded na'vi and we go ahead and an
hour
private and launch transmit so i can
upload this oops just updated to lion
finally alright so system expression gin
just like all third-party add-ons an
expression engine to remember in
previous videos expression engine one
was sort of just chaotic and I hope you
to remember all these different paths
and all that stuff but now it's easier
so we just drop this right here it's
going to go ahead and upload and now we
need to upload the theme this is the
control panel stuff so let's go ahead
and do that and that goes in the from
the root it goes into the themes folder
and just like in the expression engine
third party full or just like the
expression folder there's a third party
folder in here and we're going to go
ahead and drop theme right in here we
don't have any other ones on here yet so
once that is complete we are ready to
install so if you remember you just to
login you just add admin dot PHP and
there you are I'm logged into this other
menu here thanks growl alright so add-on
module Hey look for na'vi here it is
install it
okay oh and submit we're installing all
those components and now that its
installed we can now click on it and so
this is the interface or the least a
start screen for na'vi so what we're
going to do is we're going to create our
main navigation and this is going to be
a mixture or this would be a mixture of
potentially internal pages internal
pieces of content just like a you know a
published entry or it could also be
external pages so we're going to do sort
of like one each and so the name is
person same a nap and the title now this
is think of this is like a URL title so
it's got to be a single word no spaces
so it's going to be main nav and this is
the main nav cool create navigation
group
so now that that main now that we've
created one we ever if we go when we go
back to this page we don't see this like
welcome blank message what we're going
to see is you know a list of all of our
navigation items as soon as it loads
here we go so right now instead of just
saying welcome and then having those two
panes here we just have the one item
here and we just click to edit it so we
haven't added an item so let's go ahead
and do that so we're going to create one
and call it home page or just home I
guess and if you right now we only have
we don't have any items here so we're
not going to sign it to any parent this
is how you would assign a sub navika sub
nav item and create link so you have
three options here for creating a link
you have manual guided and pages so what
this means is for this one maybe we just
wanted to be our homepage which is due /
and hit add
okay so now we have one item added to
our nav the next one we're going to do
is the about page now if you remember in
a previous video now it's been a while
but we created a page called about and
so that was an actual page so to set up
using manual now we're going to use
pages and we actually only have one page
created and what this does is it's so
like it says here select from the pages
module so when we've gone through the
previous videos and created pages using
this tab that we added to our control
panel navigation you know we now if you
will however many you create here that
mean you're going to see that list here
so we have a book we have about some go
ahead and add that one and we'll do
another one just fun to say this one's
going to go to look that's website and
so this is going to be an external and
so I'm going to do that in manually
about that second if you haven't been
there yet check it out and then this
time I'm going into the optional items
just so you can see some of the
additional items that can be selected
here and so output include a navigation
true or false so you may have an item
which you may want to exclude from your
navigation maybe you want to remove it
temporarily or maybe you know maybe
there's some other reason why you'd want
to exclude it and so you can select that
here you can assign IDs classes rels
access keys targets if you need to open
in a you know a new window this is an
external links oh maybe we'd want to do
that
I kind of hate when that happens but
we'll do it just so you see you can
apply regular expressions which is
really useful and also you can restrict
by member groups so it's pretty complete
you can do a lot of things I actually
haven't really run up because too many
occasions where i needed to do something
that I with the navigation that I can't
do with Nabi so definitely props too
buoyant for that so let's go ahead and
hit add on this one and we're just gonna
add one more um let's see here news item
may be so i'm going to use guided and i
am going to say select from a channel
news and then it's going to populate um
you know my my entries here and i can
just choose i'll say story too and i
think I want that one so we'll go ahead
and hit actually be good detail kind of
don't remember so we'll try it see what
happens um alright I'm gonna hit add
here that's going to be four items but
one thing will say is we want we
actually want level up to us to be under
the about page just mix it up so i'm
going to edit and i'm just going to
assign it to the about knit update and
there you have it if you wanted to
reorder these you can just do a drag and
drop the one thing that I'll say is you
can't like it won't let me drag news
into about you can only drag to reorder
on the same level so I can move these
blue ones but I can't you know drag this
blue one into the gray if you want to do
that you need to edit it
and then assign it to the parent and
then you can reorder okay so that's
that's the nav that we want to do here
I'm go ahead and update it actually
thinking I had already saved yeah it's
been all every time I drag you'll notice
that it adds a little to the ticker
here's to say in like hey good update so
anyway but I want to go home about with
this tucked in here and then say news
item that sounds good alright so that's
all we're going to cover in this
tutorial in the next tutorial what we're
going to cover is actually outputting
this navigation to the page thanks a lot
