and today i'm going to show you how we
can create another layout simply by
duplicating the layout that we already
had made in the last video and then
modifying it and we're going to do this
to create a layout for the home page
that way we have an interior layout and
a home page layout and in the next video
after that we're going to actually use
context to make sure that we're seeing
the home page layout on the home page
and the sidebar interior page layout on
interior pages so this one might be
really easy what we have to do is we
have to take the layouts folder the
sidebar folder that we create in the
last video and we're just going to
duplicate this inside of here I can do
this just in finder anyway you know how
and we're going to call this home and so
this new layout is named home likewise
we're going to want to change the file
names in here to be home layout and then
home layout Inc just like that and that
it's nice and easy and again we want to
have these staffs files that we created
we want to do the same thing so let's
duplicate this sidebar once more and you
might want to stop drush guard while
you're doing this you can see mind's
going crazy because it has all these new
files to compile might have to end up
deleting some of those CSS files either
way we can change this just like we did
before and we're just removing the word
sidebar from all of these so we're
basically just creating this new layout
right it's home and there's going to be
some differences in this layout so now
we need to get in and edit our files
actually okay let's close out some of
these first off let's go into the
important files we have the ink file we
want to make sure this name is home and
it's going to be using the home lay out
the
home page layout you can do more to
describe what this layout actually looks
like in fact highly recommend that no we
just have to I can do a find and replace
for sidebar oh well maybe I don't want
to do that here we'll just change it
like that there we go now it's using the
right styles and you know what in this
home we don't actually have a sidebar at
all in fact it's just going to be one
large main column and then we might have
blocks that are on columns and stuff
like that but our main content is really
just going to be without a sidebar so we
can go ahead and get rid of this sidebar
first region entirely from this home
layout Inc now let's come to our homely
out TPL and again we can remove this
sidebar first because we're not going to
be using it so it's just getting rid of
stuff we don't need right it's trimming
this down so it's just the stuff that we
want okay so now we have our home page
layout and now we just need to modify
the CSS so let's come into our our SAS
home and then we can come too well let's
get rid of this sidebar first here
because we didn't need it this is in the
level home layout SCSS keep in mind this
is the same CSS because we just
duplicate those files directly now some
things we do want we want this page we
want the widths to be brought over and
uh we want let's actually get rid of
this breakpoint touch blue I don't know
why that stayed in there anyways and uh
let's get rid of this sidebar stuff so
we don't need the sidebar stuff and
actually we want the content to span the
entire grid so we can just say this is
the entire grid just like that just like
that okay cool so now we should have a
sidebar layout which includes the CSS
that you saw in the
previous video and we should have our
main layout which is going to have one
big l content region that spans all 12
grids and it's going to have our tablet
and our desktop with so it's all going
to be one big with cool so let's come to
our site now and let's enable our new
theme first we have to clear the cache
as always remember since you most likely
have just installed now you could go to
drush and type CC all too clear all of
your caches or we just click clear on
cashier I find rush to be usually much
faster but I don't have it currently
open so let's come into our parents and
refresh this we're now seeing our home
layout here and you'll notice if we
select and enable this let's come to our
page we refresh it's all in one big
column and you'll notice that this
didn't get our Styles right this isn't
getting anything sure it's one big
column but it's not getting our wits so
why is that well there's actually one
thing that we forgot to change in our no
queria scss looking for sidebar layout
which doesn't exist in this folder so of
course we could have gone to our
terminal and saw that it was giving us
an error saying that there was problems
cannot find sidebar doubt layout so if
you're running to issues always check
your terminal and see if there's a neat
output you know so we need to have this
a home let's save it and let's check our
our terminal here and it looks like
everything's all good so let's come back
to our site here now we want to refresh
this once more let's clear the cache
refresh so here's our page it's getting
the Styles exactly like we would expect
and this is our responsive single column
width page okay well keep in mind we
only want this single-column layout to
be for the homepage
so in the next video we're going to show
you how we can have it be that the
single column layout will be only in the
home page and the interior page will be
only in interior pages so as always this
is Scott would level up tuts if you have
