up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be installing atom and opening
it up and checking it out so stick going
on that right now to get atom we just
need to come to atom dot I oh now you'll
see this home page is great I mean
that's one of the things that atom does
really well overall it has a great
design experience like so many text
editors and other web editing
applications just completely neglect
some of the little things that make an
interface really nice and you can see
even their website gives you confidence
that this is going to be a nice package
now what's cool about atom is that you
aren't seeing any sort of purchase
buttons anywhere because atom is totally
hackable and it's provided from github
you can actually download and use it
entirely for free making it really the
best free text editor available on the
web
in addition there's a ton of people
using Adam and because of that there's a
ton of resources available both for
packages plugins and people using it
suggesting different items and things to
do now there's great documentation
there's a blog there's themes there's
packages and that's just the start of it
so throughout this series I'm going to
be showing you some of my favorite
packages we're going to be diving in and
we're going to be we're going to be
customizing and changing Adam we're
going to be going over some of its
interface find your features some
features that you can do with Adam to
improve your workflow and just use Adam
has what it says a modern approachable
and hackable text editor now one of the
cool things about Adam is it's actually
built in essentially HTML Javascript and
CSS so if you know those technologies
extending Adam is really super simple
in fact it uses a stack called electron
which is built by github to allow you to
use those technologies in an application
setting like this and electron is
actually really really cool if you take
a look at it but what's great about this
is you could inspect aspects of this
user interface simply like you would
inspecting something with Chrome and
then you can then come in and modify it
using plain old CSS to write your themes
and things like that making it really
super hackable like it says okay so
that's enough introduction while this is
downloading I'm going to wait the 1
minute and then we're going to open up
this zip and install it on our computer
okay so we've downloaded Adam for Mac I
can just double click on this zip and
it's going to simply come up with an
application here which you can just drag
into your applications like so I know
that this is in my applications I'm
going to put it in my dock here right
here next to sublime text where I can
find my editors nice and easily and just
go ahead and selecting it it's going to
allow you to open it up
here we have Adam now what's great here
is that like I said the experience on
hanim is already really nice they give
you a welcome guide a loading screen
it's not just sort of a blank window or
something like that they give you links
to the docs a page to discuss Adam and
just a whole bunch of information now
it's cool as they say get to know Adam
you can open a project you can install a
package choose a theme custom the
styling hack the hack on the
initialising script add a snippet and
learn some shortcuts so right off the
bat Adam scores points in being easy to
use and really just showing you how you
can be better at using its own
application direct out of the box
an additional notice there's two panes
here we can slide this one we can change
it out you can also drag this tab and
move it over to this one so as you can
see this should function very similar to
a lot of text editors and applications
that you've used before in the next
video we're going to start pawing
through the interface of Adam and check
out some of the interface features so as
always this is Scott with level up
