of HUD's and today I'm going to continue
where we left off with our email
newsletter template and you know in fact
in the last lesson I said that I am
going to we're going to get into the
newsletter queue where we are but not
right away first we want to dive back
into this template so the screen I'm in
is in newsletter templates just where we
left off and you see our template here
that we had before and as you remember
this is our template name this doesn't
really get seen by anybody the template
subject hello from level up times this
is what you use is going to see in their
inbox as well as the sender name and
sender email let's preview this again to
remember what it looked like here it is
just like we left it so I you know
there's some things here what are some
things that we're always going to want
the newsletter template to have so this
is sort of your strategy for your
template things that are going to change
every time like we're going to have this
welcome text and all these paragraphs
we're going to have these change every
time as well as these images but the
things we're not going to have change is
this Facebook link this Twitter length
is Google+ link this email phone number
we're not going to have that stuff
change as well as any of these links or
we're not going to have this logo change
so anything that's not going to change
from every time you send out your
template you're going to want to create
in your template itself so you're going
to want to change here so that way when
you you know create an actual newsletter
you don't have to add these things in
every time and replace them you just
have them okay so I want to replace this
image with our logo so let's go to the
show/hide editor let's scroll down here
and we can find this image right here
and I'm just going to delete this but
i'ma leave my cursor here I'm going to
insert an image and that image is going
to be this logo insert the file and you
can see it has this Magento and specific
tag and now let's go show/hide editor
okay
now let's preview the template
and for some reason it still thinks it
has this other logo they're not quite
sure why that is
let's check back the show editor maybe
it's because we haven't saved it so
let's go ahead and save this template
now I want to cancel all sorry I want to
save template not save as save as is
creating a another template and now
let's just come back in here and one
more time I'm going to click preview
again I don't know something's getting
messed up or what perfect okay so now
our logos in here however there's some
funkiness going up here with deserve
emails sometimes magento what it's
trying to do is it is adding this like
title tag but the magento editor doesn't
really understand any of that stuff so
it converted it to a P tag so I'm
actually just going to go ahead and
delete everything before the initial
table tag and that way we won't have
those problems anymore preview ones but
let's close this without preview this
once more well you get the idea because
it's clearly not showing you the updated
ones so that image is going to be there
and let's scroll down here we also want
these links to be changed so you'll
click the link button and right now it's
just set to a pound sign we could find
the level up touch face book of Tut's
and okay here's your face book yep yep
yep okay and I'm going to paste this URL
in here update this and you can go
through to that for all these likewise I
put my phone number my email in here and
these are things I want to save so let's
click Save template and we're ready to
get our newsletter queue started so
you'll notice this action right here you
can see preview and it's going to open
up a preview like before or you can
click Q newsletter so let's click Q
newsletter and what this is going to do
is Q a newsletter from this template
what that means is it's going to take
this template and it's going to have
what's called a Q which means that you
set when this
template or when this email is going to
get sent out you'll notice this Cuse
date start is when uh it's going to get
sent out here so if we have it sent out
tomorrow you can even set exactly what
time and here we have our editor now if
you're more comfortable editing the HTML
like I am I would say go and do that
because this way if you're editing the
HTML here you're going to know exactly
what you're deleting in in keeping you
know whereas if you're editing this
WYSIWYG who knows you delete something
too much and and sure enough maybe like
a header tag is gone or something so I
would go in here from your HTML and I
would edit this and if you're not
familiar with HTML it's not too hard to
like tell what's going on here you can
do a search and find for whatever text
you're looking to replace and replace it
that way okay hello from a little Tut so
you can see I'm editing in here and keep
in mind this is the real content that's
going to go out at the site so this is
where you're going to want to replace
all your images with the ones that you
actually want to see get emailed so
after you go through and re-type in all
your text change it to whatever you want
to be you can even delete stuff like if
we delete this image right here so now
it's gone it's gone completely but
actually okay let's just just do this so
let's say this is our email template
it's perfect
the exactly way we want it to look sent
out right we don't care about that big
image right now but we might want to use
in the future so we're going to leave it
in our template this screen right here
does not affect your template at all
this is just affecting the newsletter
that's going to get sent out so let's
click Save newsletter and the cue start
date is January 4th it's going to tell
you right here cue start January 4th and
it's going to give you a finish date and
this finish date is once it's actually
sent out that's what that is going to be
so it's going to update it after January
4th to tell you if it was processed for
how many recipients and everything like
that and the status so far is not sent
because it hasn't been set yet
because it's not January 4th so let's
actually click preview here great I got
a pop-up blog ok
ok preview it's mad now or something so
let's go back okay preview hello from
level of touch so here's our email
perfect and see you know when I actually
changed that link I changed it through
the WYSIWYG in exactly what I said about
it possibly changing code it did so now
this Facebook link looks terrible and we
were better off just going into the HTML
to edit that in the first place but for
whatever it doesn't really matter right
now this email template is going to go
out and if you wanted to change it
before it sent out you can come in here
and change it let's say I really messed
up that Facebook button I want to fix
this so this had this social button
class on the anchor and what I'm
guessing is that this class just got
removed when I change the link so social
button and I'm going to guess this is FB
although you know could very possibly
not be and of course we won't see it in
this interface let's save the newsletter
but either way this is all happening
before it's sent out so it doesn't
matter we preview this Facebook's back
ok so now this is going to get sent out
whenever it's not and if you want it to
delay anyone a change of time you can
always do that before the queue start
date and just like we said if you go
back to your newsletter templates here's
our newsletter template and it's going
to be here with this giant old image
back again because we only deleted it
from the queue itself ok so this is how
you manage your newsletter with Magento
there's a lot of cool stuff you can do
with it you can have different templates
different queues you can you know change
as much as you want but you always keep
it simple and do what we just did here
have a template change it up for the
queue and send it out that way as always
if you have any questions please
in the video it isn't the Twitter level
of Tut's and we're also on Facebook /
level up Tut's I think it is either way
you just saw the URL in this video so
check us out let us know to think all
right thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
