up tuts and today I'm going to go over
related products or as they're called on
the site upsells in this particular
situation so if we go to a particular
product actually let's go back I'm gonna
go to this phone that we have before and
I want to say that there is a particular
product that is related to this and you
see there's things like recently added
recently viewed sure sure sure but we
want what's called an upsell in Magento
language and it could be called an
upsell in other languages as well but so
the same way we had searched for this
before we're going to search again I'm
going to copy this and I'm going to
paste this in here now Alfred okay hit
enter and here's a product so I'm going
to click here so what we want to go to
is upsells right here that's how there's
also related products and cross-sells
we'll go over those in a second the way
this works is basically right now it's
showing us everything that is an upsell
because this is yes right here it's
filled to this to show all the products
that are considered upsells already and
since there are none we have no records
found if we want to say any so whether
they're an upsell or not we're going to
say that and then search and then now
it's any products and now we could go
and find some phones or I'm actually
going to type phone in here to see oh
there is no record for phone I'm just
going to use the attribute set then and
we say give me cell phones and I'm going
to search for those and now I'm going to
check some boxes I'm just going to say
this ones are all related to this
particular phone and I'm going to save
this
so now let's go to our product and
refresh the page if you'll notice if we
scroll down here you'll see you may be
interested in the following products so
it's trying to sell your customers these
new products here it's going to say oh
well you might also be interested in
these so maybe if you have a cheaper
phone you want to put some more
expensive ones in here and see if you
can get your customers to upsell to
these maybe this $399 phone right here
well what is the related products well
let's go back I'm going to go back into
this phone and here in related products
I'm going to add some and this one I'm
going to be a little less particular
about it
even though these aren't super related
I'm just going to click and add them as
being related and then we're also going
to add some cross cells and super
related and I'm going to click Save here
and we're going to see where I put these
cut now let's come to the product if we
refresh this you see there are related
products right here they'll show up in a
different spot this is a different block
so down here you might be interested in
the following products this is sort of
what like amazon.com has related
products we'll throw them into a block
right here so now let's add the last of
the three let's add the cross cells
let's go back to our product let's click
on it once more and let's go to cross
sales and see where it puts those so I'm
going to select any again we're going to
search and again I'm just going to
select three random products here of
course you'll want to be more selective
about that when you're doing it on an
actual store okay we have that now let's
refresh this page and let's see if it's
added them here we have related products
we have you might be interested our
upsells but we don't have anything else
so we're gonna put those well let's
check let's check some places let's
check the shopping cart well here they
are
I have to admit I actually knew they
were going to be here but if you've
purchased a few selected cross-sells
they're going to show up here at the
shopping cart where it says based on
your selection you might also like these
right when your customers about to check
out this is something that you've seen
on pretty much many of the websites that
you go to to purchase things so that's
all good
those are cross-sells upsells and
related products all three very similar
but a little bit different things so if
you have any questions please leave a
comment the video or hit us up at
Twitter level up tuts you can reach me
at st Linsky I'm Twitter or you can
reach us on Facebook we always like to
get to the comments but sometimes
there's just too many of us are too many
comments for us to get to there's only
two of us and we just do this in our
free time so this is not a full-time job
for us that's what we always are willing
to accept donations for what we do here
but we don't require it we want to keep
these videos free for you
so if you let them feel free to donate
if you don't let them feel free to

opposite either way so as always this is
