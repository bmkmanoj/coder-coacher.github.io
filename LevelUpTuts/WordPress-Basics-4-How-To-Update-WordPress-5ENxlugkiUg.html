up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
one of the maybe one of the quickest
tutorials we've ever done here this is
going to be how to update WordPress now
if you have a wordpress site and chances
are after a given period of time
there's going to be a new version coming
out whether it's security fixes or just
small little bug fixes or anything like
that you'll see a little pop up and then
the latest version of WordPress it looks
like this and it says WordPress three
point eight point one is now available
please update now you'll also see this
little updates here and it's going to
tell you what kind of how many updates
you have whether you have plugins that
also need updating or anything like that
or you have the WordPress core that
needs updating itself well and I'm happy
to say that WordPress has one of the
best if not the best updating interface
and experiences out of any CMS it's Ed's
truly really painless and you always
want to make a backup of your site
before running updates but to be honest
I never really have that many problems
with WordPress and updates unlike uh and
maybe not Drupal so much anymore but in
the past you know you maybe would update
something and things were brick or
something like that but don't always
make sure you make an update before any
making are a backup of your site before
making any large change such as a
version update but let's go ahead and
click this please update now and it's
going to take us to our updating screen
where it's couldn't be any easier it
says WordPress is there's new version
available with an update now button mint
now if you have plugins or themes
they'll also have update buttons and you
can click this separately but you could
download the version three point eight
point one and update it manually or you
can just click this update now let's
click update now and it's going to go
ahead and you're going to get a little
message here that says it's downloading
and verifying it copying it it's
upgrading your database and it's
successful and you know it's successful
because after you finished it's
introducing WordPress as the version
that it's set to update to so
congratulations
you updated WordPress and that was
incredibly easy so as always
with level up heads in the next video
we're going to start talking about the
back end of the site we're going to
start showing you what's what and
where's where where you can find things
in the next couple of videos we're going
to be continuing to do that and then
we're going to move on to actually
creating and managing your content so as
always this is Scott with LevelUp Tut's
and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
