up tutorials and in this video we're
going to take a look at what you get
when you buy a premium sketch uikit now
we've looked at a bunch of free
resources seen all the great stuff you
can get for free for sketch now some of
the online marketplaces are starting to
really fill out with a lot of great
sketch resources as well so let's dive
into a few of these UI kits from
creative market so in the past we
focused a lot on free resources but I
wanted to point out that you can
actually buy a lot of really
high-quality resources for pretty cheap
and I want to thank creative market for
sponsoring this video I think there's a
lot of great things on something like
creative market where you can actually
type in like sketch UI and you'll find a
whole bunch of paid sketch resources the
ones I get up there above the 50 $40
range they include a lot of stuff but
even these more cheap ones like this
eight dollar one they include quite a
bit of stuff I was actually really
impressed when I came here so creative
market allowed me to check out a few of
these and I wanted to paw through them
so you can see what sort of comes in the
different price points for instance I
have this fifteen dollar one downloaded
this is the finance app UI so I have
this downloaded up here I'm gonna pull
it up and sketch and you can see what
the sort of comes in a paid UI kit verse
a a free UI kit now not saying anything
negative about the free resources
because the free resources are seriously
incredible getting something like this I
mean is seriously awesome I'm sure you
may be able to find something like this
at some point for free but this kit has
a lot of great little design interface
elements I mean sure there's one page in
this particular one after all it is only
$15 and there's what looks like a tart
boards but these Art boards are all very
different you're not getting sort of
like the same thing over and over again
I mean you do get that sort of unified
design here with these like list items
styles but you get a graph you get a
credit card you get a card get sort of a
timeline view you get a navigation you
get a larger navigation and like maybe a
user page so well this is a resource
that you have to pay for for five
two dollars you're getting a whole lot
and in addition you can feel good about
supporting these designers because these
are all independent designers who are
uploading their designs under this
marketplace so you can find a lot of
really great stuff in here and you can
support some talented designers while
you're at it now what's cool about some
of these is this one was a little bit
more expensive and it actually came with
the fonts to download which is something
I really like and these fonts are
available on the internet you can go get
them but it just saves me a step here I
don't have to go try to find these fonts
somewhere so I can just simply install
them I'm going to open this one up
because this one is nice and big it
turns out I already had just fins okay
whatever
so let's go ahead and open this
blueprint one up and maybe they couldn't
get the permissions for laddo or
something to distribute that but let's
open this anyways with that laddo that
was a pretty middle-of-the-road font
that's really nice looking font but it's
not going to sort of make or break this
design here and as you can see this one
is awesome so on this page alone we have
nine different full-page art boards and
these are mobile these are our full
pages here with all sorts of different
things right so we have yeah we have
some repeated elements we have some
repeated sort of imagery but there's a
lot of different components I mean this
page itself this is a full website right
here and this is a full website that you
can change and attribute and design your
site around you could use this as like a
starter kit for yours or you can simply
just use these UI elements in your
projects but this is like a real deal
full website here now if we come here
you're going to see in addition to nine
artboards they're several pages there's
a lot of pages so if we click on the
about page you'll see we only get one
artboard for this two ballot page but
it's a good-looking page I mean these
things are very well designed this is
some very professional stuff portfolio
page we have a blog page with the blog
page has like more than several
different variants so you can have a
right column to column left column no
column I mean they have all that stuff
include
I mean this is just really great blog
single post and it's all very well
designed good good stuff here and as you
can see all this stuff is very well
labeled we have sidebar we have the
header and we have things that are even
like broken up into symbols here so
let's zoom in on this element here
you'll see this is quite a bit larger of
a sketch file and sometimes it happens
with sketch when you into larger files
but we have things like this featured
article this is a a symbol right so if
we wanted to just throw this around we
wanted to make our own we could simply
even just insert a symbol and here's a
whole ton of symbols right so this one
really went above and beyond I mean you
won't necessarily find stuff this good
in a free resource we could simply come
in here and throw in some social icons
and there's our symbol right there so
I'm going to check out one last one is
this 404 page awesome I mean this is
just read stuff because I mean in
addition to this you get these nicer to
font treatments out of out of this this
UI kit you could pull font sizes font
spacing you could pull the font
combinations and stuff like that you
don't have to use all these elements of
the page but simply using something like
this font and this font together with
this underline and all this spacing is a
nice little design tweak that you can
add it to something you're working on so
something like this let me check how
much this one cost I'm not quite sure
yeah so this one is a $48 this is part
of the the most costly one I've checked
out so as you can see for $48 you're
getting a whole ton of stuff and that's
not me trying to sell you on this
particular one I don't know who this
user is I don't know anything about them
but this this is a really nice little
package here I simply came in here and
did sketch UI like we did at the very
beginning and you can see I mean there's
a ton a ton of stuff so for a long time
a lot of these stores have really just
been Photoshop and illustrator so it's
actually really nice to see something
like this where there is what how many
pages of sketch resources I mean there's
just an unbelievable amount so there is
a ton of stuff and if you're a designer
selling your stuff on on someplace like
this and having your work go up on here
could be a really nice way to bring in
some extra cash and practice your design
abilities right I mean look at this some
of the stuff this one includes all of
these inputs and yeah this is just
really great stuff actually wish I had
this one downloaded now so I could pop
through it but it looks really really
good
so like I said this video was sponsored
by creative market but I'm really glad
that they were able to let me go through
some of these sketch UI kits just so I
can see what a paid UI kit looks like
versus something that's like a free
resource so if you're looking for some
higher quality UI kits just maybe to
kick off a design or find a design
element check out creative market
there's a ton of sketch resources on
here and this one even comes with sketch
and Photoshop which I actually found to
be true for a couple of ones I
downloaded the sketch and Photoshop
thing was nice because if you're not
totally committed to sketch or maybe you
want to see how something is done in
sketch verse Photoshop you can download
this sketch and Photoshop files here and
then maybe compare techniques and get
better at either app cool so if you are
looking for some resources head up
creative market search for sketch UI
kits or just really anything sketch and
let me know if you find any cool ones
I've been pulling through this set a lot
and like I said I keep finding ones I
really like including the ones I've been
showing off here there's some really
high quality stuff on here so if you
want to try out some of these resources
and you want to save some money there's
actually a coupon code for 10% off any
of your purchases here at creative
market you can use that coupon code I'll
have it in the description of the video
it is level up tuts 10 or you can click
on a link in the description there so
you can either click on the link or copy
the promo code itself but they'll give
you 10% off anything in creative market
so take advantage of that and check out
some of these sketch resources as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials
there's gonna be a lot more sketch
videos coming soon
I have a lot planned for sketch right
now I'm working on some pretty cool
stuff that I'm going to be revealing

the pipeline so keep your eyes open for
anything new sketch showing up on the
