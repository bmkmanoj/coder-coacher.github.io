up Tut's and today I'm gonna show you
to install an extension in Magento
community using the mage command-line
tool so if you are on a server I would
recommend you doing this on a dev server
with a site with the proper backup and
you can log into your server with SSH
and do this if you're working locally
you can just open up your terminal and
we're going to browse to our site's
directory like usual and just like when
we use the mage b-before we just have to
get into our site here and now that I'm
in here it's really a pretty simple
command since we use mage before we
don't have to run any sort of extra
stuff we just have to run this install
command and so it starts with a dot
forward slash mage just like usual and
we're gonna type install and then now we
want to use the what channel we're gonna
be downloading this from so let's go to
Magento connect and grab an extension
here and let's just find one that's free
that we can install really quickly and
you know make sure that it's working I'm
in most popular community at version 1.7
so this foo man speedster looks like
it's pretty good and you notice they
have some stuff here but really I just
wanted to free a free module here to
test out and if you remember when we
installed for Magento connect we clicked
Install Now and we grabbed the Magento
connect 2.0 extension key this is sort
of the same basically what we need to do
here is copy parts of this in fact I'm
gonna copy everything until a community
and you and the forward slash as well so
I'm going to copy this right here and
I'm gonna come to my tournament all I'm
gonna paste it in here notice how it's
connect $20 Gento commerce comm slash
community and I'm on Magento 1.7 so if
you're running 1.7 I believe it's 1.5 in
higher it's on Magento connect 2.0
so you're gonna want to use this connect
to 20 and then so we're gonna have a
space here and then it's going to be
this end part this foo man speedster so
come back to our terminal and paste this
here
and you'll notice we have that mage
installed and then it's the channel
space and then the extension so a common
mistake would be not having this space
here so make sure that's there so if you
want to go ahead and hit enter you're
gonna see installing community and
successfully install package installed
perfect so if you couldn't use this mage
tool go back and watch the mage video on
setting it up in the basic usage but if
you were in the last video and you saw
you know the installation install
process for extensions you know it might
have been okay but maybe you were having
some permissions errors on your folders
or just you couldn't get it to work
please try this method because it's
really you know you could be a you know
afraid of terminal or something but it's
really easy and to be honest it it works
more frequently and you don't have to
worry about permission stuff so
basically that just downloaded there and
now we just need to make sure that we
have the correct ownership on these
folders and so I have the owner as Scott
and the group as staff because that's
just the way this is locally set up on
my server and what happens if you
install like this it's gonna give them
permissions of root and root I believe
so
what I'm gonna do is notice how I'm
still in my Magento folder I'm gonna CD
one directory out of this and I'm gonna
type shown space - are and this is
changing the owner of every single
folder within this folder I'm about to
declare so I'm gonna say change the
owner to Scott and then colon staff
and the folder that I want to do that is
my Magento site I'm gonna enter and gave
me a bunch of permission so I'm gonna
try that again but I'm gonna say pseudo
Joan - our Scott staff and this is going
to be Magento password enter cool so one
way we can verify that is by you could
browse there in terminal or something
but I'm actually just gonna show in here
because it's a little bit more visual
for this approach so one thing that it
probably added is it probably added
something to the app and then it
probably added a file in at ET c and
then modules so of course my assumption
was correct and here's our foo man
speedster that XML you can see this file
was added just now and so if I inspect
this you can see it has the owner of
Scott and staff just like I wanted it to
cool so we now have that let's make sure
it's working on our site so I am going
to log out and while I'm logged out here
I'm going to CD back into Magento and
I'm going to type that mage space and
then it clear cache and lets it enter
it's gonna clear my cache for me and now
I can just sign back into the site and
we should see our foo man speedster
somewhere in the admin like I said I
haven't used this extension before so
see exactly where it is but they should
just show up in the config so if we go
to system configuration and let's scroll
down under advanced we should see foo
man speedster it's set to being enabled
so they do say on their site however not
to disable here so dough if you're using
this module don't disable it follow
their instructions how to uninstall it
but we have it installed and working
obviously if there was a bit more of a
front-end feel to it or something like
our other extent
you'll be able to see that here but it
looks like it's installed fine and as
far as we can see the front end of our
site is working just fine and it seemed
pretty snappy to me who knows if it was
that much faster but of course I don't
have any caching turned on so that's how
you install an extension with terminal
using mage it's simple you just use dot
forward slash mage space install space
then the channel space and then the
module so as always if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video hit us up to Twitter at level
up tuts
you can reach me and twitter at s
Solinsky and we're on Facebook or on
Google+ although we're not on all of
them equally probably Twitter and
Facebook the most often and as always if
you sent an email I'm trying to get to
it so thanks for watching and I'll see
you in the next one five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
