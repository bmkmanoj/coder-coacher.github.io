up Tut's and today we're going to be
installing Magento onto your Windows
computer using lamp server that we went
over in the last video if you need to
learn how to get lamp setup go ahead and
watch a video that was the one before
this so if you are go to Magento comm
you'll notice this is what the site
currently looks like I feel like it
changes well before this change it
hadn't changed a long time but this
change is fairly recent so what we're
going to do is we're going to go to
products and then from products we can
go to open source /c e and this is going
to be the community edition and we can
go to view available downloads here and
we're going to want to grab looks like
the latest version is one point 8.1 at
this time of recording this so go ahead
and grab whatever the latest version is
and I'll just grab this tarp GZ and we
can go ahead and download this now it's
going to ask you for a Magento account
so go ahead and use your login
credentials or create an account if you
don't already have one now after you've
gotten through your download will start
and it will take you to this page where
it gives you some installation guides
and you can go ahead and check out any
of these installation guides if you get
stuck at all now if you want to install
the sample data down here there's the
sample data you can go ahead and
download this most recent version of
that and keep in mind if you're going to
install the sample data you have to do
it before you install Magento now I
won't be covering that in this video but
the process is the exact same as it is
on the Mac videos that I had done
earlier so go ahead and watch these
installing the sample data video that I
did on Mac and it's going to be the
exact same process then you can go ahead
and install Magento after that okay
after your Magento is done downloading
based on whatever compression you have
if it's just zipped up you're going to
want to unzip it ok so I've gone ahead
and extracted our Magento directory into
my desktop here and you can see in
it appears the standard Magento stuff
and I'm going to make a folder on my
local C Drive and it's just going to be
just www and that's where I'm going to
keep my websites right so if I go to my
desktop I'm going to grab this whole
Magento folder throw it into here and
then throw it into my WW so here it is
and now it's just going to move those
files really quick kept perfect now what
we need to do is tell our our ramp
server to have a new location and so if
we basically go to our Apache and we
want an alias directories let's add an
alias
notice how we already have local host
PHP might have an SQL buddy and web
grind if we come to this it's going to
ask us what the alias should be and this
is just going to be when you go to your
browser and go to localhost / something
it's what it's going to be now I want
this to just be Magento okay and now
it's asking where it should be located
and it gives an example of C and then
the folder test so we can go ahead and
say that this is going to point to see
ww
and then Magento just like that and hit
enter and it says our alias created
press exit enter to exit you notice this
goes orange for a second as it restarts
our server now we can click on here and
and everything looks to be looks to be
good here so now we can go to our
localhost and and we can type in and you
want to make sure that you have a
forward slash here or else oh it's not
going to take you to this install screen
so this is Magento's normal install
screen if you watch the other videos on
how to do it on a Mac this looks
familiar now we want to agree to these
terms and let's click continue at this
point it's going to ask for some more
things basically our location settings
so we can say I'm in Eastern Standard
Time so I'm going to come up and find
that
Eastern Standard Time my currency is
u.s. dollar years could be whatever your
currency for your store is going to be
now let's click continue and it's
telling me PHP extension curl must be
loaded
so with WAMP we can come in here and
let's go to PHP and now extensions we
can find PHP curl in this list click it
and it's going to once again turn our
server orange restart our server now
let's give this page of refresh and it
looks like we're good so now it's asking
us for our database connection well we
haven't created database yet so let's go
ahead and do that which is that we want
to come down to our WAMP server and then
go to PHP myadmin here now from here we
just need to login username is root
password is blank we can click go and
now let's go to databases now in that we
want to create a database so we can just
call this Magento of course you're going
to want to name your database maybe
something a little bit more meaningful
and let's click create we can just leave
this as collation ok
so now we have our database here it is
Magento let's come back to our install
our database type is in my sequel
database it's running on localhost the
database name is Magento the user name
is root and our user password is blank
now we don't have a tables prefix so we
can leave this blank our base URL is
localhost / Magento our enman path can
be slash admin however you can make this
to be whatever you'd like a lot of times
people change this because they don't
want people to know where their admin
path is but it might make your site a
little bit more secure but really for
this particular example I can leave it
as admin just so it's common you know I
do want to enable charts and I don't
need to check anything else we don't
have an SSL this is just a basic basic
install here and we want a safe session
data in our file system sound everything
sounds good right so let's click
continue
now it's going to tell us if it's
connected to the database and everything
is ready if not if you have some sort of
issue with your database not finding the
database perhaps your name or your user
name or password or incorrect but if
you're following along and this is a a
WAMP server then this information should
be correct here perfect so now we've
moved on and that's asking us to create
an admin account and let's go ahead and
type in my name here and this is scott
at level of tuts
okay now if we come to our PHP database
this is just to show you if we come to
our Magento you'll see it's totally
populated with tables now so it's
connected to our database and it's
filled our database with the Magento
tables that it needs now I'm going to
give it an admin username and password
and then probably this encryption key
blank it will create one for us let's
click continue do not like my password
it needs seven or more characters that's
my bad and now let's click continue and
like this says we are all set with this
latest version of Magento they're
actually asking us for some information
like what are you selling online and I'm
going to say I'm just testing this is
just a survey right this actually is
rather new this didn't used to be
populate this didn't use to show up so
you can go and fill the survey out if
you'd like if not it's no big deal at
the bottom here you can go to your
front-end or your back-end and it's
asking you to keep this encryption key
in a safe place so if we open a new tab
go to our front-end here you'll see our
site is is installed and ready to go
since we don't have any products or
anything like that
you don't see that sample data because
we didn't install that and
we come to our back end here we can go
ahead and login I just did not type the
password to correct at all okay now if
you've gone to login and you type in
your credentials it doesn't give you any
sort of errors here but it's still one
let you log in it's actually a common
problem and to fix that we need to
actually comment out some lines in one
of the core files basically there's an
issue with a cookies or something that
allows you to not login and this is a
pretty widely accepted solution for your
temporary local site here so if we come
to our site and then go to app code core
mage and then we want to go to core
model session abstract we should find
this variant PHP file now if you're
having this issue you're going to go to
this file and you're going to need to
edit out in fact I'll just put this link
in to the comments here basically you're
going to need to go and edit out these
lines basically you just make a comment
on them save it again
your login should be working fine and so
now you have Magento officially
installed on your Windows computer and
everything should be up and running
correctly as always this is Scott will
develop tuts
if you have any questions or comments
just up on Twitter level up tuts on
facebook on the new level of Tut's forum
that you can check out that is still
like pretty bare-bones right now but
it's being populated and it'll be really
cool once everybody's on there asking
questions and stuff like that so check
it all out let me know what you think
and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
