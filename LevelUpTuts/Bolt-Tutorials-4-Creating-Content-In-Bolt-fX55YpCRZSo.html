level of Ted's and today we're gonna be
talking about creating content in bolt
and so this is going to be pretty
straightforward but here at level up
tops we like to start at the
straightforward and move into the more
advanced so that way everything's
covered and if you're ever looking for
any sort of like video documentation on
some of this you can pass this video
along to someone that's need to enter
content and is a little confused so
here's what the back end of our bolt
site looks like it's showing us our
latest entries pages and kitchen sinks
which are the default content types that
it created for us and like I had
mentioned before entries is a type of
content that's sort of like a blog post
and a page is a type of content that's
treated like a full page and so these
are just their two distinctions Drupal
comes with the same sort of content
types
when you you first install it so it
should feel at home for anybody who's
used to something like that
so we're of course going to create a new
entry first and these are really simple
we have a title for this entry go be
like our first fist real post and we can
come up with an image let's see I always
like using our logo for everything it's
a little boring but whatever sure here
it is and we can enter a teaser so a
teaser is just like basically the
content that you'd show on an earlier
page to give the user an idea about what
the full post is going to be like so
what okay and if we wanted to add a
video we could add a video but we're not
going to and body let's say
okay and so we can have a relationship
so if I hover over this and saying what
is the relationship by selecting other
records as a relation you are creating
the link between this record and the one
you have selected on the website this
can be used as related articles see also
so it depends on how your templates
going to be using this relationship but
we don't want this related to anything
so we're not gonna worry about it and
this pose is going to be just a news
post and first is the only tag we're
gonna leave and notice all this great
functionality is I'll just in here by
default there's nothing we didn't have
to do anything special it's
automatically gonna generate the ID
generates day as the publishing date
however we can say that it's gonna be
published in the future and you know
let's say it's published on March 27
then it's gonna publish then but we
don't want to do that we want to publish
it right now so we want to have it
status you can also select a time to
publish now publish or draft and which
is really nice to be able to put this in
draft so that you know you can have
somebody come and check it out before
you publish it it's a you know a pretty
common feature but it's one that's nice
to have so let's click Save the century
and see what happens so we have our
number six as the six posts and the
site's got our image up here but let's
see it happens on the front end because
we're on the default site here we're
using the default theme which is using
ZURB foundation you're gonna have a lot
of default styles the site is gonna be
responsive and some things are just
gonna act a certain way and it's pretty
cool here our post is already showing up
in the latest entries by default if you
just wanted to only modify CSS you know
maybe change at the fonts or something
like that you could copy the theme over
change them the CSS without really
getting rid of any of the ZURB stuff and
make this site yours without really even
doing a whole lot you wouldn't even have
to touch the HTML templates that this is
all your after the
point so we have our post here there's a
link to it here
there's also in the recent entries and I
think that's it for right now but let's
click here and here's our first drill
post it's got our image if we click on
it it lightboxes it out for you I mean
really this is doing all this great
stuff for you we hardly had to do
anything so this is this is great it
also has this written by Scott whatever
if we wanted to get rid of this we can
go into the template and get rid of that
however we're gonna go over a templating
and a whole lot and the other videos
because it is something that you're able
to do a whole lot with and it's one of
my favorite parts about bolts is just
really the access that you have to the
templates and how you're really writing
them yourself if you're building the the
site from the ground up so let's create
a we created an entry let's create a
page and this isn't gonna be any
different really but it just prove to
you how easy this is okay and this one's
also going to have an image let's see if
I have any good images I have an image
of a dog here cool okay yeah yeah I'm
not these aren't really anything
exciting here I should maybe have some
lorem ipsum or something saved but no
big deal
and here we have the option of using a
template so the options that it's giving
us is the default template which is
defined in the content type or entry
twig index twig listing now we wanted to
pick let's say if we want to have
certain special pages use completely
different layouts you could actually
specify the template here and that would
give you complete control over the HTML
so that's really nice and this is really
just a taxonomy and taxonomy like we
explained is the same thing that wasn't
Drupal really it's just sort of like you
couldn't think of taxonomy as being like
a tag
however a tag is just a type of taxonomy
there could be several other
you know types of text on me on your
site so like this says you can use
taxonomy to group certain records
together basically you'd be saying like
maybe these are the the posts that
feature the word read or something who
knows but either way we have an ID here
as well and we can choose when it's
posted we're gonna save this page and
just like that we have a page let's come
back to our sample site let's click on
this all pages listing page that's
created for us and this is going to be
all the pages and here's our first real
page with this dog picture I don't know
why I have this picture but so here we
are first real page and it's full page
and perfect so this is how you're
creating content in Vault nothing too
crazy okay well in the next lesson I'm
gonna show you how to modify this menu
up top here and we're gonna be able to
add our page to this menu so we don't
have to go to all pages and then this
page as always this is Scott with Lola
tuts if you have any questions leave a
coming the video hit us up at Twitter
level of tuts let us know what you're
thinking alright thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
