tutorials and in this video we're going
to be doing a little bit of building for
this site we're going to be dropping in
our styles we're going to be busting
things out in to partials and we're
going to be creating our side navigation
now we don't have all the pages ready
for that yet but having the navigation
there will be one step we won't have to
worry about when we do so let's get
going on that right now okay so now it's
a great time to drop in our style so we
have our styles and I will make a link
available to these styles on the
description of the video go ahead and
throw these into your stylist file right
here if you don't know stylists don't
worry about it either way we shouldn't
really need to modify this to get this
project going I just want to throw this
in here so it's working now by the time
you head back to your site you should
see it's looking quite a bit different
in fact mine's a little zoomed in right
now so I'm going to zoom out just a hair
okay and you can see we have this form
you can see we have our plus button down
here now instead of the plus weird plus
and minus so these look a little bit
better
okay cool okay so everything's looking
really really nice here or at least it's
looking acceptable let's come back to
our code and let's go ahead and add our
side navigation now this side navigation
is going to appear on the side of our
website and it's going to quickly allow
us to just change our different views
obviously it's what a navigation does
but we can head to our layout code and
let's add a new file and let this file
name be side nav dot HTML okay this
template is going to be named side nav
side nav like so cool now let's have a
nav with the class of side nav okay
and a unordered list with three list
items inside of it and any side of each
one of those is going to be an anchor
tag cool so nothing too crazy there now
we want this to be a recipe book link so
we can
say recipe - book now we'll want this
link to be our menu so we could say -
menu and we want the last link to be our
link to our shopping list like so now we
can go ahead and just add a shopping
list menu okay like so right we're just
essentially filling this out now in
addition I want to throw some icons in
here we have the font awesome package
added to our site so we can use any font
on a awesome icon we would like we can
say FA dot F a - list for the recipe
book now the menu itself
this can be fa fa - map - oh and this is
just gonna be a map I think that looks
pretty good for a menu it actually looks
quite a bit like a menu you'll see in a
second now we could say I dot F a dot F
a - shopping - cart
well shopping cart okay look so I'm
gonna make this unordered list look a
little bit more presentable usually I
like to break out things like this if
it's getting a little too crazy here
nothing too fancy just making it easier
to read since I have wrapping on okay so
we now have these lists and links like
so now we want to go ahead and use this
side nav however this is where our
layouts are going to come into handy
because at this point we have these two
layouts the main lay on the home layout
and they're not that different but now
we want to include the sidebar in to our
main layout and obviously we don't want
it in our home page because this is
something we only want accessible to
users that are logged in so even though
we haven't run that logic yet to do that
let's go ahead and say greater than side
nav and we will now have our sidebar
if we head back to our site you can now
see this lovely side navigation that I
have quickly thrown together for you and
you could see is looking pretty good if
we make this smaller it's even
responsive heads down here like so make
it bigger there we go
although right now you see it is
covering up this side of the page
because this is position fixed let's go
ahead and fix that by adding a clasp to
our main right here and we can say class
equals main - layout now this should fix
any of those issues upon refresh you now
see we have this nice little area here
and we have the ability to change our
routes of course if you click any of
these routes it's gonna give you an
error there was no path for this route
so until we create those routes don't
worry about these links but it looks
quite a bit nicer another thing I want
to do is break out this header into its
own a partial as well so we had this
partials and actually might be more
appropriate for the side nav to live
into partials let's go ahead and do that
and this is like honestly one of my
favorite parts of meteor I know this
sounds ridiculous but I can open and
finder here I can drag this side nav dot
HTML into partials and this site doesn't
care it doesn't it just doesn't care I
don't have to tell it anywhere I don't
have to reference it anywhere I don't
have to change your path on another file
I do want to make sure I close this
before saving it or else it's gonna do
resave it but now you can see I have the
side nav and partials that makes more
sense right and it was really easy okay
so let's make a new file make a new
partial and it's just going to be header
HTML and template you guessed it the
name is going to be header with a
capital H that's how I'm doing it okay
and now inside of the header template
simply just grab everything from the
main layout header there we go paste it
in here
like so nice and easy now we can
reference this as header and you might
wonder you know why is that necessary
well now in our main layout our home
layout we can use the same template tag
here and we only have to edit the header
in one spot is just a don't repeat
yourself sort of thing and it's a common
practice to be using partials for that
sort of thing now when we go to any page
on our site it should have the header
just like we remember it although of
course we need to route to a proper
position if we come home here you can
see organize your meals eventually when
you're logged in it will automatically
redirect you to recipe book where you
have your side navigation here perfect
so we now have the styles and those
things looking infinitely better and we
now have what's coming together as
what's a nice-looking web application
now there's a lot of things to fix for
instance we are on the recipe book page
but there's no indication so we need to
add an active state to these routes we
want to start our actual listing for our
recipes so we're not just looking at
them inside of our meteor toys mangal
but either way things are really coming
together so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you like our
videos head over to store that level up
tutorials calm and check out what we
have going on there and help support the
creation of free tutorials so as always
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
