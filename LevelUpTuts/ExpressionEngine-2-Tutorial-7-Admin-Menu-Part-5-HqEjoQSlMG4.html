up Tut's today we're gonna level up our
expression engine skills this is
tutorial number seven and today we're
gonna try to wrap up the admin menu but
before we do that I want to encourage
everyone to subscribe to our YouTube
channel alright admin we have gone over
channel administration so now we're just
gonna sort of fly over some of the
highlights for the remaining items and
then move on so let's go into general
configuration and on this page what
we're gonna see is basically just a
review of the items that were
automatically filled out by the system
during the installation process so you
know the name of our site the you know
where it lives where the theme folder
lives where the the URL the theme folder
the path the server path of where the
theme folder is one thing to point out
about this is that when your site say
you develop locally on your on your
website or maybe you develop it on like
a on a development server you know this
is one of those paths that will change
once you move it over to wherever that
sites going to live once it goes live so
just maybe make a mental note this is
like one of those paths that you need to
that you'll need to change okay and
default control panel theme note that
maybe you don't remember this but the
default expression engine to theme is
this pink thing and then the corporate
one is this blue and green thing that I
have right here so it says that we're
using default well but actually that's
not what it's saying is the default for
a new user is the default theme but this
that is a member by member setting so
while the default is set to that any
user can
can change theirs if they have that
permission and then this new version
AutoCheck yes know what that does is by
default it's on yes and what that will
do is anytime expression engine posts a
new update to your system right here in
this area it will say you know there's a
new update it's you know 4.0.1 and then
you know sort of notifying your user to
to update it some people some developers
maybe will take that off after the site
is launched because what will happen is
you know your users of this the users of
the site will see it eventually and
maybe they'll get confused or scared or
something and so it is it is something
that can be turned off and actually that
was all we're gonna cover in the submit
menu so let's go back up to admin
localization within here you can set
your time zone
you can also set you know whether or not
you're in a daylight savings and so what
will happen is if this setting is
incorrect and if you're in a time zone
that hat that honors daylight savings
then post will be an hour wrong and
people may be confused so just note that
that setting is here under system
administration there's a couple things
here that are worth pointing out there's
output and debugging under this this is
where you can do just a couple of things
the defaults actually look like this to
start with gzip not enabled which I
always just enable it and the only other
one that I when we play around with here
is the display template debugging I set
that to yes like it says here if it's
enabled soup administration's super
administrators
we will see some pretty useful
information on the bottom of the screen
while building out templates or viewing
rendered pages so if you're having
issues or you know want to know like how
fast at a page render like what is it
you know what processes are taking place
in the background you know you you can
set this to yes so I'm gonna leave it to
yes just so I can point it out in
another video otherwise apply just
forget so I'm go ahead and submit that
back to admin menu one thing that I'll
point out about the search log
configuration is or what this even means
an expression engine there's a search
log so if you're using expression engine
to search you're able to track you know
what people are searching on for your
site which is useful for a variety of
reasons but also I mean one one cool
thing about it is obviously you can see
like what do people looking for on my
site so maybe you have a blog and you
find out that people are always looking
for this type of thing well maybe now
you know that you should make more posts
about that because that's really
interesting to people so that's
something that you can sort of use again
with your like Google Analytics or
whatever analytical software you use to
give your users a better experience but
here we have you know it's enabled by
default and also saves the last fifth
searches that's probably enough but it
also doesn't hurt a whole lot to
increase that to something higher but
500 is probably fine but I'm just going
to change mine
and then under security and privacy
there's a couple different settings here
which you guys can kind of dive into if
you're interested but there are some so
if you're having comments there's some
CAPTCHA preferences if you're using
expression engines CAPTCHA there's also
some security items that here's where
you control how sessions are stored or
kept alive by expression engine so a
control panel session type that's what
I'm doing right now so I'm an
administrator and I have access to the
control panel that's stored by a session
ID and also it stores of cookie user
sessions right here by default it's just
cookies but it could be by session or it
could be both we're not really gonna
dive into any this other stuff here but
there's more like user settings that can
be set like for example you know what's
the maximum or the minimum user length
and what is the minimum password length
I mean that's just some some basic
security things that you can change if
if you have multiple users to your site
or many users to your site
let's hit submit even though I didn't
really change anything and that's it
that's the entire admin menu thanks a
lot for watching really appreciate it
again
