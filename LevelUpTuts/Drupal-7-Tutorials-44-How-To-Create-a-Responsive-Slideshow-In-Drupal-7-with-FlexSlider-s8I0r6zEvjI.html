of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to use a responsive a slide show
called flex slider if you recall before
we had the slide show and it works great
right let's actually change something in
it though
let's uh let's go to our image and let's
change this to be a larger image I think
like project test was pretty big okay so
let's select all yeah so this is nice
it's nice and big enough okay cool so
let's save this and this is in our main
cool so here's our big big slideshow
it's doing its thing right okay well
let's let's see if we went into a
different theme let's say we have a
responsive theme luckily I've been
building a theme myself for my website
and I have that on here let's just
enable it set default okay so this is a
theme that I've been building for my
website and as you can see actually I'm
sorry let's turn this on this block we
don't have this turn down I'm just going
to turn the slideshow on in the main
content should be a slideshow we're
going to set content okay
okay so as you can see here we now have
the slide show it's thrown onto our page
doesn't look great because of course
this theme wasn't designed to have the
slide show here I just sort of threw it
on but um let's actually check this out
so let's say you have a site and this
site is responsive so it's going to
respond to your browser or sighs you
know to accommodate four different
browser widths or even mobile verse non
mobile desktop whatever laptop tablet
whatever you got so as you can see as
the browser window changes things sort
of just right here so here's a break
point where things have adjusted but the
slide show is not adjusted and even
further it's going to keep going getting
worse and worse and worse and it's
because cycle is not built to respond to
something like this responsive web
design whatever so we need something
different for that if your site's
responsive which I would recommend that
you make your site's responsive then
you're going to need something different
that's not just jQuery cycle you're
luckily there's a jquery plugin called
flex slider and also luckily there is a
module called flex slider for drupal and
what this does is it not only includes
the flex slider module but it also
includes the views slideshow
flex slider module and that allows you
to connect to the flex letter within the
same slideshow interface that we were
using before so I'm just going to grab
and I'm going to throw this flex letter
module in here and I come back to our
site you go to modules and we're going
to install this okay so we're just kind
of tied flex okay
and ones I'm going to use them a grab
flex letter which is the main module and
then I'm going to grab a flex slider
views slideshow okay
let's save configuration for that and
then now we should be able to go into
our slideshow let's click back out of
here let's grab the gear edit our view
and then now when we have our slideshow
settings we'll leave this on to
slideshow and we can select flex slider
from here okay and let's leave controls
on
and we'll just keep those wait here
options default capturing whatever we
don't apply to all displays okay so if
you'll notice here we have our slideshow
but again it's not working if you
remember last time we had to go in and
add the library as well so for this we
have to get the library you can get this
at github and for this one just download
and I'm going to throw this into my
libraries okay so we're going to want to
doubt we're going to drag this flex
sliders into our library and we're just
going to change this name just say flex
letter flex slider turn okay
now let's actually go back to our view
here at add view or not okay let's go
ahead of you okay we don't have to
really go in here
I'm just making sure we didn't forget
anything okay controls everything
perfect okay so now we scroll down and
we have our flex slider see here it's
added these buttons on here you can sort
of configure that yourself actually
let's go back to configuration and let's
change that so over in configuration we
can find the Flex slider configuration
it's under here under media flex slider
and we're going to select default so
that's the one we're editing and let's
check this out we don't want to use
those buttons navigation and control
settings
yeah sure will you leave keyboard mouse
wheel navigation on shouldn't turn the
mouse wheel navigation off because it's
sort of annoying to me but of course you
may want to use it whatever Advanced
Options Kent
pay a project test okay
so cool this is fine if we want to get
rid of those images we'll just have to
CSS it out it's no big deal
going back to our slideshow settings
skin is a default slide option set again
default no caption field if we want to
add a caption field you could import
your body text as a summary and have
that be a caption you could suck this as
being the caption field
okay controls cold perfect
alright let's save this now we have our
slideshow here right you know this one
these default options are a little silly
with this like white border it's like
something you always have to turn off
when you immediately turn on flex slider
but it's no big deal we have a slideshow
working it's fading and let's see what
happens when we adjust our browser size
so here it just had a breakpoint and it
changed Sheffield and the slideshow even
still fits the page we change it again
still fits down to mobile all the way
down still fits cool and then so you can
use CSS to really skin it if you need to
to change it and and here we have a
working jQuery slideshow that is
flexible to your page width
