up tutorials and in this video I'm going
to be showing you a package that gives
you all of the functionality you need
when working with git directly within
Adam so we don't have to go to another
terminal application or anything like
that we can manage our repo directly in
Adam so let's get going on that right
now now for many developers get
integration is sort of an essential
feature for a nice text editor and Adam
is no exception to that so if we head to
packages in our preferences and we go to
install here
we can search for a get package if you
just type in and get GI T you'll see
some of the most popular ones and it
should be completely obvious which is a
highly used package here we have one
with 400,000 installs and it's version
5.9 so as you can see there's a lot of
work being done into it and of course a
lot of people are using it if we select
this you can see it basically gives us
access to get commands directly from
within our text editor which is really
what you would want from a package like
this so as you can see you have some
basic options here where we have the
amount of commits to show you can say
pull before push could have a verbose
commit if you want all sorts of nice
stuff here and in fact you even have
some key bindings so that you could have
the get menu itself now we have some
other things like tab legs show
Invisibles and we have our diff settings
down here where we can auto indent and
have tab lengths and stuff like that
let's just go ahead and get into this so
I have a project here that isn't
actually being tracked by get right now
command shift P we can just type Sibley
get and if you see we have git plus log
n plus run ad in it since there's no
project here let's go ahead and do get
plus in it
as you can see we have a message down
and initialized a repository in this
current directory so we now have all of
our files are green over here in our
left column now what does that mean
let's go ahead and actually modify one
of these files I'm just going to simply
add a comment as you can see when upon
adding this comment nothing's changed
over here there's still all green and
now what does that mean exactly so we'll
see if these files change from green to
something else as we go here let's go
ahead and try to add a file we can do
shift command P then type git add and
you'll notice we have this shift command
a will allow us to just run this command
directly so instead of running this from
this command pane which we could do
let's just do shift command a and you'll
notice we get a message down here saying
it's added the index.html file now since
this is a new project we probably want
to add all of them so let's come in to
git add and let's add all
okay so it added all of the files let's
go ahead and commit them now so I'm
going to guess that it is shift
commanded see we have a commit message
here these are all the files that are
going to be committed and we can just
simply type in a message so we can say
initial
commit and then we can save that now
you'll notice after saving it
immediately closes and we have our
little log here
telling us exactly what happened now
you'll notice that something interesting
happened our files are no longer green
in the left-hand column anymore because
they've been committed let's go ahead
and make a modification again to this
index file we can save this you'll see
that it's now yellow it's yellow because
it has been modified after it's been
added to the repository
so now we have changes that we need to
commit now to commit this change we can
once do command shift see once more we
can just say that we removed
comment and save this and as you can see
our color has now been changed back
to wait over here and we've committed
this
have a remote location for this repo and
I'm not necessarily going to make one
just for this video now if we were to
say get push let's go ahead and select
push here we'd be able to paste in our
remote repo address here and have it
push up if you had multiple different
remote repos you would have a list here
in which you could actually push two
different ones if you chose so as you
can see here I'm not going to go over a
complete introduction to using git in
general this package for atom really
contains everything you'll need to
manage your repos directly in atom I
highly recommend it get - plus for all
your git and atom needs as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials you can
hit me up on Twitter or Facebook at
level up tutorials or leave a comment
the video I always love to hear from you
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
