of tutorials and in this video we're
gonna create our very first animation in
principle and you're gonna be just
amazed at how easy this is it's gonna be
just super effortless and you're gonna
be really surprised just how much you
can accomplish quickly within principle
let's get going on that now okay so
another way of principle downloaded and
added to our dock we can just go ahead
and simply select it now if this is your
first time opening principle it will
prompt you for either to continue your
trial or enter a serial since I have
purchased principal I don't need to do
that anymore and I just have the full
version here and this is what it will
then look like now what's great about
this is that this should feel very
familiar if you've used sketcher any of
these apps before I mean even any mini
iOS apps have a very similar sort of
just key interface right where we have
our tools up top here we have some
information and we have artboards and
layers over here on the left and we have
our canvases and we have our artboard
here in the center now instantly you'll
notice a few interesting things we have
like tutorials up here and now where
this differs from sketch is that we have
this green outline around here which
we'll cover more and we have this
lightning bolt here now if we select
this lightning bolt you'll see a whole
bunch options pop up we have tap long
press scroll begins scroll release
scroll and drag begin dragon and touch
up touch down so what's great about
these is these are essentially the
triggers that are going to trigger an
animation from one artboard to another
and that's really how you need to think
of this each artboard you make is going
to be a state of your animation so for
instance if we wanted to animate a
rectangle growing in size just simply
growing in size one thing we can do is
first go ahead and draw a rectangle we
can do that by selecting rectangle up
top here and you'll notice here we have
our rectangle
I can adjust its size you know it does
some snapping here for us and if you
don't want to use that dragging snapping
you can always use the alignment tools
in the top left select align Center
Center or center Center horizontal and
as you can see here we have a rectangle
now what I want this to happen is I want
when I click on it I want this to spring
open into nearly the full width of this
canvas okay so now that we have this
let's just go ahead and select the
artboard itself you can do that by
clicking on this white space you'll see
that we have these borders here or if
you wanted to you can select it in the
layers over here on the left with the
artboards selected we can do command D
to duplicate or you can right-click on
it and duplicate artboard okay so at
this point I want to zoom out a little
bit
we have to artboards by the way if you
hold space just like many other
applications you'll get this grabby hand
so like illustrator or Photoshop or
sketch you hold the space button click
and drag you can move yourself around
here okay
so we have these two Art boards you'll
now notice the green outline is around
the one right here
the green outline simply just presents
the one that's selected or the one that
we're working within you'll notice even
when the layer is selected that
particular artboard has the green
outline okay so like I said we want to
think of each of these artboards as sort
of a state of our animation if you're
used to working in a sort of animation
this is sort of a end frame right not
necessarily a keyframe because we can do
some keyframes this is at the end of a
particular state of animation so let's
go ahead and at this point I can
actually just click to make this bigger
we could do this mathematically by
adjusting the values over here in the
info bar but right now this is just a
quick demo okay so I'm just gonna drag
it and make it larger okay super cool
now what we want to do is
we want to animate from this state to
this state on click you'll notice we
have this window right here that sort of
been hanging out we haven't mentioned it
for a reason you'll notice when I click
this back arrow it has the first frame
and we have this little cursor we also
have this little camera here that allows
us to record this this is essentially
we're going to be seeing all of our
animations in action so you'll probably
want to have this somewhere visible
almost all times unless you sort of know
what you're doing so as you can see here
it starts at this initial state if I
were to select this you can now see that
this is what's present here in our
animation window but obviously we want
this to actually animate because that's
the purpose of this application let's go
ahead and select this square select this
lightning bolt and let's select tap now
you'll notice something interesting
happened it created a third artboard for
us with the current state now simply by
selecting to happen this is the default
functionality when you click an action
it's going to create an artboard for you
with a new state and that can be really
handy however we already had the end
state and we essentially just wanted to
connect this state to this state so
let's go ahead and actually delete
artboard number three and let's try this
again this is one of the cooler features
of this application we can now select
the lightning bolt select tap but
instead of just clicking it click and
drag and you'll notice we have this neat
nice little arrow here and we can drag
and say on tap go to artboard two and we
now have an arrow up top indicating an
animation so this is pretty magical it's
insanely easy but we can actually set up
an animation and this arrow indicates
that this is animating into this let's
go ahead and check out how this works
here in our animation pane I can
actually make this quite a bit larger
and let's go ahead and click this
refresh and now what we do is we can
just simply tap on the square and you'll
notice a grow
I can click the rewind button and do it
again super cool okay so in addition to
that we can also really tweak this
animation right notice how everything is
defaults if we select this layer tap
arrow right here this essentially saying
hey if we tap on layer which is the name
of this layer then go ahead and do this
animation you'll see we have a whole
bunch of properties for instance we have
X width and height and we have some what
look like timelines here now these are
very similar if you've ever used After
Effects or anything like that they have
these diamonds to sort of indicate a key
for each individual property that
essentially means the start value the
end value and if we wanted this
animation to take longer we could drag
all of these out to one second now I'm
gonna be going over all of the stuff in
much greater detail as we go so don't
worry about it too much
the only thing I want to focus on right
now is essentially you click this layer
tap and it brings up this layers menu
now another way you can bring this up is
simply by clicking this animate button
you can see they pop up right here if we
wanted to change the easing to make it
more of a spring we can select where it
says default here and just select spring
now let's go ahead and do that for all
of these properties again easing says
something that I'm gonna be talking
considerably more about as we go so do
not worry if none of this makes sense to
you in terms of easing but as you can
see here simply by selecting spring here
we're now going to have a nice springing
animation to see this in action let's
head back here click our rewind select
this and you can see it now bounces
right there's a little bit of a little
bit more personality there it Springs
open now every single time we're
clicking this we're having to click this
rewind button to get it to go back how
about we want to have this do the
opposite when you click on this now it
should go back so again we can select
our square select our lightning
Boult and click-and-drag tap over to our
artboard 1 and now when we select this
goes back and just like that you've
created an interactive animation and it
has really nice easing patterns already
in everything right I mean this was
extremely simple and you had to do
hardly anything right we created a
rectangle two artboards and dragged some
arrows and all of a sudden we have this
working animation that we could export
and show off on dribble if we wanted to
obviously this isn't something that you
would want to show off it's not that
cool but this goes to show you just how
insanely easy it is to create really
super cool things with principle so in
the next video we're gonna be diving in
a little bit more into the tools that we
have available we're gonna be talking
about sort of the info bar and then
we're gonna be diving more into the
animation menu we're going to be talking
about easing z' we're gonna be talking
about different styles of interactions
we're gonna be talking about different
layers and groups and stuff like that
and we're gonna be covering importing
documents directly from sketch if you
don't have sketch don't worry about it
because you can always just make your
animations directly in principle if
you'd like however working in an
application like sketch is something
that many people already do and you
maybe can just convert some of you
already created designs into super cool
animations all right so I'm really
excited to keep going I love principle
it's an application I use all the time I
think you're really going to like it as
well
creating really awesome animated
interfaces so as always this is Scott
with LevelUp tutorials if you want extra
content for this series I want to be
covering some of my very most favorite
inspiration items that I found on the
Facebook group I'm gonna be covering
exactly how the creator made them I'm
gonna be showing you exactly how we can
recreate them from scratch and you're
gonna be building some just incredible
stuff so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if have any questions
or comments they become in the video
room yet that level up tutorials on
Twitter
or Facebook had to store doubt level up
tutorials and help support the creation
of these free tutorials thanks so much
for watching and I'll see in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
