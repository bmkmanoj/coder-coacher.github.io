up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you the easiest possible way
to get started with a blog now this
isn't going to be the most customizable
full-featured experience but it's going
to be a really nice editing experience
it's going to be a really nice clean
design easy to read easy to find and
easy to get started so with that said
let's get started right now so the
easiest possible way to set up a blog
period is using medium.com now I have no
allegiance or anything to medium I just
know that this is the quickest and
easiest way to get started up and
running and medium is nice because it
has a large community of other people
writing blog posts now there are several
downsides to using medium which we'll
get into in a second and more
importantly we're going to cover
alternatives to using medium as well so
let's go ahead and first what we want to
do is head to medium.com and you're
gonna go ahead and click sign in or sign
up now you can log in with Google
Twitter or any of this stuff and we can
just say let's go ahead and sign in with
Google I'll select my level up tuts
account and let's sign in and allow this
and just like that it's going to go
ahead and get my information my full
name level up Hutt's username I can
change this we can just change this to
level up tuts
apparently that's not available for some
reason even though I don't own it but we
could say level up tutorials okay and
looks like that's just fine let's go
ahead and create the account now at this
point you'll want to go ahead and pick
some of the topics you're interested in
so let's go ahead I'm gonna select
design let's maybe look for like
technology or or something like that
maybe these aren't exactly alphabetical
so okay design the technology sure let's
go ahead and click continue to next step
and it's gonna give you an option to
follow some people I'm gonna go ahead
and just click finish I don't really
want to follow any people at the moment
I just want to build
Blagh okay so now that we are here let's
go ahead and write a story or a blog
post for that matter let's click this
write a story and we can say title and
we can say the easiest way to build a
blog and you can just say head to
medium.com and sign up I hope this
doesn't sound too much like an
advertisement for medium as you can tell
I don't even have a blog on here so I'm
not I'm not exactly promoting this or
trying to promote this or something but
as you can see here this is just super
easy right so in no time at all I mean
it's probably less than a minute we
signed up we signed in and we're
creating our very first blog post we
have a title and some text now they have
some keyboard shortcuts here for
instance if we want to change this and
turn this into a bigger headline you can
do command alt + 1 you can see it's now
a level 1 heading a smaller heading is
command alt 2 command alt 5 is going to
be a quote now let's see some other
shortcuts here we can always make things
bold by doing command B let's actually
select this line command B is bold now
you can see here even when I do that
sometimes we now have this formatting if
you select the line of text this
formatting comes up and you can turn
this into a double quote like a block
quote a single quote which is just like
an indented thing you could have this be
where we have this drop title or this
drop character I believe that's the name
you could turn it into a link so you can
paste your link in here and the one
thing you're gonna notice instantly
about this interface is just how easy it
is I know a lot of the other blogs that
we'll be showing in this later on in
this series even the more customizable
ones will have maybe more tools and I
say maybe because it it is a maybe here
but they're not going to have it be this
nice
and I don't want to sound like I'm
advertising their system is just really
nice now there's some also advanced
keyboard shortcuts if you want to link
to another account you can always do at
and then it's going to search for
different accounts it's just like
Facebook or Twitter any of that stuff
like you're used to and we can add a
command enter to add a separator just to
add a little bit more you can do command
alt 6 and start typing some code here so
we could say life dot push code ok and
as you can see here it all formats it
really nicely for you so other than
keyboard shortcuts advanced keyboard
shortcuts and you can see over here we
have this plus button where you can
click to add an image you can add a
YouTube Vimeo video any of that stuff
you can always hit escape to cancel out
but really these tools are gonna be like
just really super easy and when we hit
publish we can hit publish right here do
we want to add a tag now but I do want
to change the visibility I don't really
need this to be public so I'm gonna
click unlisted click Save and scheduling
none you can always schedule is to go
live at a certain point and we can give
this a specific license or tag this up
with up to five different tags so it
could potentially be found on medium.com
or just increase its findability now
medium is not going to be the place to
have your own platform you'll notice I
hit publish there and we instantly have
this super nice blog post where we can
share this link you can share it with
any of these share tools you can comment
on it by just selecting text and saying
hey let me leave a comment I mean like I
said here medium is the quickest and
easiest way to get a nice-looking blog
that said this is what you look like
pretty much and you'll know if we ever
need to come back into this blog post we
can always just hit edit and change some
things about this if we'd like and so
there's a lot of things to explore here
but in the end this isn't going to be
your most customizable and some things
that you'll notice you
we have this medium blog post but it's
tied to my user account it's within
medium.com and the URL if we go to the
level up head section of medium is like
at level of tutorials and medium comm
and so some of these things might not be
a big deal but it depends on what the
purpose of your blog is if you're in
this to perhaps make some advertising
money or to start your own platform this
might not be the way to go I think the
strongest key feature for medium is its
findability and is easiness to read so
if you are looking to promote yourself
or your brand in a way that's going to
maybe draw people into who you are so
that you can have a wider reach and have
access to more people that way I think
medium is definitely the way to go but
if you want to have advertising if you
want to have a newsletter sort of set up
if you want to have potentially an
ecosystem where you're having other
people post or revision systems where
other people are looking in approving
content then I'm going to go and say
medium is probably not what you're
looking for so if you're looking for a
blog that you're probably going to build
a business on then I would say medium
calm no good if you're looking for a
blog just to promote yourself or promote
your writing medium calm super good so
this is the easiest way to build a blog
now in the remaining videos of the
series we're gonna be a we're gonna dive
into more and more customizable
options for different blog platforms I'm
gonna show you things like Squarespace
I'm gonna show you things like Wix I'm
gonna show you things like wordpress.org
as well as WordPress running on your own
hosting platform so you have access to
all the code and you can do any of your
customizable stuff that you absolutely
want and I'm going to get into some
other newer platforms like Ghost
basically we're gonna cover all of the
different ways that you could make a
blog and along the way I'm going to talk
about there plus and minuses so like I
said at mediacom easiest quickest way to
get up and running with your own blog
least customizable as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
want to help support the creation of
these free tutorials as well as have
access to early
videos released by level up tutorials
had to stored at level of tutorials
dot-com and you can purchase a
subscription to level up tutorials
become a pro and get access to a whole
bunch of videos before they're released
and get 20% off the level up store where
we have some really excellent next level
series that I'm going to be producing
more and more of just a really high
quality in-depth tutorial series so as
