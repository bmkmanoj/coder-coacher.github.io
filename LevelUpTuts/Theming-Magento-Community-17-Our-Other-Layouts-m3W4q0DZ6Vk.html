up tuts and today I'm gonna show you how
to take your a template that we're using
on the home page and apply it to the
rest of your sites if you'll notice the
header or the footer the nav the stuff
that gets repeated across sites is gonna
be fine on every page but what happens
on other pages and even better than fine
they're going to be great what happens
on other pages so let's check out let's
check out the customer service page okay
so this is just madness here we have one
single column and has no idea what to do
likewise on our furniture page which is
also something a little bit different it
has no idea what to do as well so I
think one thing we need to do is know
exactly what templates these pages are
using so it's always I'm going to go to
system and configuration
developer and then set my configuration
scope to be main website I'm going to
turn our developers tool boxes and I'm
gonna see what templates these are using
at the moment okay I'm gonna refresh
this page and it looks like as we can
see here this is using page three
columns what did our privacy our
customer service page use i'm bevvan
seizing three columns as well so we have
these pages let's actually see if we can
have one more when that's using one
column okay this one is using one column
so we have these templates they're
already in existence and when you tell
they're in existence because pages are
using them but more importantly they're
in our default folder and pages unless
you tell them otherwise you're going to
want to use these so we can go to all
those pages and tell them to use the
same template but you don't want to have
different options you're gonna have left
column right column one column whatever
so let's look at our theme our theme we
have two columns right in the default
theme they have one column two columns
left and three columns
P HTML and we're just going to grab all
three of those and we're gonna put it in
our theme of course going to copy these
as always and throw it into our page
directory where they
we're sorry I took them into the HTML by
accident let's move these up a level
thanks finder okay let's put these in
the page director where they belong and
let's open them up in sublime text let's
open all of them up
great okay well it decided to not do
that let's do something a little bit
differently here two columns left we're
gonna have this open as a tab and the
close to these other tabs we don't need
them right now and we won't need them
for the remainder of this tutorial here
so I'm going to grab the three columns
throw it up here as well and the one
column throw it up here just so we can
have them all open and I'm going to
change my view here I'm going to change
the view to do layout and two columns so
this right template is the one that we
were using before I had the sidebar to
get some extra space here okay this two
columns right is the one we were using
before we want to take the styles that
we used for this which wasn't a whole
lot of craziness but we won't apply them
to these other templates since two
columns left is going to be the most
similar let's pull it over here and we
can compare them first off we see this
doctype the stuffs all different here
I'm gonna grab everything from this
doctype to the head I'm just going to
replace this code and likewise so we
have we can we can line these up sort of
here but we have a div class of wrapper
and then we have global analysis head we
had this class of page that we actually
deleted so I'm going to delete this as
well right here okay so these are
getting a little more similar and we had
this this div that was main container we
gave it just a class of container and
we're gonna do that again here we're
gonna change this to column left we're
gonna get rid of that as well and just
give another clear fix and for this new
class of main we'll leave it like that
column main it's done a thirteen column
well this is column left we're gonna do
the same here we're gonna do thirteen
columns column main and for the sidebar
this column left it's also going to be
sidebar three columns
and we're just gonna paste this in here
okay and one thing you might be thinking
is okay well if these look the same how
is this gonna be left in this one going
to be or this one it's going to be right
and this one's going to be left well the
way that magenta was doing it their
default themes they had this floating
left in this floating right and here
they had this floating right in this
floating left or than both floating left
either way we're not going to be doing
it that way we're using skeleton so we
want this column left to actually come
before our main column in our theme
right here okay so let's get up then
okay so now we have what should be the
same except for we had this be a section
before c-section and then we want this
on the right bar we want this to be in a
side or this left bar I'm sorry
okay cool so now things are looking
really similar in fact this is all we
need to do for this file let's check out
our pages see what's changed first we
want to turn off this configuration
settings dhruv done okay now we want we
want something that's going to be using
this layout let's pick this furniture
page I'm going to go to catalog and
manage categories I'm going to change
this furniture ones specifically
furniture and we're going to custom
design you know layout updates I'm gonna
say two columns with the left bar and it
really quick I need to select this
custom design level of default and say
this great and now we have an opposite
what we had before we have a two column
layout with a column on the left
come on the right first this is going to
require more CSS than this to get it
looking great but the basic layout is
here and if we just our page it's gonna
be responsive cool perfect awesome so
now we just need to take it to the last
two template files in roughly on our way
up so let's do the three columns first
because that's going to be the most
different and then one column because
it's going to be the easiest so I'm
going to come here get in and grab
everything the stock type this code
right above the head here throw it in
and now we have this page using html5
again I'm going to delete this page
class as we did before just like that
and I am going to change this main
container to just be container and then
this call 3 layout be clear fix and this
time we're gonna do something a little
bit different if both of our columns are
taking up a left and a right we're gonna
have to have the main take up something
different so before we had the left
sidebar go above the main wrapper we're
gonna be doing that again there using a
little different technique to have three
columns here I find this grid framework
to be a little bit better of a technique
especially for doing this
responsive using this skeleton frame
working that as well use it to our
advantage so this is going to be an
aside this is our left set this is our
left column we're going to have this via
the side and we're gonna have the
classes for this be the same as it was
before
sidebar three columns and we're not
going to worry about left because it
automatically is on the left although
maybe we could maybe we can leave the
left in there I take that back we want
to leave the left in there for trying to
key off anything inside of it but other
than that we shouldn't need it this div
the column wrapper is a going to be
actually this is going to be completely
gotten rid of because this didn't exist
in the previous template so content
wrapper is gone we have this column main
at the same level as our side here just
make sure all this is nice and clean
okay and this main column is going to be
a section and this div is going to be a
section okay and we're not going to
worry about the classes right now we're
gonna do this one first this right
column which is also an aside and then a
sign and this is going to have the same
sidebar three columns if you remember
our total column numbers were out of 16
16 minus 3 minus 3 is 10 so we're going
to have this main section column main
we're going to say 10 columns so now
this is going to be 10 3 3 equals 16
we should have a three column pay chair
so let's check out one of our three
column pages that we're using this and
we can go to let's say electronics I
believe was using it so now I click down
electronics we have three columns just
like we would have in the open the
gentle design however these columns are
responsive to the width of your site and
are going to allow for better mobile
experience okay last one is one column
shouldn't take any time at all if you
remember what we did before as always
we're gonna grab this stuff throw it up
top here delete the page because these
templates are mostly the same if you're
working off of these that's cool another
thing you could have done from the start
was build out your own template and then
fill it in with their code instead of
modifying their code you know either way
it works depending on how custom you
have to make it if it has to be very
similar to Magento's default site you
might as well just edit theirs and take
it from there
this certainly works fine for this
particular instance so I'm just gonna
add a class of container class of clear
fix and then our class of main and then
our section column main this time is
going to be getting a class of nope it's
going to be getting a class of 16 that
columns so 6 teen columns save this and
let's find a page so it's using this one
column layout actually let's go to a
pair out and it'll tell Apparel to use a
one column layout just for fun so we can
see that action custom design we're
gonna use parent settings applied
products we're gonna say you use Magento
or use a level up and one column save
this refresh it's now using one column
it's responsive I mean it's not great we
wouldn't want to do this normally but we
have all of our templates ready to go so
in between this tutorial next I'm gonna
do some styling to get these things
looking right if you need help with that
let me know and I will make tutorial
videos to show you how to style these up
and then grid it a little bit better but
I'm basically going to get this
presentable so we can do some real great
Magento development here there's always
this is Scott with level up tons if you
have any questions or comments blues
