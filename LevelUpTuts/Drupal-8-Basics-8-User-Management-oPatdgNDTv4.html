up tutorials in this video we'll be
talking about user management how to
create new users how to manage your
users and how to see who's registered
for your site so let's get started now
so now that we've talked a bit about
content publishing content and sort of
the workflow around that oh it's now
time to talk about user accounts for
instance in the last video we wanted to
talk about revisions but we only had one
user so to get started we want to head
to people and now people is where you
will see anybody who is using it your
site as an account number now from here
we can add a user simply through an
interface like we would have with adding
content so we could add in their email
address here we could say Scott at level
of Tut's comm and this can be Scott now
I can give this person a password for
themselves and typically I would have
this password be something like changeme
and let them know that this password
needs to be updated so you can make this
password really super weak as long as
the user knows that they need to make
this a more secure password especially
if they're going to be an administrator
now you'll see by default their status
is going to be active which we want and
that their role is just going to be
authenticated user now the difference in
this case between authenticated user and
administrator is an authenticated user
does not have access to see any of this
administrative stuff now we can say be
an administrator and notify them of a
new accountant created now you might be
wondering I want them to be able to
update an ad post or maybe even create
posts but I don't want them to have
access to all this configuration stuff
well that's something we're going to get
into more with user roles in the next
video so as you can see we can add them
a picture if we'd like
contact settings sometimes own any of
that stuff and we can click create new
account
now as you can see a welcome message has
been delivered today user and if we go
to people you can see that Scott exists
here now I'm going to head to our site
in a non logged in window got a log in
I'm going to go to slash user or I would
click the login link in the top right
now as you can see this page is create a
new account to reset your password if we
were to create a new count it would not
give you the option of setting somebody
as an administrator now if we create an
account through this interface you could
always come to your people come here
edit and then make them an administrator
if you'd like however let's go ahead and
log in as this user I can say Scott and
enter the password and as you can see
this user has their own settings here so
their admin bar is all up here they have
access to everything you have access to
as an administrator now if this account
let's go ahead and make them not an
administrator I'm going to save this now
upon refreshing this page
you almost I don't have access to any of
that they have access to a my account
page which is really just some really
basic profile information but no
administrative tools ok well let's say
you want them to have access to be able
to create a new post but not actually
even publish it just create it then
another administrator will have to
review and publish the post in addition
you don't want to give them access to
structure appearance extend or any of
this stuff but you would like them to at
least have this admin toolbar well how
do we go about accomplishing that in the
next video we're going to be talking
about user roles we're gonna create a
new role and we're gonna assign some
permissions to that role so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorial so
