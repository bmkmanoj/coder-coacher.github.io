Tut's today we're going to pick up we're
left off with the free form module in
this tutorial we're going to cover
dynamically printing out content from a
freshly or newly created form entry so
let's go ahead and jump right on in and
hopefully that will make a little bit
more sense in a second so oh yeah also
please subscribe to our YouTube channel
we really appreciate all the viewers
that we've picked up recently and thanks
a lot for your interest and thanks for
watching
so the idea is that once a form is
submitted
currently they are taken to a page it
assess things but the idea here is what
we would want to do is pull actually
pull content say the name field on to
this page so for example what we'd want
to do is say thanks for your submission
Ben or whatever the name thought that
this person enters obviously this is a
pretty sort of the low-hanging fruit
result of doing something like this but
certainly you can do a lot more
difficult things as well but that's what
we're gonna do so what we need to do is
first need to edit the free form so
let's go into the template manager and
go into the index for contact and the
one thing that we're gonna have to
change on this page everything else is
fine what we need to do here is change
the return and what we need to change
the return to do is pass it a parameter
or a variable rather and that variable
is going to be the newly minted entry ID
and so the right syntax for that is
actually a little bit different so it's
percentage percentage sign entry ID
percentage percentage sign and this will
actually be replaced by soul space when
when the form is actually drawn on the
page so once that once it actually
receives an ID
it will then kick us to that page so
let's just go ahead and see what that
does just by itself I'm actually let me
zoom in here so you can see that
so that's presenters presented alright
so let's go ahead and update this I'm
just gonna submit you know what I didn't
do this in the last video but I'm just
gonna submit this without the required
fields and just so you guys see what
happened you get this ugly expression
engine page that says that these girls
weren't required are the fields that
required weren't filled in but that's
just what that looks like so you know we
didn't cover that last video I meant to
anyway so let's try to now follow the
rules and submit this oops and let's
just do three submit and what it did was
it actually took us to it did take us to
a different page it looks very similar
to that last thanks page which just says
things for the submission but what it
did differently is it passed it the
entry ID so now what we need to do is go
into the thanks page and customize that
template a little bit more so let's go
ahead and do that so I'm go back into
the template manager under their contact
template group I'm gonna select thanks
I'm going to you know what I'm gonna get
rid of this reform stuff I don't need we
don't need it repeated here it's just
sort of confusing and now instead of
just thanks for your submission we're
gonna make it save thanks for your
submission Ben so I'm gonna push us down
here the whitespace will all be removed
right that's just basic HTML stuff so
it's okay that there's extra space here
and now we're gonna do is we're going to
say expression engine free form instead
of form whereas the entries and the one
print parameter that I'm going to pass
it is the entry ID and what's tricky
about this and this is something that we
don't think we've covered yet but it is
absolutely vital to developing a
expression engine site is knowing that
you can actually pull information based
off of the URL so inside of this
parentheses I'm using segment underscore
three in this case and what that means
is I'm going to look at it's a segment
one this is segment two and this is
segment three so I'm going to do or what
this is saying is give me the
information from this segment and put it
in the value here so again what this is
saying is basically give me the eighth
entry so here's the eighth entry now
again just like the form tag this needs
to be closed as well so I'm just gonna
do it I'm thinking about it and again
what I wanted to do here he remembers I
want that output the name and this again
matches the shorthand that we had
defined a couple videos ago when we were
doing the setups for freeform so
remember there was name there was email
and there was comment so you know what
let's just do this so what's a name
let's do this actually I'll just change
this up just a wee bit
thanks for a submission ban your oops no
your email and that was alpha than that
he's the email that they had put here
and your comment let's do this
and then whatever what to say alright so
let's go ahead and see how we did here
it's close tree form freeform entries
okay cool looks good
so now if we go back and just refresh
this thing here you know thanks for your
submission Ben shaft your email address
oh I must own oh yeah here so here your
comment come in three yep and so it is
there and then just those things again
so obviously this is a wreck
style-wise but functionally it's working
we're pulling in the name we're pulling
in the email address we're pulling in
the comment so that is how you create a
diet dynamic contact form result page
using and displaying information from a
freshly created entry so thanks a lot
for watching
and again please remember to subscribe
to our YouTube feed so that you can stay
on top of when we upload new videos
