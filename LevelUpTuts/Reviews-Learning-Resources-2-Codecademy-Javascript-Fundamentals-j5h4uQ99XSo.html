of Tut's and today i'm going to be
giving you a review of code Academy's
javascript fundamentals course and we're
going to get back into tutorials really
soon however my computer was kernel
panicking all week on boot up and it
turns out with just a setting in the
bios and somehow got reset but as you
can see it's back but i didn't have any
time to prepare anything so in i always
have these reviews sort of in the back
of my mind ones i want to do so what
we're going to do is we're going to go
through the javascript fundamentals
course in code Academy I'm going to tell
you what I think about it okay so you
might be wondering who this is courses
for and I found that if you're somebody
who has maybe experience using jQuery
plugins you've written some jQuery but
you haven't really had the full
experience with a javascript from the
beginning or you haven't you know really
gotten into the foundations of
JavaScript this course would be perfect
for you also if you've never done any
programming at all I'm you know I think
it's even great starting here because
the very first thing you do get started
as you can see what i'm going to click
here it's basically a like this in a
code editor here where you basically
just have like a terminal window where
you can type your code and it's going to
run so in this case it says type a the
word or your name with quotes around it
like this so you type your name if i can
do that and hit enter it outputs it
right so now you're going to say oh
what's your name quotes length and now
it's going to give you the length of
your name so it starts at the very very
basics but by the end of it once you go
through all of these lessons it gets
into you know more complex things you
end up building a pretty complex game of
blackjack you get into object-oriented
programming arrays and loops and even
recursion and then you build a more
complex version of the blackjack game in
the end using recursion near loops
arrays pretty much all of the skills
that you've learned throughout this
whole thing as you can see there are a
ton of exercises here so not only do you
get the learning
where you get to start at the beginning
and it teaches you programming
fundamentals you also get the the end of
this by the time you've done you've
completed this you'll have a greater
understanding of JavaScript and even if
you need to write jquery you might even
see instances where it makes more sense
to write just plain old JavaScript and
and it just might open your mind to how
things work a little bit and you can
even get into writing your custom
JavaScript code all the time and I
should point out the most important part
it's all free just sign up for account
it's free no hidden caches or anything
just go and do it all the lessons are
there so in another example let's just
go into one of these more complex ones
so you can see exactly a little bit
stuff that they get on it later in the
course so I'll just go into this loops 1
i'm not exactly sure there's you know
pretty much any of these lessons are
good so looping through a raise so in
here you actually have some JavaScript
code and it gives you you know some
setup and then in bold text there's
going to be the what you're trying to
accomplish so here print out all the
items in the array using console.log and
this is not sure where to begin you know
you can see the exercise hint so
sometimes they have these well I think
usually they have these show hints
that's going to give you a little bit
more of a background if it's been too
long and you didn't remember quite where
you were also this color is really nice
you can save different versions of your
code let's say if i delete this save it
I now have a different version I can go
back and forth between or if you mess it
up beyond repair you can always click
reset and it's going to take the the
course back to the code that they
originally give you see the reason why I
had a bunch of extra code was is because
I had completed this lesson already and
it saves all that completed code in
there so let's let's show you something
a little bit harder here so they want
you to go through this array you know
using a loop to get all the items in
this array so you could do different
things so as you can see here I just did
a basic while loop I have you know just
iterating through this array I'm going
to print everything so
click run it runs your code council logs
everything down here and then it tells
you if it's correct or if it's wrong
because if it's wrong it usually gives
you some pretty helpful information I
think if there's any downside about code
Academy as a tool in general is it the
feedback that it gives you isn't always
the best but because of that right up
top here you have this questions and
answers forum and if you go there people
can usually you can either post your co
to you I'm sure you can look through
other people's code and and see exactly
what you are doing wrong but I would
recommend sort of really you know
cramming down and seeing exactly what
you could have done wrong before doing
that because you'll learn much better
and if you click next exercise it's
going to take you to the next one okay
so like I said uh you know if you have
experience with JavaScript and you just
want to touch up or let's say your
experience at how their languages you
want to learn some JavaScript just run
through this course you know it will
take you pretty much it won't take you a
ton of time if you will you know have
this experience but if you don't have
this experience I think I mean it's
going to be super beneficial to you and
you'll see the benefits right away when
you're working on a website and you'd be
like oh how do I do this and it just
comes to you because you have these
JavaScript skills so i definitely
recommend a code Academy's javascript
fundamentals for learning just what it
says javascript fundamentals I think
it's extremely worthwhile as always uh
you know let us know what you're
thinking of these reviews you know these
are sort of new so leave a comment is up
on Twitter near the dro this is scott
level of Tut's and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
