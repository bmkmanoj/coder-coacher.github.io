level up Tut's and we just installed
bolt and that we have created a admin
user and here we are logged in to bolt
it says down here version 1.01 and it
gives you some helpful links to about
bolt and then to their website if you if
you need to check those out it up it
gives you some latest activity right
here saying that I'm logged in edit a
user so this is going to give you the
latest activity whenever you log in or
whenever you're on the dashboard here
and then also give you some bold news so
this is saying both stable 1.0 is
released so you can stay up with the
latest news here here's an alert message
that you can close just saying you've
logged and logged in and you can see
from here you can I can create new stuff
we can create a new entry a new page or
a kitchen sink which it will be going
over in a little bit because this is
just a test site and this is our first
bold site I am going to want to follow
this what it says here is that there's
no content in the database so to get
started quickly let's add some content
just by clicking this lorem ipsum dummy
content it's gonna generate a whole
bunch of entries a whole bunch of pages
and a whole bunch of kitchen sinks and
it's gonna it's gonna be pretty cool so
let's click this lorem ipsum dummy
content and almost instantly we'll see
all sorts of content just show up so you
can see you fill the database with dummy
content lets you add some more records
or back to dashboard you'd see it added
like five of each or or so so let's
click back to dashboard and this is what
your dashboard looks like now that we
have some content in it you can see it
shows like the main photo for each of
these it gives a little bit of the body
text it gives the title it says which
number it is in terms of when it was
created and if you want to create a new
entry you can do so here or here you can
see the rest of the entries if there's
more than five by clicking more entries
or pages or more kitchen sinks and so
just so you know entries by default as
the one of these stacked content types
is like a article in Drupal it's like a
maybe like a blog post or something it's
a it's
anything that can be repeated as a chunk
of content sort of like you would a blog
page and then the latest page is what
maybe the Drupal pages content type
would be like basically it's a page I
mean just like you would know a web page
it's just a single page and if we check
out one of these pages let's actually go
to the front end of our site and it's
just your URL here without anything in
front of it here's our site you can see
we have some entries we have some pages
let's click one of these pages you can
see this is what it looks like and this
is all just using the default theme that
they gave you and the default content
types if you wanted to you know have a
blog in this format where you have all
your latest entries show up here and
this theme looks great if you want to
use you know a different image or
something make your sites like done I
mean look at this it's already
responsive and everything so it's pretty
cool it with some CSS or some HTML you
could get this perfect in no time so
let's go back to our admin here this is
just the dashboard of course we also
have content here and here you can view
entries view pages view kitchen sinks so
we know what entry as we know to page a
kitchen sink is actually just a content
type that they throw in here that gives
you an example of every type of field
that's possible so you can see you have
these sort of number fields here we have
a URL we have a video and we have a
WYSIWYG where you can enter your your
content you have geolocation field and
if you hover over any of these info
boxes it's gonna tell you a little bit
about that type of field well these are
really great there's all sorts of nice
built in fields and image lists if you
want an image list file upload you can
even have your code in markdown if you
prefer to type in markdown and let's
check this out you can have a text area
without a WYSIWYG that you've noticed
they're writing HTML and there's a lot
of different fields and if you
keep the kitchen sink around this maybe
not make any kitchen sink objects you
can always come in here and see exactly
what's available we'll go over this more
when we go over creating a content type
next is settings so settings we have the
ability to create users we have some
configuration options which is all just
a config dot yml LEM will file and we
actually have access to these files
through our sublime text or our text
editor and we're going to go over all
that - we have configuration we have
content types which is another gamma
file and it's the same thing we're gonna
go over this more once we talk about
creating a content type menu is the same
and taxonomy so these are some of the
items that you have in your
configuration we also have maintenance
which allows you to add extensions and
you're actually going to be adding
extensions in the config file not
through here but this servic tells you
exactly what's available what's
installed what's not you can run this
check database this is it's already up
to days you can clear the caches caches
are now cleared you can check your
activity log it's going to tell you
everything that's been done recently and
you can view and edit the template files
if you click here you can edit any of
your style sheets or your twig files
which are really templating files that's
sort of a shorthand to make it a little
bit easier so you don't have to write
PHP in here so it's pretty cool you have
access to everything I would typically
be writing all of the template files or
any of this configuration stuff through
my text editor itself I found that to be
a bit easier so you might not need the
settings too much and as you can see
that's it it's pretty lightweight
there's nothing going on here but as you
can see from the kitchen sink example or
even the front end of our site it's able
to do a whole lot out of the box okay
well we've just scratched surface here
of bolts and but there's lots more to do
including creating content types
modifying posts doing all sorts of cool
stuff and we're gonna make sure you know
how to do it all so that you can use
bolt and grow its audience because
personally I've been really liking using
it lately
so check it out if you have any
questions leave a comment the video how
to set that Twitter level up Tut's once
again this is Scott level of Tut's
