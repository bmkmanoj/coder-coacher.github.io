up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to add tags and how to manage tags
on your site so tags are great because
not only do they allow users to find
your products more easily they also
helped in the search throughout your
website and you can do things like most
commonly popular tags is something they
have by default on here but you can
build your own basically tags are a
great way to categorize your products so
let's click this and we had this product
that we created before and I'm just
going to add some tags to it and so you
can actually use single quotes for
phrases or just separate them by space
if you want so we're gonna have this be
awesome and put rap what else we can get
some we'll do a phrase so single quote
right hip hop even though this is not a
pop let's see that's another one kung
foo okay so let's add all of these tags
add tags and see it's gonna ask me for
my account information so let's uh check
this out let's go to my account okay of
course I don't have an account so to
create tags your users have to have an
account on this site okay so this is
actually something we haven't done yet
so let's actually just create a new
account as a user I know we have an
admin account but let's just have an a
user account so so if you see here it
says three tags have been accepted for
moderation one tag has been added to the
product and that what Hank was awesome
let's actually try this again so if we
do fun and then we'll do another single
quote one four phrase and just gonna be
super add okay and then quote okay ed
tags so if you notice two tags have been
accepted for moderation if you keep
adding tags it's gonna be like you need
to have these approved okay so where you
do that is very similar to what we did
for reviews if we come in here this is
going to be under tags and then pending
tags this is really to stop people from
just spam
the crap out of your tags if they want
to do like SEO or some some like BOTS
trying to add a bunch of tags even
though they haven't they must have an
account for your site it's going to stop
people from spamming a bunch of stuff
but we want all these approved so let's
select all and just like reviews we do
actions change status and approved
submit cool so we have let's go into our
tags all tags and here's a bunch of our
tags cool so let's add a new tag from
this interface let's click add new tag
so if you want specific tags to
automatically be approved on your site
let's say you want music to be always
approved any time anybody tags it
anywhere you can select this to be
approved and then save tag okay so now
music is a tag on the site let's go back
to this product and now let's try to add
music to this product and it's going to
let it just automatically go in so let's
do music we'll click add tags and you'll
notice music tag has been added to the
product this is a great way to have
guided tags so you don't have to go in
and improve approve all the text for
your products you can come in and you
can say okay these are the things that I
really want my products to be tagged as
and then you can either tag them
yourself or you can have your users tag
them that way you don't have to come in
here and every time somebody writes a
new tag prove it approver to prove it if
you'll notice here it also a listed a
number next to it and that's how many
things are tagged with the same tag if
we click awesome here it's going to show
us all of the products that have already
been tagged with awesome so these two
products are already tagged with awesome
and that's why when we originally
created our tags for this product it
automatically went through for that one
but for the other tags we had like
hip-hop and rap they didn't just go
right through immediately okay so that's
tags for your products and so now if we
go to the front page here you might see
some new tags here but if we go to view
all tags you'll see all the tags of
course you might want to CSS this make
it look a lot nicer than this
I don't know if I would push this out
looking like this to a site live but you
know if if this is what you want it's
right here with no modification needed
okay so that is how you add and manage
and approve tags for your website as
always if you have any questions please
leave a comment on the video and it is a
bit toward our level up Hut's once again
this is Scott and thanks for listening
