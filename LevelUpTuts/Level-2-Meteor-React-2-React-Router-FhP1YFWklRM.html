tutorials and in this video we're going
to install react router into our project
and get some basic routing done now
react router is a router that is highly
used outside of the meteor community it
with the react community and for good
reasons you'll see just how easy it is
to make sense of the concepts in react
router as we get up and running so let's
go start with that right now okay so we
have our app up and running now we're
ready to start diving into some
intermediate techniques including
something that might not necessarily be
intermediate but entirely necessary for
mini apps which is going to be routing
so in this series we're going to be
using react router now react router is
great because it's not tied to meteor
right if for some reason meteor to
disappear tomorrow the skills that you
would learn from using react router will
definitely transfer over to other other
frameworks in terms of back-end or full
stack frame works and who react router
is very popular outside of the meteor
scene as well so it's always nice to
learn techniques and tools that are
popular elsewhere so that you're not
only just advancing your meteor skills
but you're advancing your skills
universally okay so let's go ahead and
the first thing we want to do is NPM
install and this right here assumes that
you have NPM installed if you do not you
can always type meteor and PM install
and that will just use meteors NPM now
we're gonna say NPM install - - save and
then we're going to save a react -
router ok NPM install - - save react
router enter this is going to bring
react router into our project great ok
now now it's actually time to open the
project in our text editor so I have my
project here and when you just drop it
into atom which is the text editor I'm
using for this series I'm using the
material theme for this and as we can
see
if we head to our package.json we do in
fact have react router right here now
from here let's go ahead and we're going
to essentially head to our client folder
and you'll see in our main TAS the first
thing we did was we hit our meteor
startup and we rendered app to the
render target this is going to be
changing here now that we have access to
a router so let's go ahead and come into
our imports and we're going to head into
our client imports and I'm just going to
make a new file we can add a new file
which will just be Rob CAS okay now
inside of here we're going to import
react from react lower case so we have
react and we're also going to be
importing react router do that we want
to say import now inside of brackets
here I'm going to space these out on
their own line so we can read this a
little bit better we want router we want
route we want index route you can just
copy and paste these all directly from
react routers github or documentation if
you don't want to accidentally type
these in correctly however it's nice to
know exactly what you're importing and
then this last one does not start
capitalized in its browser history like
that and we're going to be importing
those from react - router like you may
have suspected okay so at this point
we're not using this routes file so you
know we shouldn't be seeing any sort of
errors or anything like that
everything should be a-okay here so
let's now what we're gonna do is
basically we want to write the section
of the code that says basically render
this to our document just like we did in
our main dot J s so let's copy this
right here let's copy this meteor
startup stuff let's pace
so we're gonna leave the meteor start up
on meteor stood up and we're gonna leave
render we want to render something to
the render target okay so this part
right here is going to stay essentially
the same with the main difference coming
in at app now we're no longer going to
be rendering app but we're gonna be
rendering essentially the router so we
can come in here delete app and we're
gonna have a new element which is going
to be router and we can give this a
property of history and history is going
to be equal to within brackets browser
history I'm just gonna copy and paste
that from up here basically this is
going to allow us to use the history API
so that we can you know get forward
backwards whatever within reactive
router and let's go ahead and close this
element off and Adam nicely does that
for me like that okay so this is looking
pretty decent we've now initialized our
router things should be going alright
now we want to add a route now what we
want to have is a route element so we
can see we have a route and we want to
give it a path the path is going to be
equal to a forward slash so this is
basically just going to be our home
ramped and what we can do is we can give
this a component and that component is
maybe you could have guessed this or
maybe you couldn't it's gonna be app
let's close this off like this so what's
going on here is this long bit right
here is going to be replacing this
little bit so these eight lines are
getting replaced by these three lines
here but we're actually getting is
something a little bit more powerful out
of it and in fact we're gonna be able to
start assigning routes instead of saying
hey just render this one particular
component to the render target hey
render whatever particular component
based off of whatever path we're at okay
so we have this route
our setup but we're not using it and we
want to get using it so let's head to
our main CAS and before we imported app
dot J s from imports that client what we
want to do is we want to import the
routes file itself we're not going to be
importing any particular component or
anything that we're exporting we're just
going to be importing the routes file so
we can delete this and type import and
then we can just give this a path which
is going to be the path to our routes
file so we can say we want to go dot dot
to go back one directory then we want to
grab from imports client routes and you
can get rid of that J s there we just
want to import this file now if we save
this we're gonna get an error because
it's gonna hit this and it's gonna say
app is undefined cuz you'll notice we're
not bringing an app anything that we're
using here like browser history or
router or route even we are bringing in
and using but app of course is the
exception to that here because we
haven't imported it yet just to make
sure everything is ok let me refresh
this page and see what kind of errors we
are getting before we get too ahead of
ourselves as you can see render is not
defined in routes J s line 10 so in line
10 we're saying render but this renders
not a part of anything it's not a method
of something we're importing so in
addition to app we also didn't bring in
render well where does render come from
well in apt or main digest that we had
here we actually imported render from
react dumb so let's grab that let's come
back here an import render from react
dumb once again we need to import app so
let's import app from not form but from
and this isn't the same directory so we
can do dot forward slash app just like
that okay and if we head back to our
file boom just like that we have it up
and running now this is great because
even though we don't have any routes
going on we know that a router is
working there's no other way for our
application to see the app component
other than hitting this router so
basically on startup it's checking out
it's coming to render and this end
functioning a lot like a normal reactor
where we're just rendering something
right so we basically have these objects
which wraps our entire router in history
and then we define a single route with
the path of a forward slash and the
component as app we were to come to our
application and pass this something like
let's see forward slash hi we're gonna
get a high did not match any routes
however if we come in here let's go
ahead and add a new path I just copied
this line I'm gonna give this a path of
high and I'm going to say if you're on
the path of high you can also run your
component app now this is entirely
stupid we'll be deleting this in a
second but as you can see our
application is back before we can even
tab back super cool we now have react
router up and running now it's not
really serving us a huge benefit right
now because we have one page so in the
next video we're going to be talking
about layouts we're gonna build a layout
with a stateless functional component
which is something that we didn't go
over in the last series but it's a
really cool short hand for writing react
components that will give you some
performance benefits when you don't need
a state for that particular component
now it's perfect for that is things like
layouts so let's go ahead and remove
this stuff right there we now have our
one route we are ready to go for the
next video where we take on layouts with
react router as always this is Scott
with elope tutorials if you have any
questions or comments they become in the
video with me up at Twitter or Facebook
