tubs and today i'm going to show you how
to splice and slice arrays using
CoffeeScript and it makes it nice and
easy ok so to get started we have our
right here with our types of ingredients
here we have rice crab cucumber all that
stuff but let's say we wanted to save
just like the first two in another array
we wanted to just slice them out right
so let's say we wanted to save the first
three rice crab in cucumber in another
array so we can just have this and let's
say this it's called this be first and
we're going to say it's equal to and
then we're going to set our original
array type and then you're going to do
bracket and you're going to do the first
position and then we're going to do dot
dot and then the second position which
would be three or which would be second
which is the 01 to ok so we have from
the first through the third position and
it's going to grab these three and save
them into first as another array another
way you can do this is you can actually
use three decimal points here and what
this is going to be doing is it's only
going to be grabbing the rice and crab
instead of rice crab in cucumber the
three decimal points excludes the last
number so it gets the ones up until this
one if we were to put three here now
this would grab rice crab cucumber again
if I remove that dot it's now going to
grab rice crab cucumber and seaweed well
let's say we wanted to grab the rest of
them ok so we have the first four here
rice crab cucumber and seaweed we want
to grab the rest regardless of how many
additional things we tack on the end
here we can just say we'll call this the
rest or yeah we'll just cause the rest
it's going to be equal to again our
array and we're going to start in the
fifth position which is four and then
we're just going to do dot dot so now
it's going to start at the fifth item in
the array which is to not and it's going
to go until the end and save those in
another
I called rest let's save this out and
you can see what the code is actually
doing it's just really doing what you'd
expect it's saying the first array is
now equal to our original type and we're
slicing from the first position unto the
fifth position okay well let's say you
wanted to just copy this array into
another array we could have this be copy
and the copy could be equal to our
original array and then inside of the
brackets here we'll just do dot dot so
now that's going to completely copy the
contents of array to another array so
just to reiterate i'm going to copy this
one paste it right here and i'm going to
put another dot so this will just be
first again okay so so the items in this
array are going to be rice crab and
cucumber okay and this one the contents
are going to be rice crab cucumber and
seaweed in this the rest is going to be
tuna and seven and then this is going to
be the entire array okay
so this is how you slice and splice and
even copy an array using this really
nice syntax it sort of reminds me of
like Python syntax if you're familiar
with Python or anything like that I'm
just really nice and easy to use you
have to worry about writing slice and
all this junk so let's say you wanted to
actually splice into an array instead
okay so what we want to do is we want to
replace a segment with another segment
so let's have our original array let's
say if we're not happy with cucumber and
seaweed we want to replace these two
items with two other items in another
array we can do that by saying type and
then in brackets we're going to have the
position that we want to replace so we
can use to dot dot and actually let's
get rid of cucumber seaweed and tuna and
we'll say a 2 through 4 so this is going
to pick the third item the fourth item
and the fifth item in our array as you
know because this index starts at zero
and we're going to change them to let's
say let's pick three more words in
another array and let me come up with
three more words we can use so let's put
in yellow tail we can put in fugu and
let's add one more it'll just be ill
okay so let's check this out let's now
alert this list and we're just going to
be we're going to learn to type after
this okay I'm going to throw it in the
tri CoffeeScript here on their website
will paste this in here and let's just
run this code actually I want to comment
some stuff out so we don't have this
this one okay so i'm just going to
comment that out and i'm going to
comment out this other function that i
have here don't want to yell my name
as well as this one and this one okay
nah let's just hit run as you can see
it's returning our new array which is
replaced the other values cucumber
seaweed and tuna with yellowtail fugu
and eel and remaining the other ones
cool okay well that's splicing and
slicing an array using coffeescript it's
nice and easy really short syntax easy
to write cool all right well this is
once again it's scott with level of
Tut's and you know if you have any
questions or comments please leave
comment in the video will try to get to
only can and thank you for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
