love tutorials and in this video i'm
going to be showing you a freebie sketch
resource that's available on code drops
it's really super cool it's basically a
landing page that's built in sketch that
you can download just check out you can
use some of the components in your own
work you can pick and choose you can
modify it as you want but it's basically
a really nice way to see how other
people organize their sketch files and
get going with that let's download it
and check it out now this on this video
I'm going to be covering a free be
available on code drops if you don't
ever go to code drops i would recommend
checking this site out there's some
seriously amazing tutorials and
resources here so if you want to head
over to the link i'm going to provide in
the description of the video you can
come here and download this land dot io
user you I landing kit for sketch now
this is a seriously awesome free be here
so let's actually go ahead and download
it open it up and check it out so the
download links just at the bottom here
and there's even some free resources
used in this design like these icons
these images this perspective mock-up so
you there's even some other freebies
here you can see these are all vector
icons that look really super nice so
once this gets done downloading I'm
going to open it up and sketch and check
it out now you can see some of the fonts
I don't have a so like lat 0 regular
turns out I'm gonna have let a regular
or bold i thought i had that and i also
don't have this railway so the fonts are
going to look quite right let's go ahead
and open it anyways just to see what
comes in here i can always download
those fonts later I don't need it to
necessarily get the full picture so
let's go ahead and you can see that we
have one page we have several artboards
so we have this full page layout which
is a landing page art boarded includes a
whole bunch of stuff including some sort
of a billboard and the other airports
are what they just use for a dribble
hard and stuff like that so let's go
ahead and then we have an artboard
that's strictly just the UI elements I'm
going to go ahead and zoom in a little
bit and let's go ahead and just check
this out so this is the UI elements that
are included in this and like I said the
fonts are going to be sore all over the
place right now it comes with some nice
UI elements so you sort of see around a
lot we have just some login buttons we
have a scarred that sort of looks like a
twitter card or something like that we
have this billboard we have a footer
header sort of a graph and we have some
text inputs and things like that if we
head over and check out the actual
landing page you can see we have a
billboard with what would with what
appears to be like a slider then we
scroll down we have like a feature that
looks like it's trying to do sort of an
apple type look we have the three column
landing page that you sort of see all
over the place right now we have the
background image with a that turns on a
video essentially we have the manager
subscriptions which is another pattern
that you're seeing a lot that's very
very similar to a pattern that you'll
see on a lot of websites right now and
we have this sort of testimonials and we
have a two column we have this footer
grid thing and we have a newsletter
signup so you can see there's a lot of
really nice elements in here could come
in here and really just sort of mess
with this and take this design into some
place that's maybe not as generic but
there's a lot of really nice elements in
here that you can use to just get going
and obviously you can change the fonts
and everything yourself so you're not
having to steak stick with leto or
railway I mean although leto is a pretty
awesome thought so as you can see this
is a really nice package and the best
part is like with any of this stuff it's
free so you can download this you can
check it out you can see how other
people or organizing and using sketch to
create nice-looking layouts and UI kit
so as always this is scott would level
