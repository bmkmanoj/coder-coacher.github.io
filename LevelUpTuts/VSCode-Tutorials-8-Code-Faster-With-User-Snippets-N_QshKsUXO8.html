up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be talking about user snippets
envious code and now I'm a huge
proponent of making your life easier at
every stop of the way so if there is
something that you can turn into a
snippet I typically turn it into a
snippet even if it's very basic like how
many times have you written out
console.log this little bit of code is
something you have to type out all the
time now one thing I like to do is set
up a user snippet just for the word log
I'm not sure why but I've just gotten so
used to typing log when I want to log
something that it makes it really easy
so let's go ahead and actually add our
very first user snippet in the process
we're going to talk a little bit about
some things you can do in snippets that
are really nice and fancy so the best
way to get there is head to your menu
bar we can click the code and then we
want to go to preferences and then user
snippets now here it's going to ask you
to select your language which is
important because the snippet is only
going to work for that given language
it's not like a generic master file or
something we want to be able to narrow
these down very specifically so this is
a JavaScript react project so I'm going
to select JavaScript react and as you
can see here we just have open brackets
which is just essentially asking for an
object right so what we want inside of
this object is you can see by this
example well we first will give this a
title so we can give this a title of
counsel blog all right this is the just
string title of what this is going to be
and the value for this property is going
to simply just be another object now we
have some things that we need here we
need a prefix a body and possibly a
description you do not need a
description but you can have one if
you're having lots of different
different snippets and you want to keep
track of them and maybe console.log is
not explicit enough for you so first
property inside of our new snippet is
going to be the prefix and then actually
if you notice that here let me see if I
can do that again I hit this
strings it's actually saying body
description and prefix so vs code knows
that you're doing a snippet here and so
it's giving you all three potential
properties like I said description is
totally optional so we can just hit
prefix and as you can see here it
already gives us a string so it knows
what type of value we're going to be
looking for and here we're just going to
use the word log and next we are going
to have the body now the body is simply
just going to be a string as well now
you'll notice the example up top has an
array it's one of the reasons I'm not
using the example up top however we will
be talking about that in a second and it
says that we can have this property be a
new array but this can also just be a
simple string and you might be wondering
why the reason why this can be a string
is if your snippet is one-line long for
instance a council log we could say
council log and inside of here we can
just have this and you'll notice in the
example above they have some single
quotes let's leave off the single quotes
here and just do dollar sign one and
then wrap it off with a semicolon
okay now let's head back to our j/s file
and i can come in here just give myself
some space and I can just say log I can
hit tab and you'll notice it's now put
my cursor directly into the console log
so I can log anything I could log this
hello class and see the answer to that
now why would they have put those single
quotes in there if we would actually
have those single quotes like this it's
going to sort of assume that whatever
our output is going to be is going to be
a string so if we were to say log and we
want to select the user snippet I'm not
quite sure this is referring to
something else we can just hit there you
can see that whatever we're giving this
is automatically a string now I prefer
to have the flexibility for myself which
is why I'd left off the single quotes
like they had in this example so as you
can see here a dollar sign one is
basically indicating where in fact our
cursor is going to end up after the
snippet and if we were to want to say
let's log two things we could have a
comma and then a dollar sign too
okay and this is going to allow us to do
something fun where we can say lug make
sure we have the snippet and then we can
say hello we want to output hello first
now I'm gonna hit the Escape key because
if I were to hit tab right now it's
gonna want to do something so you'll
notice I have no dialog box and I hit
the tab key and it jumps immediately to
the second cursor position or we could
maybe just lock view and see what the
view object has in store for us so as
you can see here if we were to hit tab
again it just gets out of this so what's
so cool about snippets well they can
save you a ton of time for instance I
have a react snippet for components that
is Bilt's components the exact way I
like to using things like a static
declaration for the prop types and
default props using the class syntax
using a pure components stuff like that
using stuff you use all the time so you
can really customize your snippets into
with things that that you do right or
maybe their code that is used frequently
in your project for instance I used
meteor a lot and there's a rolls package
so to check a user's role its rolls dot
user is enroll and then you have the
user ID in whatever roles well it's nice
to be able to put that into a snippet
and I can just say roll tab and have
that snippet in there without having to
remember how to spell everything now
remembering exactly if it's user is
enroll or user is enrolls because one of
those is going to cause the code not to
work so it's gonna reduce errors it's
going to speed up your development and
it's gonna make life easier
now what happens if we were to do two
dollar signs right if we were to do two
dollar sign number ones what's gonna
happen here is we're gonna have
something very very nice so I'm gonna do
my last vlog here I'm just going to say
log make sure I have the snippet and now
when I start typing you'll see we now
have both of these typed at once it gave
us two cursors now why might you want to
do this
let's go ahead and make another snippet
here and I'm going to show you maybe a
good reason why we could have a
functional stateless component so
functional stateless okay and now
instead of here I'm going to give this a
prefix which is just functional as C
okay and then the body this time is not
going to be a string like we had last
time but it's going to be an array and
why is this in the rate because we're
gonna have multiple lines of code if you
want this to be anything more than a
one-liner
you need an array and it's array of
strings a string for each line and the
first string can just simply be import
react from react okay
just like that we can have a comma and
now we want a blank line in here so we
can simply just do double quotes we no
need to do a space or anything next on
the next line we're going to have a
constant variable is equal to dollar
sign one whichever the name is is equal
to then we just have an arrow function
okay and then a bracket now next line no
I do not want to have a council there
okay next line we can just simply close
this off here we can just have a return
okay and then this one I can have a
dollar sign too cuz why not right might
as well make this easy and easier and
keep in mind it's a little tough writing
this code out like this right and you'll
see in a moment here some issues that
I'm purposefully not addressing right
now but as you can see here what we
really just want to do is construct our
code in a series of strings so okay now
I'm going to give this another space and
at the bottom of this file I'm going to
have this simply just to be export
default and then
and we're also going to use dollar sign
one again alright this is where that
dollar sign one is going to come in
super handy and we can save this so
let's try out our FS see we're going to
do so on a new file I'm going to just
say test dot J s and this already knows
it's a react to JavaScript file and we
had functional state list component
which was our users snippet we can hit
enter or tab and you'll now notice when
I have the new test component I now have
a constant variable test which is equal
to a function and export default test
now if I were to hit tab from this it
sends me right into my return statement
where I can have let's say a div and
Emmet is choosing not to work correctly
there we go and we could type this in hi
whatever save this and let es lint take
care of the rest however if I do command
Z let's go back to before I had typed in
the word div and here here and here now
one thing you'll notice immediately
about this is certain things look fine
and certain things look not fine it's
one of the reasons why writing your
sniff it out in an actual JavaScript
file before you're dropping it in as a
series of strings is a good idea for
instance how many incorrect things can
you spot in this for instance we don't
have a semicolon after these parentheses
we do not have a semicolon after these
lines the indentation is wrong here and
these are kind of things that you're
gonna have to work out if you're writing
a lot of snippets so semicolon semicolon
don't get rid of that parenthesis but
semicolon and we also want to tab in
front of this return line and how do you
do a tab well we actually just do it
with a backslash T you'll see it's even
a special color in our syntax
highlighting right because this is going
to denote a tab and if we wanted two of
these we would just have another
backslash T okay save this let's nuke
this out and try it once again F s FS c
es f SC and here now this is looking a
lot better just like that
we now have a functional stateless
component that looks a little bit more
like what we'd expect and like I said
I'm making user snippets constantly and
if you do not want to make user snippets
constantly if you want to have this
already done for you then the best place
for that is the extensions market we
type in react snippet you can just start
even looking in here and you'll see we
have some react native ones HTML
snippets Redux snippet browsing through
these packages of various snippets can
not only you know make your life easier
by installing and using these snippets
but it also can make your life easier by
seeing how other people have made their
snippets you can pause these on github
and see exactly how they are and dive
into maybe something cool that they're
doing or you can just maybe get ideas
for things that you want maybe without
having to have this entire package right
and as you can see here there is a whole
ton of react react native Redux snippets
but most likely snippets for everything
you're trying to do so go wild start
installing a bunch of snippets use them
as much as possible they save your life
they make your code less buggy because
you don't miss extraneous little things
and they just help you out in all sorts
of ways so as always this is Scott with
level of tutorials if you would like to
learn react native you may have seen a
little bit of the code in this video
head over to WWF to tutorials calm
forward slash store or just level up
tutorials calm head to the store in the
navigation and check out react native
for everyone it's a beginner series for
react native you don't need react
you don't need react native knowledge to
do this series it's basically enough to
get you up and running with react native
and start exploring some of the cool
stuff that you can do with native
development also I started a new podcast
with West boss called syntax so it over
to syntax and dot FM and check that out
there's links to all of the major
podcast players or just search for
syntax on your podcast whatever a
podcast you're listening to right now I
believe we're we're on trending in the
pocket casts one so you can look forward
there as well
either way check out syntax we talked
about react we talked about CSS all
sorts of web development topics
featuring me and West boss so thanks so
much for watching and I'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
