up tutorial and in this video I'm gonna
be talking about another one of my
favorite react packages which is react
measure now react measure is the
absolute best way for measuring things
and being able to have components update
based on those measurements like if
you're resizing the browser window or
you need something to respond in
JavaScript to a specific size of things
you can literally do anything with this
package so this is react measure now
before we get into react measure I want
to take a quick minute to talk about
this video sponsor which is dev Mountain
so what dev Mountain is is well it's a
coding bootcamp where you can go and you
totally immerse yourself and what I mean
by that is well it's full time so you
show up to one of their locations and
you stay and live there and you
obviously get free housing while you do
this and there's in several different
locations from Provo Salt Lake Dallas
and Phoenix and you show up and
basically you have access to full time
mentors tons of courses and the ability
to just grow as a web developer designer
app developer in a place that really
encourages personal growth so dev
Mountain is super cool because you show
up and get absolutely real-world
training you can see it's very
career-focused they have a huge network
companies like Nike and reddit eBay
LinkedIn Apple HP the list goes on and
on and on so if you're looking to really
step up your career head to dev Mountain
come check out some of their locations
check out their courses request to
syllabus take a tour of the campus and
just contact them and step up your game
by taking the leap into becoming a full
time programmer designer any of that
stuff with dev Mountain all right now
back to the tutorial ok so let's talk
about react measure now let's first
start off by saying that rec measure is
extremely easy to use you simply just
install it like you would expect and if
we head down here in the ducts you can
see we wrap our component in react
measure and then we have an unrest
resize is going to Phi
anytime this thing is resized and then
we can do things with that information
such as the the content rect bounds and
set them to a dimension in their state
as we're seeing here and that we're
going to get the rectangle bounds for
our both height and width of our item
and in that case we can pass along and
well you can see that we have access to
those props as they're changing what
this means here is that as a an item is
measured or it changes the react
component will run every render and
we'll have access to those new values
you can click on their demo and see that
well if we add this paragraph toggle
display we click measure you can play
around with this thing a little bit and
see all of the different values now I
can actually change the width of this
and see some of the stuff in action now
it might be hard to see I actually I
click this and it's animating but check
out the values here as I manipulate this
this is great because these props are
updating the state in real time as I
change the dimensions of this thing
giving us again full access to change
these properties to work with these
properties of the size of any item on
our page we just have to wrap it in
react measure now before I now before
you wonder about performance of
something like this let's talk about why
this thing is awesome this thing is
awesome not because it gives you access
to all this information and it updates
everything but because it uses the
browser's own native implementation of
measuring stuff which is the resize
observer it even uses a resize observer
polyfill for any browsers that do not
support resize observer now the resize
observer is going to be something that
the browser uses to be able to have
access to it and as you can see right
now with the polyfill you get really
excellent support now you can always
check out what you get without the
polyfill or check out the spec itself
but the resize observer is one of the
cool
those things for working with the size
of your elements it's very nice and
performant it works very very well so
this thing basically gives you access to
any of the dimension size positioning of
anything that you wrap around it and you
can control that with state or with
anything and you can use a higher-order
component you can use a decorator you
can use all sorts of stuff to get this
information out of here so react measure
is one of my favorite components not
only because of its insanely useful
functionality of passing in constant
size updates to your react components
but also because it uses a native
browser implementation of the resize
observer where can and the polyfill
where it needs to so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials check out
react measure you can do a lot of cool
stuff with this package so if you're
using react measure in any really cool
way that you want to share posted in the
comments I would love to see what kind
of cool stuff you're making with react
measure thanks so much for watching and
I'll see in the next one if you liked
this video and want to learn more about
react you can head to level up tutorials
com4 slash store and check out react 16
for everyone which is my latest series
on react in fact the new series coming
to level up tutorials in December is
going to be on react as well except for
this time react and redux so if you want
to learn a lot about the basics of react
head over to level up torres comport
slash store and purchase react 16 for
everyone or sign up to become a level up
pro and get access to every series every
single month the moment they're released
so thanks so much for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
