up touch and today I'm going to show you
how to install a plugin that you've
downloaded from somewhere else perhaps
you have found this plug-in on another
website somebody gave it to you or
basically you just need to install it
and all you have as a folder that
includes the files of your plugin well
we're going to be just downloading a
plug-in off of wordpress.org just so I
can have one here but if you have your
plug-in or you found one somewhere else
or perhaps even on wordpress.org you can
follow a log and install it manually so
to do so I'm actually going to first
need to download the plug-in I can do
that off of WordPress so work with this
big orange button and it downloads a zip
now plugins are going to be a folder and
inside of this folder basically a bunch
of PHP files we're going to get into the
more of the specifics later on in the
advanced series when we'll show you how
to build a plugin but that's not for a
little bit and we're just going to show
you how to install this so now I have
the jetpack plugin that I've downloaded
and I have my wordpress site now in my
wordpress site these are the standard
files you used to sing if your site is
on a server somewhere you're going to
want to go ahead and FTP into your
server and browse to your WordPress
install now from here we want to go to
WP - content and then we want to go into
plugins now you'll notice we have some
things already here we have that hello
we have the Akismet we have the Google
Analytics and we have this index dot PHP
which we don't need to worry about
however what this folder is lacking is
our jetpack plugin what we want to go
ahead and do is just simply drag that
into our plugins folder now if you are
an FTP uh you know sites on a server
somewhere of course you're going to want
to upload this folder to this plugins
folder that's within WP - content so
what's awesome about this is now that
that plug-in is in our folder if we come
to the backend of our site
we can now simply go to plugins and it's
going to show up in the list of our
plugins however it's going to show up as
not activated just like when we
installed it from the interface we're
going to have to go ahead and click this
activate button now once we've activated
it's successfully activated and we can
come down and go to the settings and now
jetpack is basically a bunch of
utilities here to help you with your
site but we have now successfully
activated jetpack and we can go ahead
and add things like a carousel or
sharing button so let's go ahead and
actually add these sharing buttons let's
click to activate on this sharing okay
now let's click configure and awesome so
today here we just need to drag which
services and oh yeah so you know maybe
Facebook and read it or up top here but
maybe you want like Pinterest to be
hidden behind a search button either way
this is what it it's going to look like
perfect and then we say we want these to
show up on all posts Save Changes great
now if we come to our site let's go to a
post we now have our Facebook social
buttons
so we have now successfully added some
social buttons by manually installing
jetpack for WordPress and the same
method that we would use to install any
plug-in manually so as always if you
have any questions or comments please
leave a comment the video hit us up on
Facebook or Twitter where else over the
level of touch forum and this might be a
good time to point out that level of
tuts is of course a total labor of love
I'd make these videos of my nights and
weekends to help out anybody who could
possibly need the help so if you really
like level up Tut's and you want to give
back
there are ways you can do that on the
level of Tut's comm we have a page at
slash donations and you of course could
just drop us a couple bucks here or you
could flatter us whatever actually
there's even going to be some more
exciting ways to thank us later this
month or / next month that of course
more information will be revealed soon
but if you just can't wait and you want
to donate go ahead and do that I will
not stop you so as always this is Scott
with level up tuts and thanks for
watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
