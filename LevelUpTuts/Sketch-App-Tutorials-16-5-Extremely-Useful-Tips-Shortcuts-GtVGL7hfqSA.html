Hut's and today we're going to bring you
part 1 of my favorite sketch short cut
tips now these aren't just going to be
keyboard shortcuts or you know quick
keys we're going to show you things that
can really speed up your workflow and
using sketch and get you fluent to the
point where you're just your body's just
doing exactly what your mind wants it to
do and that way the application gets out
of the way and just lets you design so
check it out we're going to show you
some of those now okay so I have five
quick tips here that are going to make
your sketch 3 life even easier if that's
possible ok so the first thing we're
going to talk about is exporting now I
have two separate tips for exporting and
both are excellent ok so the first one
is going to be exporting in multiple
resolutions so let's say we select this
layer and we want to make a slice out of
this layer we can go ahead and do that
by clicking insert slice and then just
by just clicking on the shape here now
we now have a slice that's perfectly
sized to this button and we have this
export menu here that shows up on the
left hand and the inspector when you
have the slice selected now what you'll
notice here is that we have the ability
to change the size for export but what
you might not have noticed is that
there's a plus right here so we can
select this plus and we can say that we
have a 1 X version a 2 X version and
just by default it adds a 1.5 X version
if you keep clicking this it's going to
give you sizes that make the next most
sense and you'll notice that it gives
you a suffix so the file name is
actually going to have this at 2 X on
the end of it so let's go ahead and
click export and I'm just going to throw
these onto my desktop which is already
cluttered enough right now and we can
open up my desktop and you can see
exactly where they went so at the top of
our list of my desktop here we now have
4 buttons and we have a flex button at
normal size we have one at 1.5 size two
times the size and three times the size
Allah's p.m. geez pings
we have them right here and it was with
literally one hit of enter really
exported all of those so that's really
great if you're using responsive images
obviously would it need to have an image
for a button like this but if you are
exporting images at multiple resolutions
which you probably are if you're
supporting higher res screens then this
is just made your life significantly
easier okay so that's one so we have
another tip for exporting which is the
drag to export and this one's seriously
cool because you might not have known
this even existed we can make this
window smaller and we can literally
click and drag this group it doesn't
even have to be a slice or anything we
can click and drag this folder group
outside here let go and obviously we
have a button named flex button already
a click replace and here it is that's
awesome we just dragged off directly
from the canvas we don't have to do
anything and it saved it likewise we
could just drag this button off this BG
layer and there it is so you can click
anything in your layers menu here drag
it just right off to your desktop or
wherever and it automatically exports a
ping for you okay so that's two quick
tips now we have three more the next is
going to be quick keys so you can get
really fast at sketch three by learning
the keys for instance are gives you a
rectangle if nothing is selected S gives
you the slice tool and you can learn
what all of these are simply by going to
your insert menu here and seeing that we
have V for vector P for pencil and then
our shapes L are O and you now some of
our more complex shapes don't have
shortcuts but that's okay
because you probably be using those that
much anyways but need to quit create a
quick text layer just go ahead and hit T
and then click and then
type something great so that is number
three is the quick keys for access to
inserting items onto your page now the
fourth tip is that you can actually
modify the interface here and so you can
change what you actually have up in your
menu here and the order that they exist
so we can get to that menu by clicking
view customize toolbar and that gives us
the opportunity to put anything that we
use all of the time up top here and it
even lets us click and drag and move
things around so let's say you want the
insert tool front and center you can
have that right here let's say you
didn't use the magnifying glass because
you're always hitting command plus or
minus you can just drag that right off
and there it's gone so that just opens
up space for something else that you
might want in fact I'd like the make a
grid tool right here and we can throw
that up let's actually put it closer to
where the Union and that stuff is over
there perfect so we now have modified
our menu and you can even have it just
so it's just I cons or just text and
that might clean up the interface a
little bit more for you I prefer the
icons and text but that's just me okay
so now we just have one last tip and
that is the ability to copy CSS directly
out of sketch 3 so let's say we had this
button so let's say we wanted to copy
the properties from this background as
we have it here we're just going to want
to make sure we select the background
and then we can click well it's a
selecting this slice right now let me
get rid of that all we need to do is
click on the layer here right click on
it and do copy CSS attributes now if I
go to a text editor and click paste
because I selected the entire group it
not only gave us the background color in
the border radius that we were
interested in for our button but it also
gave me the font family the font size
the color and the line height so now
this might be more than you needed in
fact if we just needed the border radius
in the background all we have to do is
actually right-click on the background
layer itself and
do copy CSS attributes now if we paste
in we're not going to get everything but
just the background color and the border
radius that we wanted great so those are
five extremely useful sketch three tips
to improve your workflow
we have drag to export multiple
resolution export we have interface
adjustments we have copy CSS directly
from sketch three and we have quick
shortcut keys so I have more quick tips
on them to share in other videos but I
think these five are good to get you
started it's really experimenting
exploring all of what sketch 3 has to
offer so check it out as always this is
Scott with LevelUp Hutts
let me know what your favorite sketch 3
tips are thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
