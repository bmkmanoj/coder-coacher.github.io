love tuts and today I'm going to be
continuing our tour of the back end of
Magento community so in the last lesson
we win over sales and catalogue and I
showed you a little bit about this
dashboard so now we're going to move on
to mobile so this mobile thing is is it
allows you to create a native mobile app
per a different device with your store
on it where people can actually order
your products or you can just have it a
catalog based app where they can just
look at your products so you can see you
can make it for the iPad iPhone or
Android it's really cool we're going to
have a whole bunch of tutorials just
teaching how to do all that so just know
that this mobile section is for making
noble our mobile apps out of your store
in Magento really cool so next we have
customers where you can manage your
customers as you'll see there should
just be two of us this is the one John
Doe that they have built in here with
our sample data and myself here is which
I created myself and you can actually go
through and edit those customers
information just like they could you can
go in and edit their address so for
client or customer comes and says oh I
need you to update my address for some
reason they can't do it you don't have
to say that you know you don't have
access to that you have perfect access
to me that it's really cool you know you
can manage all that stuff and just like
before it's this interface where you can
sort you can apply you can export them
to a CSV that way if you're moving to
another Magento install or let's say
you're moving to Magento go you can
export all your customers and you can
export all your products and import them
in a Magento go Magento go is real quick
it's just a paid version of Magento
where they host the site for you you
don't have access to any of the code you
can do custom CSS and JavaScript or you
can just download themes and install
them they still have extensions the
backend is pretty similar it's really
robust has all the features and it's at
a good price so if you don't want to
manage the code yourself check out
Magento go I'll be doing another
tutorial series I'm just on the gentle
go showing you that in a little bit but
community comes first so customer groups
you can create
two more groups right now there's
general not logged in retailer wholesale
that way certain customers can be tagged
with certain groups and then they will
see maybe custom prices for let's say if
a customers a wholesale price they're
going to always want to get that
wholesale price so online customers is
going to show you who's online right now
nobody is on our site right now online
usually this list can be you know
whoever is currently viewing your page
and is logged in so promotions you can
have a it's like catalog price rules
twenty percent off you can do coupons
and stuff a shopping cart price rules
same thing okay under newsletter this is
where you can manage your newsletter
let's say if you want to have templates
you're going to create a new template
here and this is what is going to get
sent out every time you want to send out
a newsletter and this is when people
sign up to your newsletter if you
remember on your site by default there's
this sign up for newsletter box let's
see I think it might be on only some of
the pages yeah sign up for our
newsletter or when you create an account
it by default gives them the option to
be able to sign up so in this newsletter
you can see your subscribers you can
report problems whatever or people can
report problems than you can see him
okay next is CMS this is where you're
going to be able to manage the content
of your site in a like a way with like a
WYSIWYG and stuff like that so if we go
to pages this is going to show you all
of your pages
here's your homepage your customer
service your about us your 404 page your
privacy policy if we click on one of
these about us you can see it lets us
choose like the content
here's your WYSIWYG the design you could
say it's going to be three column one
column whatever the metadata so this is
really where you're editing your page
content your static blocks your static
blocks are little blocks that are going
to be on your page so this footer links
let's click on this one and as you can
see it's about us a customer service
privacy policy
if you go down here and the bottom of
your page here those links if we want to
just say let's say test and save save
block let's refresh this page we should
see test down here here it is so this is
our static blocks we also have widgets
and if you remember before we went over
sort of what their type of widgets are
you can create a static block recently
compared products orders and returns
there's also two stuff that you can do
in here we'll go over that again later
polls is its own category I might have
said it as a widget before but it's
actually the own thing you can create as
many polls as you want and then you can
add them to your site as you can see
this what is your favorite Magento
feature has apparently four thousand
responses you can get your answers here
see what the vote count is delete things
edited okay reports this is going to be
you can see your sales reports you can
see let's see if we want to say no
period from whatever May first to today
and let's see we just click show reports
not going to find anything because we
don't have any sales but either way you
can click show report it's going to
generate a report you can click export a
can export as an excel file or CSV
there's reports on all sorts of stuff so
products and cards actually here is the
product that we had in our cart in the
previous two uh let's see two videos ago
you can export this this this way you
can keep track of this data in your own
way if you want you know if you have its
Excel spreadsheets that you want to
track all your data yourself you can do
it that way again these are just reports
for any of the stuff it's nice and easy
to get to so here a system and system is
a beast in itself so we're going to take
a whole tutorial video to just go over
system there's all sorts of things in
here my account notification tools
whatever so in the next lesson I'm going
to show you all the stuff in this system
menu
and this is where a lot of your site
lives in terms of configuration and
setting things up there's also some
other useful things in there too so just
being able to import an export so if you
have any questions feel free to leave a
comment on the video it isn't the
Twitter level up tuts let us know your
thinking
once again this is Scott with level of
tuts and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
