level up tots today we're going to
continue our education on expression
engine and pick up where the last
tutorial left off with free form so in
this tutorial what we plan to cover are
the basics of creating a contact form
using free form so let's get into it
bring up my browser and this is where we
left off with the site on the last
tutorial video we went over the freeform
module so that was add-ons modules free
form and you know what I I'm going to go
ahead and just add this one to my list
up here just cuz I'm Pony cap to keep
coming back to so I'm just go ahead
click Add you maybe you need to do this
maybe you don't i'm going to call this
form and trees and it's meant when i
head it to the top right here alright so
the idea is we are going to create a
form now now in the last tutorial we
covered you know these items and now
we're actually going to create the form
and we're going to go as far as getting
the form to show our the form entry to
show up here let's go ahead and do that
so to do that we need to go into a
template so I'm gonna credit go ahead
and go into the template manager and
just create a new group I'll call
contact and I will I will duplicate this
site not that I need anything out of it
really except for I sorta with the shell
the side of one of the pages here so I'm
go ahead and just delete these other
ones out just so I could have really
this little bit so that wasn't much of a
savings button anyway so we'll go ahead
and do this so to start a free form we
do this it's a little bit bigger for you
guys um let you go expressionengine tag
free form and in this case the tag that
we're interested in using is form and
this is a tip this is a pair so i'm
gonna go ahead and close it down here
okay and now what we want to do is we
want to pass in some parameters and so
the first parameter that we're going to
do or though i'm going to set here is
called collection and what a collection
does is it allows us or a groups are the
entries into a collection so that you
can filter by them later for your
convenience you'll see this in action
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to tell free form which fields are
required say name an email this is by
the way we're only going to have three
fields name email and comment that's
pretty normal for a contact form i think
but certainly you can have more fields
anyway so there's quired return this is
one that we're going to use contact i
thinks is one of the set here and what
this does is once the form is
successfully submitted it's going to
take you to this page in the next
tutorial series what we're going to do
is we're going to cover we're going to
take it's going to return you to a page
that is dynamically going to pull in
content content from the entry they had
just submitted so but for now is going
to return it to from to the thing to a
thanks page and let's see here oh and
then of course notify so what this
notify will do is send you an email
whenever this form is completed this is
a pipe delimited field so if you have a
couple people at your at your work that
you want this to go to certainly you can
just you know put in each one of their
addresses
so but i'm really gonna use this one oh
boy there we go alrighty so that's that
so now what we want to do is we want to
output an actual form here and I already
got one baked up I'm sitting in my paste
Oh rats
sitting here we go okay cool here it is
so here's the form and so what all this
contains is a label and an input so this
is a label for name and the input for
what's the name name and this is the
label for the email with the input email
and then the text area name equals
comment and the name on the inputs and
textures is very important because those
values need to match the values that
were defined under the module so I'm
going to go ahead and go back into that
and go into fields this is modules free
form fields and the values that they
need to match our right here so name
email and then if you remember in the
last video I created one called comment
so mine match I just have another input
with the type of submit I changed a
value to comment and so go let's go
ahead and submit this now I haven't
created this thanks Paige will do that
in a second but let's go ahead and hit
update I'm going to now go to that
contact page and we just have a form
here so I'm just going to type in my
name a email address of mine that's
different than the notify and a comment
and submit now it reset this and it
actually brought us to a thanks Paige
sort of it actually is just loading the
contact index because things doesn't
exist so we're gonna actually going to
create things in just a second here but
before we do that I'm going to go back
over to the modules page for free form
and go back to entries and now that I've
submitted one we should see it here so
here's my contact us collect our entry
it's got my name email am I comment so
you know there that's that's how this
works it's not terribly complicated but
now let's go back over to the template
and I think it's one thing I didn't
really mention was these are just very
few of the parameters that you can pass
it into a free form form there are many
others and I would encourage you to
check those out as they may be
applicable to your site and you can
check them out on Sol spaces
documentation for free form so now what
we want to do just real quick because
create this return page and then that's
going to be it for this tutorial so
ahead and do that contact i'm going to
create a new template
and thanks and I'm just going to copy
the contact all right contact index and
all I'm going to do here is just um put
a horizontal rule and just say thanks
for your submission in the next tutorial
like I said we're going to do something
cooler than that so I'm just go ahead
and refresh this page this is actually
going to go away but just ignore that
it's because we don't have had an
enabled PHP for this temp is template if
you remember in one of the earlier
videos that's what we're bringing that
they're so sort of ignore that even
though I'm highlighting it here there we
go thanks for your submission and so
really now what would happen is if we
rather contact page and just did this
thing one more time to come on to submit
and thanks for your submission so there
you go that's how you create a basic
contact form an expression engine using
soul spaces module free form thanks a
lot for watching and guys remember to
subscribe to our YouTube channel thanks
a lot take care but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
