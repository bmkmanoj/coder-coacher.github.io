of tutorials and in this video we're
gonna go ahead and get started with our
code base we're gonna talk a little bit
about crate react native app we're gonna
talk a little bit about what we're doing
and we're gonna talk a little bit about
why but most importantly we're gonna get
set up so let's get started right now
okay so in this series what we're going
to be doing is building an app from the
ground up using react native where we're
going to be able to store things to a
database we're going to have
authentication we're gonna be able to
hit that API and we're gonna be able to
pull in the data whenever we want it the
application that we're building is going
to be a note-taking app or a journaling
app or something to that effect right
you can modify it based on your needs at
the end of the day what it's going to be
doing is saving posts under your name
and your account and then having them
being able to be accessed via the API
and you'll be able to have a preview
list and click on it it's gonna be
really super cool and you're gonna see
the benefits of using something like
graph cool
almost immediately now I don't want to
get too much into that just yet but we
do want to get started with our project
if you had to react natives
documentation at Facebook that github
that IO for it slash react native from
here we can click the get started and
from here you'll want to make sure we
have the Quick Start tab we are going to
be using create react native app okay
now the directions don't necessarily
tell you this however creep react native
app and Expo which is what create react
native app is built on are actually
having some problems with NPM using the
latest npm version so if you are getting
NPM errors you're gonna want to go ahead
and use yarn instead I will be using
yarn for the sake of this series here
but you'll want to make sure you have
yarn installed if you don't know about
yarn it's an alternative package manager
for NPM you can get it at yarn PKG comm
i won't be showing you how to install
that it's really super simple you just
click install yarn and follow the
direction
here okay so what we need to be doing is
first install create react native app
globally onto our system now we can do
that with NPM install - G create react
native app like so if you get any sort
of errors about this oh well you
probably won't at this point but you
definitely want to make sure you have
yarn installed don't don't ignore that
or else you will have some issues along
the way okay so we ran NPM installed - G
create - react - native - app which is
going to give us access to the create
react native app command-line utility
allowing us to create a new project now
this is a super sweet new project while
not SuperDuper new maybe a year old or
so that gives you a much easier start
into react native using something called
Expo now you might be wondering if this
is an intermediate series why are we
still using Create react native app well
the answer is is that Expo makes your
life easier in so many more ways than
just getting started so because of that
we are going to be using Expo through
the course of this series although I
will show you how to eject from it if
you need to okay so let's check it out
now that we have create react native app
installed and all you have to do is run
create react native app as a command so
let's go ahead and do that again create
- react - native - app then the name of
our app which is just going to be
Journal okay you can give this any sort
of name that you'd like and again if you
have yarn installed it's going to use
yarn here if you don't you'll get some
errors okay so once more last warning
news yarn and while this is installing I
should mention something else you're
gonna want to go ahead and go to the
respective app store if you are on
Google Play you'll go to Google Play if
you're on an iPhone go to the iPhone and
you're going to want to install the expo
app it's exp oh and this will allow you
to debug your application on your own
device while you're developing it with
live reloading and stuff
that if you are not interested in that
in fact you can use the simulator or the
Android emulator so what we have here is
our application installed where we can
now CD into journal and we can run yarn
start this is going to load up our
application now while this is doing this
I'm going to go ahead and open up the
app in our text editor I'm using vyas
code for this project but you can
certainly use any particular text editor
of your choice there's nothing limiting
here to vs code itself however if you
want to follow along for the best
possible way and see maybe some
shortcuts along the way vs code it is
okay and as you can see here our
projects up in here I'm going to just
bump up the font size so we can see
things a little bit better on the
interface you can tell it's done because
we got all of this message saying that
it was up and ready if we scroll up in
our terminal you'll be able to see in my
case a giant QR code your should
probably not be this large this QR code
if you have the expo app you can
actually scan this QR code right now in
your expo app on your actual device and
see your react native app live on your
phone which is a really great way to
develop in my opinion because you can
instant access you can feel the app with
your finger it's not like using the
simulator emulator okay so check it out
we now have an app up and running and
and you can see we have some directions
you can head a to open up in the Android
device or emulator I to open up in the
iOS emulator queue to display the QR
code are to restart the packager or
capital are to restart the packager and
clear cache or d2 toggled development
mode which we are currently in now if
you hit a or I right now nothing might
happen now if you want to know how to
set up the Android emulator or the iOS
emulator you'll want to head back to the
react native for everyone series where
we go and setup the iOS simulator or the
Android simulator for me since I already
have the iOS simulator set up I can just
hit I here and you can see it's going to
open up the simulator myself
let's see as the low boots up here or it
looks like we have a new iPhone or
something the iPhone 10 and that this is
going to have our actual application I'm
sorry not the iPhone 10 the iPhone X
what we can see here is our app is
starting up within Expo and soon we're
going to have an actual native app
running on a simulator that we can
modify okay and just like that we have a
real live and native app here if we were
to head to our vs code and head to our
app dot j s file let me pop this open
here and let's just go ahead and well
let's modify this text in here because
why not we want to see this thing
actually working okay so we can remove
both of those and let's go ahead and on
the third text line here let me zoom
this out just so it's a little bit
easier for you to see on the third text
line here we could just go say hello
okay standard hello world only this time
leaving off the world because why not
and we should be able to see our
simulator update nearly immediately with
our hello text now this is part of the
benefit of working in expo is that we
get these updates quite a bit faster
than we do if we're compiling the native
code every single time so check it out
we now have hello we have our react
native app installed and set up again if
you need to review any of the
foundations of react native check out
the react native for everyone series on
this channel it does a good job of going
over all of the basics and that sort of
stuff to get you up and running with
react native and this series we're
primarily going to be focused on stuff
that was not covered in that series
we're going to be like I mentioned
hitting a database importing data user
accounts are going to be having
navigation which we didn't have in the
last series at all so some of the
trickier things in react native so check
it out in the next few videos as we set
up navigation and then get started with
our graph QL stuff so thanks so much for
watching as always this is Scott and
I'll see you in the next one if you
would like to complete this series head
on over to level up tutorials com4 slash
story you can either purchase this
series outright or you can become a
LevelUp pro get full access to this
entire series the code and all that good
stuff so thank you so much for watching
and i'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
