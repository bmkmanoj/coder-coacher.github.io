up Tut's and today we're going to pick
up where we left off by adding a new
widget area to our templates now we've
added a new widget area to our theme
it's going to work we could throw a
whole bunch of widgets in to this in
fact let's just add a tag cloud for fun
and let's just add a whole bunch of
stuff just so we have this for when we
actually get this to display here so we
have all these things in our widget area
you'll notice if we refresh they're
going to stay there so they have now all
been added however simply by browsing to
our website you will not see any of that
stuff show up anywhere and we want to
change that right and what we want to do
is we want to add this widget area to
the very bottom of this page but we're
going to want to keep it into this main
area of content here but just below our
posts so if you remember we talked a
little bit about the loop and it looped
around and got all of our posts and
displayed them out here if you go into
your inspect element and look at your
code you can see we have a series of
articles and you can see that there's a
comment that's you know it's got a pound
and then content and so we want this to
be within this content div or just
essentially within this primary div
basically anywhere inside of here
now we want to be able to find this
template and then add the code we need
to make sure that shows up so let's take
a look at our template files and if you
remember before our template is living
in WP content slash themes' and then
slash 2014 child and then these are the
pages that we have notice we have index
page no sidebar these are the ones that
we've modified so if we come into our
index dot PHP
file here and we scroll down you'll see
that primary div and that content div we
want this to live inside of our content
here because that's the styling that's
applied and inside of our content we
basically have this loop that's just
going to be getting all of our posts you
saw when we were inspecting that inside
of our content we just have a bunch of
articles so we want this widget area to
be directly after the articles now we
can scroll down here and you'll see this
helpful comment that's showing us that
this is the end of the content div we
can confirm that this is going to show
just by writing a big old test I'm going
to put this in like in an h1 just so it
shows that nice and nice and bright
we're going to absolutely delete this
before we do anything else but let's
come in here and refresh and we scroll
down you'll see our big h1 test that's
inside of this content area so how do we
display our widgets well it's actually a
very simple one line of code but what it
is is it's really just a shorthand way
of writing an if statement and it's
actually really nice and easy if you
need to write little one-liners so for
this particular thing we hardly have to
write anything except for what the the
content is so what we can do here is we
can type a bracket or less than and the
question mark PHP because what we're
going to be doing is opening up a PHP
code area and we're going to be writing
PHP so you close that with a question
mark greater than sign just like that
and in between these two you know ends
beginning and end is where we're going
to write our line of PHP now what this
is going to do is it's going to say if
there is content in this widget so if
this widget area has content then show
it otherwise don't show it okay so what
we can
is if and then parentheses and inside of
our if we can say dynamic underscore
sidebar and then a parenthesis here
because this is a function and we're
going to be passing it the string of the
name
and when I say name I mean the ID of our
widget area so if you come back to your
functions.php you'll note that we had
our ID as level up new widget area all
lowercase with underscores and we're
going to paste that in there between
quotes so this is passing this dynamic
sidebar now what we can then say outside
of the parentheses is colon else colon
and if now it's not important is the
stuff at the end because this Elson end
if is basically saying otherwise show
absolutely like if the sidebar exists
show it otherwise show nothing and then
in the if statement so while this code
might seem a little confusing don't
worry about it it's doing something very
simple and it's just saying if the
sidebar exists then I display it so I
will link it to the WordPress codex
where you can go ahead and read that
code for yourself if you want to copy
and paste it to make sure you're not
messing anything up but it's just if a
dynamic sidebar well dynamic underscore
sidebar past the ID notice how every
single parenthesis I have has been
matched colon else colon and if and then
close and with a semicolon and then
close our PHP statement okay so we've
now added a widget area we've thrown
things in the widget area and now we've
added this statement that's going to
print out
our sidebar so let's refresh the page
and you'll see we have a whole host of
things that we just threw in there
obviously the styling is weird because
we did not write any CSS to accommodate
a calendar or a search bar or a tag
cloud in our main content area but as
you can see all of its here and we now
have official working widget area that's
going to show up at the bottom of the
content of the index page now you might
be saying like well this is only the
index page what if I wanted them the
other pages the posts the pages any of
that stuff well luckily all you have to
do is copy and paste this line of code
every single place you want this widget
area to show up and your widgets will
show up there so that's how you add a
widget area and enable widgets on your
theme so you can get busy not only
making your own themes and adding
widgets but you can add widgets to
themes that you've downloaded and
extended in case they're not doing the
things that you need them to do so as
