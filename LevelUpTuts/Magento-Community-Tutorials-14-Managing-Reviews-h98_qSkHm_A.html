love-love Tut's and today I'm going to
show you how to manage reviews and
ratings on your site so in the last
lesson we created a digital product you
don't have to have this digital product
but I'm just gonna click on this one B
just because we you know we just did it
let's be the first to review this
product you can on your website review
any product to see how this works but
we're gonna click B first to review and
of course we're gonna give this five
stars in quality price and value because
it's a great product because I'm selling
it so we're gonna have the nickname and
this will be the users nickname so I
mean they can beaten leave their name is
anything so this is just me leaving this
review and it was magnificent okay you
know spelling an error okay okay
album that's great thanks okay
let's click Submit review so what
happens now now the user gets a a
message here that says your review has
been accepted for moderation okay so if
we refresh this page or we go to this
product again you know you're not going
to see is you're not going to see the
review itself so if we go to the actual
product there's details product tags
whatever but you're not going to see the
review so as an admin you're going to
want to check your site and if you're
getting a lot of traffic you're gonna
want to frequently go in here and we're
gonna go to ratings and reviews and then
we're going to do customer reviews and
then pending reviews so here are your
pending reviews chances are you'll
either have you know none of these are a
bunch of these so if nobody's visiting
your site you might not get that many
reviews the Bloods that you have lots of
reviews in here you can actually batch
approve them if you can just tell just
by looking at here that it's not a spam
so if you look at here and you see you
know by somebody and they have all this
information it's a legitimate review you
can click you can just click this check
box here or you could click select all
here it doesn't matter
and then actions you could do update
status
change the status to approved and click
Submit ok total one record has been
updated now if we go to reviews and
ratings under pending reviews this will
not show up let's check out all reviews
ok so here it is and likewise let's
check out this manage ratings we come
here we can see that these are our
ratings right so if you remember when it
we asked to review the product let's see
be first to review this product although
it won't be first anymore
we have these options quantity or
quality price and value you can have
these be anything you want so let's just
click on one price for example and we
can say this is Awesomeness
ok and let's save the rating so now
that's actually gonna be awesomeness we
refresh this they they give it a five
star on awesomeness and this is the the
third one right here of course you can
create as many or as few as you would
like you can come in here and delete
them if you click on this so you can
just click delete rating right up here
likewise if you're back here on this
page you can add a new rating and
they're gonna show up here so now if you
notice that we approved this rating and
it was magnificent review by Scott that
was great thanks posted on this date
here's our quality review and if we want
to leave another one saying sucks awful
and I hate it okay so let's just post
this one and again it's going to go in
for moderation now if we come back here
to reviews ratings all pending reviews
let's approve this one select all let's
approve it at different let's click on
it here you can see here this is the
review ok cool let's say this oh I'm
sorry let's change this status to
approved and let's save this and now our
review is no longer in pending will
refresh our page here or we'll come back
to our product and as you can see it's
given us the review of three stars
because we've had two reviews one of
which was straight fives and one of
which was straight ones okay so then you
can see the reviews you can sort them
how you like and that is your reviews so
that's how you moderate and set reviews
and how to edit them to be exactly what
you want if you have any questions or
comments as always please leave a
comment on the video or hit us up at
