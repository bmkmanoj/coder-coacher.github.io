up tuts and today I'm going to be
showing you a new CSS experiment now
what we're going to be doing is taking
the functionality that you would
normally get with a jQuery slide down
and we're going to be accomplishing that
slide down animation using only CSS now
we're going to do this with just a
transition and some in height max height
some padding stuff so keep watching
we're going to show you how to do that
right now so what we have here is a
basic starter page sort of like what we
had in the last video let's take a look
at the HTML really quick we really just
have a header with an h1 up top then we
have a Mane with an h2 and then a
paragraph next we have an h4 that says
accordion trigger and a paragraph of the
class of accordion ok so now what we
want to do is be able to have this
accordion trigger when you click on it
we want it to toggle whether this
paragraph is being shown or not so right
now we can see that it is in fact being
shown now what we're going to be doing
is using a transition on the accordion
paragraph but you may have noticed that
transitioning height with CSS just
doesn't work well luckily there's a cool
little workaround that we can transition
max height now the combination of
overflow:hidden and transitioning that
max height we can show and hide this
based on a toggle now we're just going
to toggle the class with jQuery like
we've done in the past but we're not
going to be using jQuery for the actual
animation so let's go ahead and modify
our CSS the first thing we want to do is
create an open state and now the open
state will be what it is once we have it
toggled on so let's go ahead in our CSS
keep in mind I'm not using sass here I'm
just going to keep this as CSS like
we've been doing and when the accordion
has a class of open then we're going to
make sure it has some things one of
which we're going to make sure it has a
padding of 20 pixels now this seems like
I'm duplicating this but I'll get into
that in a second and now we're going to
make sure this has a max height and now
the max height has to be whatever the
maximum height that this could be
because this is how high not how high
it's going to open but how high it could
open so if we smush this down here let's
say on mobile this is what it's like
more at a reasonable height you can see
that this paragraph is going to be
pretty high it's going to be let's look
it looks like 320 pixels high so let's
count on this being a max height of
something like 400 pixels so like I said
at this state it's not going to be 400
pixels tall ever but the max height is
not going to make it that tall it's just
going to say it has the possibility of
getting that tall so let's go ahead and
say max height of 400 pixels okay so the
open state has a padding of 20 and a max
height of 400 pixels now let's add some
things to the non open state so that we
can see what it should look like when
it's closed now we have a padding of 20
however that's going to be a problem and
I'll show you in a second what we need
to do here is add max height again and
we went ahead a max height of 0 because
when the accordion is that hits normal
state it's going to be closed so the
next set of 0 you don't see a lot of
changes what we need to do next is add
an overflow of hidden now with an
overflow of hidden you can see it's
actually cutting up the content and not
just resizing the background but we also
notice that even though we said that max
height is 0 it's still has some height
and if you were to check that hide out
you notice that it was 40 pixels what
max ID doesn't take into account is
padding so we have 20 pixels of padding
here what we want actually is we want
when this is in its closed State we want
the top and bottom padding to be gone
but we want the left and right padding
to be there so we can say 0 20 okay so
we're now in a state of closed this
accordion is no longer visible however
you can see that if we come into the
HTML though and add a class of open here
it's back so let's go ahead and delete
this class of open K it's gone let's
come back into our CSS and we have one
last thing to add to our CSS it's going
to be a transition now this transition
we want to have beyond everything
because we want this to be the padding
we want it to be the max height and we
might even do some other things in a
second too so let's just say all and
then it's going to happen over the point
of zero point two seconds and then we're
going to say ease just to make it a
little bit smoother and now let's go
ahead and add our toggle so in another
video we showed you how to add a little
jQuery toggle in fact let's go ahead and
add something to our CSS really quick or
HTML really quick we're going to have a
class of accordion toggle to this h1 or
this h4 just like that simply because we
can now target this with jQuery okay
let's come into our jQuery and like
you've seen before we do dollar sign
parenthesis and then quotes and then we
do dot accordion a toggle hut cardian -
toggle and what that does is it captures
the accordion it says we are now working
with the accordion and we're going to be
using the method of on and on it the
first parameter takes is click within a
string the second parameter it takes
after a comma is a function so we type
function let's actually give this code
some more room here we type function
then parentheses and brackets finish it
up with a semicolon ok so inside of our
function is what happens when we click
this statement says alright something
happens when we click on the accordion
toggle what happens so now we need to
find the accordion simply by doing
dollar sign for parentheses quotes and
then period accordion
just like that and we can do it a toggle
clasp and then in quotes the class we're
going to be tackling is open so like I
said we're not actually doing the
animation with jQuery which is nice
because we don't have to rely on jQuery
for anything presentational it's simply
turning a class on or off that way if we
didn't use jQuery let's say we wanted to
write this in normal JavaScript or we
wanted to use another technology like
angular or something you could toggle
the class with any of these other
technologies and this animation would
still work okay so we now have saved
this let's give this a try
and I want to click our accordion
trigger you can see that our content
slides up and down perfectly like that
cool awesome and if you want to add a
little bit extra nice flare to this what
we can do is actually give this some
opacity change so if we were to say
accordion opacity zero when it's closed
and then when it's open we could give it
an opacity of 1 and since we have the
transition on everything we're going to
get nice little fade in and the actual
content when we trigger this now and you
can see it's sort of it comes in like
that it's a nice little effect cool and
if you don't like that opacity and you
just wanted to be a standard style
accordion you could always just remove
the opacity changes here so we now have
an accordion trigger and what's really
cool about this is it's totally flexible
we could have this trigger anywhere we
want because the jQuery is just looking
for a trigger and looking for a
paragraph you can style these no matter
how you want you can make it look like a
drawer or anything like that or you
could just have it a simple trigger that
you know opens up this content so check
it out this is how you do a slide toggle
or an accordion action using CSS for the
animation so as always this is Scott

level up Tut's so with level up Pro
can download the videos you can have
code examples for the CSS experiments
and we're even going through and doing
the back catalogue to make sure those
have code examples there's a private
form you get an ad-free experience on
level up Tut's calm
there's even a two-hour sass mastery
course which is similar to the saz
videos that I have on level up Tut's but
it was made special for the Tut's Plus
