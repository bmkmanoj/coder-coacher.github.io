up Tut's and today I'm gonna be giving
you your seventh CoffeeScript tutorial
and today we're gonna be going over
objects and arrays objects and arrays
are not too difficult with CoffeeScript
in fact there's nothing really crazy
here it's gonna save you a little bit of
typing and it generally I think is a
really organized structure however it's
nothing sort of mind-blowing
okay so for a raise what we have here is
pretty much normally like you declare an
array except you just pretty much need
to leave off the bar so let's say we
were having let's just say types ANOVA
say type and then equals and then when
you got bracket and then we're just
gonna have rice and then come out and
say crab or something and then we could
say cucumber okay so these are all of
the strings in this type array so if we
save this and we click over to our
script is you can see how it's doing is
declaring a variable name type and then
assigning it just like you normally
would and adding that the semicolon on
the end here there's nothing really
quick you can do about this you can also
write the same thing with spaces let's
say you wanted to you know have this
organized space tab over and then you
don't have to have the commas here we do
it like this and then we save this click
over here you're going to get the exact
same thing so this is the array you know
these are how you write arrays I
personally just gonna leave the other
way it's nice and easy to look at and
it's pretty standard it's probably what
you're used to with a javascript in
general for objects though you can
actually do outfits very similarly to
how it just showed you doing arrays
let's say we have an object called sushi
so the sushi and sushi is going to equal
and then we can just do enter and then
tab over one and this is going to be our
first property of this object so we can
say we can just say kind here so it will
say kind and a kinda say roll and then
now we just don't know that we don't
have
, here we can just to enter and then if
we need to do a method inside of here we
can just declare our method very easily
something like how we would normally do
and let's say we wanted a sushi to roll
we could just say roll and then and then
we're going to do so colon space and
then you're going to do - greater than
sign just like how we did at our
functions above here so this is
declaring this function this is a method
in your object and this can just return
I don't know it can just return the word
rolled okay so it's been rolled let's
save this and let's click over to our
copy script to see what this did exactly
so scroll down here so we have our
object sushi in sides kind with a value
of roll and then the roll function is
just returning this rolled that's all
it's returning so if you need to call
that then it'd just be like a normal
method call okay and then we can even
just jump down here and right down here
we could do something else so let's call
this we can do the fish the fish type
and the fish will just be salmon so
that's nice and easy it comes out
exactly like how you'd expect here's
your object and here's your method
inside of your object and if you needed
to actually do an object inside of an
object let's say let's see how more
complex we can get this in ingredients
we can say I'm sorry v8 this to IMG and
ingredients we can do : and then if you
do space and tab over you're going to be
building an object inside of an object
so now we're going to say let's say rice
and the rice is just going to be white
and then let's just say this vegetable
will say veg and this veg is equal to
cucumber so now if we save this pop back
over here you can see we have an object
within our object
this is err ingredients is rice is white
rice its vegetables of cucumber and so
we have our our sushi object here most
is really nice and easy building
object you didn't have to do any of
these brackets you didn't really have to
keep track of any of the structure here
I had to do is tab over anytime you
wanted to have an object or have a
property of that object also one of the
really nice things that CoffeeScript
does is if you're trying to use a
reserved word in their example they give
class right if you try to use the word
class in JavaScript it's not gonna lie
to use as a property of an object
without putting it in quotes
well CoffeeScript will find that for you
let's just show you this so if we have
this called class and we'll just say I
don't know I'll duplicate roll-ups I
can't think of anything else right now
and we'll save this it's going to
automatically give class quotation marks
for us right here you can see and this
is nice because it allows us to use this
word and we don't really have to think
about it it just works okay well that's
how you make objects and arrays in
CoffeeScript in the next lesson I'm
gonna go over something called splats
okay once again this is Scott with
Louisville up tuts and if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
below in the video or hit us up at
Twitter or level up to us let us know
what you think alright alright thank you
for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
