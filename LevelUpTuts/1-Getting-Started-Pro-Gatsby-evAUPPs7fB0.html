tutorials in this video we're gonna get
started by installing Gatsby and getting
started with a project let's get going
on that right now okay to get started
we're gonna head to Gatsby j/s org and
here you can do some reading about
Gatsby if you'd like however we're just
going to dive right into it and you can
hit the doc section or you can just
follow along with what I'm doing here
now this series assumes that you have
node.js installed so if you don't head
to the essential skills of Jas video
installing nodejs
and that way you can actually get note
installed and have this up and running
we are also going to be using the
command line which I am going to assume
that you are familiar with if you are
not there are some command line tutorial
videos on this channel available as well
what we want to do first and foremost is
install the global command line utility
for working with Gatsby and we can do so
with NPM install - - global and then
Gatsby - CLI for command line interface
okay so we're gonna hit enter here as
what this does is who's going to install
Gatsby globally and if you are getting
some permissions errors you'll want to
go ahead and just google npm install
global permissions errors and there's a
one-liner that will fix it or you can
simply just do sudo NPM install Gatsby
all this stuff the sudo isn't the
recommended version but it is quick and
dirty and will get you here okay so what
we do have now is we have the Gatsby
command line interface installed and we
can start to use this to actually give
us a new site and we can use this simply
by typing in Gatsby now I'm in my
directory where I keep websites so I can
have a new and then the file for this is
just going to be level up - blog okay
you can name this anything that you
would like it now I'm using the word
blog here because Gatsby is often used
for blog type content it is however also
used for basic static sites someone can
hit enter here and have this create us a
new Gatsby
site and we're gonna be going over
exactly what that means in a second so
with this install tool is going to do is
basically get a set up with our build
tool it's going to get a set up with all
of the files that we need and once we
actually just get going and actually set
the site up into build mode you are
going to see a basic full website well
with a very very very little effort and
that's really the beauty of Gatsby is
that it's going to allow us to not have
to think about that kind of stuff and
we're gonna get a blazingly fast website
for very little okay so another way of
our site created we can simply just
change directories into the level up -
blog or whatever you called your site
and we can run the command Gatsby space
develop now a Gatsby developed is going
to put us into what's called a hot
reloading development environment so
this is going to be the environment when
you make changes you're going to be able
to see these changes happening live and
your Gatsby site okay so it looks like
things are finishing and as we get going
you're going to go ahead and see a URL
pop-up now the default URL is going to
be localhost colon 8080 chol URL as well
for the remainder of this series I'm
gonna go ahead and assume that you have
both the localhost port 8000 up as well
as the graphical URL and I'm gonna tab
between these now if you don't know too
much about graph QL or graphical have no
fear we're gonna be going over quite a
bit of that and if you like graph QL
there's an entire series on level up
tutorials for react native with graph QL
right now so there's even more graph QL
content and lots more coming because let
me tell you I'm a big fan I'm a big big
fan so you're gonna see over the course
of this series a little bit about graph
QL we're gonna be talking a lot about it
because graph QL is one of the ways that
gatsby handles your data so as we dive
in you're going to get to know a little
bit more about how Gatsby overall works
but let's talk a little bit about the
big picture stuff Gatsby is a static
site generator as in this site if we
were to look at the source is going to
be HTML
and while a lot of the site isn't fully
generated as in we're simply just
getting the body and an ID of body
that's just simply because we're in
what's called the development mode now
the development mode is going to treat
this as sort of a non-static site as in
when we write our code everything is
going to be react based and it's all
going to be dynamically created on the
front-end however when we build our site
we're going to be getting an HTML file
fully rendered out for every single page
on the site and those files are going to
load extremely quickly now after the
file loads it's then going to use react
for doing all of the client-side
switching so therefore the initial load
times are going to be insanely fast
because you're getting a straight-up
HTML file just like back in the day when
you wrote a standard HTML site now if
you are not familiar with react you'll
want to check out the react 16 for
everyone series on level up tutorials
this series is also going to assume that
you know react because a large part of
the front-end programming in Gatsby is
done through react ok so we now have our
Gatsby site up and running in
development mode and if we were to run
it gatsby build you'd be getting a fully
built version or it gets be served would
start a local HTML server for testing
the build site those things are going to
be things that we will cover as we go
but as you can see here we do in fact
have a website up and running and if you
give this thing a refresh you can hardly
see the page refreshing it is fast these
sites are very fast and this is
development mode which is even slow
compared to the fully built out site ok
so as we get into it in the next video
what we're gonna be doing is diving into
the files that come with Gatsby and
we're gonna be talking about the file
formats we're gonna be talking about the
file structure and basically everything
you need to know to sort of know where
to go to do things and to make webpages
ok so check it out this is Gatsby we are
now up and running with our first Gatsby
site and we're going to build on this
initially we're going to be pulling in
data from a markdown source and we're
going to be pulling in data from other
sources such as CMS's we're going to
talk about hosting we're gonna be
talking about all the little bells and
whistles for working with things like
styled component
working with working with images working
with external JavaScript all sorts of
awesome stuff if you'd like to learn
even more about Gatsby the most exciting
static site generator round a head to
level up tutorials calm forward such
prone sign up become a pro get access to
the all this series and more like the
ones I mentioned in this series react
native for everyone react native level
to react native with graph QL react for
everyone basically get your react skills
up to par where you can build awesome
fast sites through Gatsby
there's always thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
