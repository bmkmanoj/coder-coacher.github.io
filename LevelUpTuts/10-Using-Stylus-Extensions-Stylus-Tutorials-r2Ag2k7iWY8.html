up tutorials and today we're gonna show
you how you can add extensions on the
stylus so that you can have all sorts of
additional functionality for things like
additional mix-ins
- functions that you can use to entire
grid frameworks there is a ton of extra
stuff available for stylus and it's all
really cool
so we're gonna get started in this video
by installing nib and the next video
we're gonna show you a little bit more
about what nib has to offer so let's get
going on that right now so the first
thing we need to do to install an
extension into stylus is really just
install the note package itself so
Emilee installed stylus in the first
place we installed it using NPM and we
typed in p.m. install
stylus now again we're going to have to
do that we want to install nib globally
on our system now there's lots of ways
that you can use something like NIF you
could actually use it within your build
process so you could have grunt or gulp
taking care of your nib and and
requiring it that way since we're not
using a boat process for these videos
I'm gonna go ahead and show you how to
use nib within the stylus watch command
and then upon other videos after this
we're going to go over the process of
specific plug-ins for gulp or grunt so
let's get into it by heading over to our
terminal
and we have our NPM command since I'm
installing this globally I know that on
this Mac system that I need to use sudo
so I'm gonna type sudo npm install and
then we're going to install nib and ib
and then - g so that's going to install
it globally on your system so that's n
ib once again and we can hit enter it's
gonna ask for your password if you're
using sudo and it's gonna go ahead and
grab the latest version of nib and
install it so as you can see the latest
version is one point one point zero at
the time of making this video and it's
gone ahead and installed NIM in our
system so now it's the time to use nib
in our stylist watch command I'm not
watching anything currently I've stopped
the watch presa process by doing command
C if you need to stop your watch process
if you're not watching already then you
can go ahead and just type this command
as stylus space and then now here comes
the part where we tell stylus that we
want to use nib so we can say base - u
which is saying this uses space and IB
and then the rest of the command is the
exact same so - w style dot sty else so
simply by saying you are - you and the
nib you're letting stylus know that
you're going to be using this additional
package and we can hit enter and you'll
notice off the bed nothing is really
happening any differently besides the
fact that it's watching this user local
nib folder in here however nothing in
our documents really gonna be changed
and we can actually use any the features
of nib just quite yet so what we need to
do next is actually import this and this
might seem totally familiar if you're
used to using extensions incest so a lot
of this process is very similar to what
you do for something like sass now we
can say add import and then in quotes
always type it is nib just like that and
instantly nothing's really happened but
let's go ahead and use a nib mixin so
some of the things that nib comes with
our mix-ins that help make your life
easier if you've used something like
compass you'll know that it includes all
these great css3 mix-ins that include
browser prefixes and stuff like that and
sometimes the mix-ins are just a easier
syntax to writing something well just to
make sure that nibs working here we're
going to go ahead and just use a
gradient mixin and so to do that we're
going to come to our body here and I'm
going to type background
and we don't need the : we can type
linear - gradient and then in
parentheses we're going to say it starts
at the top and it goes from white to
black so that's top comma white to come
up black just like that and you'll
notice in our CSS over here now we not
only have the background linear gradient
top with the hex value and bottom with
the other hex value white and black
there we also have gotten WebKit
background and Moz background so it's
bringing in these prefixes and we never
wrote a mixin to do that for linear
gradient so this is one of the features
that nib is bringing in for us in fact
we'll be able to delete the css3 mix-ins
we already created in the previous
examples and just use nibs because
they're going to include all of our
prefixes for us and the great part about
nib and stylus has to pose to something
like sass if you're using these mix-ins
they're transparent right we don't have
to say @include and then the mix of name
and passive properties like a function
we can simply just define this like a
normal CSS property here saying
background linear gradient and it will
recognize that and stylus will recognize
that and compile it correctly for us
cool so we now have our first stylus
extension installed and let me tell you
there's some absolutely great stylus
extensions and while I'll be showing you
all of my favorite extensions and how
they can make your workflow and process
that much better so check it out in the
next video we're gonna go a little bit
more in depth with nib and show you
what's included there as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments or to
come in the video or hit us up at
Twitter or Facebook we love to hear from
you thanks for watching and we'll see
you in the next one I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
