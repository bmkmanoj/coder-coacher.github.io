up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be talking about how you can
set roles and permissions to give access
to certain users to be able to do
certain things that they might not be
able to do before for instance you could
give a user access to see the
administrative toolbar perhaps to create
a new page but not do anything else so
let's get started on that right now
so now that we have a couple of users we
can actually see the difference between
our user roles so in the last video I
removed the administrative role from
this other user and you could see they
no longer have access to the toolbar now
I want to slowly give them new
permissions such as having access to the
toolbar and being able to at least
create new content even though if they
cannot publish it so what do we do about
roles well if we come to our admin menu
when we select people you'll see we have
permissions and roles now permissions
are going to be more granular for
instance here we have on anonymous user
authenticated user and administrator
these checkmarks show exactly what these
people can do an authenticated user can
view comments they can skip comment
approval and post comments where an
anonymous user can only view comments
without being able to post or skip
comment approval now you can see there's
warnings that say have to have security
implications and that's something to be
aware about when granting different
people roles who's going to be having
those exact abilities now you can see
there's a whole ton of stuff here and
for every single module you add you
might be growing this list even more so
what we want to do is first we want to
add a new user role so let's head to
roles here at the top now we have these
roles let's go ahead and add a new role
we can add this as content creator
ok so this is going to be a person who's
going to be actually being able to
create
content but not actually publish it so
there gonna be a content creator and
they're gonna need an editor and
administrator or somebody to go ahead
and approve it you'll notice I just
dragged this up here you can change the
order based on sort of importance it's
nice to actually have them be sort of in
order of least abilities to most
abilities that way everything sort of is
nice and easy to tell at a glance let's
head to permissions now that we have our
new role and what you'll see is we have
a whole bunch of empty check boxes
however our content creator is getting
these same roles as an authenticated
user so you'll notice those are grayed
out we can't uncheck them because a
content creator is an authenticated user
with more permissions so what kind of
things can a content creator do well we
don't want them to administer blocks we
maybe want that at some point
let's keep scrolling down what we're
going to be looking for is content here
we have users we have files we have
filters right now they can have access
to basic HTML or full HTML let's give
them access to full and restricted HTML
just so they can actually create their
content as needed notice how
authenticated user does not have those
same options if we keep scrolling down
administer image styles we do not want
them to administer image styles however
node is where we would want them to have
access you'll notice a node in Drupal an
individual piece of content is referred
to as a node so we want them to access
the content overview page so we can
check this we want them to not be able
to administer content not administer
content types
bypass access control delete revisions
or any of this stuff but we maybe want
them to be able to view revisions and
view own unpublished content we want
them to be able to create new content or
even delete their own content but not
delete other people's content and again
we would want them to edit their own
content
now let's keep scrolling down we could
also have them be able to view revisions
now we can have them create new basic
page delete their own content edit their
own content and a few revisions so as
you can see those are some basic
permissions that we're now granting to
this content creator and as you can see
it's on a per content type basis so
let's say you want somebody only manages
blog posts and not basic pages well you
can uncheck all of these basic page
things and they're only gonna have
access to articles if we continue to
scroll down you can see all sorts of
other things but nothing else that we
need to modify however we do want them
to have access to the administrative
toolbar you'll notice that this
administrative toolbar will be a bit
different based on their permissions so
let's keep scrolling down and let's
click Save now let's head to our list of
users and let's edit Scott once more and
change this user you'll see we now have
content creator let's go ahead and save
this and now when we come back to the
other logged in user Scott over to
refresh you'll see we have a modified
very small version of the admin toolbar
it really just has their own shortcuts
their user page and the content link now
Drupal takes care of all this for you
based on what permissions so you don't
have to have all these extra links there
it automatically filters it all for you
now we click content and you see we have
an added content button now you might be
noticing this theme is not the
administrative theme so how do we get
this person to have the administrative
theme let's head back to permissions and
let's look for theme now I just did
command F to do a find and you'll notice
we have administer themes but just a
little bit further down we have view
administration theme let's go ahead and
check that and let's save permissions
once again you can see that saving
permissions sometimes requires some
tweaking now
head back to our content creator when i
refresh the add content page looks
exactly like what you would see for any
other administrator if I want to add a
page I can't if I'd like to edit any of
these pages you'll notice I can't
there's no edit buttons there's no way I
can edit this content as it was created
by somebody else but if I add a new
piece of content let's just say an
article we can just say hello
hi-hi-hi okay and I'll come down and
save this content so you'll notice now
the article has been created and I can
see it I can view it if I come to
content you'll notice that we have an
article here and it's named hello and
now I have this operation where I can
edit and/or delete it now this doesn't
hold true for this user the
administrator has access to everything
they could see that de Scott posted this
article and say why why did he post this
article he shouldn't have this here I
just delete it and let's delete it and
it's gone so as you can see you can make
your permissions very granular you can
make a user be able to do anything that
you want them to do and not do anything
that you don't want them to do now
setting permissions is really key to
having a nice user experience for your
content creators and site managers
because if you'll notice the difference
between this toolbar and this toolbar is
a whole lot of stuff now all this extra
stuff can get confusing people might
come in here they might want to mess
with things and they might just not know
where to go but if you have somebody
whose job is to simply add content
they'll see content add content and it
couldn't be any easier nothing gets lost
in a whole bunch of menus and for many
people this is entirely necessary so
make sure that you're giving your users
the permissions they need by heading to
people and either creating a new role or
defining certain permissions so as
always this is Scott wood level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave it come in the video hurt
me up at Twitter or Facebook I level up
tutorials I'd love to hear from you if
you want access to the rest of these
