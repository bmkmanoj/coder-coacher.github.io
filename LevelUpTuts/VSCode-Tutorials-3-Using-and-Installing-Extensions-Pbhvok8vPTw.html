interface let's talk about one of the
key features in any text editor which is
of course extensions
now extensions are a great thing because
they not only allow you to expand how
the application looks but they also
expand how the application functions and
handles certain types of files so one of
the cool things I like about vs code is
it makes extension sort of write first
class here we have them right in our
left-hand column we can click this and
we have a little indicator to letting us
know that I have five extensions that
are in need of updating but before we
get into that let's actually make this
quite a bit bigger so we can see this
and what's cool about this is that we
can search extensions in the Mike in the
marketplace let's say we want to look
for some react native stuff it's going
to search for react native and it tells
us which ones are most popular so by
default you can see that these ones at
the top are very most popular this one
has two hundred and thirty-five thousand
installs so as you can see here 4.5
stars code hinting debugging integrated
commands this seems like a great great
thing to have so to install an extension
we simply have to click install now one
of my least favorite things about vyas
code and how it expands extensions is
that after installing an extension you
need to reload the entire app now I
understand why this works this way I get
it but what I'd prefer is that if you
hit reload that things sort of went back
to where they were but check this out if
I hit reload click reload window it
doesn't remember even what I was
searching for it doesn't remember where
I was so that way if you're searching
for a whole bunch of stuff it's going to
be in your best interest to install a
whole bunch before reloading otherwise
you're going to have to come back in and
search for react native once more if we
wanted to install more react native
extensions so just a minor gripe but
what's cool is that after we have this
one installed we have a little gear next
to it we can click this gear
and here we can disable it for this
particular workplace we can disable it
for always or uninstall it we can click
on the title and see the page with all
the details this should be similar to
what you're used to with an atom much
better than what you're used to in
sublime text so we can see not only do
we have the contributions we have
changelog where we can see what changed
from version to version we can even see
its dependencies what other extensions
it's depending on but as you can see
here react native tools this readme is
going to tell you everything you need to
know what exists keep scrolling down
here it's going to just basically tell
you how you can make this package better
for yourself and improve your workflow
now there are a ton a ton ton of
different extensions in addition to
these extensions are also things like
themes and color schemes if we were to
hit these three dots we could have
access to a whole bunch of stuff like
show installed extensions show outdated
extensions show disabled recommended
workspace recommendation recommendation
key maps and popular if we were to click
show popular extensions it's simply
going to give us the ones that are
downloaded the most in it you'd see 2.1
million for the c-sharp we have python
we have vs code icons which is when I
definitely recommend grabbing or at
least some of these icon is having icons
next to your files is something that is
makes any sort of text editing
experience really nice something I
always liked about Adam and Adams
extensions we also have this really cool
debugger for Chrome which we're going to
get into later we have es lint which if
you're not using ES lint for linting
your JavaScript highly recommend it but
as you can see here these are all of the
most installed extensions now this isn't
my personal version of vs code here this
is in my actual laptop I have a ton of
these extensions installed and you can
really go nuts because honestly they're
not really that large they're not going
to sink your hard drive or something by
installing a whole bunch of these but as
you can see here we have things like
atom
dark-themed based on the d1 dark theme
from adam so we can come in here and
check out a whole bunch of different
ones and you'll find pretty much
anything you're looking for in here you
want it it's here so now I actually want
to update all of my extensions at once I
can get if you have nothing in the
search bar here it's going to just show
you your installed ones you could click
this Update button on all of these or we
could click these three dots and then
say either check for updates or update
all extensions if we click update all
it's going to download and install now
if I were to hit this reload button
before they'd all finished installing it
would cancel the installation of
whichever ones hadn't finished so you
want to make sure - you see a bunch of
blue and once you see all blue then we
can go ahead and click a reload any
reload will do and all of them should be
updated ok let's click reload reload
window and gone is that little annoying
thing and you can click close here but
basically we have everything installed
now and all of our extensions are up to
date whichever ones you've had so
managing installing extensions is super
nice and easy and obviously if you hate
the extension that's being used let's
say this tenacious design one which I do
love I can click here and uninstall it
cool so these are extensions using vs
code you can see how easy it is to
manage your extensions just like that
and while the reloading thing is a tiny
bit of a bummer it's not a big enough
bummer that I'm going to stop using this
application or anything because of that
cool so I hope this made understanding
extensions just a little bit easier and
then a few videos we're going to be
going over things like customizing
modifying this we're going to be using
some different maybe key bindings to
update the key bindings I'm going to be
showing you a lot of these get features
because if you use git and I know most
of you probably do they get features on
this thing are top-notch and out of the
box they're much better than anything
else
the
other text editors on the market bring
so keep watching as we dive further and
further into vs code which is a nice
simple text editor with lots and lots of
great features and runs really fast as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video a me
up at Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials if you want to help support
these videos head over to store that
level of tutorials calm and check out
all of the paid series we have available
for you there or there's also a pro
subscription where you get access to
these videos for downloads you could
access to a ton of series that aren't
available on YouTube a lot of great
great stuff and more content coming all
the time there will be a react native
series coming in fact this code that you
see right here is from the react native
series that I'm recording right now so
keep your eyes open for that thanks so
much for watching and I'll see in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
