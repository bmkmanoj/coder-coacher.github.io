tuts welcome back to another static
tutorial in this tutorial I am going to
show you guys the text text area and
redact or field types so we've actually
already had been acquainted to the text
because that is both the title and the
sub headline so let's take one more look
at that so let's go ahead and find that
sub headline when I created here we go
sub and what you notice here is that
unlike the other fields we're not seeing
is a type attribute and that is because
ins data make the type by default is
assigned to text so there would be no
impact at all if we did this come over
here refresh the page and it's still
just a text field if we were to change
it to a text area what we're going to be
met with is the traditional text area
form input you know it's resizable so
this would be useful I guess if you're
expecting multiple lines but really I
imagine that if you are wanting to input
multiple lines you're going to want
something a little bit more robust and
in one of the earlier tutorials I sort
of just randomly selected redactor so
let's go ahead and I already have it
assigned to the content fields also
scroll down to that one so redactor what
it does is
is or what it is is an html5 JavaScript
WYSIWYG editor you may be familiar with
other WYSIWYG editors such as ckeditor
this is rooted actor is sort of a more
modern WYSIWYG editor and redactor sort
of claim to fame is that it's really
fast the library itself is quite small
which means that on the page it loads
pretty quick I know that on some clients
sites where I'm using ckeditor they have
multiple you know ck editor content
fields on the same page it can take some
time to run to load rather so redactor
for me is sort of a nice and for your
clients I would imagine do is you know
gives them an interface that you know
they're sort of used to rights we wanted
to give this a style or like a and
assign it as an element of you know h1
we can do that we want to make something
bold sure no problem and what you're
seeing here are the buttons that are kid
are not the only buttons that are
available through dr. these are just the
buttons that are enabled by default by
static
the buttons can be changed and I will
show you how to do that now so go to
your ftp or wherever this is living and
go to your config and go into the
add-ons directory and then you'll see a
file called redact or Diane will go
ahead and open it and here we're seeing
the settings and then there's also a
handy link / 23 dr j s site docs and
then settings page so that you can learn
you know what other buttons are
available and what other settings you
may want to tweak for your site so one
thing that you'll notice on my side
actually this caught my eye was there's
these like boxes around elements that
setting is this gym I guess I'm not
really proud as pronounced that and I
was just monkeying around with it I
changed up the truce to see but I find
it distracting so I'm going to changes
to false and I'll save this here let's
go back to it
there we go so now that's gone so now
we're just seeing it you know sort as
it's meant to be but I'm go ahead and
scroll up one thing that you notice you
know we're seeing a just a list on the
list of the buttons that are available
and to notice that there's a pipe and
wherever you see a pipe you're seeing a
separator so you can reorder these if
you want if you you know have a you know
someone that's sort of savvy enough and
wants to just get in the source view
when necessary you know we could reorder
that and I just put it to the first
thing so now I can just flip this over
to that mode another attribute that go
ahead and close that um can be assigned
when the type is read actor is the is an
upload directory or if you're going to
upload an image
to add that all we do is we just say
image oops image derp and we wanted to
just go to our assets image directory
which should already exist but this
could go to you know any upload
directory if you need to change it from
the default also what you notice is you
know we're setting this on you know the
page type so if you have like you know
some other fields set that you know want
a different upload directory that's
totally fine and completely manageable
because of this attribute here that's a
text text area and redactor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
