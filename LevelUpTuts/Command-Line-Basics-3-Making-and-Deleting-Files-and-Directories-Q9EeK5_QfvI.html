up Tut's and today we're gonna be taking
our command line just a little bit
further and we're gonna be creating and
removing directories as well as files
now in the last lesson we learned that
if you type ls' you'll get you'll be
given the files that are in the current
directory that you're in it's going to
list them for you right so let's change
directory into my sites and then level
up the folder and type LS again and now
let's make a new folder right so let's
make a folder and we're gonna call this
test so to do that we want to M K dir
and that stands for make directory so
you can always think you know CD is
current directory
mkdir make directory so you're using the
word directory a lot and of course these
commands might seem sort of foreign to
you at first but the more you use them
the easier and easier it's going to be
remember them in fact I would just play
around with them to get your fingers
used to typing them and then sooner or
later they'll just do the work for you
now after the make der we're gonna have
a space and we're gonna put the name of
our folder so like we said test and I
had enter now if I hit LS again I can
see that we do have this test folder
here in fact if I come to my actual
finder under level up you'll see that
the test folder is here as well
so this is going to obviously mimic this
because it's the same filesystem now
let's come back to our command line here
and we're inside of this directory and
let's make a file now to make a file we
can just type a touch space and then
let's just make an index dot HTML now
keep in mind there's way better ways of
making a file not through command line
but if you're in a pickle and you need
to make a file touch certainly war
or you could probably do a I think you
just type them and then the filename and
and then once you save it it'll create
the file but for now touch space index
dot HTML is going to create our index
file so if you type LS you can now see
that it didn't actually create this
index.html file in our test folder
obviously because we didn't change
directory anywhere right
we made our test directory but we never
went into it so when we typed touch
index dot HTML it's putting it at the
same level as test we want it to be
inside of course there's a moving
command which we'll go over later but
for now since this file doesn't have
anything in it we will absolutely
sacrifice just deleting it so to delete
a file we just simply have to type our m
space and then the name of the file like
before i can type in the first couple of
letters and then hit tab and it's going
to autocomplete now when i hit enter
that file is gone a quick LS will prove
that the file no longer exists in our
system here so now let's change
directory inside of test and now that
we're inside a test let's actually make
that file again so we can just type
touch well actually we don't have to
type this again if you find yourself
typing the same command over and over
again it's actually you don't have to so
let's delete touch and we can hit our up
arrow on our keyboard and it's going to
cycle through the most recent commands
you can see that the last command we
typed with CD tests and by hitting up
once it gives us CD test if I hit up
again it gives us LS and if I hit up
once again our M index is just gonna
keep going so if I hit up twice more we
now have touch index.html so instead of
having to type this again we could just
hit up a few times now if I had enter
now LS once more we can see that
index.html has been created inside of
this test folder this is be confirmed by
going to our finder here and you can see
we have a blank index.html file perfect
so we now have created a file we've
deleted a file and we've created a
folder now let's delete a folder so
let's change directory out of test and
we're gonna delete the test folder
entirely and you might be thinking well
the remove command that we used before
seems right so we could type RM space
test and you're gonna get a message that
test is a directory and the RM command
will not work on directories so you need
a modifier for the RM command that's
going to make it work on a directory now
keep in mind that this command is not
only going to delete the test folder but
it's also going to delete all files and
subdirectories of this folder so we can
say RM space and then - the r option
stands for recursive so that means that
it's going to find every entry whether
it's a subdirectory or a document and
the F option is going to stand for force
means it's going to forcefully do this
so RM space - RF is going to remove a
directory for you and all of its
contents so we can type RM hyphen RF and
then the name of our folder and just
like that we do LS that folder is no
longer there and if we check out our
finder of course it's no longer there as
well test has gone is gone forever
so we've now created a file we've
deleted a file we've created a folder
and we've deleted a folder and its
contents so this should get you being
able to create folders more easily and
things like that in fact I I mean I feel
like I used the make dirt command more
frequently than then
command's if you're browsing your
filesystem let's say you're browsing
your server or something through SSH
you'd be frequently wanting to create
directories and modify documents so
that's great in the next video we're
gonna show you how to use them to edit
files of course there's other ways to
edit files like Nano or something like
that or you could of course create a
file and edit in your text editor but
it's important to know how to edit a
file through command line if you need to
through one of the various command line
text editors so as always this is Scott
with LevelUp Hutt's if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video hit us up at Facebook or
Twitter or the level up forum we love to
hear from you so thanks for watching and
we'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
