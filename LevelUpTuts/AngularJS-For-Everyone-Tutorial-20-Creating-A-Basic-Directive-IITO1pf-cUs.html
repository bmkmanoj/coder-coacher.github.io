tutorials and in this video we're going
to take our hello world example from the
last video and we're going to turn this
directive in to an actual version of our
directory lists person that we were
making before using an ng repeat and
another ng include template so we're
going to be adding a little bit more
functionality to our custom directive in
this video let's get started right now
so in a few videos ago we basically had
this ng repeat over a list item that
allowed us to list all of these users
out right and then we used this person
HTML as the ng include to sort of output
that information well how about we do
that with a directive right we could
actually encompass this hello world
directive in these same sort of ng tags
we have here so for instance if we were
to just copy this bit of code here paste
this down here now instead of including
this person HTML like so and let's go
ahead and get rid of this class 2 i'm
just going to make this pretty simple
here okay and as you can see we're going
to paste in our hello world component
here this hello world directive is going
to now be inside of this is not going to
be inside of this ng-repeat where we're
saying item and duralast list so just by
looking at this what might you expect to
happen well we should be seeing hello
world the text being output in an
unordered list as many times as there
are items in the directory lists so if
we can do our page you can see we have
equal one two three four and we have
four down here now an interesting side
effect here is that if we type in Scott
the hello world filtering actually works
as well because even though we're
displaying the text hello world that's
still using the same filter here that we
are using before now let's actually try
something we're going to come in here
we're just going to grab this
and here this item item name okay and
we're going to go ahead and paste this
into this template string right here
notice how we're still including item
name and item dot age now this isn't a
great practice but it's going to show
you a little bit about how scope is
working with your directives here we're
actually going to be able to pass in the
scope from this controller into this
directive without having to do anything
additional than what we have right here
so let's come to this and we can paste
this in here like so so now as you see
we actually get the names output in the
exact same way in fact it's it's very
very similar to what we have going on so
let's actually try something different
since we have this person HTML with the
image and the item name and all this
stuff right this is the content we
actually want to be outputting here we
could actually have this directory list
template as a template URL so we can say
template URL and inside of the string
here instead of some code we're actually
going to be having a path to a directive
template so the template we're going to
use is person dot HTML okay so we now
have person dot HTML and what we should
be seeing when we refresh is we should
be seeing a duplicate of this list
directly below it and as you can see we
have the same list listed twice now the
only difference is it's not getting some
of the classes because I took that stuff
off when we did this ng repeat but it's
no big deal now and some other things to
be aware of since this doesn't really
make sense to have this named hello
world have this person HTML we also
don't want to keep things listed the
same so let's go ahead and first rename
person dot HTML i'm going to rename this
to directory hyphen
person like so okay so this is directory
hyphen person HTML and now we're going
to reference that file in here correctly
directory type in person now let's go
ahead and change the name of our
directive from hello world to die
rectory person and what we're going to
want to make sure is that this is not
hyphenated and this is camel case like
we went over in the last video so we
have directory person directory person
HTML and I want our actual HTML we want
this to go ahead and be directory person
hyphenated just like the HTML file that
we included was going to copy this paste
it in there like so okay so we've now
renamed the directive to be directory
person we rename the HTML file to be
directory person and we've renamed the
actual directive here it's come in and
refresh you can see it's all good okay
so now let's go ahead and just get rid
of this other unordered list and what we
can do is we can go back and add at this
class here like so just to get rid of
that and I'm going to paste this on a
new line here line this up cool so we're
now using a directive to accomplish
something that we had to use an NG
include to do before and you may be
wondering what's the sort of benefit in
this well directives can encompass a lot
more than just HTML directives can
encompass a lot of functionality on
their own functionally that can be taken
with them so for instance you'd be able
to use this directory person outside of
this ng-repeat and whatever sort of
functionality perhaps maybe you're
saving or modifying a person in this
directory but either way that
functionality will be able to travel
with the directive itself and you won't
have to have a lot of that logic inside
of the controller so now this is a very
most basic example i just took something
that we did something else and arguably
made a little bit more
complex however directories add a lot of
really great functionality that we're
going to see in upcoming videos so as
always this is Scott would level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments if it come in the video or hit
me up at Twitter or Facebook a level up
tutorials I love to hear from you thank
you for watching and I'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
