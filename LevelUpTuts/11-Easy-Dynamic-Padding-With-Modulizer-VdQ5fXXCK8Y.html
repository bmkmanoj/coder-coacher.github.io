tutorials and in this video we're going
to be showing you sketch module I zernow
sketch module Iser is a plug-in that
function similar to another one that we
had that created auto buttons for you by
having a padding layer however the
functionality with module Iser is
significantly easier to get going and
has much less chance of something going
wrong when trying to use it so let's
check out sketch module Iser right now
okay so to get going with module Iser
really what we need to do is we can come
to sketch tool box and we can type in
module Iser so MOT and as you can see
it's right here so go ahead and install
module Iser so macho loads are really
just easily allows you to add padding
for buttons and things like that that
can be adjusted dynamically for when
your content changes and like I said
it's super easy so it makes things sort
of pretty turnkey so we're first going
to do is create a rectangle we'll just
use a rounded rectangle because it's
going to be a button and that's a pretty
common thing to see so we have a rounded
rectangle here take some text set as a
mono file all right now I'm just going
to go ahead and put it as anything other
than that essentially I'll used in and
didn't bold is just fine let's go ahead
and adjust the font size make it nice
and big we're going to say button ok and
now like most buttons we can go ahead
and modify the dilemma turn off the
bordellos I'm going to just make it this
nice blue color here and that's really
it to even change the font color to
something like white there we go we have
a button now let's go ahead and select
both of these layers you can just drag
in and select both of these layers now
we can sucked our new plugin which was
module Iser now what we can do is the
module Iser command which is a shift
command em so shift command em and these
paddings are sort of all wrong souls and
let's say we want something like let's
say 40 on the top 40 on the bottom and
20 on both sides we can say 40 20 42
okay now let's go ahead and click OK and
as you can see with this button is now
it's now pretty tall and not very long
if we select this button layer the txt
and hit our alt and see you can see we
have 40 on the top and bottom and 20 on
the left and right and what's cool about
this is that in some of these other
plugins like the button padding one we
had to create this layer ourselves but
what it actually did is it renamed a
rectangular layer to the 40 20 40 20 now
because of that we already have the
format built in to do it and it's cool
because it put them both into a group if
we were to have this group selected and
do command shift em once more you can
see nothing's going to happen because
it's going to be looking for these
values so we can come in here and modify
these values directly we can leave the
40 and 40 as it is but let's change the
20 to something like well let's go 100
let's go big and we have 100 on both
sides now with the group selected shift
command m and you see it's automatically
changing sides of our button let's
change this text to no longer say button
let's say it's just going to be an Add
button so we just as ed control let's
select the group control shift em and
adjust the button accordingly now let's
check out the values that's going on
here let's set this to something that's
drastically different let's do 40 10 1
4200 select the group once again ctrl
shift em and let's check this out so
with this open I'm going to select the
text layer hold alt you can see we have
40 on the top 10 on the right 140 on the
bottom and 200 on the left so as you can
see it goes top right bottom left
clockwise around starting at the top and
so let's reset this to something totally
sane instead of that and we do let's say
40 80 4080 enter okay shift command down
we have a nice really just a really nice
button creation tool what's cool about
this is that we can do
placate this we can change this let's
change text to delete take cap locks off
delete ok I'm going to change the
background to be right now like so we
now have a red button I'm going to
select this group control shift em and
we now have our add and delete buttons
and it took no time at all and it's just
really super great and easy to use so
this is sketch module Iser it's a
package i highly recommend it's super
easy responsive button creation in
sketch 3 so as always this is Scott
