up Hut's and today I'm gonna sort of
wrap up our CSS lessons here okay and
what we've done into our CSS course is
we've we've gone over all sorts of stuff
from flexible positioning you can now
float things you can make multiple
columns if you like I showed you a box
model there's margin and padding that
stuff and all of the stuff is CSS
sprites image replacement just basically
anything that you would need to create a
super modern website with CSS now of
course css3 allows for things like
border radius you know so rounded
corners gradients drop shadows things of
that nature and in the next lessons I'll
be going over some css3 things and if
you're wondering where to go from here I
would recommend checking out sites like
CSS tricks calm lets CSS - tricks calm
that is there's lots of great stuff on
here you'll learn a ton about CSS and I
recommend just practicing writing a lot
of CSS trying to find how to do things
and then googling as much as you can but
it's not looking like you think it
should there's always the CSS IRC room
and you can go on there and ask
questions as well people are usually
pretty good about getting back and
answering even beginner questions but
with these skills you should be able to
do all sorts of stuff so one thing I
would recommend is besides just writing
CSS write your CSS and then go back over
it and look at what you could do better
so let's say for instance in the last
lesson we went over sprites and let's
say we did something like this and we
had Drupal and we had it at 0 this is
violating a basic concept of CSS which
is don't repeat yourself because we
don't need this little bit of code
because by default it's at background 0
0 and this little bit is taking care of
it
so what you can do is you can come back
find things like this and remove them
and not everything is always going to be
totally obvious when you're writing CSS
and you may not know the answers to how
you're going to do everything when
you're writing it so it's a really
helpful exercise to go back to your CSS
and see what you can change and to
reduce the amount of code you have to
make it simpler to read just to have it
be less repeating another thing I would
suggest is going through I'm using
Chrome Canary but in chrome it's pretty
much the exact same and using this
inspect element that we showed you here
and what you can do an element style is
you can click and add your own CSS to
anything right and you can see it in
real time how it's going to look on the
screen and then you can from here copy
and paste it into your CSS or you can
even download the CSS file this isn't
actually a tutorial on inspect so I'm
not going to go over all of the details
here but you can go through and do so
much with inspect to see exactly how
it's going to look and then add that
code to your CSS or better yet you can
play around with it in the inspect
viewer to see how it's going to look and
what kind of cool things you can do ok
so what we're to go from here write CSS
lots of CSS inspect your code inspect
other people's code look at any other
person's CSS if you see a technique
being done on a website and you want to
use it view their sores check their CSS
inspect it and look through it and learn
their techniques okay so try all that
stuff and then we're gonna come back we
got css3 tutorials coming up soon you
can go to sass and compass tutorials to
learn what's so great about writing sass
in CSS it's just awesome so go ahead and
do those things and you will become a
CSS master you can do anything you want
to design your own websites as always
this is Scott with LevelUp Tut's if you
