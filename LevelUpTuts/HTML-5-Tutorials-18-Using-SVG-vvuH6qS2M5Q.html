up Tut's and today we're going to be
talking about SVG and HTML and if you're
not using SVG right now you should
because it is a great technology now SVG
what it allows you to do is use vector
graphics in your HTML and you can use
these as images by simply just dropping
in an SVG file or you can write SVG code
exactly as it is in your HTML and that's
actually just simple XML and maybe
you're not going to want to write an SVG
by hand but perhaps you can edit
something that already exists and on top
of it all you can actually animate and
do things with hover States using basic
CSS to control your SVG so for the
course these next two videos we're going
to take the level up tubbs logo export
it as an SVG then we're going to drop it
in as an image show you it in as a
background image and then we're going to
take that so that the SVG code is
actually inline your document and we're
going to do things like animating it on
hover state so check it out we got a lot
of cool stuff with SVG coming up so to
get started we're going to create a
basic shape logo using a vector tools
here I'm going to be using sketch if you
have access to illustrate or any other
vector tools most likely you'll be able
to export as SVG so we can go ahead and
create a circle here of course you can
make whatever shape you would like let
me get rid of the border and just have
this be a basic blue color I'm going to
make sure that it's all centered nicely
and everything and now I'm going to grab
and make a rectangle make it rotate it a
bit and then we're going to have it
passing through this circle I'm just
going to make this maybe a little
interesting and drag this over here then
maybe scale this rectangle down and have
it going through our circle just like
that I can then say to make sure that
these are both aligned correctly now I'm
going to select these and take the
difference of the
so we have a shape here that wouldn't
actually be easy to create with just CSS
we have a transparent center here and we
have some interesting looking shapes so
let's export this as SVG using sketch we
can do that simply by exporting this
particular layer gives us an option for
SVG and let's click export now the
exporting process might be a little bit
different on each platform but if you do
a quick Google search for export SVG in
Illustrator it should be the same as
exporting anything in Illustrator you
just change the format to SVG so let's
just title this logo SVG I'm saving this
into an images folder for a site that
we'd been working on with the Suzy grid
framework you don't have to you know
have this site set up you can drop this
into any HTML document so here we did
have a main tag but we didn't have a
header so I'm going to make a header and
just throw into here our SVG now the
easiest way to throw in our SVG is to
simply declare an image so just like you
would normally have an image with an IMG
tag and image tag here and a source now
all we have to do is to pass in the
location of our SVG and since our SVG is
saved in our image directory slash logo
SVG then that's all we need ok so now if
we save this let's come to our browser
and refresh and with no effort at all we
have our image here so this image is the
exact size as it was when we exported it
when I made this in sketch it was on 128
by 128 pixel canvas but one of the
benefits to using SVG is that it's a
vector so check this out if we come onto
this image and we just say uh width and
let's say 300 and height 300 save this
and refresh we now have a giant version
of this SVG but look at how great it
looks there's no blurred edges we have
nice smooth lines in fact if you do
command + and zoom in on your browser
you infinitely can zoom in on this thing
and you're getting crisp lines because
that is a vector image just like any
other vector image that you could use so
it's it's great right this is the
awesomeness of SVG you don't have to
have this big old image file you can
have these small SVG files and if they
have enough data and everything like
that they can create these excellent
sharp shapes they're perfect for logos
in fact if you check out the level of
Tut's website we're actually using an
SVG logo on our website ok so you can
change their height by declaring it
there you can also obviously declare it
in CSS which I would probably recommend
but that's not all you can do with SVG
and CSS we can also use this SVG file as
a background image so let's go ahead and
see that in action I'm going to remove
it here from the header for the time
being just simply commenting this out
just so we don't have it in the way and
I'm going to throw this as a background
image on our body now this is going to
look crazy because obviously I'm going
to have it repeating and stuff but just
to prove a point we're going to go ahead
and do that so my main CSS I'm just
going to add in for this background I'm
going to add in a URL and then paste in
our image URL actually the path is a
little bit different here there we go
and now I refresh and just like nothing
we didn't have we didn't have to tell
CSS that this was an SVG we didn't have
to do anything fancy but sure enough we
just took this image that we created an
illustrator and now it's being used as a
repeatable background as an SVG and this
is brilliant
but let's say we decided we hated this
blue color and it's already up here
we've already made the SVG do we have to
export it again well the answer is no
you
actually come directly into the SVG if
you're using a basic text editor you can
click on the SVG file and instead of
giving you an image it's actually giving
you the SVG XML and so this is really
similar to anything you've ever seen
before in fact there's some extra stuff
in here we don't even need and can
delete but as you see we have a path and
it has the the location for all of the
paths and even gives it an ID for us
well you'll see later that we can even
use that ID to style this and you can
see we have a fill color so now if we
change this fill color to something else
like perhaps three three three uh we're
going to be getting a dark gray SVG now
this is just the tip of the iceberg for
the great stuff you can do with SVG in
the next video we're going to show you
how to work more with this file to even
modify your SVG with CSS so keep
watching and we'll show you that in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
