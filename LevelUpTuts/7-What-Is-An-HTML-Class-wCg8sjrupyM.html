tutorials and in this video we're gonna
be talking about classes in HTML we're
gonna show you how you can use classes
to define styles once and use them on
several different elements so you're
essentially adding a descriptor to that
element that you can use CSS on so let's
get going on that right now so in the
last video we talked about IDs and we
showed that you can do things with IDs
like link to them or you can even style
based off of them now I'm actually going
to delete this giant long text paragraph
we had here is just there for that
previous example we don't need it
anymore okay so that's gone I'm also
gonna get rid of this link to footer we
don't want that anymore and everything
looks just fine so now just like we had
ID we also have what's called a HTML
class now we can define a class simply
by saying class equals and then quotes
like that and then we can give our class
name and just like IDs you're gonna want
to have these classes be one word and
then they're gonna want to be lowercase
with no spaces so you can use something
like hyphens or underscores to separate
your words now now many people have
different preferences about hyphens
verse underscores and that's just going
to be with the team you're working with
however I personally only use hyphens in
my CSS and you'll see a lot of projects
that are just exclusively using hyphens
we can define a class simply by giving
it a name like intro - text okay and so
just like we had our ID let's go ahead
and copy this class now our intro text
can be used to style off of just like we
did our ID and we can say period intro
text so with an ID it was a pound with a
class it's a period and we can give this
a font - size of 18 pixels and let's
save this now if we check our HTML when
we refresh if I right click on this
paragraph text and click inspect element
you'll see that we have this class intro
text and the font size is being applied
as 18 pixels so how our IDs different
from classes well for one we can't link
to a class like you could an ID so we
can't use an anchor tag to jump to a
class and where IDs were meant to be
used once per document classes are meant
to be reused for instance a class would
come in here and we could drop this
intro text class on several paragraphs
right so let's actually make a copy of
this paragraph exactly pan let's paste
to here so in a real-world example you
might see this class intro text being
reused where you would not see this ID
being reused so just like so we now have
two paragraphs in sure there may be the
same we can change them just a little
bit here just get rid of that span I'm
learning to websites and so now this
intro text class is not only going to be
applied to both it's completely valid so
now the purpose of classes really is to
pass along a style that might be
reusable for instance this intro text
anytime we have this it's going to be
font size 18 and therefore any paragraph
we want to contain the styles we can
just throw that class onto and it will
get those styles so classes make it
possible to basically say here's a group
of CSS that's going to be attached to
anything you attach the clasp to and IDs
where you have an ID classes you can
have multiple classes so for intro text
we could have intro text and we could
also have we could just have a class and
we'll call this part two like so this
isn't a great class name we'll get into
more of that later strategy and stuff
like that but for right now you can see
that we have this intro part too okay so
we have intro text and we have part two
and let's give this a color of purple
okay now if we come back to our page and
refresh you'll see if we hover over the
main text and click on it we get 18
pixels for our font size and if we hover
over at the intro text part two you can
see that both of the properties are
being assigned so intro text and the
color purple so you can have multiple
classes that pass in multiple different
sort of properties and combinations so a
lot of larger projects and CSS
frameworks are built so that they have
an organized structure of classes to
define their elements and how they're
interacting on the page that way instead
of having to define the styles for every
single item individually on your page
you can set up a set of rules
essentially with these classes and
therefore you can control the look and
feel of your site just by these classes
so this is an HTML class and like I said
this is just the basics we're gonna be
getting into things like strategy for
how to use them in later videos so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video hurt
us up at twitter or facebook at level up
tutorials we'd love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
