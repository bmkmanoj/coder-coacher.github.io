up tuts and today I'm gonna be talking
about in the gent oh and we're just
going to do an overview of the Magento
front-end just so you can sort of get
used to it
so we installed in the Gento with the
the data that Magento the sample data
that Magento provides for you so as you
can see we have you know some products
here we have some t-shirts some shoes
some laptops um they are tagged all
sorts of stuff camera
hohohoh sexy you know so all this data
is already in our site here if you are
starting fresh you're not going to have
any of this but it should sort of look
like this still because you're using the
name theme and later lessons we're going
to go into theming and how you can
really customize the appearance of your
site there's all sorts of ways you could
do that you can even by themes and
templates from all sorts of places
online and install them easily and have
a great looking site that way so this is
Magento this is the home page with a
three column layout that's easy to
change you can always have this be a two
column layout or whatever the Magento
built-in templates allow you to do that
as you can see here the default layout
is there's your search up here your user
account my wishlist my cart checkout and
login and it says default welcome
message of thanks Magento so here's all
you know this stuff is what users are
going to see when they visit your site
if you have multiple language sites
you'll have this in English French
German this demo actually comes with the
set up although I don't think there's
any actual language changing when you're
cooking these with the demo itself but
no biggie there you can see there's also
a built in community poll here but you
can you know make your own we'll show
you how to do that so you probably not
going to want to keep any of this stuff
around because of course it's not going
to pertain to your site no matter what
it is so as you can see but there's
these little widgets here at this thing
this popular tags community poll this is
a widget you have my card information
compare products these are all things
that you can move around you can change
or whatever and
navigation it's going to automatically
do like a drop down here with your
different categories you can see their
subcategories let's actually go into one
of these if we click on shirts here it's
going to show us all of the shirts that
are in our site as you can see it says
shirts up here and it also has this
image each one of your categories can
have an image at the top you can have
this all customize this page can have
its own layout separate from other ones
if you click apparel it's going to give
you everything under shirts shoes
hoodies all of this stuff at once as you
can see there's a custom header here by
default it has these things as a product
image its name its rating the price at
the cart wishlist compare you can even
that show how many are showing on each
page or if you want to see it in a grid
or a list these are all great features
that Magento just offers right out of
the box I have I haven't done anything
to this other than install the sample
data and use this base theme you can
also see there's the shop I it allows
you to drill down into different
categories this is again all
customizable nice and easy to go okay if
we let's check out let's go back to the
home page here let's go to the my
account page this is going to show you
like users who have an account let's say
they have their shipping information or
payment information if they want to have
all that information their account this
is where they would go to login I
haven't made an account on here because
I'm the admin but I would suggest making
an account on your site just to check it
out in fact let's actually go through
and make an account right now click
create an account no just got ok and you
can have a you can have a newsletter
built in so they can check to sign up
for your newsletter if you'd like I
usually even leave that on there
especially if you're planning on and on
using a newsletter to keep in touch with
your clients
okay so let's see what happens once we
create an account okay yeah sure I'll
save this password okay so here is at
your account this is what users will
actually see when they make an account
saying hey you can change your password
update your billing address you can
change if you want to be on the
newsletter not even has your account
information let's see it's all sorts of
stuff your orders so anytime you
purchase anything these orders are going
to be here that way your clients can
come back and look at their orders
they're downloadable products if you
have downloadable products on here they
can always click back into this and
download it as many times as you have
specified tags my wishlist my product
reviews this is all a lot of stuff that
your users can use to interact with your
site and they're pretty much standard
features that you see in a lot of stores
nowadays like Amazon or any sort of
thing where you're buying products
online
so my wishlist is pretty pretty much
what it sounds like it actually takes
you directly to this my wishlist tab
under your account if you want to use
the wishlist feature your products will
feature a wishlist button we can click
this add to wishlist and then here it is
it's now in your wishlist you can share
your with wishlist with other people you
can remove things let's go ahead and
click this trashcan to remove it yep
okay we want that gun okay so now
there's nothing in our wish list my cart
is just like any other site when we add
something to your cart it shows up in my
cart here where you can then go to
either view your cart or checkout to add
this laptop this is actually your cart
if we click on this my cart button it's
going to take us to the same page so
here is where your clients would enter
their coupon codes shipping information
you can set it up so it recommends some
products let's say if you want to buy
two of these we can click update
shopping cart and then proceed to
checkout so in a normal situation when
your your clients are buying things are
your customers are buying things from
your site it's going to give them this
checkout form and I'm not going to go
over this right now we'll go over the
simulator to tour
when we're setting up the whole checkout
process but it's pretty straightforward
just like any site you've used really
you enter your billing information
shipping information shipping method and
then payment information and you click
Submit so this is really what Magento
gives you it also has a couple of pages
here that are sort of your content
management your CMS pages not sure
what's going on this image off to check
that out but these are just sort of
default pages that you can edit in the
backend here is your about us of course
there's some lorem ipsum in here
customer service page sort of default
templates you can just go through and
edit these there's also a Advanced
Search they're all great things to be
built into Magento so you don't have to
build them yourself later ok so that is
the Magento front-end in the next lesson
I'm going to be giving you a tour of
Magento's back-end and that's actually
on take a couple of lessons because the
gentles back-end is awesome it has a lot
of things to do a lot of things to see
and all sorts of things for you to
configure ok once again this is Scott
