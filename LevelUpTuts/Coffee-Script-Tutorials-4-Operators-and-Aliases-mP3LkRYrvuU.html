up tuts and today I'm gonna bring you a
quick tutorial on operators and aliases
in CoffeeScript and this is going to be
pretty quick because there isn't a ton
here however it's really nice because I
actually personally really like the way
that CoffeeScript does operators you
know longer you know have to worry about
doing 3 equal signs to have a correct
comparison in JavaScript
so now the equivalent of 3 equal signs
in CoffeeScript is just the word is so
pretty much any time that you would want
to say something equal to something you
would say this is that or whatever okay
and just like you know before we would
have to do exclamation point and then
and then two equal signs for isn't or is
not you would just say isn't in
CoffeeScript okay also not not it's just
an exclamation point right so if you're
saying this is not something well in
CoffeeScript it's just the word not so
one thing you'll notice thing that is
these conditionals are these operators
right these operators are a little bit
more language like so it's almost like
you're speaking the code instead of
looking at 3x or equal signs or an
exclamation point if you were to read
this code it would it would almost sound
like you were speaking a sentence that a
normal person could understand right not
just a computer or robot whatever okay
and just like and we have and we have or
instead of two pipes and we have four
true you can type true now that you can
type yes or you can type on our those
are all going to equal true and for
false you can do false you can do no or
you can do off and so these are all
equal to false you could say well we'll
show these in a second I'll just show
some of these in action but let's see
we got instead of this you could just
use the add sign or you can also say
this okay
and for in you are going to be saying up
so for something of something else and
we'll get into that when we're doing
loops and for loops okay and and then in
you actually have a different use first
sort of in in CoffeeScript CoffeeScript
if you're gonna be like checking a list
of something you're gonna be saying four
items in this list or four items
whatever then you can be using the in
okay so this is the operators and
aliases in CoffeeScript that's it really
quick show something here if if I change
this from true to know let's click over
here it's gonna say false okay just like
if I change this to on or yes or true
it's going to equate to true so this way
your code can sort of sound like English
a little bit better it's really cool so
we can well actually I think it would be
better just to get into that in the next
lesson we're gonna be going over
conditional statements anyways and then
we can really get to use a whole host of
these operators and some really cool
stuff and in case you're wondering I'm
actually using code kit to compile my
CoffeeScript you can do it the way I
showed you in the previous lesson or you
can you know put some money down and
purchase code kit it's an app I really
like to use it compiles your sass your
compass your less it does all sorts of
great stuff and what's cool about this
is if I want to say minify compiled
JavaScript here just minifides my
JavaScript for me and I never even have
to see normal JavaScript however if I'm
in developing I'm gonna be wanting to
check out what I'm doing anyway so I'll
usually turn them on as the last step
before I you know put it on the web or
something but so we're all good here if
you want to use a code kit check it out
it's nice and easy cool as always if you
have any questions with this please
leave a comment on the video
let us know what you thinking you know
what let us know what you want to hear
the next couple lessons we're going to
get in some real cool stuff with
CoffeeScript Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
