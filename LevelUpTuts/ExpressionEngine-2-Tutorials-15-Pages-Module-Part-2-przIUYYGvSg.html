level up Tut's today we're going to
level up our expression gin skills and
wrap up the pages module before we start
and encourage everyone to subscribe to
our YouTube channel this is going to be
tutorial number 15 okay so in the last
video we created our we installed the
pages module and created our first page
but it didn't present itself correctly
you know it was missing the it's
actually it was missing the title it was
missing the body and that's all because
we didn't create the template yet so
let's go ahead and do that remember what
we learned in the previous tutorial to
manage our templates we go under design
template the template manager or I
created a link to it over here so I'm
going to a template manager same place
and we only have these two templates
that so far so let's create a new
template and this is a template that
we're going to use for our static pages
so I'm going to call it page and it's a
web page and i am going to model it
after the detail page so i'm going to
select detail hit edit and create and
the reason why i chose that just because
i wanted to save a couple characters
from having to be retyped and so now
we're looking at a template that right
now is trying to output the channel
entries for news and that's not right we
want to do our pages from the status is
fine this disabled is fine the sort
actually doesn't matter because this is
only going to print one entry so I'm
just going to say lemon equals one even
though I really don't have to but why
not and and the other important thing is
dynamic the dynamic parameter has to be
set to on for the pages module to work
if it's set to know it just won't work
we need dynamic set to on and again what
that means it's going to look at the URL
and get some information and
print the content so let's go ahead and
again dynamic the default is on so we
could just we I'd really don't need to
have this here but yeah we'll put it
there anyway okay so let's go ahead and
hit update and go back to that pages
menu and you know we're going to do this
is already getting old let's add that
pages page to the main navigation here
so to do that remember we click the Add
button up here and pages it's going to
be listed after template manager it's
already here so we can just go ahead and
hit pages now instead of having to go
admin modules page is blah blah okay so
now we have the about page here so if I
click view page ah still not working so
let's go back and okay so it's not
printing because this channel name is
actually incorrect it's actually page
and again that's the short name for the
channel and you can load you can find
that out by going under your admin
channel administration two channels and
there it is it's not plural news was
plural page was not and so we figured
out that so let's go ahead and hit
update and give us a refresh what I do
see here oh right it's not doing
anything yet because we had we didn't
assign that entry to use that template
because this template again wait didn't
exist yet so let's go back to pages
click on about go to pages and it's
again it was using the wrong template so
now it's the habit use the correct
template page I'll hit submit and I'm
going to refresh this it's still not
going to be quite right but we're
getting really close this is a static
page okay but now it's not printing the
body and the reason for that is the
template that we just created was
pulling in the wrong body tag I created
one just for the pages channels I don't
remember what it was though so let's go
ahead and check so channel fields um I
threw it in temple group called default
Oh Paige body Paige body curly brackets
it update let's refresh this one more
time and there's our body cool so again
notice that it's showing up at / about
so let's create a child page or a nested
page in this section so let's go under
pages before we do that I want to go
back and go under module configuration
and assign X right now there's no
default but I'm going to assign that
site page that we just created as the
default it's amit i'm going to create a
new page
so this will be like a ball about child
I guess this is the about child page
again under the pages you can say about
child it defaulted to use that site page
so that's nice our users our clients
won't have to struggle with that now if
we go back to pages we see about and
then because it's a child here it is
click view page about child this is
about child so pretty easy I almost do
maybe just one more oops about so we've
done create new page I think actually
we've already in the other video we did
this way either way doesn't matter OOP
about child child good job
so we just keep sort of filling this out
select the right one again hundred pages
there it is tertiary page magnet view
and there we go as well close some of
these town so I I think that covers
everything there is to cover about the
pages module so we covered installation
setup creating a template so thanks for
watching and please stay tuned some for
some more of our expressionengine
