love huts and today we're going to be
talking about refactoring some of this
code here and we're going to take this
little bit here where we declared our
variables and we're going to break it up
and what we're going to do is we're
going to first declare the variables as
existing and then after we've done that
we're going to call a method that's them
going to set our variables for us so we
want to do this outside of this on
create so I'm actually going to click
this minus right next to this set
onclicklistener just to get it sort of
minimized out of the way and this
bracket corresponds with the oncreate
method so right below that bracket we're
going to give some space here and we're
going to type private void and then what
we're going to have here is the name of
this method and I'm just going to call
this VAR set because I and you know
being lazy right now and this is not
going to have any arguments and we're
going to finish this up with brackets
you know to open and close it and of
course it's got the CLO underline saying
that it's not being used but that's
because we haven't used it yet so what
we want to do is let's get rid of some
of these finals and I go through and get
rid of some of this stuff here and all
we need to declare up here is the
variable name and the type we want to
keep this equal stuff and we want to put
that into our method so I'm going to
copy this quick so i don't have to
retype a bunch of this stuff but i'm
going to go ahead and delete everything
after or everything before the equal
sign here or after the equal sign the
variable name whatever so just come here
delete all this stuff as this is so the
equal sign and everything after it make
sure you finish off your aligns with
your semicolons and so now by this we're
declaring a textview named text one a
textview named guest text and edit text'
name user text or user guests
and a button named push me but now all
this stuff's going to be mad because
here we have this push me on
onclicklistener in it you know it
doesn't correlate that with anything so
it's going to be confused for a second
but let's go inside of our variable set
method here and let's paste these values
in here and now i'm going to delete
everything before the variable name so
in this instance I'm saying these
variables and then I'm going to exactly
what they're equal to before and we
don't have to worry about the data type
so let's delete them like this so
they're still everything's still getting
a little angry at us and we're not doing
a couple of things well we've gotten rid
of the stuff we need to get rid of here
but we actually need to move these
outside of our uncreate and so right now
right when the main activity starts this
is when we're going to put our variables
that are being declared so here's what
the data type and the variable name and
then it's going to run our on create and
so now we have this blue text this blue
color letting us know that these you
know we don't have to use Final anymore
anything like that and we're pretty good
here however we still need to set these
variables once the application has been
run so on our on create we now need to
add just a call to that method and to do
that we just do VAR set and then
parentheses semicolon and you'll notice
a lot of our redness has gone away
however it is mad about this so here
it's giving us an error because how
we're declaring this array and this is
just a way that Java handles arrays so
we have to type new and then string and
then brackets just like we had we had
string brackets up here so where's that
down here we may have a space here and
you'll see our air is going to go away
just a syntax II thing and maybe people
who are a little bit more Java
experienced will be able to give a
better explanation than that so as you
can see we've gotten all of our red
underlines to go away and now we can go
ahead and just run our app really
quickly and you'll be able to see
there's really nothing changed into how
the app is running itself so here we are
here's our app and it looks like I got
it right on the first one so yeah
nothing nothing crazy there but
everything's all working and our app is
running and we didn't have to use final
all the time and now our variables are
all declared at a much nicer way so as
always if you have any questions leave a
come in the video or hit us up on
Twitter our level of Tut's this is scott
with level of Tut's and thanks for
watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
