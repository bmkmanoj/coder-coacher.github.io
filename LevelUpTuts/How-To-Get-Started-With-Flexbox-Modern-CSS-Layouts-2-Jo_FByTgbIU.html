tutorials and in this video what we're
gonna be doing is we're gonna be
tackling flexbox 101 this is going to
assume you know nothing about flexbox
and flexbox is one of those things that
has really changed how people do layouts
and CSS because of that it's an
essential part of modern CSS layouts so
let's get started learning flexbox with
the basics in flexbox 101 okay so before
we get started building any kind of
layouts what we really need to do is lay
down a solid foundation of new
technologies for working in layouts now
I'm gonna do most of this series in code
pen here that way we can embed the code
pens you can see them in the post just
below the video here and you can make
your own and fork them as well so what
we have basically going on here is a
container with four divs and this
container doesn't have any set two
dimensions okay and we simply just have
these four divs in here each with a
letter now some of these examples can be
sort of well non real-world if you think
about it especially when we're working
with boxes with numbers in them but the
good part about the series is that after
we learn these foundational skills I'm
going to be showing them in action so as
you can see here other than HTML we just
have a some s CSS or SAS code and the
only crazy thing that's going on here is
well I'm nesting any sort of a child div
inside of the container is getting the
purple background getting the color of
white getting a width and height of 100
pixels and having a text-align:center
and a line height of 100 pixels so what
I want to do in this video is really go
over flexbox 101 this is a complete
guide to getting started with flexbox
and over the next video or two will be
essentially covering all of the basic
stuff you need to know about working in
flexbox now the cool thing about flexbox
is well it allows us to do things that
weren't really possible for a
time in CSS for instance if we wanted to
display each of these in a container in
line we would set the box property on
the div to be display and then we could
have this be in line block right so this
turns each of these into its own inline
block but you already noticed there's
some weird spacing between them that we
didn't tell to be there ever and well we
just don't have a lot of control over
this like for instance even though this
container is with 100 here let me
actually add a border on this container
we're gonna do a border and this is
going to be dashed with a two pixel red
border just so you could see the
container like let's say I wanted to say
hey evenly distribute these in this
container spanning this entire thing and
you couldn't do that and you could do it
in Illustrator you could do it in
sketcher figma Renier design apps but it
would be very difficult to do that
within CSS and that led to so many
problems and maybe sort of hacky code or
a lot of extra CSS when you don't really
need it
so in comes Flex box that allows us to
have a flexible container and allows us
to do that kind of stuff so if I remove
the inline block each of these still
remains to be a block and on the
container itself we can go ahead and add
a display of Flex okay and a display of
Flex is simply going to have a container
with Flex children so now each of these
direct descendants of our container is
now an item within our flexbox container
and as you can see they're no longer
necessarily acting like block elements
well they maintain some of their
properties of block elements for
instance we're able to give it an
explicit width and height here however
they're now in line and even though
fluxbox is primarily used within a row
like this you could also do the same
exact thing in a column maybe if this
container had a height of 100 and it
would look the exact same but they'd
just be stacked on top of each other
so we'll get into obviously more of that
later but as you can see here it's now
place these all in a group and if I want
to do things like hey make sure you put
all of these into the center of this
container I don't have to do things like
display:inline-block and
text-align:center to try to align some
block-level items what we can do on our
container is we can add another new
property called justify - content now
justify content is one of these
properties that you're going to be using
quite a bit on Flex containers and what
this allows us to do is have several
different types of ways that our items
are distributed within its container for
instance if we were to say justify
content center you can see our content
has now been justified or aligned to
Center into the container you can think
of this as like hitting the
text-align:center on Microsoft Word
right it just goes Center and this is
something that we've never been able to
do with block level elements this easily
I mean this right here is worth the
price of admission if we were to make
this container 100% of the height and we
were to justify Content Center and then
and then use another property we could
place this directly in the center of our
document with three lines of code in a
way that is non hacky in the past you'd
have to do things like translate
negative 50% and left 50% and you know
it just never felt totally right so now
it's so nice that we can have in two
lines of code here display flex justify
Content Center and we can have some
block level items in the exact center of
our container now I mentioned it when I
first started talking about being able
to distribute these evenly through this
box well we also have some other
properties here and our justified
content I'm going to comment justify
content center out and have a new one
which is going to be space - be tween
and I use space between quite a bit as
you can see here all of our blocks are
now even
distributed throughout our container
with 1 &amp;amp; 4 being pressed up against the
edge of our container what's awesome
about this is the flexible nature of
this flexbox property right if we change
the size of our container
well our objects are evenly distributed
regardless of that position between we
don't have to worry about the individual
margins there even then if they get a
little bit too much you can see what
fluxbox does is it takes over the width
of each of our objects and it starts to
shrink them so more on that later
however as you can see here flexbox
allows for some really excellent dynamic
layouts without having to do very much
we added two lines of code here now in
addition to space between we have
several other properties I'm going to
comment this out again and paste another
one in which we can say space around now
space around us the exact same thing
however it gives us an equal size
padding on the left and when I say
padding I don't mean padding in the
sense of CSS padding I mean just padding
right it's it's extra flexible space and
as you can see here this space is half
of the space in between two items
because it's even space on both sides so
this is another really useful property
for having flexible items inside of a
container especially if you want to have
that space on the outside now if you are
thinking man wouldn't it be great if
this space over here could be the exact
same space that's in the middle well
there's another property that has you
covered called space evenly not evently
evenly and as you can see here now the
space in between is the same all the way
around and we also have some other great
properties such as well
flex start which you're not going to see
being ground break hearing anything
because it puts all of our items at the
start of our container but we also have
flex end which will align them to the
end of our container and now with the
reason why I'm saying the
and the start of our container rather
than left and right is because you can
also align your flexbox items into a
column okay so you can take advantage of
things like this even spacing and
justify content and align Center that
sort of stuff
vertically as well as horizontally so
flexbox as you can see is just extremely
powerful for flexible space it's not
rigid it's not a grid so to say but it
can make certain layouts extremely easy
to pull off and as we go on in this
series you're going to see me using
display flex justify content space
between quite often because it's a nice
little fix for making something work and
there's a ton of instances in what
you're going to want to use this and now
you might be wondering well that's great
and all but you know instead of
squishing it wouldn't it be better if
they maybe jumped on to their own rows
right well we could also apply a wrap
property which is flex - wrap and then
the property values are no wrap wrap or
wrap reverse now what rap does is simply
allows you to put the next item on to
the next line and where flex reverse
will have it so the individual items
will wrap on two lines starting from the
bottom to the top we can show off both
of those right now so we can say flex
wrap wrap which I always think is kind
of funny that you have to you know flex
wrap wrap but as you can see here the
moment that they touch it suddenly is
now putting these on to another line and
as you can see because we don't have
five items if we have five items the
fifth item would be taking up this space
right here but it's essentially just
putting our next one on to the next line
now we could also have this be wrap
reverse like this and as you can see
here what's happened is well our items
do one two three and the fourth item
pops up top rather than down below now I
can say that I use wrap reverse very
often however there are
definite use cases for all of this stuff
so we can leave this as flexwrap
ripe for now and see that our items just
go on to the next line so now we've
covered our display flex we've covered
the justify content as where to put our
items we've covered the ability to wrap
our items now there's a couple other
properties we can put on flex containers
for instance I mentioned before if we
wanted these to be vertical we could
always give our flex a direction we gets
a flex - direction and the flex
direction will just be the default which
is Rho as you're seeing now but we could
also have Rho reverse which is an
interesting one because what it does is
it reverses our items now this is great
because I mean the Dom positions of
these hasn't changed the one is still
the first in the DOM and now four is
appearing first so it's just one of
these really interesting things that you
could never ever do without flex box
before so in addition to Rho reverse we
also have column so we could say column
and this aligns our items into a column
you'll notice that the container is
still only filling up this little bit
but if we add a little bit of CSS using
a new property called VH we do 100 VH
you can see that our container now takes
up the entire page here and we have our
items distributed just like we did
horizontally and then these other
properties such as you know justify
content flex and they're all going to
work the same way now this is a really
super handy thing if you need your items
inside of your vertical container to be
centered or at the bottom or reverse or
wrapping or any sort of cool stuff like
that just very interesting techniques in
fact there's a sort of replacement and
by replacement I don't mean
full-featured replacement and he sort of
temporary kind of replacement for the
Pinterest outlet layout where you do a
container where you have wrapping and
you have your Flex Direction B column
and your items will filter however
they'll be one two three four five six
seven whatever but they'll
take up your space and rose and it's not
a complete replacement for Pinterest
layouts or masonry or any sort of
JavaScript solution but it's definitely
a step in the right direction okay so we
have a flex direction and we also like
we mentioned we have row row reverse
column we also have column reverse I'm
going to go ahead and set this back to
its default which is row and I'm gonna
begin to talk about some more flex
properties so we've talked about the
wrapping we've talked about the
direction we've talked about justifying
that content but we haven't necessarily
talked about aligning now aligning is
really interesting because you think
well we already did aligning right we
already did aligning here well this
actually refers to a vertical alignment
or if these are in columns it would be
horizontal so while our justify content
places things on the left to right in a
row base the align items is going to do
it in the up-and-down space and again
what's nice about align items is that it
has similar properties so to show this
off I'm going to give one of our divs if
we do our ampersand and do n - child and
we can say hey the second child I'm
gonna give you a height of 150 pixels
okay so as you can see number two has
been now given this height so this is
going to allow us to experiment with
some of these aligned items properties
so let's go ahead and check out a line
item so if we do a line - items and this
is like I said it's going to have very
similar properties to justify content
now we don't have a space between but we
do have Center which is going to put all
of our items in the container Center now
at this point I already stretched the
container height to be 100 VH so I'm
going to go ahead and comment that out
and as I comment that I you can see that
the container is now only at which the
largest flex item is in here but
nonetheless all of our items here are
aligned in the center of them
likewise in addition to Center we can
have things
like baseline now baseline is
interesting because you'll see that all
of our text is on the exact same line
and what that does is it's specifically
about the text on the same line if we
were do have the line height be
something like 120 pixels this gets a
little bit more interesting now they're
not on the same horizontal plane they're
not centered here but all of the numbers
are perfectly in line okay so really
cool let's get rid of that line height
and let's talk about well we also have
things like flex start and flex end
so we could say flex start which is
going to put these at the top and flex
end which is going to put these at the
bottom definitely a useful thing in fact
what does this remind you of right now
well this reminds me of a line graph or
a bar graph not a line graph a bar graph
where each of the items represents some
sort of data now this would be a really
cool example if you actually had data
all you would have to do is set each
individual box is height to the value of
your data in some sort of pixel value
that makes sense and if you had them
aligned at the bottom here using flex
and it's gonna look like a line graph
and it's gonna be nice and easy you
don't have to use a chart library to
show that so super cool and very easy to
set up and flex end is really super nice
so I mentioned we have flex star flex
and center baseline and we have stretch
which is the default so with stretch
right if we do a line items stretch you
can see that our container here is
adjusting to the size of the largest one
and we are all good now there's one last
property on flex box containers which is
a line content so we've seen a line
items and we've seen justify content and
aligned content is very very similar is
you can tell just based on the name
alone in fact a line content has the
same exact properties as justify content
so it has flex start flex and center
space between space around and stretch
now what's cool about
aligned content is it's going to
basically take into account all of our
items so let's actually push this so
this fourth item is down here and once
again let's unleash this 100 VH you can
see here that well all of our things
want to take up this space but let's say
we wanted all of our items in our row to
actually be in the center of our
container now we wouldn't want to use a
line items Center because that's
essentially going to put them in the
center of their own line so Center puts
them in the center of their own lines
rather than the center of everything
so if we were to do something like a
line content we can say Center and now
they're still in their own lines but
they're pushed to the center and
likewise if we were to do a line content
flex and they're going to be pushed to
the bottom and if we do things like
space - between just like we have you
can see that they're now pushed to the
top and bottom anytime you add another
item is just going to go right to the
bottom
so what flex box is great at is these
extremely flexible containers that
respond very well to responsive sort of
browser size flex box is incredible for
writing mobile layouts because I mean
look at how we easily this essentially
re shifts itself what flex box isn't
great at however is very structured
layouts and to get very structured
layouts we're gonna want to be using CSS
grid which is something we're going to
be doing a very similar video to very
soon so now we've covered all of the
different properties on flexbox
containers in the next video i'm going
to be covering all of the different
properties for flex items aka
children of a Flex container aka our
boxes 1 through 4 here so fire up the
next video check out the next code pen
and we're gonna get going on properties
for the children of a Flex container</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
