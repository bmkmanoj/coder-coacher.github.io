up tuts and today we're going to be
showing you in my favorite sketch
extensions and this extension what it
allows you to do is it allows you to
create boxes and buttons of that sort
that have padding that way if you're
creating a button just like in CSS
regardless of the text that's in that
button it's going to adjust to the size
of that text so you don't have to fiddle
around with box sizes or things like
that to make sure your dimensions are
correct if you say you know this box has
20 pixels padding it's going to respond
to that padding based off of the text
inside of that so get going and we're
going to show you where you can get this
plugin install it and check it out so to
get started we first need to grab the
plugin the link of which I'm going to
put in the description on the video it's
for this sketch dynamic button plug-in
so you can go ahead and download this
button directly from the github page
here and we're going to show you how to
use it okay so just like last time when
we install the plug and the easiest way
to do it is just to come in to sketch
we're going to come in to reveal plugins
folder and it's going to open up our
plugins folder and finder here we can
just go ahead and drop this dynamic
button plug-in directly in here and
there we have it so to get started what
we need to do is we need to create a
text layer and this text layer is going
to be the the padding of our box of our
button that is so let's say we wanted a
button with 20 pixels on the top and
bottom and then 40 on the right and left
of padding we're going to say 20 : let's
actually zoom in on this so we can see
this bigger let's say 20 : 40 : 20 : 40
now this is just like CSS if you're used
to that it's going top right bottom left
and let's bump up the font size a bit so
we can see it better say something like
48 there we go
cool so now let's go ahead and create
our button all we need to do is select
this text layer and hit command
J what you see as we've been given a new
flex button group now if we open this up
we can see that we have our text layer
and we have this this background layer
and here we have our dynamic box now how
do we get it so we can change the text
and make it dynamic well if we change
this text to something like submit
you'll notice the box stays the same
size so how do we get this to be dynamic
well if we change the layer name here we
can just double click on the layer name
itself and then set this to be whatever
our padding is let's do something a bit
different this time so we can do let's
do a little bit wider of a button so we
can say 10 and then 50 10 50 and keep in
mind you need the colons in between
there so 10 fit 10 : 50 : 10 : 50 : okay
notice how our layer name is that but
our button still says submit now with
the text layer selected we can hit
command J once more and what's happened
is our button our background has changed
size to match the dimensions that we
wanted here likewise if we were to
change this word - let's just say high
which is a nice short word we can now
make sure that we have our layer name
the same and hit command J once more and
you can see the button resizing itself
so this way we could create something
maybe we give this a blue color um we
could round the edges a little bit and
maybe change this text color to white
now that's on top of a button there we
go and now we have a nice looking button
here and we did that all with the help
of this plugin again one more example to
show you after it's changed we could
just say this is now saying cancel
select your text command J perfect it
couldn't be any easier
we now have dynamic buttons in sketch 3
so check it out let me know what you
make with this it's really great for for
web comps where you're changing buttons
and
now somebody says oh this button doesn't
have the right text you don't have to
change it it's going to be more like CSS
where you can always have things updated
based on the sort of the styles the
generic Styles you want so perfect check
it out let me know what you think as
always this is scout level up Tut's if
you have any questions or comments let
us know what you're thinking we love to
hear from you so thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
