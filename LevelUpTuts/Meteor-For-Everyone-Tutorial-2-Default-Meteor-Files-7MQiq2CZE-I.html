tutorials and today we're going to talk
through some of the code that was
generated when we initialized our
application using the meteor create
command that we used in the last video
so check it out you're going to see what
does--what within meteor and what is
existing when we use the create command
so let's get started right now
so we have our project we've started it
it's been created and well we're not
going to get into the actual creation of
our resolutions code in this video we
are going to do is show you a little bit
of the media or code that was generated
and what's doing what within this demo
so when we used created created this
code for us in our folder which was
resolutions I'm just going to drag this
folder in to my sublime text so we can
take a look now as you'll notice we have
a folder that is dot media now this
folder is going to contain a lot of the
things about our application as you can
see it tells versions of dependencies
you can use it's see it's using things
like underscore it's using things like
blaze which is their templating system
their views it's using packages like
auto publish now if you don't recognize
a lot of these packages that's okay
because a lot of them are meteor
specific packages now that's one of the
cool things about meteor it's sort of a
platform of a bunch of different
components like using the blaze for the
front-end views and things like that and
although it is opinionated by using
something like underscore you can
actually easily add in something like
lodash if that's what you're used to
using instead of underscore like I
prefer to do myself okay so let's check
out some other stuff you can see the
version of the meteor now the stuff
within this dot meteor folder you're not
going to be going in here if we come
into that local there's all sorts of
things and we're really not going to be
touching any of these files but it is
kind of interesting to paw through here
and sort of see the internals of what's
going on with meteor and if you have no
clue at the end of the day what if that
stuff is doing don't worry about it
we're going to be creating cool stuff
regardless okay so let's check out our
resolution study HTML and this is going
to be your first introduction to the
blaze templating so what we have here is
just some normal-looking HTML however we
have
a couple double brackets a greater than
and then a name what this name is doing
is it's actually referencing a template
now if you look down here we see a
template with the same name hello now
this contains the click me and the youth
pressed counter which is in these
brackets as well so as if we head back
to our page you can see that the digit
right here is our counter and this
button is our button however all of this
content in this template has been
inserted in to this hello Tex
so this hello is just referencing this
template now we're going to dive in a
whole lot more with what these templates
can do it can do quite a bit and it's
really really cool so don't worry about
too much other than this is just
standard HTML just augmented with some
template tags and some additional
functionality now let's check out our
CSS see how there's nothing in here I'm
going to show you something really
really cool about working with meteor we
have the meteor command running our
websites live and actually it let's type
in body brackets and let's say a
background right I save this now I'm
going to tab back over to my browser
without refreshing or without telling
the browser anything it's already
updated the color that's one of the
great things about meteor is when you're
just working in it it's auto updating so
as you're saving your CSS you can tab
back to your browser and you're getting
this auto update but we didn't have to
do anything to tell one our browser I
didn't have to enable any sort of
plugins or extensions I'd have to do
anything it just knows so that's one
really great thing about meteor likewise
we could just instantly change this to
anything let's just say it'll be blue
okay back and as you can see it changed
really quickly okay another really
interesting thing about this CSS within
here is that this files named
resolutions CSS
if we look in our HTML it's not
referencing any CSS file and you might
be wondering well how is it getting
anything so what happens is meteor just
knows that this resolutions dot CSS file
is going to be going with your project
now ways this can be augmented is
through something like CSS preprocessors
in fact in this video series we're going
to show you how to use stylus within
meteor so that you can write stylus
files that are broken up into all sorts
of different files and you'll never even
have to look at a CSS file so that's
just one of the really cool things about
meteor it just makes a lot of things
really nice for you you don't have to
worry about your pre compiled and your
compiled Styles just what Styles you're
using in your application and what
you're writing ok so now let's check out
this javascript in resolution cas now if
you look up top here the first thing you
see is this if meteor is client this is
what we're going to put all of our
client-side JavaScript and if you look
down here we actually have an analogous
if meteor is server which is where we're
going to put our server code for
instance there's this meteor dot startup
which is code that's going to run on the
server at startup
now meteor oftentimes combines front-end
and back-end code into single statement
so it keeps things together however you
can do separate functions and in fact
there's going to be all sorts of
instances where either-or is going to be
useful to you at that given time also we
have here's a session set default and
what it's doing is its setting a
variable name counter to zero and
because this is a session variable only
the user who's current session is going
to see that in the quick example that
you we showed you before where one user
was able to see the resolutions that
other users were seeing as they happened
without refreshing you'll notice that
this is different because this counter
is using a session variable if we click
this you know 10 different times if we
open this up
the same application and an incognito
window it's going to say zero times so
this variable is stored to the user's
session rather than the the site itself
or stayed persistent in the database now
we have template helpers which are going
to be enabling you to use various tags
within your HTML for instance in our
HTML file we saw this counter tag right
here
well this counter object in our template
hello helpers is the result of this
function so as you can see it's getting
the session variable counter and it's
returning it as the value in this object
here okay now if that doesn't make a
whole ton of sense yet don't worry we're
not even going to get into session
variables in depth until for a few more
videos so don't worry too much about
session variables or anything like that
however we're going to show you quite a
bit about them now we also have this
template hello dot events now as you can
see that this is where our events going
to go when you can say when we click the
button and it's going to increment the
counter that's being clicked so it's
going to set the counter variable one
more than it already was
so in these 23 lines of JavaScript in
fact just 17 of them are actually
applicable we have this nice little web
app that's doing something really super
basic but it's pretty cool that it
exists and it works so nicely will
you'll be even more excited about the
resolutions application that we're going
to be creating is not going to be using
very much more JavaScript than that and
it's going to be way more complex and
it's going to even persist into a
database so that's a brief tour about
what comes when you install meteor and
you use this create command so over the
course of the next few videos we're
going to get started creating our
application in the next video we're
actually going to start laying the
groundwork down and I'm going to pass
along the CSS for our meteor app
location so that you can just drop that
in your project and we don't have to
worry about it obviously the resolutions
application isn't going to be winning
any sort of design awards but it's nice
to have however it will be nice for you
to see the same thing on your screen
that's on my screen so I'm really
excited to teach you the basics of using
meteor and hopefully after that we're
going to get into some really great
intermediate and advanced meteor stuff
as well so as always this is Scott with
LevelUp tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment

Facebook we love to hear from you thanks
for watching and we'll see you in the
