up tutorials and today we're going to
show you how you can import files using
stylus now import statements are
something that as a key feature in CSS
preprocessors because it allows you to
separate your CSS files in a nice
organized manner so things can stay
separate like variables can stay with
variables nixon's can stay with mix-ins
and so on
so let's get started using import
statements right now okay so in the last
video you can see that we have things
like a clear fix and we have
border-radius and then we have some
variables well what's quickly happening
is that our style sheet which is our da
sty elf file is now not necessarily
representing our actual styles on our
page is representing code that we're
reusing for instance our actual CSS this
body tag where we're actually styling
something already occurs on line 18 you
can see that once you start to bring in
more and more mix-ins to help you out
and more and more variables and other
things like that your CSS and your style
the code that you're actually going to
be editing most frequently is just going
to get pushed down and maybe that's not
a problem but one of the best parts
about using a CSS preprocessor is how
easy it is to organize your code using
separate files and import statements so
how do you how do you do this right how
do you use an import statement well in
stylist importing is really super easy
and you can import not only stylist
files but you can also import other CSS
files so we're gonna show you how you
can quickly set up your project to be
nice and organized so instead of just
having a one style file which is maybe
what you're used to you can have a whole
separate folders that you can navigate
to quickly and keep everything organized
so to start this off I'm actually going
to make a folder here and this folder is
going to be named as Tyl now I'm naming
at this because this is where I'm gonna
keep my stylist files so now that we
have an st yl folder I'm gonna make a
new file inside of that
and this file is going to be our
variables stylus file so what we can say
is variables dot st yl and so it's just
like saving any other file with a stylus
extension now let's move our variables
into this stylus variables file so I'm
just gonna cut cut those right out of
there and I'm gonna paste them into our
variables style file and you'll notice
that if I were to save this main style
file things get really weird over here
you start to notice that this blue is
now using the actual color blue and red
is now using the actual color red these
really ugly colors and in fact if we
weren't already using predetermined
color very color names here it would
start throwing errors because it
couldn't find those variables and it you
know the CSS would have no idea what
those variable names are so how do we
bring back in our variables dot style
folder well that's where this import
statement comes in and we can type at
import just like that and we need to
pass it in a string now we need to give
it the path at which it finds that file
so it's going to be st yl forward slash
and then our variables file so it's
named variables just like that and here
because we're using a sty L file and not
a CSS file if we save this already like
this stylus is just going to assume that
the ending of the word variables here
it's just going to assume that this is
has dot sty L at the end so we don't
have to actually specify that this is a
stylus file so if we save it you'll now
see that our colors are magically back
to normal
so this import statement saying is
saying hey go to this file grab this
stuff use it at the top of this file and
then any time it sees these variable
names it's going to use the correct
variable and not
the ugly default red and blue colors
that we have cool so that was really
easy let's go ahead and do the same
thing for mix-ins I'm gonna make a new
file in the same folder and I'm gonna
name it mix-ins so let's say that st yl
and now once again i'm gonna copy and
cut all of the stuff out of here and i'm
gonna paste it into our mix-ins file
save that now I'm going to copy this
import statement paste it in here and
change this to mix-ins like that and as
you can see nothing's broken we're still
getting our clear fix mix in to work
we're still getting our border-radius
mix in to work and now you can see our
actual CSS has been bumped up from line
18 all the way to line 4 like I said you
know the length at which your actual CSS
gets bumped down is more dependent on
how much stuff you're bringing in but
really what's nice about this is that
you can just go to your main style dot
stylist file and know that these are
actually going to be your website's
files and in fact if we in sublime text
type command T to look through our
project we can just do things like
search for the variables file hit enter
and here are all of our variables and we
can just keep adding them in here keeps
them totally separate now it might seem
like an extraneous extra step if you're
not used to working with CSS
preprocessors but let me tell you that
it is one of my favorite things about
CSS preprocessors and the organization
it brings to your Styles is unmatched it
is really just the best way to keep your
files organized now you can even take
this one step further and make separate
files for all sorts of things people
make extra files for maybe components
you can move things like default element
styles into its own file and then
everything that's your template is
somewhere else you can keep just your
layout CSS and its own stuff you can
really do all sorts of different product
project management schemes based on how
you like to maintain your project and
how large of a project it is and Stylus
really lets you operate in a way
that makes it nice and easy now you may
be thinking well the more things I
import the more in import statements I
have to make it's just gonna keep adding
to the top
well stylist actually supports something
called globbing directly out of the box
now globbing is a feature that I use all
the time and SAS using a SAS plug-in
called SAS globbing so I'm really super
happy that it exists by default in
stylist now what is globbing it's
essentially the use of a wild card in an
import statement so it we can get rid of
one of these import statements by simply
deleting it and then instead of saying
variables we can say forward slash
asterisk now this asterisk is saying go
into the st yl folder and import
everything so grab the mix-ins dot s Tyl
file grab the variables st yl file and
then import them import both of them so
if we save this you can see once again
nothing has changed we have our colors
we have our mix-ins everything's working
perfectly
thanks to this wild card and keeping
stuff organized that way if you have
several folders full of several
different types of stylus files you can
just have you there import statements
this way and it's gonna keep everything
nice and organized so this is not only
the benefit of import statements this is
how to use them you should now feel
confident in separating out your CSS and
the different files and being able to
import those stylus files in the next
video we're going to talk about more
advanced in extra import stuff that
comes with stylus that could be cool
like importing CSS statements using the
require instead of import and all sorts
of cool stuff so keep watching we're
gonna show you some of that in the next
video as always this is Scott with level
up tutorials if you have any questions
or comments leave a comment the video
how to set that toward our Facebook at
level up to tour else we'd love to hear
from you thanks for watching and we'll
see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
