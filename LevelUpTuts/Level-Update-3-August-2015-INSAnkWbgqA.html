tutorials and in this level update i'm
going to cover a little bit about what i
was able to accomplish in july and what
I'm planning and hoping to accomplish in
August and beyond with level up
tutorials now this july i was able to
create more videos for level up
tutorials than any other month this year
however in august i plan on not only
creating more videos than july but more
videos than any other month than I've
been able to put out in the history of
level up tutorials now to do that I have
a bunch of series that are planned that
are both new series and continuations of
series have already started and or now
so we're going to continue the progress
on our technical series like angular for
everyone the meteor intermediate series
which is about to start where we detail
some of the best and most used meteor
packages the polymer 1 point 0 videos
where we show you how you can use
polymer in your day-to-day web
development life and continuing the
adaptive theme series for Drupal 7 now
in addition to these series i'm also
planning on starting a bunch of new
series which I'm hoping I'll be able to
release in larger chunks than maybe one
or two videos at a time we'll have to
see how that exactly works out but these
video series I have planned are
something like how to build a website
for the very first time in which you're
not only going to learn what hTML is and
what CSS is and that kind of stuff but
really the foundations of how to build
websites so even if you have no
experience you'll be able to follow
along and if you have some experience
it's going to really clarify about why
you do what you do and how to do it now
in addition to that I have a couple of
other series plan one on the SEO for
search engine optimization there's a
couple of really small tweaks you can
make to your code and how you build
websites to make them much friendlier to
search engines so that you can do a lot
of the work in the code to make your
websites more findable also I plan on
having a series for web optimizations
now there's a lot of techniques you can
use to not only find what's causing your
website to be slow but how you can use
these tools to really optimize
and make your website as fast as
possible website optimization is a
gigantic thing you should learn in your
web development tool set because a fast
website keeps people on your website and
a slow website is going to drive people
away from it so I plan on covering all
sorts of really cool stuff in this web
optimization series now the last series
i've been working on is going to be a
sort of web developer life series where
we talk more about the motivations of
how you can continue to advance your
career as a web developer now this is
not just professional things but things
like there are a thousand JavaScript
frameworks out right now front-end and
back-end how you can learn how to choose
one of these frameworks or maybe even
learn how to pick which frameworks work
for you things like that how does does
not feel overwhelmed when there's a
thousand things out there to learn in
addition covering a little bit about how
to make your career as awesome as it can
be as a web developer so keep on the
lookout for all of those many of them
may not be available in august but i
hope to get as much work done on these
as possible as soon as possible so keep
watching and those videos are going to
find their way into your playlist if you
are subscriber also you may have noticed
on some of my more recent videos i have
a new end card which allows you to
quickly linked to various playlists
subscribe or even help support level up
tutorials as a channel i made this in
sketch and animated it in Adobe After
Effects now the good thing is is I
recorded my whole process while I was
doing that so if you'd like to see how
you can take a design from sketch move
it to Adobe After Effects and animate it
I will make that video available
sometime later this month so keep your
eyes open for that also there's a bunch
of really exciting future plans for the
next few months at I'll be announcing a
little bit as we go and further level
updates I'm not quite ready to to spill
just quite yet and however one of these
things that I'm not quite ready to
announce i am ready to maybe give a
sneak peek at there is going to be a new
level up patreon page that allows you to
help support level up tutorials in my
creation of these free tutorials on the
web now check it out i'm going to post a
in the annotation or the description of
this video and you can start helping
support level of tutorials on patreon
like you may be used to with some other
channels now we have some rewards and
things like that and there that are just
still being worked on so if you have any
suggestions there feel free to let me
know and it could just make its way onto
the list of rewards so like I said check
out the patreon page is this and the
official announcement it's not the
official release of this but check it
out it's available and you can help
support level up tutorials that way so
as always thank you so much for watching
there's going to be a ton new videos and
they're just going to keep on coming out
as fast as I can make them so thank you
so much and I'll see in the next one but
