tutorials and in this video we're going
to really sort of round out parts of our
design by showing you what it takes to
get our footer looking correctly so
let's get going on that right now okay
so in the last video we got our main
column our main area set up now in this
video we're gonna be talking about the
footer
now what content is typically in a
footer is maybe a copyright there's also
usually is some additional links
sometimes they include links they are
not part of the main navigation for
instance maybe if you want to have about
in an home and some other maybe like
products or things but you don't want to
contact us to be right in the forefront
you sometimes see people put links like
that that they just want to be part of
the main links but not sort of highly
focused like these header links and in
addition you could put things like a
Terms of Service and a privacy policy or
something like that alright now we just
have this C 215 this copyright 2015 and
it's a background of white here now what
we want to do is we want to make this
look like a footer now one now one quick
thing we can do to make it look like a
footer is instantly take some cues from
the header now we had on our sites
header we had a padding of 10 pixels and
5% now I'm just gonna go ahead and type
in main footer okay I'm gonna give it
this padding now I'm gonna take this
class because I haven't actually
assigned this to the HTML yet I'm gonna
add this to our HTML main footer so we
have an ID here of footer but if you
remember we don't style off of IDs we
style off of classes so let's go ahead
and just ahead main footer now the
reason why I gave this a class of main
footer instead of just using the element
is the footer element doesn't just have
to be the pages footer but can also be a
particular section or an asides footer
or something like that so to leave
ourselves open for being able to use the
footer again in the future I'm giving
this
class so we have main footer there we go
padding let's refresh okay cool so now
it's all done line with our header here
it should be nice and nice and good that
way I'm actually going to bump up this
padding to like something like forty
pixels for the top and bottom and I'm
gonna give this a background now this
background is gonna be really dark it's
gonna be the same color that we were
using on the Billboard and I'm going to
give it a color of white like so so
background 3-3-3 color white forty
pixels five percent refresh and you can
see we now have our footer here I mean
this looks a little bit cramped because
we don't have a ton of information here
however once this sort of fills out and
pushes down you'll be able to see that
this is looking more proportional as we
go so we have this copyright 2015 let's
head to our HTML and I'm just going to
say level up
Vittorio's now I'm gonna give this
paragraph a class of copy right okay and
what I'm gonna do with this is I'm
actually going to once again float this
to the left so copyright it's going to
be floated to the left because we're
floating this to the left we actually
need to give our footer a class of clear
fix if you remember to make sure that it
actually contains the height of its
children now what we want to do down
here is let's add another unordered list
we could say ul L I and inside of that
we're going to add a link to the index
page which we can get to just by a
forward slash we can say home close
these all up likewise I'm gonna let me
scroll down here I'm gonna have this be
about the skin linked to about HTML okay
and there we go now I'm gonna give this
unordered list a class name of we're
going to have this just be letter nav
okay save this let's come here to our
footer nav and the CSS I want to use for
the footer nav if you remember the
footer nav is on the UL itself so we
want this to be a list-style:none we
don't want any hot list elements in here
anything like that and a copy and paste
flutter nav and make an on target our
list item here now the list item itself
I'm going to want to float left because
I'm floating the list item left again
we're gonna want to use a clear fix on
our unordered list you'll notice this
pattern here any time we're sort of
using a float inside of a container
you're gonna need that clear fix on the
container if you wanted to maintain its
proper height and so we floated our copy
right to the left
let's actually float the entire nav to
the right so let's come back to our page
and see all of the work that we did so
what you can see is we now have our
copyright on the Left we have our footer
navigation down here on the right
cool so let's actually go ahead and
target these links here because we don't
necessarily want these links to be this
blue we don't want them to have to text
underlined although the text underlined
isn't isn't too bad we also want them to
maybe be a little bit smaller they're a
little big for my taste right now so one
way that we can target these links
specifically is we can think about only
having links in this footer being these
navigational links know that very well
may not be the case however in this
particular example we want to target
every single anchor tag that's in the
footer so we can say main footer anchor
tag okay so now this is going to target
every single
anchor tag in the footer we can say
color equals white we can say font size
is equal to 12 pixels like so now let's
go ahead and add some margin left to the
list items here now this is going to be
a really interesting property of CSS now
this is a property that many people may
not even know even if there are not
necessarily advanced but experienced
with CSS so what we can say is in the
footer nav we want to target every
single list item that is plus a list
item and what this plus means is it's
next to a list item so if we look at our
HTML we're gonna say we're looking at in
the footer any sort of list item that's
next to a list item but next to as in
follows a list item so this one right
here the home link even though it's next
to this about link it doesn't count
because it scans down the document so
next we see this one it looks up one and
it sees that there's a list item so it
knows to add the property to this bottom
one so the plus is adding one to any
list item that follows another list item
if we were to keep adding items in here
like say if we were to add another link
here it would just add the property
would target every single element except
for the very first one in our list now
what we're gonna want to do is say
margin left and we're any of this margin
left of 10 pixels like so now let's go
ahead and refresh our page now as you
can see we have these two links they're
a bit smaller there are not so obtrusive
and if we inspect this you can see the
let's pull this down here you can see
that the first list item is not getting
any sort of margin but the second one's
getting a margin left of 10 pixels cool
so we now have our footer it's really
coming together this is starting to look
like a pretty normal website in a lot of
ways I mean obviously there's a lot of
things to add here mostly in content and
things like that but the design is
really starting to come together so as
always this is Scott
