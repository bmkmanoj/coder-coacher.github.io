up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be creating our first menu now we
had menus that were previously already
created for us and this one's gonna be a
quick one because we're going to show
you just how easy it is to create your
own menu full of whatever links you
would like so now that we've worked with
the menu let's go ahead and create a
menu now in this particular example
we're going to be creating a menu that's
multi layers deep now we don't have a
ton of content to work with but what we
do have is a couple of blog posts or at
least one blog posts we have this node /
- my edited post so let's say we want to
make a new menu that's just going to
have home as a link and then are several
different posts so let's go ahead and
head to structure from here we can head
to menus and let's go ahead and click
add menu this is going to just be side
nav now you can just have this be
whatever you'd like here and listen just
be a side a side bar navigation for
posts okay and we can click Save now
because we don't have a ton of content
it's not going to be amazing but let's
go ahead and click Add link and we can
at least get a basic menu going
we can just say recent posts which is
going to take us home now to take us
home you'll notice that it says enter
front for the front page now let's come
to description and we don't really need
anything there so and we don't really
need anything there and as you can see
show as expanded is unchecked but since
we're gonna have this as be a child
we're gonna have a child of this we want
show as expanded checked in addition we
want the parents to be side NIF and the
weight to be zero let's go ahead and
click Save now the next one's where it's
going to get little bit more fun because
we're gonna have a child link we can
click add link once more and let's go
ahead and say menu link title it can
just be first post and the link is going
to be it too
node / - now in the real world you might
want this list to be automatically
generated and there's lots of solutions
to do that but none that are super easy
out of the box I personally would use
views to create a list for this and I
might be going over that exactly in the
advanced views series that's going to be
available now we have the link to node /
- and we have first post and we're not
going to have a description and this
doesn't need to be show as expanded
because it's not going to have any
children how if our parent link is going
to be recent posts which is the one we
just created and I can leave this as a
weight of 0 since this is a parent
having a weight of 0 isn't going to
clash with its parent who also has a
weight of 0 it's going to be a new list
of weights in there so if I click Save
you'll now notice this is now
illustrated like so we now have recent
posts and a first post
so we've now created a menu and our menu
has a recent post and first posts and
our menu has a parent and a child so now
that we've created a menu we're ready to
learn more about menu blocks which is
actually a feature that used to be
outside of Drupal scorin you had to end
and you had to add it to every single
project that you made so in Drupal 8
it's awesome that we now have menu
blocks in Drupal so in the next video
we're gonna cover that as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments and they
come in the video head toward our
facebook at level up tutorials thanks
for watching and I'll see in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
