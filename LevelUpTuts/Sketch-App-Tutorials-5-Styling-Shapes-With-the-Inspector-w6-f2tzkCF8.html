of touch and today we're going to be
talking about the inspector and in
particular the inspector for shapes so
we're going to be modifying shapes using
the inspector now what does the
inspector it's the area over here on the
right of sketch and like you've seen
will never eat select anything whether
it's an art board or a rectangle itself
this inspector is going to show
different things so let's go ahead and
create a shape we're just going to do a
basic rectangle inside of this artboard
and one thing you'll notice is that the
default properties for this shape are
that it's going to have this gray fill
and it's going to have a darker gray
border now like I said when these shapes
not selected this information pertains
to nothing because nothing selected we
select the shape and we get its position
in X and y coordinates its size width
height and width its rotational we can
flip it if we'd like we can give it a
radius and around those corners we can
basically give it a shared style that's
sort of like almost like we'll be
working with CSS
maybe we create a style that we're going
to be using over and over again and then
we can save it and then reuse it we also
have blending styles like what you'd
expect with Photoshop when you have
blending we have normal dark and
multiply color burn the stuff that
you're going to be useful to now we also
have an opacity where you can make this
transparent and next we have fills and
borders below that we have some options
like shadows inner shadows Gaussian blur
and reflection now what's cool about
things like fills and borders is that we
have some options here it's not just
changed the amount of fill give it a
blending style or an opacity we can
actually add multiple fills first let's
actually get rid of this border we can
just do that by unchecking this check
box there we go we now have a borderless
rectangle and let's change this fill
color by click
the color here and within here you can
see that we have options to all sorts of
different fills so fills are not just
the color it's also gradients its radial
gradients its angular gradients its
patterns and its noise now we can change
now each of these are going to have
different types of properties we can go
over some of these in later videos but
you can see that you can provide fills
of all different types and individually
we have ways of controlling that we also
have a quick color palette here where
you can add colors or select them via
hex RGB or just this color picker here
cool so what can else can we do with
this let's say we wanted a flat red but
we also wanted a layer of noise that we
wanted to multiply so we can have this
fill red and then we can click the plus
right here and this is going to add
another layer you'll notice it's adding
a gradient by default on top of this
that is set to the color up top here
having some transparency but let's add
some noise on top of this so we did that
here and let's just say we're going to
have original is fine and let's tone
down the intensity a little bit now we
have this layer on top now you'll notice
that when I'm up when I move this
intensity it's actually just changing
the opacity of this layer so we can
leave that here it let's tell this to
however multiply with the layer below it
we can go ahead and say multiply and
that's not a huge difference we can have
it darken we can do any of the things
that you normally expect here's an
overlay and now let's dial back the
intensity a little bit me there we go so
now we have some noise here on this
layer let's say we hated that noise we
want to get rid of it we actually
decided we don't want to Phil's we can
just right click on that and select
remove we now just have one fill
and likewise with borders we can say
let's have a border that's five pixels
thick and it's like black and now let's
say we want to click plus we can add
another border now keep in mind here
that borders can also have linear
gradients radial gradients or angular
gradients now I'm going to keep this as
just a basic example here so let's do
this something super ugly and have a
blue here now let's go ahead and bump
this size of it up and we can watch it
grow now it is covering our previous
border now that's because the position
was sent to center we can changes to be
inside or outside and you can see that
it's now on the outside of our other
border and our shape so just like that
we have a double border and we can keep
adding borders and you can click this
gear gear here to give dashes or gaps or
you can give your borders rounded edges
or chopped edges that sort of thing so
we have some options with borders even
on top of that now you can even add a
shadow nice and easy and this is sort of
what you'd be familiar with if you were
using CSS we have an X a Y a blur and a
spread and we have a color picker here
nothing crazy
we don't need anything extra that and
you can always click the plus and add
more shadows likewise we have inner
shadow which functions the same way and
we have some blur effects we can use
Gaussian motion zoom or background blur
and to enable those you just need to
click this check box notice how these
are all non-destructive you can click
and unclick and it turns them off or on
just like Photoshop layer styles we can
also do a reflection if you'd like you
can see this reflection down here and we
can turn up the strength and then the
distance and stuff like that now let's
see these are the visual flares for the
inspector but a lot of the times this
position and size comes in handy let's
say we wanted this to be exactly 650
and this one to be 350 tall now that's
exactly perfect and we wanted this to be
let's say we want it to be 200 pixels
from the left of our artboard all we
have to say is 200 and we wanted this to
be 100 pixels from the top of our
artboard we just say 100 so these
position values are relative to the
artboard itself this size is the size of
the shape and we can rotate it like so
cool so we now have the ability to
transform our shapes into all sorts of
cool stuff using all these different
styles and there's even more than that
like I said we could set up a shared
style and of course we're going to go
over things like that in the future
about how we can make our workflow
better and how we can create some really
cool stuff using sketch of course the
shape is super ugly and I apologize for
that
and I promise in the next videos we're
actually making things that look nice so
as always this is Scott with level of
touch if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video or
hit us up at Twitter or Facebook or
anywhere we love to hear from you so
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
