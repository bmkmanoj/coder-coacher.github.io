tuts and today I'm going to show you to
set up UPS shipping on your Magento site
in the last lesson we did free shipping
cable rates and flight rate if you don't
know how to get the shipping it's under
system configuration and then down here
just down here under sales it's under
shipping methods ok so what we're going
to do is we're going to click to open
this UPS shipping the first thing we're
going to do is enable this so we'll
check this to be yes UPS type you paste
Parcel Service or UPS processor for sex
and now we're gonna leave it as that
the title will just change us to UPS
because that's what people are going to
notice anyways you don't have to have
them read United Parcel Service when
they go to checkout this gateway URL
you're not going to want to change this
this is the the gateway to where it's
going to be getting the prices for the
shipping so just leave that the same
yeah just don't don't touch it
and then now package request type
divided to equal weight or use origin
weight so this is like this is basically
if you're sending one request to UPS and
it's going to have all of the weights
together or this is the few requests
with the different weights I'll just
leave it as one request if I were you
I'd probably try at different ways and
if shipping B is the accurate to what it
actually is when you're taking two UPS
than if it isn't then you can always
adjust it to whatever works best for
your store container is whatever you're
pretty much going to be sending stuff in
customer packaging is probably going to
be what you're sending stuff in unless
you're sending I mean everything is the
exact same so I would select customer
packaging unless you know that it's all
going to be one of these and now weight
unit pounds if you're in the u.s.
kilograms period anywhere else
maximum package weight this is in pound
so 150 pounds is the maximum so it says
contact your carrier like I said you
cannot I mean you can't just determine
it yourself that's something that UPS
you'll probably want to go over with
them but 150 is the default so we'll
just leave it pickup method customer
counter and you know regular daily
pickup this would be something that you
would have an agreement with you
yes if you work with them regularly if
they're going to be doing a regular
daily pickup I'm gonna leave it at
customer counter we can just drop them
off minimum package weight is less than
a pound okay fine um calculate handling
fee handling is going to be you can be
fixed or percent you can never be a
percent of the total price or fixed per
order okay
per package you can even do it but you
know you're handling whatever we'll put
it two dollars these are the allowed
methods you can select or deselect as
many of these if you like if you only
want one of them you can just click one
if you want multiples you can hold
command if you're on a Mac and click
different ones hold shift to select all
of them like that okay so free method um
if you want a free shipping method you
know it sells ground selected but if you
want to have an option for a free
shipping method you can click done you
know how Amazon sometimes has like five
to eight day shipping is free and you
just have to wait for it so you can have
that I'm having it set to none free
shipping with minimum order amount so
you can get a free shipping if you spend
$100 for something so you could say if
you spend a hundred bucks do you get
free shipping we're going to disable
that for now this is the error message
the shipping method is unavailable okay
you can just customize that to whatever
you'd be I usually don't even touch that
stuff allowed countries unless like
specific countries shipping to all these
countries might be difficult um depends
on what you're selling but I'm just
going to ship to United States only
sorry everybody else and then so I show
method if not happy but like I said
before I don't know why you to you know
want to show this if it wasn't
applicable maybe if you just want to
have people know what sort of options
are out there but we'll leave those
being no and debug I said no sort order
since we already have the other one but
we want this to be the first one I'll
put it as zero and then if we go back to
our flat rate which we enabled I can set
this order to one so that our table
right shows up on top let's save this
configuration and let's see this in
action okay
so let's go to our checkout here we are
this check out from before I'm going to
refresh this and it's going to make me
do all this stuff again so just give me
one second I'm going to type in my
information okay and if you select trip
to a different address like I said
before it's going to put in a different
address your shipping information but
furnish it to this address so it's going
to copy this stuff filled in under
shipping information move it on to the
next step okay the shipping method so
here you can see UPS is now first and
it's going to give them the price
options that it got from UPS is a
website itself so ground is going to be
13 three-day air like I so see how
there's so many options here you don't
usually get this many options from
websites that would be changed back in
here let's close these um right down
here so if we only selected one of these
they would only see whichever ones you
select but these are the only ones that
are applicable so it's only showing
these or free shipping looks like it's
enabled as well how we didn't turn that
one off so if I was the customer right
now I'd be selecting free shipping
however you can select UPS click
continue and it's going to ask for their
payment cool so that is now displaying
their shipping method UPS ground when
they place this order it's going to show
up in your store so let's actually place
this order click continue and now here's
our whole thing order review we bought
this keyboard it's expensive and it is
1334 shipping grand total place orders
the last button you click before order
submitted and since I selected cash
because that's an option in here it's
not going to make me put in any sort of
information this is going to expect that
I'm sending cash in this order isn't in
a ship until that cash arrives however
you know that's another thing if you're
thinking about your store if you want to
accept cash like that or not you could
have all sorts of orders come through
and people in every even going to send
cash so you just want to you know be
cognizant of that you know ok so this
order is purchased let's click continue
shopping it's going to keep you you know
take you right back here to the front of
the store let's go to our store to go to
orders and let's check that out it's
under sales orders
here it is came through and select two
pending okay and if we go to our
dashboard it's going to come in here
only after its through when it's no
longer pending last five orders is right
here one dollar one item and that's our
grand total okay cool
so in the next lesson we're going to go
over what happens no let's say an order
comes in on your store what are you
going to do okay and then we'll go over
tax and a whole bunch of other stuff I
mean there's there's absolutely time to
go over Magento heads all sorts of great
options and is a really great platform
so if you have any questions or comments
please leave a comment of the video and
it's a bit toward our level up Tut's let
us know what you're thinking
once again this is Scott and thanks for
