of Tut's and today I'm gonna show you my
favorite new sublime text plugin and
this is called color highlighter color
highlighter is going to make your life a
lot easier in some subtle ways that are
going to have a big difference in how
you look at your CSS so check it out I'm
going to show you color highlighter
right now so now this is going to be a
quick one because the package we're
looking for requires basically no
configuration and handles a lot of great
stuff for us involving how we visually
look at our code so you might be looking
at your CSS and you'll see a hex value
and this value just sort of looks like
it just no it's just numbers and maybe
you have some of them memorized I mean
I'd have you know the standard one sort
of just in your brain because you use
them all the time but to be honest I
have no idea what these colors are just
by glancing at them so along comes a
really super incredible package for
sublime text called color highlighter so
to get this we just have to use our
package manager package control and type
in color and there's quite a bit of
color color coder color highlighter
color picker
of course I color picker is going to
bring in like what you'd expect a color
picker but what we're looking for is
color highlighter and it might not seem
like this is going to be super useful at
first but color highlighter what it does
is it underlines all of your hex values
with the actual color that the value is
and better than that when you click on
it it highlights your hex value in that
color you'll notice that it doesn't work
when I highlight the whole bit of text
but when you click on the hex value or
the color itself it shows you the color
of all of these hex values and it even
shows you obviously the text values here
so that's pretty great but you might be
thinking well I use sass and and that
doesn't necessarily help me out a ton
well let's see what happens when we
apply this to assess variable so let's
go ahead I'm going to copy this color
and I'm gonna make this color into a
variable that's just going to be X
an accent is going to be equal to this
value you'll have said after I save my
file not only is the hex value
underlined in our color but so is the
variable accent xn is now registered as
having this color so when we go ahead
and use accent down here you'll notice
that the color highlighting once saved
is applied throughout so any time we use
accent it's going to be getting the
right color of blue now if we were to
change this to something different like
let's just do 0 0 FF 0 0 which is this
ugly green you can see instantly once we
save the file everywhere in our document
accent is now underlined green so you if
you're changing your variables in sass
or anything like that you can now see
exactly what all of these colors are
with color highlighter it's super cool
and honestly since installing it I don't
know what I've done without it so I
thought I'd pass it along to everyone
