up Tut's and today we're gonna be
creating a sub theme for Omega and we're
going to be doing this the recommended
way which is using dress now if you
don't have dress installed please check
out the level of Tut's drupal tutorial
on installing drush it's a lot easier
than you might think we make it really
nice and painless and that way you'll
make sure you have the latest version of
drush now I'm on the dress version 7 I
believe so if I type drush version it's
gonna say 7.0 and you want to make sure
you have the latest version of drush
available because older versions of
drush don't have these Omega commands
now you can see if you have these Omega
commands by typing in drush help and
then two hyphens filter equals Omega and
it's going to give you the Omega
specific commands if it tells you
there's no commands here then you either
don't have the latest version or you
need to clear your drush cache now if
you have the latest version and you're
still not seeing this type drush CC
drush and this is going to clear your
dress cache then you can probably run
this dress help filter Omega and see
these commands here again I'm on version
7 so make sure you have the latest
version now so I have drush I'm gonna do
command K here to just clear clear the
view here so I'm gonna type LS here and
you can see we're in our projects root
directory so you can see this is a new
site because I still haven't removed in
of these install that txt files from
anything like that I'll make sure to do
that
but we want to go ahead and tape that
drush command to see those what those
drush commands were exactly so we type
drush help - - filter equals Omega is
the same command we just ran and you can
see what commands are available to us
now we don't really care about any of
these right now except for Omega wizard
which guy
see through creating a sub-theme you
could do Omega something but this Omega
wizard is going to be a guide for you so
why not take the guide we're gonna type
drush and then omega - wizard enter now
it's gonna say enter the name of your
new something we're gonna say level up
Omega enter and now it wants a
machine-readable so we can just hit
enter and if we just hit enter it's
going to take the level up Omega and
make it lowercase and convert the spaces
to underscores like you see right here
now of course if we wanted to have
something more specific we could type it
ourselves I don't really need anything
more specific I'm just gonna hit enter
now it's asking what the base thing is
we have two examples we have home and we
have Omega ohm is an already sub theme
of Omega and it's really just a
demonstration so it's free to see what
the best practices are that sort of
thing now we want to use - which is
omega so we want to just use normal
Omega so let's hit enter and it's going
to ask you to choose a starter kit and
there's only one starter kit that comes
though mega now you may be we're used to
the last version that had an html5
starter kit and all this stuff because
of the project growing as Omega grew but
because Omega 4 is fresh we just have
one starter kit so we can hit one enter
and now it's asking where we want this
sub theme to be placed now we want the
site to be in just the site's all folder
so we're just going to hit and one here
and then enter now if we wanted this
installed inside of the parent theme we
would slug parent theme we do not and
we're not using an installation profile
so we're not going to hit - and now
choose a site we want this installed in
all because this is not a multi-site
it's just all and do you want to keep
the starter kits readme files you know
what we don't need those so we can hit
No
and you want to enable your new theme so
let's click why because we want to see
our new theme in action and do you want
to make your new theme the default theme
why again enter and now it's beginning
to do a whole bunch of nice stuff
downloading a whole bunch of latest
versions of products or projects and we
have successfully created the level up
Omega theme cool
so let's come to our website now and if
we refresh you can see it's enabled it
for us our level of Omega default theme
is here and if we get out of this window
which I want to turn that overlay off
anyways you can see something very
different from Omega 3 and Omega 3 you
had these block regions as debugging
this resize me thing now we have
something that's really bare-bones here
we have some region debugging stuff it's
everything's in one column and there's a
lot of white going on but we have an
Omega theme and it's enabled and
everything's good so in the next video
we're going to show you how you can
create this theme without brush now like
I said before using dress is a wonderful
thing and you should really attempt to
get that working and you will see much
benefit from that of course so try using
dress last last-ditch effort if you
really can't get it working you can
install it without and we're going to do
that in the next video so once again
this is Scott with level up tuts and
thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
