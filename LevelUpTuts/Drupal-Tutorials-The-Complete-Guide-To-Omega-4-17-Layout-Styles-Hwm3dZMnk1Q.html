level of huts and today we're gonna be
continuing talking about Omega layouts
by making our layout more portable right
so the idea here is we're going to have
a bunch of layouts or maybe as many
layouts as you need and you can reuse
them you can modify them you can take
ones that exist and modify them be their
way you can drop them into projects and
they're still going to work right now
that's not going to happen with the
layout we created and that's
specifically because we put our grid
style sheets in our style dad scss here
they are defining our actual grids bands
and they're not portable like that it's
just not portable so how can we change
this to make this better well we can
define using lay out specific style
sheets and that makes things really
flexible now it doesn't add more files
and it makes things a bit more complex
but in the end it's definitely worth it
because what you're able to do with
these layouts okay so the first thing we
need to do is we need to create some
files I feel like that always happens
right we've got to create some files and
inside of our SAS folder we can create a
layout folder so let's do a new folder
and they met layouts just like we did
inside of our theme before and now we're
going to create another folder one more
folder and this is going to be the name
of our layout which was sidebar notice
how we have this pattern here of layouts
in the name of layout now let's create
some files we're going to create three
SAS files one's going to be sidebar and
then dot layout dot well this is just
going to be sidebar Jos CSS and for some
reason i'm typing this instead of saving
the file name is that ok sidebar layout
des CSS perfect now we need to create a
nun of new file and this is going to be
sidebar
and then we can say that layout dot no
hyphen query because remember we want to
have these no query CSS files and with
layouts you're going to have to have a
separate note query layout file if you
want to do that if not if you don't if
you're not using no query just just stop
and you don't have to create that and
now we're going to have another one and
this is going to be themed specific so
uh you can name this really whatever you
want i'm going to call this level hyphen
sidebar that layout dot s CSS ok so
sorry these are long and i want to make
sure typing them correctly so now we
have these 3s CSS files now if we go to
our CSS you'll see that there's a layout
folder and our three CSS files have been
generated now this is important because
now we need to tell our theme to use
these CSS files now there's two places
we're going to do that and you might be
wondering why there's two places well
here let me break it down we have two
different types of s CSS files
associated with this layout we have the
sidebar layout SCSS in the sidebar that
layout no query data CSS and these are
the sidebar lay out specific CSS files
right so these files are the ones that
are going to move along with your layout
wherever it goes the other one is the
level hyphen sidebar jaleo CSS and now
this file is actually going to be a
theme specific CSS for this layout right
so these can be things like background
colors on specific elements basically
things that are part of the layout sort
of part of the layout but not part of
the grid you know the display of the
layout I guess you could say the layout
of the layout so the the level up
sidebar
scss is essentially an additional style
sheet for your modifications to this
layout for this particular theme okay so
we need to say in our layout we want to
use these two files and then we want to
say in our theme we want to use this
file so let's check this out this is
nice and easy we're going to come to our
sidebar layout ink and we can do another
semicolon and type in styles and in here
we're going to say style sheets and then
all and then nothing inside of the next
bracket equals and now we're going to
give the path to our style sheets so we
have CSS hyphen layouts hyphen sidebar
hyphen and then we had sidebar lay out
that CSS all right making sure a spell
everything correctly and I'm just going
to copy this paste in one below and
change this to sidebar hyphen or was it
sidebar layout dot no hyphen query just
like that cool so now our our theme is
going to be loading these style sheets
only with this particular layout so
before we had our grid stuff defined in
our normal styles right down here but we
don't want to do that because we need to
have these accessible everywhere so
let's grab all of our grid stuff for
this particular sidebar theme that we
had come up with before so this should
be all of it ok and I'm going to just
deal that right out of here and I'm
gonna throw it into the sidebar layout
SCSS now there's one thing you should
know about this before we do anything we
need to include some stuff up top here
and that's because right now if we tried
to compile this sasabe like I have no
idea what break point
is so we need to import some stuff so
just like we did before we can import
some stuff so many compass we need break
point we need singularity and then it's
nice to have our variables well we sort
of need our variables because that's
where tab and desk are but so keep in
mind how we're doing this import we're
importing and we're saying go back to
directories than variables and then
everything in front of it so dot dot
forward slash forward slash variables
for / and then we're saying asterisks
all up in there so anything we're
globbing the subfolders just like we
were before now if we save this okay
let's save this this is going to be
compiled to our sidebar layout right
here perfect and we come into our page
we refresh you notice that this is
currently not getting the Styles it's
because we've made some changes to our
ink file so we're going to want to clear
the cache but you'll see that's a good
sign because it's pulled these styles
out of our main stylesheet they don't
exist we refresh and of course here is
our layout CSS just like we had it
before if we do this inspecting it's
nice and responsive just like how we
made it cool so we now have a layout
that is more modular right so we can
take this CSS file and just throw it
into any other project and it's still
going to have the same layout as long as
as it's getting you know the correct
variables right okay so now we need
still do our note query and far no query
it's going to be the same as before
we're just going to give it basically
the breakpoint no query variables that
we wanted and we're going to say import
quotes we're going to give this side bar
dot layout just so reimport this and
does its thing okay okay so I'm going to
wrap this video up here in the next
video is going to be a quick one and
we're going to show you how to have
themed specific style sheets for your
particular layout using this level
hyphen sidebar layout SCSS so check out
the next video as always this is scott
with level of Tut's and thanks for
