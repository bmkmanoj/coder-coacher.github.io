up tuts and today I'm going to show you
how to do some more advanced stuff with
the exposed filters that we showed
before in the past couple of tutorials a
few tutorials ago I showed you how to
use these exposed filters that allow you
to filter out your different pieces of
content and views so I have this one
here here's all my projects and let's
say I just want to see development we
can click apply in here there here's all
the development once I have uploaded
here okay let's go back to any we'll
click apply and okay we're back to all
of them okay so it's pretty cool um but
it's sync you know it's not that it's
not necessarily the nicest system you
have to select and then click apply we
can do this all sorts of ways that is if
we're using this better exposed filters
module and this certainly allows for a
better exposed filter so I'm going to
click downloads get the latest version
of it thrown in my modules just like
always and okay we'll just drag this
over here modules okay cool alright
let's go to our modules page refresh
this and search for it better exposed
filters okay we're just going to enable
this and now let's go to our view and
let's edit that view that we're on here
I'm just going to click this edit view
and so some of the things that this
allows you to do it allows you to change
the style so right now we have it as a
select list and our our options were
limited before is a auto fill or select
list but what if you wanted something
like links or you wanted checkboxes this
sort of allows you to do that so under
the Advanced tab here you'll notice this
exposed form settings exposed form style
is set to basic and settings here we'll
click this basic and we're going to
select this to be better exposed filters
okay and now these are the settings for
a better exposed filters you can change
the text on the submit button if you'd
like you can include a reset button you
can
those sorts label ascending descending
okay cool but the thing I want most is I
wanted to auto-submit and this is a
great feature if you check this box here
it hides the submit button and anytime
you make a selection it automatically
will filter these for you so you don't
have to click apply so that's really
nice I'll check this one and now if we
come down here
here's your expose filter settings if
these are our our categories expose list
if you had a multiple exposed filters
per view you would have more of these
down here they would just be underneath
each other here but since we just have
this one for categories this is it so
let's check this as you can see there
are different options here you can have
it be checkboxes nested checkboxes radio
buttons links and hidden let's do
checkboxes and we'll click apply to all
displays we'll save this and I'll check
this out so now we have these checkboxes
here they're radio buttons I think
because we haven't selected to only
allow one filter at a time if we would
say hey you can do multiple filters
these would be checkboxes and I'll show
you that in a second but right now as
you can see whenever I check a new one
it's automatically loading in this new
content for us it's a Jack sing it in
here super cool okay cool well let's
let's change these two checkboxes let at
the view and then under our exposed
filter settings sorry project type
exposed allow multiple selections apply
save and now we should see checkboxes
here so now it's giving us the option of
which one we want I want to see
animation and tutorials okay here they
are cool well let's actually do one more
we'll go to edit view and we're going to
have this be just the links because
actually like that setting then you can
do some cool stuff and you could style
it up I'm going to select links here and
click apply we'll save this and you'll
see it's just text links here if we
click animation it's animation
development development and because we
have multiple selected you can see that
they're just adding here we would want
that reset button if if we have this
multiple selections so let's turn off
the multiple selections for now and I
want it to just be so they can see one
thing I don't necessarily need them to
be able to have that much control over
it
okay so let's select animation here okay
here's our animation click tutorials
development as you can see it's only
allowing one at a time so here we have
filtering you can have a lot more
control over how you're filtering and we
can then further style these and do
anything we want with them I actually
like this a lot better than the Select
list clicking apply it's a lot less
tedious for the users and allows you to
have a little bit more unique layouts or
you interactions with the visitors on
your site okay well that's how you use
better exposed filters to really get
some great functionality out of your
exposed filters and views once again
