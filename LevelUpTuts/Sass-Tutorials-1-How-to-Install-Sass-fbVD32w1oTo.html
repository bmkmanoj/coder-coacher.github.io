level up Tut's and today I'm going to be
talking about SAS and what SAS is is
it's a really interesting extension of
css3 and it adds all sorts of cool
features to css3 that will really make
your life a little bit easier in all
sorts of ways so some of the stuff it
adds it adds variables which are really
important because let's say you want to
give this color blue and you're using it
all over your site and then at the last
second somebody changes that so you have
to go in all of the places that you have
declared that color of blue and change
them by hand
what's great Bice about sets is you can
have a variable blue and assign it to
whatever value would like and then you
can go and use that all over on your CSS
document and then if you need to change
it you only have to change it in one
spot there's also some really great
functions that go along with variables
that we're going to get into in the
variables tutorial
there's also nesting which saves you a
ton of time so instead of having to
write CSS long out like you would here
you can nest things inside of other
things and it saves you a ton of typing
and just a ton of time overall mix-ins
are sort of like variables but with
larger groups of CSS you can use mix-ins
to declare you know a whole group of
things and then and then head it to
something later basically allowing you
to reuse code in all sorts of ways and
changing it with variables it's really
powerful is very exciting there's also
selector and heritance so it allows you
to you know reuse CSS properties without
duplicating them it's it's it's very
powerful as well you know sass is just a
all-around great tool to use and I found
it really you know helping you know
write CSS really quickly and it's just
really really great ok so to have to
install sass you need to install Ruby
gems I'm not going to go over install
rubygems in this tutorial I'll you know
make a separate video for that if needed
if you don't have ruby gems installed I
would you can go to rubygems.org and
then follow the download and
installation instructions here and this
will install ruby gems if you want to
check to see if you have ruby gems
installed open up your terminal and type
gem and then - V and it will give you a
version if you have gems installed if
not it will say command gem not found so
I have gems installed I want to install
SAS because I know that uh I don't have
admin privileges in this account I'm
going to have to sudo or also you know
I'd get an error saying I don't have the
privileges to install this so as you can
see at the top of SAS - Lang comm it
just says gem install SAS we're going to
do sudo gem install SAS it's going to
ask for my password give it that take a
second here and ok it's going to say
successfully installed sets three point
one point four one four and then it's
going to go through and install some
documentation this will just take a
second it might take a little bit longer
on yours I've actually already installed
SAS on this computer so I'm not exactly
sure the time difference however it
shouldn't take that long and as long as
you don't see an error it should be fine
alright so this is done we want to make
sure that SAS installed so we'll do SAS
- your V it's going to say you'll have
SAS three point one point one for brainy
Betty which is the latest release ok so
now I'm going to show you how to use SAS
in its most basic we're not going to get
into any CSS right now but I will show
you how to get SAS running so we're
going to change into my desktop and if
you notice I have a file that's style
dot s CSS and what this is is it's just
a blank document
that's style s CSS so when you are
writing your sass the s CSS document is
the one that you will be editing and
what sass does is it converts it into a
CSS file that your browser can read so
what we need to tell sass to do is we
need to tell it to watch that s CSS file
and anytime that there's a change made
and needs to update the style that CSS
actually when you tell it to watch the
first time it's going to create that CSS
file so I'm just going to get rid of the
one I have here already so if you notice
at the top of sash - Lang com
it gives you your command right here so
we can do sass - - watch style dot s CSS
so this is a file that you're watching :
style dot CSS and this is the file that
it's going to be changing it into so
when you hit enter it's going to say
sass is watching for changes press ctrl
C to stop and it says overwrite style
that's CSS so you can see this file was
just created on my desktop so in my
style dot s CSS file I'm going to show
you how when you save it it updates
automatically so we're going to add just
a basic class here this is just normal
CSS we're going to do body background
and give it back on a black I'm typing
okay so watch when we hit save and this
it automatically says change detective -
styled a CSS overwrite style.css and now
if we go to our CSS document it'll say
body background black of course because
we didn't have any actual stats there's
going to be no difference but as you can
see it successfully converted your s CSS
file into a CSS file so that's pretty
much it for the first lesson in the next
ones I'm going to be showing you some of
assesses more powerful features and some
of the great things you can do with
variables and
doing all sorts of stuff thanks for
watching again this is Scott with level
up Tut's and see in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
