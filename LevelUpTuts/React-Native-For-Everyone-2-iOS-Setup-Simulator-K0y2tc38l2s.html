last video you should have your editor
open whatever that may be we're using
atom or sublime text reusing vs code
like you are here you should be able to
see the same sort of us okay so at this
point we should be looking at somewhat
the same thing my text that our size is
bumped up so it's going to be looking a
little bit larger than yours but
basically we have our app installed
using create react native app using this
technology called Expo to get things up
and running much much easier so this is
a little bit more awesome than following
the official instructions where we're
having to install a whole bunch of stuff
and sitting around and waiting now if we
want to get this up and running with an
iOS simulator we need to head to the
Apple Store here and we want to type in
Xcode now if you don't have Xcode
installed already you want to make sure
that you have it installed via the app
store here you can see right here it is
a large package so I can guarantee it's
going to take a very long time to
download but after you get it downloaded
installed you'll be using it and all
sorts of ways and you can even use the
simulator in a much different ways so if
you do not have Xcode go ahead and
install it pause this video and wait
until it's done installing okay so now
that Xcode is installed we'll want to
close out the App Store and we're going
to want to make sure that our Xcode
command line tools are installed I'm
going to hit command D this is just an
item thing to split up a new window you
can always open up a new window and it
doesn't matter from what directory
because this is a global thing but we
want to type in Xcode - select - -
install and now it's going to ask us if
it would like to install the Xcode
command-line tools we're going to click
install we're going to click agree and
it's going to grab the latest version
for us if you've ever used git or many
other things you've probably already
installed these so if you get installed
and then we're going to get this fired
up on the simulator okay so now that all
that is installed I'm going to hit ctrl
C on our previous version that was
running over here I'm going to close
this tab out
let me do command K to clear this window
and what we want to run this time
instead of NPM start is NPM run iOS ok
and this is going to start up our
package manager but it's also going to
get this up and running on our simulator
which is NPM start is sort of assuming
that you're running on your device right
running on the Expo app but run iOS is
going to make sure that it gets fired up
in the simulator which obviously only
exists if you installed Xcode or in the
next video we're going to be talking
about NPM run Android which is going to
be able to simulate or you can't shake
it like this because that just flat-out
doesn't work you can click the window we
can come up to hardware and we can do a
shake gesture which you can see is also
this command here which could be control
command Z you can see we takes us here
or we could do like I said shake gesture
brings us up the same information now to
prove that this is in fact our actual
react native application let's head back
to our vs code let's open up app J s and
let's go ahead and check this out you
can see we all have these text tags here
let's go ahead and delete some of these
text tags now if you don't know a whole
lot about react or if you don't know a
lot about react native do not worry
we're going to be going over a lot of
this stuff here but what this is here is
essentially a react component right and
if you've never used a react component
we basically have a class with a render
function and the render function is
what's going to get displayed and then
we have a return statement which is
actually what's going to get displayed
here now inside of our return we have
JSX code which looks a whole lot like
HTML but is a little bit different and
in addition to being different normally
it's even more different within react
native because we don't have like a
paragraph tag or something like that we
have a view tag and a text tag but it
looks like HTML nonetheless let's go
ahead and highlight this open app js2
start working on your app
we can simply type in hello world okay
save this and when we save we can head
back to our simulator and see hello
world already exists so you can see the
immediate benefits of using react native
right here we don't have to paw through
a whole bunch of configuration code and
stuff like that we have what looks like
HTML inside of a class here we even have
some CSS esque styles going on over here
which we'll definitely get into in this
series but as you can see here just like
that we have our app up and running on
the iOS simulator and we don't need to
use any sort of actual device so if you
don't own an iOS device you can
certainly develop an iOS app still okay
so this is getting set up with an iOS
simulator using Xcode create react
native app and expo in the next video
i'm going to be showing you the same
process to get set up and we can use an
android emulator so as always this is
scott with level up tutorials if you
enjoyed this series if you want to learn
more about react native had to store
that level up tutorials calm and you can
purchase the rest of this series where
we're going to dive into really
exploring the very basics of react
native react native is an amazing
platform where you can use your already
useful react skills to build real native
applications and these aren't a webview
with a you know a website running inside
of an app this is a legit application
right here cool so as always check it
out in the next video where to get this
going with android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
