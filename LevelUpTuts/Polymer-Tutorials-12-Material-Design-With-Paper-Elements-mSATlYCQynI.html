tutorials and today we're going to show
you how to use material design using the
paper elements in polymer in this first
video we're just gonna drop some basic
paper elements in there like a paper
button and a paper check box just to see
how easy it is to throw these material
design elements into your art page so
let's get going on that right now so to
implement material design within your
polymer project it's really quite simple
all you have to do is include these
polymer paper elements so you can get to
them by going to elements and then paper
elements here and you can see all of
what they have to offer however if you
wanted to learn a little bit more you
can come to slash Doc's
slash elements slash paper - elements to
HTML here and that'll take you to the
polymer paper elements page where
there's this big get paper elements
button but like we've seen with every
other polymer component all you have to
do is click this it's going to give you
the Bower command to run to make sure
that you have these paper elements
installed since we've been installing
everything with Bower so far we're gonna
continue to do that and just use this
Bower install polymer forward slash
paper - elements so I'm just gonna paste
it in my project hit enter and it's
gonna go ahead and download everything
okay so now that everything has been
downloaded what we can do is simply just
add with the same link scheme that we've
been using before and just copy and
paste this link import into our HTML
document so at the top where we have all
of these other ones we can just throw in
one more and keep in mind that this says
components paper elements well our Bower
components are actually living in this
Bower components folder so we're gonna
go out to make sure that this path is
absolutely correct and I'm going to open
up this Bower components folder just to
make sure that a folder named paper
elements is in here we do in fact have a
folder paper elements cool okay so now
that our paper elements have been
imported we can go ahead and see what
they have to offer now what kind of
things can you use with these paper
well let's check it out if you click on
this paper element sampler link they'll
take you to this page where you can
check out all of the different paper
elements that exist so as you can see we
have things like checkboxes where when
you check them they have this nice
animation and you can see that they have
several examples and these are in
different colors so they're more than
just giving you one or two examples
they're just showing you sort of what
you can do with them so we have these
radio buttons they're in two different
colors we have something like this
toggle button you can see when you click
it it toggles on and off and they're
just showing you them in a couple of
different colors you can also drag this
to turn it on okay now we have things
like inputs which one you select they do
things like this if you have with a
floating label the label is going to
come up top here things like core input
plus floating label auto growing text
area auto growing text area plus
floating label so it's definitely worth
your time to come in here and see all of
these different paper elements let's go
ahead and start throwing some of these
into our page the first thing we want to
do is just quick throw in something like
a check box this is probably going to be
one of the easiest ones because you
simply can just drop it into your
project so let's come back to elements
and let's click on paper elements down
here and let's find check box so it's
under paper - check box okay so now we
have this paper check box we can
actually just drop it in here with this
paper check box element so just like we
have been I'm just gonna paste this into
our project and it's just paper - check
box now when we come to our page and
refresh you'll notice that we have just
a pretty standard check box with nothing
else when you check it you do get that
nice animation and it goes green now
what else can we do with this if we come
back to this paper check box page you'll
notice that you can pass in a default
attribute of checked you can change the
checked state with this
CSS here okay so that was nice and easy
we have this working checkbox here now
another nice little element you can use
are these buttons and these paper
element buttons can sort of be dropped
in there and they can give you this
really nice touch ripple effect like a
lot of things using the material design
specs so let's actually throw one of
these paper buttons in here really quick
and just show you exactly how easy that
is so I'm just gonna copy this paper
checkbox and change this to paper button
like that and once more so we can have
this just the button one and let's save
and see what that gives us just out of
the box okay so nothing really crazy we
have just this text however when you
click on it it does give you that nice
ripple effect but how do we get the
buttons looking like how they have them
here well you'll notice that we can pass
them some attributes things like raised
or no ink removes the ripple effect so
if we just pass in this raised attribute
here just simply like that what it does
is it gives us the whole shadow and it
gives us a certain level of shadow here
and when you click we still get this
ripple effect now in terms of styling
this button you'd want to style this
like any other element using CSS and in
fact they even have some examples here
they can show you that you could just
simply style it like any other dumb
element simply with a class or perhaps
just by defining it and you'll notice
here it says by default the ripples the
same colors the foreground 25% opacity
you may customize this color using this
selector so it's really cool that we can
modify the ripple itself so I'm actually
gonna go ahead and copy this and in our
CSS let's make this a little bit
different so I'm just going to call out
our paper button itself and we're gonna
say paper button and the paper button is
going to have a background of blue
color of white will stick with FFF okay
and let's go ahead and let's go ahead
and define the ripple color so we can
say paper button and then paste this in
so we have our colon colon shadow ripple
and we can define a color here elicits
using this color blue so let's go ahead
and make this something way different
and let's just say it's going to be red
so this is gonna be super ugly and I
just notice I had a two piece in here
pepper so paper button can't fix that
okay so we now have this blue button
when we click it the replica looks
purple because it's a 25% opacity of the
red color and you'll notice if you click
and hold you get to keep that ripple
there so as you can see you can really
modify these buttons with CSS as you see
fit but it's nice that it really comes
with those touch effects that make
material design such like a nice feeling
interface so what other kind of cool
things can we do well there's a lot of
elements here and we're not gonna go
over all of these elements but I think
similar ones are things like these paper
tabs we can go ahead and do so using
paper tabs and paper tab now if we
simply want to add the paper tabs
themselves I like to do is let's
actually just copy and paste this
example that has paper tabs as an
element with selected equal to zero and
then three paper tab elements inside of
here so I'm gonna paste this into our
page just anywhere here pretty much
because we just want to see it in action
and let's tab this over okay great now
let's check this out it in our pages see
what this paper tabs gives you you
notice that we have three tabs here and
since by default they don't have any
color other than this yellow you'll do
notice that we do get this yellow ripple
effect and we do have a slight yellow
underline let's go ahead and actually
make this look a little bit nicer I'm
gonna head over to material colors comm
and grab some of these material UI
colors on
the large colors are for the main colors
and the smaller ones are for accents so
if we pick two let's just say we pick
this blue color when we click it is
copied to the clipboard I'm actually
gonna replace our pager button with this
color as well because I can't really
stand looking at that blue but now what
we want to do is we want to define our
tabs so we can say paper - tabs
background with that blue color now if
we come and refresh you know this is
looking a little bit better we click it
and we get this nice ripple now let's
actually want to change this yellow
color how do we do that so if you come
back to the paper tabs and we scroll
down here the best part about the
polymer documentation is when you want
to find something it's here the CSS is
at the bottom the attributes are just
below that so if you need to be able to
modify any given part of an element you
can do that really easily so as you can
see we have the paper tab shadow we have
the paper tab ink or we have the paper
tabs selection bar okay so now the paper
tabs selection bar is going to be the
sliding bar that we have here so let's
go ahead and I'm gonna actually grab
this whole bit from the semicolons after
that and once more we can type paper -
tabs I'm gonna paste this in here okay
and now we can modify this color let's
actually go ahead back to material
colors and grab something that is going
to be obvious here let's do one of these
this light purple here and let's paste
this in here
okay now when we come back to our page
refresh you'll see that we have this
purple underline and when we click the
ripple is still yellow however on the
paper tabs you'll notice that this ink
ripple color is the exact next thing so
if we wanted to modify that we could but
as you can see here these paper and
material elements right the paper
elements they're not giving you things
like your font they're not interrupting
there but they aren't giving you this
base tab system that has a nice
interaction it has a nice animation and
it feels really good without sort of
getting in the way and I think that's
really important because you want a tool
that helps you but you don't want a tool
that you're constantly having to
override so I highly recommend coming to
the polymer documentation and just going
through these paper elements and just
start throwing them on your page and
modifying them the documentation is all
here and it makes it really nice and
easy to get a good handle on what's
going on here in addition to the paper
elements that we've seen and that you've
seen on the paper elements sampler page
there's also what you can use the actual
material effects so there are material
design effects like the click to ripple
that you can use in your own elements so
in the next video we're gonna show you
how you can drop these effects into your
own elements and get them working on
your custom stuff without having to use
the paper elements themselves so as
always this is Scott with level up
