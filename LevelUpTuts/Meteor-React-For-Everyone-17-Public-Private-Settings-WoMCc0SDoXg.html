up tutorials and in this video we're
going to cover both public and private
settings a settings follower you can
store things like your API keys or just
information that you need to access V
there on the client side or on the
server side so this is going on that now
okay so now that we have some
parameterize routing that we did in the
last video you know I got rid of these
anchor links it's just a technique I
want to show not actually part of this
application right so let's go ahead and
let's talk about the public and private
settings available to us in meteor now
what think we can do is head to our
application and in our meat there are my
resolution so the root of our project
let's go ahead and create a new file now
this new file can be really anything you
want it to be named it can be named
settings it can be named down dev
settings or whatever you can have
multiple ones of these settings files
anyways we can just say settings JSON
goes nice and keep it nice and simple
here and let's go ahead and talk about
what is going on in this file so
settings that JSON is a file that allows
you to have site-wide at variables and
settings that can be either exit
publicly on the client or privately on
the server now all we have to have in
here is an object and inside of this
object we want another object that's
going to with the key of public now
anything in public we do colon anything
with in here is going to be publicly
available for instance let's just say
test and give test a value of hello this
is going to be available on the front
end of our site let's go ahead and just
copy this object put a common here and
paste it in and and in this object
instead of public we're going to have
private now this is going to be set as
pee test okay so private test hello
private okay so this is going to be a
good example you can see just how cool
this file is one thing to note about
your settings JSON file though is do not
commit this file to your repository if
you have API keys or sensitive
information here now this file is great
for storing sensitive information it's
where you want to store all of your API
keys and stuff like that so don't commit
this to your repo you don't want those
keys inside of there if you're working
with github
okay so after that little disclaimer
let's go ahead and actually try to
access one of these variables we can do
that just by coming to our application
what's come here and let's come to our
council and we're going to hit an error
doing this so we can access these
through meteor settings and now we could
say dot public and then obviously we had
a setting that was test now check this
out this will not work right now it's
going to be known to find however what
we need to do is restart our meteor
servers let's head to our command line
let's do ctrl C to stop this and now we
want to say meteor but let's pass this
in with some flags here the flag we want
is hyphen hyphen settings space and then
we need to pass in our settings file so
let's say you had a dev settings file
this would be dev settings since we only
have one it's just settings dot JSON
enter and what meteors going to do now
is it's going to load up your site with
these settings now a lot of people use
this to have multiple settings files for
different settings for production or
development let's say you want a test
api key to be running let's say you have
a ecommerce site like a stripe ecommerce
site or something and you want your test
api key to allow you to do tests
purchases but only on your dev server
well you could have two different
settings files and have your development
settings be loaded this way and then
when you move to production you could
load up your other settings file okay so
we now have our app running and it's
gonna be running with our settings file
let's head back and let's run that same
commandeered settings dot public test
and this time we get output hello now we
remember we had at this other variable
which is private p test let's check this
out we can do settings Dot private dot P
test and keep in mind that this data
saved in the same exact file enter
cannot read p test of undefined private
variables are not available on the
client let's just simply head to any of
these code we'll just do
this one because this file is going to
get loaded no matter what and we can
console dot log and let's say meteor
that settings Dot private dot P test
okay this is going to be the brilliance
of the settings file okay so we're now
Counsell logging this settings from our
private and we're doing this from within
our server folder so this code is only
going to get run server side and you'll
notice if we head to our command line
that's running our actual server we say
hello private whenever the application
restarts so that's pretty sweet right I
mean we now have access to having
information that's withheld from the
client side but can be accessed on the
server cool so this is the meteor
settings file this is a great place to
put things like your Google Analytics
IDs and stuff like that you could put
this in here your API keys your public
keys your test Keys any of that stuff so
only put data that you want to be able
to be able to be made public in your
public settings and information that you
want to be made private in your private
settings cool so as always this is scott
with level up tutorials in the next
video i'm going to show you a great way
to make your site even more secure so
