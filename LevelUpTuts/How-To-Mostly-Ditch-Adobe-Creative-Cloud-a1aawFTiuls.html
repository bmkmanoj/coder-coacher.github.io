showing you how you can mostly ditch
Adobe in 2017 now I say mostly
specifically because there are just some
applications if you're on a one
particular platform that are just maybe
not equally matched in a sort of way by
anything else that's out there and of
course when these when we hit these
things I mean if you know of something
please let me know because in my
research I haven't found anything to
cover some of these bases but for the
most part if you're doing web design and
that sort of stuff for design in general
and if you're staying away from maybe
video topics then you could probably get
away with completely removing Adobe from
your computer now I totally stopped
Adobe a couple of years ago and have not
found the need although I don't work on
a team so I don't need to manage other
people's expectations it's easy for me
to say that you can do this however
obviously can you might want to consult
with your team make sure everyone's on
board before completely uninstalling the
Adobe Creative Suite from your computer
now first and foremost we're going to
get started with probably the most most
widely used Adobe application which is
Adobe Photoshop and basically the best
way to replace Adobe Photoshop is with
affinity photo you can come to affinity
serif comm and you can see a selective
suite of some of their app witches
affinity photo as well as affinity
designer now we're going to want to go
to the desktop version now this is
available for Mac and PC for a one price
of $49 okay so one of the reasons I
liked to ditch Adobe was because they
got the subscription model right I don't
want to pay every year if the app is
getting incremental updates right so
affinity photo is a one-time purchase
they take a little dig at Adobe by
saying no subscription here just $49 buy
from Mac buy for Windows and if you're
wondering does this stand up to
Photoshop the answer is rough for the
most part absolutely you know there's
some weird sort of edge case Photoshop
features that this thing does not do I
believe lyrics
like 3d image editing I'm pretty sure it
doesn't do stuff like that but Photoshop
never did that stuff very well anyways
and if you're using this for photos this
does photos very well and the interface
is going to be nice and familiar
obviously it's not Photoshop so it's not
going to be the exact same however in
terms of using this ones you get sort of
the lay of the land affinity photo is a
great great replacement for Photoshop
you can even open PSD files in affinity
photo here and they work very very well
and best part cross-platform Windows or
Mac I liked to see that because
obviously with some of these things you
know there isn't a cross-platform
solution and you might need to look
elsewhere for that but you know watch
this affinity photo download the demo
download some of their examples you're
going to be immediately impressed with
how easy and nice this application is
like I said just a plus right this is
this is the gold standard for Adobe
replacement apps affinity photo okay now
next up we have illustrator which is
another highly used application now
illustrator can be replaced by several
applications one of which you can get to
without even leaving this affinity site
which is affinity designer now I
personally do not use affinity designer
it's $49 but it is very nice and if you
look at this video you can watch this
video you can see you have access to
things like symbols textile style
improvement constraints asset management
there's UI kits and stuff like that this
is definitely aiming to be an
illustrator replacement and it does a
great job of that so head over to
affinity dot serif com keep in mind none
of these companies are paying me
anything to say anything about their
apps here I just these this is stuff
that I've used and I've liked you could
see there's some nice grip tools here we
have like that
isometric grid brush work even a lot of
just great great vector stuff so
affinity designer is a great place for
your vector work that you need to do so
this is affinity designer like I said
head over check out all their features
this page is really nice that's the
thing one of the things I really like
about this company is all of their
software is really well designed now
next way of a non cross-platform
solution which is a sketch now many
people know that I'm a big fan of sketch
I have many many videos of it on my
channel it's basically a no frills
editor for vector stuff primarily
focused on designing for user experience
web stuff like that so you're probably
not going to get into this to do maybe
like character design and stuff like
that like maybe you would affinity
design you can see there examples are a
little bit different here so sketch is a
great option if you're doing a UX design
however big issues only Mac only Mac
compatible and that's really it's really
a bummer because it's I feel like I feel
like sketches audience could have grown
significantly if they would have topped
at the windows by now but as you can see
there still is no option as far as I
know there's nothing on the roadmap
another bummer here is that you pay $99
but then you do have to subscribe to a
license if you want to continue to get
updates again that that did then a USB I
used to be another bummer here but for
$99 this application super nice download
the free trial check it out now lastly
we have a third that I really really
really like and what's great about this
application is its web-based so we have
figma which you can get to it figma
dot-com which is another user interface
prototyping in vector based design
platform now this would be seen as like
a replacement for Illustrator or if
you're still doing design in Photoshop
it would you it would replace that but
basically it's for web and UX design it
makes things really easy you can have
symbols you can have your own team
library of symbols and this application
is in super super active development it
emphasizes team work and it's seeing
updates constantly one of my new
favorite applications and I will be
doing a full-on tutorial series on Sigma
because it's just that good now one of
the cool things about figma is that
because it's web-based you can sign in
and you can use it anywhere you could
use it in the browser it also has a
and PC version so there's both desktop
versions for Mac and PC or of course you
can use it just in your browser and
everything's synced to the cloud so you
good access to your files anywhere so
again this might not be the most
appropriate example if you are trying to
do
maybe illustrative work like this but if
you're doing web stuff which a lot of
people use illustrator for figma is
definitely my new hot pick because of
its crops
cross-platform is its eagerness to
update and improve and all of the great
stuff that's coming with it you'll be
seeing a lot more of this application in
the future I promise you
so that is illustrator and Photoshop now
next up we have InDesign which is sadly
one of the ones that I'm not able to
truly replace now the good news is is I
have never opened and designed
intentionally in so many years of
working on the web so I I know there's a
large portion of people that still use
InDesign for laying out books and lots
of stuff like that I'm not sure that's
going to change the good news is if
you're working on the web chances are
you haven't used InDesign very much
anyways so if you know a great InDesign
alternative something hopefully that's
cross-platform let me know I was not
able to find anything that I really
liked now next up we have Lightroom now
Lightroom you could have potentially
replaced by aperture my Apple but it
they cancelled basically support and
stopped updating aperture in 2015 and
hasn't really been a great piece of
software to use in a very long time it's
one of those things that you would use
it if you really needed the
functionality from Lightroom but you
know in all honesty I said I'm not a
professional photographer so I can't
totally speak on the every one to one
feature existing in other applications
but I'm gonna head back to affinity
photo once more because affinity photo
has some really excellent Roth photo
capabilities and it has sort of the same
kind of development workflow where
you're bringing in your RAW files and
you want to develop them and modify them
before working on them like normal
photos or something like that in a
similar way that you would - with light
the only difference is is that I don't
believe there's any sort of like
cataloguing like there is in Lightroom
now like I said not a professional
photographer I have not used Lightroom
in that regard however if I needed the
high-end photo editing like I would in
Lightroom using RAW files and stuff like
that affinity photo is certainly super
nice and in all honesty I would probably
manage my photos somewhere else bring
them into affinity to edit anyways okay
so here we have a replacement which is
not one-to-one features for Lightroom
but does the things the Lightroom could
do now next we have Adobe Premiere Pro
now if you want to go something Apple
based I do love Final Cut Pro X in a way
that most people don't Final Cut Pro X
especially in the latest version has
gotten a lot better I know when it first
came out people really skeptical of it
there are some things in this program
that once you get good at it will really
save you some time but the learning
curve is a little bit there because
Final Cut Pro X does not feel like
premiere and it does not feel like Final
Cut Pro 7 or any of the older versions
but like I said when you can get over
that hump of the learning curve Final
Cut Pro X certainly is one of those
applications that can make your life a
lot better now if you're not into Apple
you want something cross-platform you
want something more like premier head
over to Blackmagic Design comm and what
we're looking at is DaVinci Resolve now
DaVinci Resolve as you can see down here
and my drawer here is an application I
really like it's a newcomer it sort of
steps up to the plate we're in a world
controlled by avid Final Cut Pro and
premier is sort of saying hey you know
there's room for a new video editor so
as you can see here this application the
designs on point everything looks really
nice it's a linear editor has really
nice color tools which was actually
there focused before turning into a
video editor and as you can see there's
even some really nice councils if you
need this for professional video editing
so check out da Vinci resolve here
what's cool is that you can even install
a pretty nice trial of this on your
computer and give it a give it a run I
really liked it I'm using the beta which
is a beta so it's not super stable but
overall everything is really super nice
about it and if I'm not using Final Cut
Pro or I switch off a Mac at any given
point I feel like this is the
application that would turn into my
number one editor so check out da Vinci
resolve by a black magic design like I
said really nice website really nice
stuff here and yeah so that's really it
for video editing now the last one is
After Effects which really it is my
biggest problem of finding a replacement
application you have things like nuke
now nuke is a compositing software it
doesn't really do the same thing as
After Effects but it does compositing
really well so then you can remove that
from your After Effects pipeline but
like for me I use After Effects mostly
for motion design and I haven't found a
great alternative to it I find myself
wanting to just use After Effects even
though I don't want to keep Adobe
installed now there is an alternative
which would be Apple motion 5 which
motion is great but again I personally
do not find this to be a proper
replacement that's it tons of
professionals use motion every single
day professionally and get some really
nice motion graphics out of it the only
bummer is it does not work on PC and
really only plays nice with Final Cut
Pro so if your is in Final Cut X and you
want to add some motion graphics then
motion is a great solution for that but
if you're looking for just straight-up
motion graphic software that will play
nice with anything yeah good luck I was
not able to find anything that was
correctly fitting all the stuff I like
to do with After Effects now lastly is
experience design which is a new sort of
application which does prototyping and
stuff like that and I'm heading back to
figma for this figma offers a lot of
nice features here including prototyping
stuff we have commenting where you can
have
maids comment on files you can go into
presentation mode and show your stuff
off this is an application I really like
if you couldn't tell from all of that I
was gushing about it earlier now there's
a ton of little periphery apps that
obviously I'm not covering here but I
hope I hit on all the major ones you
know nothing against Adobe their
products have been amazing for so many
years however they're also bloated heavy
expensive an annual subscription and
take up a ton of room on your computer
and it tried to do too much so that said
nothing against them personally I've
just found replacing them with these
applications there's a little bit more
focused and maybe a little bit more
hungry to improve have definitely
improved my workflow and my overall life
so if you want to head to any of these
websites I'll put all the links in the
description of this video so you can
check these out like I said no
affiliations with these companies
although I did do some of the videos on
sketches learned page regardless it's
one of my favorite apps so check it out
head to the description if you want
