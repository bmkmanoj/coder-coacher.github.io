up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be giving a bit of an introduction
into what figma is why you might want to
use it and what it offers that is
totally unique to figma in addition
we're also gonna get it installed and
open it up and basically show you figma
so let's get started right now
so in this series I'm going to be going
over all of the figmas major features
and showing you a lot of great tips and
tricks along the way you might be
confused you might not know exactly what
figma is capable of or what it is even
and so in this video I'd like to answer
sort of the what and why a figma and
we'll get started with it basically
figma is a great design application it's
cross-platform so you can use it on
Windows Mac and Linux or even in the
browser and the actual native download
versions are available for Windows or
Mac it's an app that would replace
things like sketch or illustrator or
even some user prototyping applications
which we'll get into exactly what these
prototyping features in figma art but
they're pretty darn awesome so if you
head to figma com you can see exactly a
lot of these features there's a whole
section on features but what sets figma
apart from the others is sort of the
collaboration and team environment of it
all in addition to some really excellent
features that are just growing all of
the time so for instance collaboration
on a file as you can see in this little
animated video here is really super easy
multiple people are working on the same
design you could actually even leave
comments in and have things marked to be
resolved
you can copy CSS directly out of this
application and what are the cool things
about this app that I really like is how
they handle components which are
analogous to sketches symbols where you
can create your sort of library of your
own components right however these
components can be shared across your
team across projects across files and
they can be extended and elaborated on
really super easy fact we're gonna be
going over a lot of stuff regarding
components within figma we're gonna just
talk about why they're so awesome
because they are certainly awesome so
you want to head to figma calm and what
you can do here is is you can either
sign in or sign up if you're going to be
using the browser version or we can
actually grab the downloadable versions
if you just head to the bottom of this
page and select downloads they'll give
you the option here to download the
installer for the desktop app or the
windows app in addition if you're gonna
be using this in the browser and you
want all of your local thoughts to show
up you're gonna want to go ahead and
download the font installers as well now
keep in mind there's also this figma
mirror for iOS and for Android which is
an excellent thing if figma definitely
prioritizes cross-platform stuff so you
actually have a mirror app for Android
instead of only for iOS and the app
works on Windows instead of only OSX now
the videos in this series are all going
to be done on a Mac however everything
should be applicable on a Windows
computer as well so let's go ahead and
click desktop app I'm gonna grab the one
for Mac OS and we can get that
downloaded now as you can see we've just
gotten a figment app that we can go and
drag to our applications I already have
this installed so I'm not going to
bother but it's really easy we don't
have to run any sort of installers just
sort of drag this to our applications
and we're ready to go so let's pop open
figma and see what happens when we load
it up okay so as you can see here we're
greeted with a sign-in form I'm going to
enter my information to sign in if you
do not have an account already you're
gonna want to go ahead and click the
Create account button a free basic
account is free and you can use that to
really do anything you'd like to do in
figma so as you can see here I have
logged in and I have a whole bunch of
designs here you will be greeted with
some of these designs some of these are
ones that I've been working on a whole
bunch already we have things like sample
files we have the same figma keyboard
shortcuts if you pop this open now here
you can actually see the real Figment
keyboard shortcuts in an actual document
that well is totally editable and
viewable just like any other document
which I found to be a really cool way to
give up some of the features of figma
here is to include a file that's not
only useful and seeing how files work
but also useful with the in
information it contains okay so here you
can see that this opened this file and a
new tab up top for us we can close this
tab and head back to our file browser
and our file browser is basically the
main page of figma here where you'll see
all of your recent files drafts deleted
files your teen stuff any sort of files
that you've shared amongst your team or
projects that you shared amongst your
team you can see I have a whole bunch of
random stuff in here you may even
recognize the level up thumbnails this
is where I designed my thumbnails as
well as do design concepts for the level
up site so as you can see I actively use
figma all the time that's my main design
application at this point and I really
super enjoy it so if you want to follow
along in the next video we're going to
talk about the interface of figma sort
of overview of what's going on and where
you could find things especially if
you're coming from another design
application I'll be doing a lot of sort
of analogous to Sketch sort of things
showing you what you can find where
because figma although it is the same in
a lot of ways
however the interface is different in
some key ways and you're gonna want to
know where to find everything so fire up
the next video where we go over exactly
where to find everything in figmas
interface if you would like to get this
entire series master figma become the
master of figma you wanna head to store
that level of tutorials and purchase
this entire series or become a LevelUp
pro as a level of pro you get access to
stream all of the content on the site
and there's a whole bunch of free
exclusive series and there's going to be
more exclusive series every single month
on all sorts of design and development
topics so as always thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
