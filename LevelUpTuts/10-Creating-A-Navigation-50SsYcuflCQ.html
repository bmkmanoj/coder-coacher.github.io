up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be showing you how we can start
building our navigation now this is
gonna be an introduction to some new
elements like an unordered list a nav
element a list item we're going to show
you how we can get those looking a
little bit more like what we'd expect
from a navigation so let's get going on
that right now but now that we've
learned a little bit about linking
things let's go ahead and build our
sites navigation so we can come in to
our HTML and first thing we want to do
is let's go ahead I'm gonna get rid of
this Google link I'm gonna keep the
about for now however I'm going to add a
new element called nav now a nav is a
new element in HTML 5 to let you know
that this is an navigation section of
your website now inside of nav we can
have an unordered list because
essentially what we're going to have
here is an unordered list of links so
it's going to be a list of links because
they're not ordered it's a ul so now
inside of it the you else we need list
items so Li stands for list item and as
you can see here we have now one list
item inside of our unordered list so
let's go ahead and take this navigation
link this about link and let's put
inside of this list item here now what
we can do is copy this line add a new
one and we can change this about to home
now we can change the link to be the
correct page which is just index dot
HTML okay so we now have two links
inside of our navigation let's come here
and check it out on our website cool so
we now have a unordered list you can see
we have home and about they'll take us
to the right pages however we have some
weird things going I don't know how many
websites you've ever seen that have
navigation that sort of looks like a
dotted list here not to mention we also
have these underlined purple or blue
links that are sort of the default color
so this is all
sort of wrong this is not what we want
those first head to our HTML and add a
class on our nav and this can just say
class main nav okay and I'm gonna copy
this class I'm gonna come to our CSS
here now I can say dot main nav then
inside of brackets we could add our
Styles since I want to actually affect
the UL right now what I want to do is
say dot main nav unordered list and then
brackets from here we can have a
property called list-style:none so
list-style:none I finished out for the
semicolon like so what this does is it
basically says for this list you know we
have these bullet points maybe we have
disks or we have dashes or something
like that well we don't want any sort of
list style so when we refresh you can
see that those bullet points are gone
now the next thing we want to do is we
want to make each one of these items an
inline block well we can do that by
adding display:inline to the list item
and we could do that and we could add
display block to each individual link
itself let's come to our list I'm gonna
copy this property here I'm gonna say no
you will Li and I'm gonna actually put
this ul L hi now in here I can go ahead
and say I can say display inline now we
went over a display inline first display
block a little bit ago and what you'll
see is that now instead of taking up
their own line each one of these list
items when we refresh is going to be on
its own line now they're pushed over
here a little bit let's go ahead and see
why we can inspect this element by
right-clicking on it and we hover over
ul and you see there's some default
information here we have some default
padding and some default margin on this
unordered list that we're not super
excited about having I didn't tell it to
be there it's just the default for list
so we can come in here and we can say
padding and zero and margin is also
going to be zero that's going to remove
the margin and padding on the list we
can refresh okay
now let's get to work on these actual
links themselves we want to go ahead and
say let's copy this line here paste it
in and now let's go and add an A to that
chain so what this is saying is saying
any anchor links that are inside of a
list item that's inside of an unordered
list that's in our main navigation let's
go ahead and add some properties one of
which is going to be text - decoration
now text decoration is going to be set
to none this will remove the underline
from the text in addition we're going to
say color and we're gonna want these to
be FFF or white okay so we now have our
first navigation for our website we can
click home we can click about into the
about me takes me to this about page we
can always hit back once we get finished
with this header we're actually gonna
copy this header code right over to our
about page but I don't want to keep
doing that over in time until we're all
done with that and in fact in modern web
development there's actually a lot of
ways around this most of it involves
server-side rendering though so we're
not going to get into that in our first
website however maybe in your second or
third or fourth website we can cover
some of that stuff so in the next video
we're going to be explaining floats
within CSS and what floats can do to
your layouts so as always this is Scott

I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
