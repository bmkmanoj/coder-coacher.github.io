Tut's and today we're going to show you
how to make some content in Drupal 7
I've gone ahead and I went back to
Bartok for our theme I figured that
since not everybody is going to be
staring at the same theme it might be
nice to have something where everybody
can look at ends the exact same so using
Bartok which is the theme that comes as
the base on Drupal 7 we are going to
create a piece of content and now if you
change your theme and you go back and
forth and whatever it's actually not
going to change your content and also
don't worry about that it's just going
to affect the way it looks so if you'll
notice here in the in the Drupal admin
bar there's an add content button
another way to do it is to go to content
and then click this add content here
either one of those will take you to the
same exact place and in here it's going
to give us a choice between an article
and a basic page an article is something
like blog post where a basic page is an
entire page so Drupal doesn't really
distinguish those too much two
differently other than they're both
nodes and a node is a piece of content
that exists on your site think of a node
like a page or just a block of content
so we're going to create a basic page so
here it's going to ask for the title
this is going to be a page that I'm
going to make called about and this is
just going to be about me this page is
about me period okay so you can put in
whatever you want here this is your body
text in the next couple of tutorials
we're going to show you how to have more
than just a title and a body but however
the basic page initial offering is just
title and body and also you'll notice
this is just a blank text area it will
take filtered HTML full HTML or plain
text we're going to use filtered HTML
for now in later tutorials we'll show
you how to install a WYSIWYG and that
stands for what you see is what you get
if you don't know and that puts a top
bar up here that's sort of like
Microsoft Word or Google Docs thing that
if you have content editors that aren't
web developers and
they'll feel much more at home editing
content you know transforming text with
the WYSIWYG than they will in just a
plain text area move they'll have to
write something you know in HTML if they
need it so we're going to go down here
and these are the basic options that are
included so it's going to ask if we want
to provide a menu link because this is
an about page we're going to have this
in our main navigation I want to say yes
click that you can choose your about
link title we're going to leave it as
about you know I don't need a
description well want to say about me
nice and easy we're going to add this to
the main menu if you notice our home our
main link is already in there so we'll
click main menu and it's weight will set
that to be 3 because I don't want it to
be the very top of the list I don't want
to be at the bottom you know we can
adjust the weights later the larger the
number the further down the list it is
and negatives we'll put it higher up the
list okay revision settings we're not
going to be creating a new revision if
you wanted to you would check this you
can leave a log message in here we're
just going to have this publish
straightaway so in URL path aliases
we'll set this up in a little bit right
now we're just not going to worry about
the alias because this isn't about me
page I don't want people commenting on
it as you can see the default on Drupal
basic pages is set to closed if you go
to articles the basic setting will be
set to open but for now we're just going
to leave this closed we don't want
anybody commenting author information is
admin author down okay you don't
typically need to touch these things
because they will be generated
automatically if that's what you want or
if you want to change it you can and
publishing options these offer published
promoted to the front page or sticky at
the top of the list so these all sort of
do what they sound like published if
your content is not published people who
are not administrative users will not be
able to access your content and
therefore it pretty much doesn't exist
to anybody however it does stay in your
site under this fine content you'll be
able to see it there where you can
publish it later however if it's not
click to publish people won't see it
promoted to the front page this promotes
something to the
frontpage main content we're actually
going to be getting rid of that page so
it doesn't really matter
promoter to the front pages use a lot of
times if you're creating a view and a
view as a way of displaying content and
so promoted to the front page might let
you select specific pieces of content to
be shown in any given circumstance
whether it's on the front page or just
promoted sticky at the top of the list
basically keep something at the top if
there's a you have a list of content you
want to bring in a bunch but there's one
piece you always want to be at the top
that's your option here so these are the
basic options here we're going to click
Save if you wanted to you could click
preview as well and it would bring up
that as you can see here here's our
about page because we edit it to the
main navigation you can see it's right
next to home in our navigation up top we
also notice that the page title is here
view and edit buttons and then the pages
body content by default this page title
is always going to get displayed above
the body content or the node this is a
page and this content right here is the
node in more advanced tutorials we'll go
over template files and PHP files where
you can change these things and change
the way to display and if you wanted to
put the title inside of the node or
something or do some more advanced
features but for the most part we're
going to be able to accomplish
everything we need with bit drupal's
basic built in functionality as is so
this is your first page in Drupal you
can navigate back to home and you'll see
you're at home click about and here's
your about page this view and edits will
go away if it's somebody that's not
logged in so let's copy this address and
go to incognito user where nobody's
logged in as you can see about no view
and edit the site will look much
different I recommend you know having an
incognito or just a logged out version
in another browser where you can test
the site and see what it looks like to
anonymous users on your site well that's
how to create a basic page in Drupal 7
and then
next tutorial we're going to go over
creating an article and what that does
once again this is Scott with level up
