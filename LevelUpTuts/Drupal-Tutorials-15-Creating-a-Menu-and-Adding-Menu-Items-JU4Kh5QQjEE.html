up Tut's and today we're going to be
working with menus a little bit more
just to give you a greater understanding
of what you can do so we're going to go
back to structure and then the menus and
then first we're going to add a menu
we're going to start at the very
beginning so click this plus admin
button and here we're just going to call
it test menu and of course this is going
to be just tests so you can see all the
settings and setting up a menu okay now
here is your menu let's add a link okay
first link we're just going to call this
test link 1 and this is actually going
to take us anywhere we want if you
remember we had a projects actually
let's browse to one of our projects that
we created and add it to this menu so if
we click to find content and we look at
my first project its URL if we delete
this is projects
my first project so let's grab this and
we'll take this my test link one okay
and now it's going to be linking to
projects my first project we're just
going to leave it as normal enabled and
its parent link is test menu and it's
weight is zero because it's the first
one cool so we now have a menu with a
link item let's add one more just for
good measure so test two and we can take
this to just projects even though we
already have a projects you know
whatever right now we're just building
some or fun
okay and we want this to be second so
we're going to give a weight of one clay
will click Save here and we now have our
two menu items okay we click this edit
menu over here this is just the options
that it gives us you can change the
menus name of the description we don't
need to do that so let's go back here
and we're going to click Save okay so
we're now have our menu if we go back to
this menus you'll notice that this test
menu shows up amongst our other ones and
over here we can list the links edit the
menu
or add a link it's pretty much the same
stuff that we've just done okay so if we
go to blocks here you'll notice that
when you created the menu in Drupal 7 it
also gives you a block of that menu so
this block is really just going to
output the menu if we click configure
here you can see it doesn't give you a
ton of menu specific options there is a
module called menu block that will give
you a lot more options in terms of
showing as expanded or starting on
different levels of the menu pretty much
giving you complete control so I would
suggest checking out menu block in the
near future we'll go over that module 2
as well in future tutorials however for
right now just know that it exists and
you're not you know if you're feeling
like you don't have a ton of control
over these menus here there is a better
way so we're not going to give this
block a title in fact we're going to say
none because this menu is self
explanatory and over here we're going to
tell it to go into the footer because
where else would it go and then we're
going to want to show up on every page
click Save and if we click out of this
you'll see we now have test link 1 and
test link 2 we can cook either of these
and our menu still here and it's taking
to us to where we need to go and you
also notice we have over this and we
have our controls here you can configure
the block straight from here you can
list the links or edit the menu itself
so that's creating a menu and creating a
menu item and then taking it as a block
and putting it somewhere on your site so
that's it for menus once again I just
want to thank you all for watching if
you have any questions or comments feel
free to leave a comment on the video hit
of the Twitter LevelUp tuts send us an
email you know my email scott at level
up tuts dot-com and you know just let us
know what you're thinking once again
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
