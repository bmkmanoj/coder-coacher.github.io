up Tut's and today we're gonna be
talking about video and html5 and video
is one of the coolest new features in
html5 because after years and years of
relying on flash and and services like
YouTube you could now host your own
videos directly on your website and not
have to worry about having a Flash
Player for it having to find that flash
player having to get it working and
having it looking nice and more
importantly having it work on mobile
browsers because as of now no mobile
browsers support flash really so because
androids dropped it
iOS never had it and you want your users
to be able to see your videos what I
really like about html5 video in fact
it's probably my favorite thing about it
is that it uses the interface of
whatever device you're on so if you're
on your phone it uses your phone's
default skin for playing videos so that
way the interaction feels comfortable to
the user because they're used to
watching videos like that on their phone
they know where the controls are so that
way you don't have to build the
interface yourself the play/pause all of
that stuff and you can just let what's
familiar take over however it's also
great that if you do want some sort of
custom controls it makes it really easy
to create that as well so in this first
video we're really just going to get a
basic video working on the screen and
that is an easy small feat and we will
accomplish that now so I have a video in
that my folder heroes or this stuff I
have a video here this welcome video
this is actually the level of tips
welcome video and it's actually on our
server or on our youtube channel right
now but I want to have it on this page
here so we can use the video tag so how
do we go about doing that well this
videos in our site here we have our HTML
we have our first blog post here and
before any of this stuff I just want to
have this video so to reference this
video you might be surprised
then it's exactly like an image so at
the bare minimum all you really need is
a video tag and in the the source just
like an image you're gonna point the
source to your video so I have my video
in a folder named video and video is
slash welcome that mp4 let's save this
and let's check out our video let's
refresh here's a video
and notice it's not doing anything it's
not playing nothing really happens it's
just there right so in the future we'll
be able to do things like autoplay and
loop and stuff like that and that's
actually what we're gonna go over to
videos from now however let's try
something else
so by default it just has the video here
there's no controls or anything so if
you want controls on your video all you
have to do is just specify controls in
your tag here you can just say controls
just like that save it refresh oops
refresh and now you'll notice I have
these chrome specific controls on my
video here I can press play and it plays
the video let's actually make this a
little bit bigger we're going and it's
playing this video perfect it's really
excellent and that took about one second
to do so we now have html5 video working
on our website and it took us no time at
all
notice how we just have this video tag
we added this controls parameter here
and we are ready to go well there is a
small problem with this if we go to this
same address in Firefox video format is
not supported is the message that we're
getting here so in the next video I'm
going to show you how you can support
multiple video formats and we'll go over
all of the different types of video
formats supported in web browsers and
what to use so as always if there are
any questions or comments leave a
comment the video hit is
the Twitter level up Tut's let's know
what you're thinking these videos are
going to be short but I'm going to keep
it into small unified chunks here so
just feel free to keep watching and
figure out what we can do next to get
this working in other browsers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
