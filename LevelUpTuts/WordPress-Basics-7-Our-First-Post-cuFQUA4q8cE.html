up tuts and today we're going to show
you how to make a post on WordPress now
we're using the latest version of
WordPress here so if yours doesn't look
exactly like this don't worry it's
pretty much the exact same the icons
might be a little bit different in the
theme in the admin and the front it
might be a little bit different but the
positionings and the exact process and
everything should be the exact same they
haven't really changed it that much over
the years so we have our page here and
notice how when I'm logged in I have
this top bar here now we can create a
new post simply by clicking this new and
then post now it takes us to the post
administrative screen where we can enter
our post we have a WYSIWYG editor which
stands for what you see is what you get
basically you type here in at Exeter and
it's something like Microsoft Word or
Google Docs like you might be used to or
you can click text if you are more
familiar with code now we can also get
here by in the back end of the site if
we have this open or even if we have
this closed we can click on posts and
then either add new here or add new here
either way it's going to take us to the
same screen we can then collapse this
menu again to make this editing a little
bit bigger now our post into a title so
we can say our first post and we want to
type some text here but I don't really
have anything I necessarily want to say
so I use this hipster ipsum and it's
sort of just like the lorem ipsum it's
just generated text but this one is a
little bit funnier because it's I don't
know hipster text so it has things like
PBR and whatever okay so I have some
text here and all that matters is we
have some paragraphs here if you go to
text this tab right here you'll see it
look doesn't look a whole lot different
because it's not really code but you can
write code in here so visual this is
more of a you know a word
what-you-see-is-what-you-get now we have
what type of format we want the post to
be and we have some options is an image
video and audio
a link gallery and a side which is sort
of just like side content or is it a
standard post this is a standard post
with text and a title so we're just
going to leave this as the format and we
can minimize this here now we have the
option of adding some categories so
let's add a new category and this will
be introduction okay and let's add let's
click the add new category button and
once I'll just have a hipster category
as well so now we have two categories
here and we can even uncheck this if we
decide that we don't want to use one of
these now notice how there's also a most
used two tab here once we start
publishing posts this most-used is going
to generate of your most used categories
making it nice and easy to find them now
you can also make something a child
category of something else so if we
wanted a child category of hello to be a
category of introduction we can do that
however we don't need that many
categories that seems like maybe
something you'd want to use a tag for
now we can then minimize this just like
that get it out of the way or you could
leave it open and scroll down and then
we can head a tag so let's just add some
tags so it can be a hello world tag and
then notice how it says separate with
commas so there we go
and so I have three tags here I can
click Add and see how it adds them
separately based on where the comma is
if you wanted to add another one right
now like that you could click add and it
just adds it to the list so you can
either add all of them at once or one at
a time just keep clicking add or you can
also choose from your most used tags now
we can also set a featured image here if
we'd like so let's go ahead and click
select featured image and since we don't
have anything uploaded I'm going to
select a file now it opened up a file
picker where I selected this image of a
it's a crab smoking a cigarette and it's
a hilarious image I'm going to
to change the title to crab with sig
there we go and you can put the caption
as whatever you'd like smoking crab
image okay so now I could set this as a
featured image if I'd like or you could
go ahead and upload even more and then
choose one from that or I could upload
it permanently or edit it again so let's
click set featured image because that's
of course why I uploaded it and now
we're ready to get this post published
so we can do a couple of things we could
save this and or we could preview it now
saving this draft just saves it in the
system it doesn't put it on the website
if we were to click save draft like this
it says it's saved however if we come to
the front end of our website it's not
there so to actually get the site
published we need to click this publish
button
now we could if we want to see what it
looks like before we click publish we
can always click this preview and we can
see that we have this large image and
our text here now the reason this theme
looks like this is because this is this
theme now I've zoomed in on it in a
normal browser size it's going to look
smaller
it'll look something more like this so
that image won't be so monstrous but
here we have this theme so basically if
you don't like the layout and you don't
like the way this looks you can go ahead
and look for other themes or if you are
familiar with coding you can go ahead
and design your own theme and that's one
the great things about WordPress is it
makes it really easy to get up and going
if you don't know the code and you don't
know how to do it but if you do it's
also flexible enough that you can have
complete control over it and do what
you'd like now preview post has just
opened this up and this is still not
live if we are again going to the front
of our site and we're to see it of
course it's not live so we need to click
this magic red publish button here and
once it's good you can see that we have
changed it now this publish button is no
longer published but update if we want
to make a change we're going to have to
click this update button before it's
live on the site if we wanted to UM
publish this we would want to click Edit
and then select draft or pending review
we could also select visibility to be
password protected and or private or not
and or but prop Ward private so we don't
want to do any that we're happy with it
being published let's go to the front
end of our site we can see right there
loud and clear is our hipster Epsom
first post it has our tags our
categories hipster and introduction we
scroll down and see our post you can see
our tags first post hello world
hipster Epsom and introduction and if we
come up here and click on the title we
can actually go to that posts page and
you'll see in here that besides having
our information we can also leave a
comment on it or you can see the
previous posts from here but you could
leave a comment and and yeah that's it
so that's our first post in the next
video we're going to talk about what
more things you can do with the post
interface either adding and editing
there's all sorts of extra stuff and
they're there screen options and things
so we're going to go over then the next
video so as always if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video or hit us up at Twitter I love
love hugs
we're also on facebook or there's the
brand new level of touch forum where you
can talk and interact with the community
and ask questions whatever so as always
this is got to Lenski thanks for
