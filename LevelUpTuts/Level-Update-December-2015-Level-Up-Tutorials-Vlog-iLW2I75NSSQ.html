tutorials and in this level update I
wanted to cover some of the awesome
things that are happening in the world
of level up tutorials this and next
month so I want to start off with a very
important announcement so next week
level up tutorials officially is going
to become my full-time job I'm going to
be committed to making level up
tutorials and overall better experience
both on the website for pro subscribers
premium content and tons of free videos
so don't expect the free videos to be
going away and don't expect the release
schedule to change either so I want to
thank everybody who's helps support by
either subscribing or purchasing
something from store dot level up
tutorials com without you guys I would
not be able to do this I would not be
able to maintain releasing free
tutorials as frequently as I do so keep
watching stored out level up tutorials
com there's going to be a lot more stuff
for sale as well as free videos on the
site and different ways that you can
help support the creation of these
videos in addition I wanted to talk
about the series that I'm going to be
covering this month I'm going to be
releasing an atom series now the atom
series is going to be unique because
it's going to be the first series in
which I'm testing out a new way of
releasing content now a lot of these
videos are already recorded and at the
time of the release of the first atom
video they all will be recorded now if
you are a level of pro subscriber or you
just want to see the series you'll have
full access to all of the videos on day
one if you either purchase a download of
the series or subscribe to level up pro
and if you're not do not worry these
videos will be made available for free
on my regular release schedule so early
access is going to be a new feature
coming to level up tutorials Pro users
once the ad on the series is available
now other series that are going to be
released are going to be a new meteor
tutorial series where I'm going to be
covering more bite-sized topics and
techniques so we're going to may be
covering like four videos on a specific
topic instead of having a long
drawn out series now one of the cool
things about this series is we're going
to be able to have like a base of code
that we can build these sort of modular
techniques and components in off of and
they're not going to rely on one or
another that way if something becomes
invalidated over time I'll be able to
recreate maybe like four videos instead
of an entire series just making it more
future proof and more effective and a
little bit bite-size chunks that you
could jump in more in the middle of now
magento to and Drupal 8 videos are
certainly still on their way and will
most likely be released in January and
I'm going to continue creating videos
for the react series that's been going
really well so far and we're going to
see a lot of meteor and react stuff in
the very near future as well known the
last bit of news I've made a slight push
to move beta that level up tutorials com
into more of the spotlight now it is now
level up tutorials com is now the what
was the beta site now i'm still working
some things out on the site so please
create an account sign in check it out
if you're already a pro user don't worry
i'll be taking care of that on the
backend and in addition if you log in to
the store or you log in to level up
tutorials com those logins will
coordinate and you'll be logged into one
and the other at the exact same time now
for current Pro users and if you are
having an issue with the new site level
up Tut's calm is still going to be
available in the current iteration
that's always been up and that's going
to remain up for a little while until
all the bugs and kinks get worked out of
level up tutorials com so check it out
it's really cool it's super fast it's
really easy to navigate it's just a much
better experience overall so let me know
what you think as always this is scott
with level up tutorials thanks for
watching and we're in for a very
exciting 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
