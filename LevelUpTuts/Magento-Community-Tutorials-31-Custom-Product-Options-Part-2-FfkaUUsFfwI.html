love-love Tencent today we're gonna go
over some more custom options for
products and this time we're gonna show
you some cool stuff you want to do let's
say you have a custom t-shirt making
company and you have let's say this
blank t-shirt and you wanted them to
give you well of course this particular
option isn't blank but let's say you
wanted them your customers to give you a
text option about what to say on the
shirt ok and the front of the shirt is
going to have room for one line of text
the back of the shirt is going to have
room for many lines of text so what do
you would your approach be personally I
would be going in to use a custom op
option for this product so let's go to
our catalog manage products and I'm just
going to search using the title of this
shirt it doesn't really matter I'm just
using a t-shirt for an example so I'm
just gonna find this particular one and
it looks like we have all of them I'm
gonna add this to the configurable
product itself and we're gonna add this
custom options and let's add some new
options so we're gonna head to new
options the one on the top we're gonna
have this be a text field and this is
going to be the front text so this is
going to be the shirt of the text on the
front of the shirt and this is going to
be the back text and we're going to have
a text area and now they don't have to
have both of these in fact if they have
a text area on the back it's going to
add $10 to the shirt if they have a text
on the front of the shirt it's going to
add $5 to the front of the shirt but
neither of these are required basically
if they want to type on the shirt it's
going to charge them $5 if they don't
want anything on the back it's not going
to charge them and they're not required
we're gonna have this be it at first and
this is going to be second and that
should be good so let's save these so
once these are saved I'm going to come
to our product let's refresh this and we
have some custom options here
so notice how it says front text plus
five dollars back text plus ten dollars
but the only thing that's required is
your size I'm gonna buy one and fifteen
dollars and no anything special on it
perfect but I want some more so I'm
gonna come back to this t-shirt and I'm
gonna say I don't want a shirt with my
name on it
and I must be off capital letters like
that okay and let's click Add to Cart so
you can see okay add to make me okay but
you can see it already added the price
so it's saying twenty dollars here the
moment I started typing in that text
field okay so now we now have a shirt
that says Scott is dope
on the front of it so let's add another
shirt and let's have one more it's gonna
be a large one and this is going to say
level up and then well let's have the
front side level of Tut's is totally
awesome and this is all capital law cap
capital letters because I want people to
shout it when they read it and it's
gonna be $30 so 10 plus 5 plus 15 and
we're gonna add this to our cart and
what's totally cool is that you can see
all of these show up in the backend as
separate products even it's not going to
say we have three of this t-shirt it's
gonna say we have one we have one that's
a medium that has this front text and
one that's a larger has this front and
back text perfect so that's really cool
for a custom shop here you can do
whatever you want
so let's actually add one more thing to
this configurable product we're not done
yet
so we want also we want them to choose
what date they want to pick it up so if
it needs to be like a rush job or
something like that we know so let's
click date so this is going to be a date
and we're just gonna say pickup and this
is going to be required and this is
going to be the second or the third
option in the list
and to be honest we have a care when
they want to come pick it up if they
pick something that reasonable you know
and we're going to you know we're
probably gonna have to call them and say
this is unreasonable but let's say
actually if they want to specify their
pickup date at all it's gonna add a $5
fees so rush this is now going to be
rush pickup date so let's save this okay
and now let's refresh the page or let's
go to our product I should say oh I also
made this required I did not want to do
that so you could see it was even
yelling at me because none of those had
this and I said this was required so
let's say this again and more refreshing
and everything will be fine
but no biggie so it's gonna say rush
pickup date and you know we could add
some language in here to say hey you
know specify your date here but if you
want it to be let's say today's the I
don't know in today's 16th or 17th 17th
we're gonna say we want this done by the
20th this year and it's gonna add an
additional $5 and this is gonna be
medium and okay
so I'm paying to have this picked up
early but I know that because it's
telling me so these are just some more
custom options you can have text areas
dates dropdowns checkboxes select lists
this this custom options is really great
it's something that is really really
expandable you can do all sorts of crazy
stuff with this and have some good
projects so I hope this sparked some
creativity in your sites and hope this
inspires you to do something really cool
with your stores so as always this is
Scott with level of tuts if you have any
questions comments leave come in the
video it is about Twitter level up tents
you know the the business so as always
we they can't get to every comment but
we would love to so leave a comment and
hopefully if we can't get to it maybe
somebody else who's already experienced
this or you know whatever can help you
out with that as well alright thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
