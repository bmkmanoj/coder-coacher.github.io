up Tut's and today we're going to be
continuing our sketch 3 tutorial series
and today we're going to be talking
about art boards now art boards are just
one of the many things you can create to
make your life easier in sketch so to
basically explain them it's worth
mentioning that sketch apps canvas is
infinite so if we were to create a shape
here a rectangle just as context right
now we can zoom out zoom out and zoom
out and zoom out and keep on zooming out
but you'll notice the boundaries to our
canvas never exist in fact we're getting
really far out here and there's no
boundaries
so what artboards allow you to do are to
define boundaries and what's great about
that is it basically allows you to make
multiple canvases per your document now
this can be really useful if you're
sharing assets between your artboards or
you're just having content coming in
between them or maybe all of this
content is related either way artboards
are a way to organize your content and
provide a nice canvas for you to work in
so what we can do is we can click new
and then artboard now we have the option
to click and drag now what this is going
to do you'll see that it has pixel sizes
next to it when we let go it creates an
artboard now we have this artboard it
almost looks like a layer group over
here but it's not it's essentially just
a grouping of everything in that
artboard now when we take a shape that's
outside of this artboard and drag it
over here you can see that that shape
just doesn't show up outside of the
airport sure if we hover over this
you're going to see the boundaries of
that shape but the artboard is the
visible area that we're working in so if
we were to export this artboard as an
image you would only see what's within
the boundaries of this artboard now
likewise we can create a second artboard
if we'd like just like that
and you'll notice it
takes another group here now if we make
another shape let's just make a
rectangle again now the shape is within
this artboard if we drag it over here
you can see that sketch actually
transfers this rectangle into artboard
number one now what happens if we drag
it between the two you can see that it
stays in the out board that it's
currently in if we move it over here it
moves it to artboard number two and we
move it back half way in between and it
stays in our board number two so you
can't actually share assets between an
artboard you can as in you can't have
one asset appear in to our boards but
what you can do is you can duplicate
this and move it over here and now you
have the same object here now of course
there's shortcuts to duplicate such as
command e is going to duplicate so you
don't have to right-click duplicate you
can also click over here and select
duplicate as well if we wanted to this
rectangle for to show up and artboard
number two we could also grab it here
and drop it right into this artboard and
you'll see that it's no longer visible
in our board number one even though it's
within the bounds of artboard number one
so artboards are a great way to contain
the things that you're working on okay
now what else are artboards great for
artboards are great for having a
starting off point if you need to work
in a specific canvas so for instance
when I click new artboard you'll notice
over here on the right we have all sorts
of different artboards pre-configured so
we have iPhone screens we have iPad
screens we have responsive web design
layouts we have paper sizes iOS 7 icons
iOS icons and Mac icons so let's say we
wanted to have a portrait iPhone and our
board we could just click this and it
drops it right into our project
so now we know that these dimensions
right here are going to be perfect for
the iPhones dimensions so we can get
working on our our design or whatever
we're doing just within this document
well let's say now we also have an iPad
and because this app is going to be for
iPhone and iPad we can just go ahead and
click new artboard and let's go ahead
and select landscape iPad and so now we
have a portrait iPhone and the landscape
iPad and these are both ready to start
working in and we can drag things
between them we can copy and paste we
can use them in the same project and
then when we're showing these mock-ups
off to people or anything like that you
can quickly show the difference between
portrait landscape whatever you have
them sitting right here and uh it's a
nice little presentation almost now if
you'll notice I'm dragging around that
shortcut is the same as what you're used
to with Adobe products if you hold
spacebar you can click and drag around
likewise you can zoom in and out with
command plus or minus cool so these are
artboards now let's talk about exporting
now we could say file export and in here
it's going to give us the option of
which our boards we want to output it's
actually asking us which slices and
you'll notice that when we created these
out boards it actually made them as
slices so we could say we want all of
these artboards
or we could uncheck this and simply say
we want just artboard number one to be
exported now when we click export here
it gives us our options what it's saying
it's going to be a ping and where we
want it to be stored now if you want to
be able to modify what those export
settings are if you click on the
artboard itself in the left-hand here in
our layers we have export settings over
here on the right and we could even say
that this has a permanent background
color of red so now this artboard always
is a background color
read and notice how the checkbox for
including export is checked that means
when we export this artboard the
background is going to be red if we just
want it to be red for presentational
maybe let's say we have a white on
transparent icon but we don't so we
don't want the background of the airport
to be white
you would want to uncheck this because
you still want your icon to be white on
transparent this little export preview
here it shows you exactly what you're
exporting and then you can go ahead and
click this export button you can also
click this button right here if you
would like to share it to any of these
services well there's lots more to talk
about with exporting which we're going
to do in later lessons however you can
now get started creating your artboards
and if you wanted to move your artboard
around you can actually select it and
move it click and drag like this change
the dimensions change the dimensions
over here in the inspector there's a ton
of flexibility so just play around with
it and see what you can do just start
creating your artboards and then start
creating your art or whatever you're
working on so as always this is Scott
with level up tuts if you have any
questions or comments please leave a
comment the video or hit us up at
Facebook or Twitter let us know what you
liked about sketch what you don't like
about sketch how are you using artboards
in cool ways just let us know what
you're doing
like I said we'd love to hear from you
so thanks for watching and i'll see in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
