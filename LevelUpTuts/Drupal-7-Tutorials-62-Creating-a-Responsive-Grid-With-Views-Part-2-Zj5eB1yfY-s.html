of hugs and today we're going to take
this responsive grid we made with Omega
one step further and show you how you
can attach individual items individual
components of this grid to the grid and
Omega so let's turn on our grid again
let's say that we didn't want this in a
grid like this but we want these to have
the this image to line up with these
three columns and then the title is
going to line up with the next one two
three four five six columns and the body
paragraph will also line up with those
six columns so how do we do that well
let's come back to our our view here and
we're going to edit this view and we're
gonna we don't need to tell this overall
row to be a certain amount of grid size
we just have to tell individual
components of it so here's our view and
like I said before we have semantic
fields on so I'm gonna click on instead
of semantic views I'm gonna go to
semantic views fields settings so here
we have the option to wrap everything
and give it a class so as you can
imagine we want this to line up with we
said let's look back at our site we
wanted the image to be the first three
grid lines and then the paragraph the
text to be the next six so we're going
to say grid - three and then we're also
going to say grid six on the title and
grid six on the body and one more thing
we need to do here is we also need to
add an element around this image so
we're just gonna wrap this in a div and
for this last one we're gonna also wrap
this in a div as well because it's gonna
put this in a paragraph so let's wrap
that in a div so let's come here to our
settings let's click on our semantic
view settings and we're just gonna go
ahead and delete that as well as the
Alpha and the Omega on that okay so
let's come down here we're gonna get rid
of this grid 4 and we're gonna get rid
of this alpha and omega and let's apply
and let's save this and look at what we
have it's not quite right this one's
fitting in here because it's long you
know
grid six whatever but this diff right
here is sort of funky what's going on
here well it is getting the margin left
and right so to get everything to fit in
here we're going to want to add our
Alpha and Omega classes where we should
have them so if we have over the image
you can see it's getting a margin on the
left just like in the last lesson
so let's come back here and because the
image is on the left we want to give the
image at alpha and because the paragraph
and the title are on the right we're
going to give these omegas and it's
gonna be Omega and after we save this
everything should fit in there it should
be all nice and responsive just like we
like it all right check it out
nice and responsive although there is
something weird going on here with this
title let's pull this back here and it's
not quite spacing up right but it could
just be a style that I have is
overriding something and doing something
weird and the problem here is as I'm
already giving this h3
it's a margin set by me if I uncheck
that it's gonna be perfectly fine for
this layout so normally you wouldn't see
that but I'd already set the margin for
something else so as you can see as it
adjusts everything that looks great and
we have more views and Omega goodness
cool well let me know if you have any
questions you know feel free to just
start throwing grid numbers on things
grid - number and Alpha and Omega and
get your layouts looking great nice and
responsive with views and Omega
once again this is Scott and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
