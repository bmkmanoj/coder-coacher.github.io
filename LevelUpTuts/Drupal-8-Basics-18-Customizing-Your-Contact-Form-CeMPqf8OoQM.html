up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna take that contact form that was
given to us when we installed Drupal and
we're going to add an extra field and
we're gonna show you what you can do to
modify the display and the function of
that form let's get going on that now so
on our site we have our contact us form
and with the Drupal 8 this just exists
in previous versions of Drupal you'd
have to install the module you'd have to
create your own form but in this version
of Drupal Drupal 8 we have a form here
so what can this form do let's actually
hover over this and we can see we just
have the title and we don't necessarily
have easy access to edit this but what
we do have as an headed button up here
so what do we do to get to this well
let's come to structure and let's click
on contact forms now we have a website
feedback so let's go ahead and click
Edit here if we want to change the name
we can change the name from website
feedback to something like contact us
now it matches the page title we can
have an auto reply where it can
immediately send a user an email saying
thank you for filling out this form
we'll get back to you soon or something
like that
now recipients is where you add the
emails that this goes to for instance
this email is going to head to Scott
talansky at gmail.com so it's gonna send
right to meet it's gonna send an email
right to me
you couldn't have multiple emails just
by specifying with the comma and we just
have a wait and we have a make this the
default form right now it is the default
form let's click Save so we now have our
contact us form but I'm not totally
satisfied let's come back and click Edit
now what we have here is we have manage
fields manage form display and manage
display click manage fields I want to go
ahead and add a new field let's add a
field let's just make this a text field
so let's scroll down we can find text
and it can be just a short plain text so
we can just select text plane the label
can just be him so this is gonna be
somebody's name let's click Save and
continue and maximum length sure we
can't leave all this stuff as is so we
now have the name field and we can make
this a required field if you want you
can click Save Settings now we have this
name field if we head to our store let's
actually just come to the home page back
to site here let's come to contact us we
can keep these both open at the same
time so we can come back and forth you
see we have email address subject
message and name is way down here
obviously we'd rather have the name be
above the subject that way you can fill
out the subject of this message who it's
from and the message so let's come to
manage fields we want to add manage form
display here now this is going to allow
us to drag these around so we can drag
this up just beneath subject and we have
send your email here we can make this
visible and hidden we have sender name
here we can make this visible or hidden
let's go ahead and just make that hidden
and the send copy to sender is all fine
and if we save this you can now see when
we refresh our contact page we now have
your email address subject name message
send yourself a copy if you'd like but
basically we have this new field we
chose where to go and now Drupal is just
gonna sort of know what to do and it's
going to throw that and format it into
our email message accordingly so that's
really nice
in the past forms have always been a
super huge pain in Drupal and now this
having this built in this form manage
forms it's nice and easy it's not the
most robust form system we can't send
multiple emails we can't use the value
of an email the value of a select list
to send to a different email or
something like that they're still always
going to be the need for more custom
webform modules how
this default solution is definitely a
great solution for the default form
settings it's not too complex and offers
just enough functionality everything
looks great and it's now ready for
primetime in our website just like how
we would want it so as always there's a
scout level of tutorial so you have any
questions or comments it becoming the
video where me up at Twitter or Facebook

purchase the rest of these videos before
