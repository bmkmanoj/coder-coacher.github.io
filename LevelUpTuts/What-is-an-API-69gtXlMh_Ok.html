wanted to try to do something a little
bit different I'm going to be sort of
working in a code here while giving you
a little example about what I'm talking
about
and this topics been sort of done to
death in sort of various animation so I
wanted to take this question what is an
API from more of a developer's
standpoint so if you are a web developer
this video will be useful to you if you
do not know what an API is or maybe you
just want to solidify something so by
definition essentially an API is just
two way to interact with an application
and you could think of things like you
know YouTube or IMDB those are all
applications or maybe it's the server
side component of your website these are
all applications but you could also
think of it as libraries that you're
using if you want to use the stripe
payment system you'd be using stripes
API to interact with stripe so it's a
basically a way that your system can
interact with other systems now as a web
developer there's going to be two
primary ways that we interact with api's
and not to say that this is it or that
this distinction is hard or something
like that I'm saying that in your day to
day this is how you will interact with
api's now the the first of which is
through what's typically called like a
network request and as you can see in
this code example I'm using a basic
async function called get movie this
movie is waiting on a fetch of a
specific URL I'm going to talk a little
bit about this URL right now and so
basically I'm running the fetch function
here to hit a URL it's going to return
some data and I'm going to wait on that
data and then I'm going to at the end of
it have a movie so what's up with this
URL
well this URL is the API that we are
able to hit as in the movie DB org is
just one example you can see here the
movie DB org
I have no relation to them they have a
nice free API to test out so I use it
for a lot of examples basically what
happens is you hit a specific URL may
actually move this browser down here so
you can see more of the browser you hit
a specific URL with an API key right
this is basically a key that lets you in
the door this is a locked system and
this key will let you in and when you
hit this URL you don't actually get a
website well you get us a bunch of data
and this data is available for anyone
who has a key to access it right so in
our code example what we're saying is
hey go to this address right where this
data lives with your key and get all of
the data and that data comes back and
you know if you're looking at this code
and thinking hey you need to try catch
it's an async function don't worry about
that these code examples here aren't
necessarily like hard and fast or
something like that the idea here is
simply that we are able to go to a URL
that makes data available for us and
accept that data now this URL that has
data available to us is the API and lots
of services have an API for instance I
use the YouTube API to import all of my
videos on to level up tutorials you can
also use API is for various platforms to
interact with them such as accessing
Google Maps in your application
like I mentioned before interacting with
a payment system may be like Braintree
or stripe pretty much if you have a
system that you want to interact with
whether it's to grab data or to do
something then you're going to be using
their API the API is the information
that has been publicly available to you
either
fully public or via a key right and this
key is typically some long string like
you can sort of see - here I don't use
this API I wouldn't recommend stealing
my key typically you want to keep all of
your keys private but this isn't
necessarily a huge deal you are
typically granted a key
from the system that is making this API
available
there's also totally public api's - that
don't need a key however many need a key
simply just to track your usage for
instance if I was using the movie DB and
I was grabbing an exorbitant of data for
them every single day they're gonna be
able to tie that back to me with my API
key now every single company's API has
their own terms so obviously that's
something you're going to want to check
out so like I mentioned that one of the
ways you interact with an API or another
or another systems application is
through get or post request aka getting
or fetching data or telling it to do
something now a newer way to do Network
requests is through things like graph QL
you could have a graph QL query that
says hey give me the movie and the title
and while your graph QL client if it's
set up correctly will then go ahead and
hit that API and get you that correct
information
now some graph QL systems actually just
use the fetch API under the hood you
just don't notice it you're just writing
this kind of code and you don't ever
have to touch the fetch they are hitting
a specific end point by the way this URL
is occasionally called an endpoint so
basically you'll have a new kind of way
to do network requests using graph QL if
you want to learn more about graph QL
there is a what is graph QL video in
this what is playlist graph QL is like
an exciting new technology to work with
api's ok so very fitting that we talked
a little bit about graph QL in this
video ok so those are two primary ways
that you work with another application
through both get and post requests as
well as systems like graph QL now the
second way that we work with API is is
through a public method now you may have
noticed some of my tabs up and I also
have this tab for react router you may
have come to in the application or a
package that you use in your code such
as react router seeing the word API here
and wondered why this is called an API
now some libraries have a whole bunch of
stuff going on under the
hood now the only things they want to
make available to you are those things
that are public aka the API so the API
here in a library like react router is
saying hey these are the things that are
available publicly for you to use right
these are the methods functions classes
whatever that you can use inside of your
own application so you can see in our
little code example here I have a
library let's call this library some Lib
okay now some Lib has a whole bunch of
stuff going on under the hood however
they only want you to be able to access
some things because maybe only some of
those things are useful for the end user
aka you right so we have those things
made available publicly to us that way
so when we say some Lib dot do a thing
it does a thing and that way the library
does the thing that we want it to do and
we're able to interact with it correctly
so the API is all of the things that are
available within this library right
whether it is in react writer we have a
switch component we have a static router
component a router component but we also
have some more interesting things like a
with router wrapped component we have a
function called match path and stuff
like that these are things that react
router is making available to us aka the
API so to wrap this video all up as a
developer there are two ways you
primarily work with api's through
network requests aka
give me that or do that over the network
and if you're making your own requests
you're probably using the fetch API
because that is the most recent and
common way to do it or you are probably
on the new hotness which is called graph
QL which is a new sort of query language
for fetching data from an API now the
second again is through public methods
aka methods functions components
whatever that is made available to you
through a library or software package so
this is an API I hope that cleared up
any sort of doubts that you had about
what an API is for web developers now if
you have some sort of edge case or other
alternative explanation go
I hadn't leave it in the comments I'd
love to hear what your explanation for
an API is if you think that could be
helpful for anyone as always let me know
what you want to see on what is
Wednesday I do a new video every single
Wednesday where I answer a wet is
question about what is some sort of
concept within web development now I've
mentioned the graph QL a couple times
which is a new way to interact with
api's on level up tutorials calm there's
a level to react native with graph QL
series that just came up where I teach
you how to build native applications
using graph QL in addition I also have a
full stack graph QL series with meteor
reactant Apollo which is totally free
where you do 25 videos of working with
Apollo in graph QL now in addition if
you're not interested in learning graph
QL I also have a Redux and react for
everyone series where we work with
standard API is using the fetch API so
check out all that stuff if it interests
you or if you want to become a pro and
get access to some of these exclusive
courses head on over to level up
tutorials that comp or / pro and sign up
it would mean a lot and I could continue
to make these awesome awesome free
videos thank you so much for watching
and I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
