up tutorials and in this video I'll be
showing you merge requests in gitlab now
this is the equivalent of a pull request
in github so basically somebody makes a
modification of a code they upload it
and request that that code is merged in
so let's get going on that now okay so
we've covered a lot of projects too but
we haven't covered pull requests or as
it's called here a merge requests and to
be honest
merge requests makes a lot more sense to
me because you're merging code and
you're requesting it that way we can
create a new merge request from here
it's right here underneath issues and
your sidebar as long as we're in the
particular project view let's go ahead
and actually see this in action I'm
going to head to my command line and I'm
gonna create a new branch we do get
checkout type and B and let's just have
this be some updated code okay and let's
go ahead and modify this code push it up
I'm gonna head over to Adam real quick
and that just to make this change here
so I'm just gonna come in here to
Android yes and I'm just going to add a
simple comment that says new branch yo
okay and let's go ahead and add another
one to the iOS we can just go ahead and
delete this comment here just so we can
have a few things now let's head back to
our I term and I'm just gonna do git add
git commit and updated some files em and
you can see we now want to go ahead and
say git push origin updated code and
this is gonna push this branch up okay
and everything's been pushed up let's go
ahead and head back to chrome and now
what's really cool here is that when i
refresh you can see you pushed to
updated code branch less than a minute
go do you want to create a merge request
right over here so if we click create
merge request it's going to already
select the updated code branch so we can
just click create merge request
you can see a debated files I apparently
spelled some things incorrectly in my
haste but as you can see from updated
code into master we can write a little
descript you just say removed and added
comments ok and the assignee sure
assigned to me and this can be for a
milestone and we can say well don't have
a label for this so I'm gonna ignore
labels right now but the source branch
is going to be updated code and that the
target branch is going to be master okay
so let's check this out here we can see
the submit merge request now what we
have here is a merge request we can
actually come in here and we can see
that it's assigned to me it's a four
milestone all the stuff here I could
unsubscribe to this if I wanted but we
also have all of our information that we
would need now you might be wondering
well how do I actually see the source
here right if you're used to get hub you
could see sort of what's been changed
and what hasn't been changed
click updated code here we can actually
click compare and under compare we can
say from master to updated code so let's
just compare from master to updated code
and what you'll notice is some pretty
standard looking at diff
we could see that this line has been
changed because this new branch show has
been added this line has been changed
because no new line at the end of file
but as you can see our little changes
show up here in the code you can just
see sort of exactly what's been changed
that way we can definitely come to view
open merge requests and from here we can
just say alright that looked pretty good
let's accept this if you want you could
actually check this box that said remove
source branch as well and then we get
rid of
the updated code branch because we don't
need it and you might be thinking well
that's great but I missed that checkbox
well after the fact we can actually
click remove source branch from right
here and just by simply clicking that
it's gonna remove the updated code or
updated at whatever I wrote their
updated code branch into master it's
deleted that
so we now merge those changes in the
master and we deleted that so let's head
to our terminal we can do git checkout
master and we could say git pull origin
master and you can see in master our
updates to Android is as well as indexed
on iOS J's have been pulled in to master
successfully so that's a successful
merger request as you can see there's
places to add comments via markdown all
along the way we can add comments we can
do whatever we want to make sure that
everybody is on the same page you can
add participants people can come and
people can approve people can subscribe
to this it's really really full-featured
so this is merge requests using git lab
as always this is Scott would love love
tutorials if you have any questions are
coming so you could come into this video
or hit me up at Twitter or Facebook at
level up tuts if you want to get all
these videos before they're released on
youtube head to store that level up
tutorials comm and either send it to be
a level of pro or purchase the series
outright if subscriptions are not your
thing as always thanks for watching and
i'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
