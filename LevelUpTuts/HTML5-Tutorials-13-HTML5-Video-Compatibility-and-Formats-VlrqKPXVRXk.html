Oh Hudson today we're gonna continue our
html5 video talk with we're going to be
talking about compatibility so we
noticed that our video worked fine in
Chrome but it didn't work fine
in Firefox in fact we got this message
it said it wasn't supported however
html5 video is supported in Firefox
in fact html5 video supported in Chrome
Firefox Internet Explorer 9 and 10 and
probably up from there it's not
supported in 6 7 or 8
luckily 7 is down to like less than 1%
of people using it or around 1% so you
know lucky you if you don't have to
support IE 7 i for one have stopped
supporting i7 unfortunately the IE 8
still exists and people are still
supporting it
however for IE 8 we're gonna probably
have to use a flash fallback which is
something we'll go over in a future
video safari supports it opera supports
at ios and android supported some my
other mobile phone OSS don't support it
but i'd say the modern up-to-date ones
do so why isn't this working then well
the video format that we used in our
code is an mp4 and now video licensing
for these codecs is sort of weird it's a
little too much to get into for this
video but basically firefox has chosen
not to support mp4 now firefox
originally was supporting an OG i
believe it's OGG or ogv forget exactly
or if it's the same thing a codec that
was being used pretty much just for
firefox however they've sitzt dropped it
in favor of web m now what's cool about
WebM is chrome also supports WebM opera
supports WebM so by creating a web em
version and an mp4 version of your video
you're covering Chrome Firefox Internet
Explorer Safari iOS Android and opera
and that's pretty good coverage if you
ask me so what we're going to do is
we're going to show you how to create
this video
to a WebM format and then host both of
these videos so that the plays no matter
what browser you're in unless of course
it's an older version of ie
and for those we'll be fixing that in a
future video with a flash fallback so
let's check this out what's the first
thing we need to do to make this video
work well we need the WebM format so I'm
gonna go to my C Chrome here and I'm
going to download a tool this is the
Miro Video Converter and this is a free
open source application it's a small
little application that allows you to
essentially drag a video onto here and
it just converts it to any format you
want based off of the ones that it has
here and it's really great it's couldn't
be any easier it's free and I would
highly recommend this video mural Video
Converter I'll put this in the comments
so go ahead and download this I've
already downloaded the application so
let me open it up here so here we have
our Euro converter and I'm essentially
going to just grab my video you can see
in the folder that it's in I'm just
gonna drop it in here and now it's gonna
say it's cute I'm gonna click format and
here I can select my format I'm just
gonna have a be WebM SD this isn't a
super high res video so I don't really
need any crazier than WebM SD so I'll
click this and let's click the convert
and just give it a little bit and it's
going to convert this video once this is
done being converted I'm gonna come back
and show you what we can do with it well
so that's all done and it has put it in
a folder on our computer I think it's in
movies or something it usually just
drops in a movies Miro video converted
and I'm just going to drag this file
directly into my project here so I have
a welcome dot WebM video as well and
let's get to our site here if we scroll
down to our video tag happy reference
multiple sources because this
is not exactly you know we can't exactly
have a couple of sources in here so how
exactly do we do this well luckily the
video spec has thought of this forest so
we're actually just gonna cut this
source out of here and we'll have a
space in here and now we can do it like
this
so inside of this video tag here we can
actually put a source tag so let's type
out source and the SRC well just paste
this hole in the source is equal video
slash welcomed at mp4 so what's cool
about this is the first thing that's
going to do is try to use this mp4 okay
okay so we have our source here our
welcome video it's going to try this one
first and if it doesn't the browser
doesn't support this it's going to move
on to the next source so the next source
can be the exact same but we can just
change this to web M so let's save this
notice how I still have the controls in
the video section up here the video tag
itself so let's save this let's check it
out in Chrome so in chrome looks no
difference we still have our our
controls here and go full screen if we
want and notice how that's using the
computers full screen option it goes
full screen based on how OS X wants to
handle it not based on how your Flash
Player or something wants to handle it
and let's check it out on Firefox as
well and pull up Firefox here and look
we have a it looks like a little bit
different controls and the video is
going to be working the same here using
the full screen sorry about that
still using the full screen video and
everything like that so it's really cool
we now have this working on any of those
major browsers well that's great well
what other cool things can we do with
html5 video well in the next video we're
going to show you more attributes that
you can use for html5 video till you do
different things with them so as always
if you have any questions or comments
leave a comment of the video
hit us up at Twitter a level of Tut's
let us know what you're thinking we love
to hear from you you know you can reach
us on Facebook or anywhere so as always
this is Scott talansky and thanks for
