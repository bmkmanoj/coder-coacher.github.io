up tubs and today I'm going to show you
how to rotate things using a CSS
transform and now with the CSS transform
you can do more than just rotate you can
do some scaling and some other stuff
there's even a 3d transform so you can
keep in mind there's more you can do
here these are just 2d transforms you
can skew things you can scale them you
can spin them stretch them so there's
all sorts of stuff you can do but we're
just going to go over rotating an item
and then we're going to apply that State
on hover and with the transition you'll
get to see some cool stuff happen so
let's grab some code here as in the past
couple lessons I'm going to be grabbing
some code straight from css3 please and
I'm going to plop it right down and
let's say I'm going to rotate this this
main column here this gray column so I'm
going to put this actually I'm going to
rotate it on hover so I'm gonna do main
column okay and now I'm just going to
change this to hover and the way this is
right now this is using a CSS transform
and it's going to rotate a point seven
point five degrees so like I said there
are other things that can go in here you
can use translate rotate skew scale
there's a matrix one that's a little
more complex so we're going to be using
this rotate save it let's go to our page
let's check it out and now when we hover
over this main column it's going to
rotate so you'll notice the same thing
before when I like did this here it's
sort of freaking out so you might
actually want to pay attention to
something like that obviously you're not
going to want the main column of your
website to rotate seven and a half
degrees when you hover over it
especially if somebody's going to be
trying to read it read content that's in
there but it could be cool for like
visual elements or maybe if it fits the
design it's just another thing that CSS
provides so that you don't have to use
images for everything
anymore so let's actually apply some of
the knowledge we had in the last
tutorial and I'm going to add a WebKit
transition on the main column and I'm
going to have a transition all and I
won't have it there'd be a delay just
have it ease out just like this and now
let's go to our page refresh we'll hover
over it it's a nice smooth rotate there
so look at that I mean I don't know I
don't know how long some people have
been using CSS but really to me being
able to do something like this using
only CSS there's really fantastic it's
just a very welcome addition to CSS and
of course it's going to get abused just
like things and flash did and everything
like that but as long as you use it
tastefully it can be really cool add
some really neat effects to your site
okay well let's actually try to rotate a
little bit more just for fun and we can
say let's rotate this 45 degrees and
this is just to experiment and you can
see it's capable of doing some pretty
wild stuff and this is just using CSS
okay well I'm going to take this rotate
off because it really it's not doing
anything for me but the ability to be
able to do that when you need it is
always welcome in real quick CSS
transforms are supported in any version
of Chrome as long as you use WebKit
starting at version 4 it goes back
Firefox 23.5 using the mods prefix and
goes back to 9 with a as long as you use
the MS prefix 10.5 for opera using the
au prefix Safari 3.1 using the WebKit
and then it's pretty much supported in
any version of iOS or Android as long as
using the WebKit prefix so as always if
