tutorials and in this video I'm gonna be
showing you how to install new color
schemes and how to search and find them
within Adam's interface that way we can
change the default color scheme to
anything that we would like so let's get
going on that right now so now we get to
cover one of everybody's favorite topics
which is modifying your color scheme now
I'm gonna find your color scheme in
something like atom out of the box is
way easier than doing it in sublime text
out of the box now sublime you can
certainly get packages to help you find
and change your color scheme easily
however its built-in to add them pretty
nicely we head to our preferences and I
throw this open in the main tab here I'm
gonna push these over to the side and so
we're only looking at our settings here
now if we had two themes you'll notice
that we have UI theme and syntax theme
we're gonna be worried about syntax
theme only and again I'm actually just
going to make these a little bit bigger
here and we can have an HTML
we can throw this HTML over here as well
just so we can sort of see what these
look like now in the settings here we're
using one dark which is the color scheme
that has been chosen for us when we just
launched this application now we could
always use something like solarized dark
and you'll notice it instantly changes
everything and even though this is the
syntax theme it also changes the
coloring inside of your settings here a
little bit and here we have something
like Solarize dark we can use solarized
light and you should be familiar with
both of these and we have things like
tomorrow dark these are all color
schemes that you'll find on a lot of
text editors we also have atom dark and
this is the atoms own dark theme you can
see it looking here nothing too crazy
but let's actually try to add and
install a new color scheme if we head
over to install you can click this where
it says themes and we can just say color
scheme in here so as you can see here we
have several different color schemes and
we have been labeled as either by theme
or syntax and many of these packages
actually include a theme as well however
really just looking for color scheme so
let's go ahead and click install on
something like this iceberg syntax and
we can look for another one let's
actually look for a material design type
one you'll notice that when you click
install that's all you have to do now we
can uninstall it whenever we'd like but
these install buttons just are really
pretty seamless so we can say
material and that's one of the really
just great things about this is just how
nice having something like that in here
is where you can just click install try
it a few different ones and if you don't
like them you can uninstall it really
super easily okay so I've added a few
let's head back to themes here let's
head over to syntax themes and we know
instantly without having to do anything
we didn't have to restart the
application we have access to iceberg
which should be sort of blueish it looks
like it's like a dark purple and if
you'll notice the background changed but
it's in the tech stuff didn't change if
we reopen this settings DJ sign you'll
notice it's all blue now in fact if we
click out of this index.html and reopen
then you'll see it's changed quite a bit
so for the actual syntax to take effect
for instance this purple intermediate
j/s it's not really doing anything if we
reopen it you can see the blue color
scheme is now totally in effect and
likewise if we change this material so
likewise if you change themes like to
this material there's some things right
here where we have our index.html is
clearly not the right theme we charge
back into it
settings JSON clearly not the right
theme we're back into it it's a little
bit more materially now so you may have
to close the current tab to see the new
color scheme fully in effect as opposed
to just a partial change so finding new
color schemes couldn't be any easier you
just had to install click on themes look
for whatever type of color scheme you're
looking for I know a lot of people like
to use editing as Batman
man it's pretty sweet theme I like wild
cherry those are some nice color schemes
there but as you can see we can install
Batman we can install while cherry
possibly okay we can install both of
those head back to our themes this is
just so nice and easy right
I changed a Batman what's funny this
time is that the index.html did change
and we didn't have to reopen the tab to
get it to take effect here so I'm not
necessarily sure if that's a particular
color scheme issue or if that's an issue
with Adam itself however I noticed I
have had that same issue with sublime
text before as well and let's actually
throw in wild cherry just to see one
more and this time you'll notice again
yeah we had the color change without
having to actually do anything now this
is funny because we're using this color
scheme without using the theme there's
some weird issues going on so we might
need to modify this one a little bit but
the color scheme itself looks really
nice cool so this is how you add new
color schemes and how you change your
color scheme using Adam as always this
