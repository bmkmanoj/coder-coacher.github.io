up huts and in this video we're going to
show you how to get started with polymer
we're going to first use Bower to
initialize our project then we're going
to download and install polymer so in
this video we're going to download an
add polymer to our Bower file then using
Bower it's going to grab all the stuff
we need and then in our HTML we're just
going to link up polymer so that we're
all ready to go so keep watching we're
going to get into bed now so we're going
to follow polymers recommended way of
setting up a project and that's by using
a bower if you haven't used Bower before
you're going to want to go ahead install
node.js first you can do that just by
googling nodejs they have a easy
installer on their page once you have
been installed you can then use the npm
command to install Bower so we're going
to go ahead and run npm install - G
Bower just like that and this is going
to install Bower globally on your system
if you get a bunch of errors that means
that you don't have permissions to
install it globally on your system and
you're gonna have to run this with sudo
and then after you run sudo it's going
to ask you for your password and it
should install just fine
but you're going to want to go to your
project so I even really have a project
set up so let's get something set up now
I'm just going to change directory into
my sites folder so CD sites and then I
keep my LevelUp sites and a folder
called level up notice how there's
nothing in here
so let's actually make a new directory
I'm going to say mkdir to make a
directory and this is just going to be a
polymer or polymer okay so let's change
directories into polymer with CD polymer
now that I'm in here I'm going to run a
init command so it's going to be bower
in it now this is going to initialize
our project with a bower file so if you
want them to anonymously use your
statistics sure I don't mind that at all
and it's going to ask for the name of
this project by
that's going to use the folder name so
I'm just going to hit yes version 0.00
sure and this is going to be a level of
polymer test okay and the main file is
just going to be index.html I don't have
an index.html yet but that is quite
alright I'll make one in a second and
you don't really have to worry about
this you can just hit enter it says just
don't worry about the modules to expose
part just by hitting Enter and we don't
need keywords authors okay let's just
keep hitting Enter
so I'm just hitting enter through all of
these right and at this point I'm just
going to say yes looks good okay so
let's hit LS we can now see we just have
a bower JSON file and let's go ahead and
add polymer to this JSON file we can do
that by installing polymer and adding it
to our file at the same time by typing
bower install - - save the save is going
to save it to our Bower file and we can
say polymer slash up that's a forward
slash and then polymer in lower case so
what this is doing is it's going into
the polymer project and grabbing the
polymer component there are several
other different polymer components that
you can grab which we'll go over in
later videos but for right now we just
want the core so we're going to hit
enter here and it's going ahead and
grabbing all that stuff now simple LS
will confirm that inside of our bower
components we have our platform polymer
core components page all this stuff here
right
so now that we have polymer installed
we're ready to go with our project here
so let's go back to the root of our
project and let's actually make an
index.html file so now I'm just going to
open up this project in sublime text and
you can see we have our Bower JSON file
and not a whole lot else so let's go and
click a new file and let's just make the
as index.html and now we need to
obviously give this some content so now
what I have here is just a basic HTML
page the doctype is just set to HTML we
have nothing in the head except for our
script tag that's linking to bower
components slash platform slash platform
dot j/s and that is going to be the main
component that we need the polymer
platform and that's all we really need
to get started so we now have polymer
installed and we have an HTML file and
we're basically ready to go we're ready
to start creating our own custom
elements right now so in the next video
we're going to take what we have here
we've installed polymer we've all got it
all set up and in the next video we're
going to create our very first custom
element so keep watching the next one as
always this is Scott with LevelUp Tut's
if you have any questions or comments
leave a comment the video or hit us up
at Twitter or Facebook and level up
Tut's we love to hear from you thanks
for watching and we'll see in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
