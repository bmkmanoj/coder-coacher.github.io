level of Tut's and today I'm gonna show
you how to add a lightbox to our site
I'm gonna be light boxing in a video and
it's gonna be really cool so like in the
last lesson I used a flood cider for
this I'll be using fancy box which is
available at fancy apps calm and I
should note that what the new version of
fancy box you do have to pay for it if
you plan on using it on a commercial
site if you're not using it on a
commercial site you can use it for free
but due to their terms you will have to
pay for it if you want to use it so
because this is just a tutorial I'm not
you know I don't have to pay for it
necessarily so you know feel free to
watch this and if this doesn't you know
I use fancy box because I like it but
you can use any other slideshow and it's
gonna be very similar to this any other
of light box that is not slideshow so
first we want to download this I'll
click download you could view the
licensing options if you'd like and
we're going to add the files to our
agentive installation the very same way
we did it before so I'm gonna find my
skin folder and then I'm going to start
putting in these files we need our we
need our files here so I'm going to put
the jQuery fancy box CSS file in the CSS
where I put the other one the one for
the last one and I'm going to put the
fancy box pack because it's minified
here you can tell I'm gonna throw that
into my J s and I'm going to wait to
throw these images here I'm going to see
where it's looking for these before I
put them anywhere and we're gonna have
one more thing we're going to be using
the fancy box media helper we're gonna
go here and here is fancy box media j s
and that's all we should need for this
I'm gonna put this also in the J s
folder and let's go back to our local
XML because we have done this a couple
of times so you should have this
pretty much down so I'm gonna add
another one of these add CSS actions and
I'm going to add the fancy box CSS now
if I copy a jQuery fancy box dot CSS
okay and I'm going to copy a couple of
these JavaScript ones because we're
gonna have to add two JavaScript files
the fancy box minified file the fancy
box pack and the fancy box of media file
and I'm actually gonna go to finder to
grab those names for those files here so
I don't have to type all this out
because I notice sometimes when you type
these file names out you can really
easily have a misspelling or something
and that could throw everything off and
that's really depressing when you find
out that's your error after a long time
of troubleshooting so I'm gonna paste in
our fancy box or sorry about that one
first - fancy box pack first and then
the fancy box media and the fancy box
media just allows you to use different
media things like it makes it easier to
use a YouTube clip or a Vimeo clip
inside of your fancy box so let's save
this let's go back to our page let's
come to our home page I'm gonna refresh
this and make sure all of our scripts
came in it's nice to make sure that
everything is in here looking exactly
how you'd want it fancy box media is
here fancy box pack is here cool and on
the home page we're gonna go to the same
place we were before which looks like
this
it's our home page I'm gonna do this
outside of the Flex letter and I'm just
gonna have a link here and this link is
going to be to a level up tuts video
it's gonna be one of our sublime text to
tutorials URL right here I'm gonna paste
it in here so here and we're gonna say
watch our video okay
and I've been actually make this an h2
because I want it to be super big okay
don't say that okay and we're gonna have
to add a class to this so if you look
through the fancy box documentation here
we can see using media helper our HTML
has to have well it doesn't have to have
a class but we're gonna use this fancy
box media and we're gonna get then key
off that in our JavaScript so let's
click here and we're gonna add a class
to fancy box media on the anchor and
let's save this page I'm just gonna save
and continue so I don't leave here and
now let's open up our script file and
I'm going to go back to this I'm
actually just gonna grab this code right
here and then we're going to change it
to fit our site so down here I'm going
to add this fancy box media it's looking
for this class fancy box media that we
just added and it's going to say add a
fancy box to it you know no opening
effect no closing effect that's fine
with me and we'll save this and actually
we need to add this JB for the dollar
sign if you remember make sure that
jQuery is getting called correctly
and let's refresh this homepage and now
let's click this watch video as you can
see our video box oh that's me talking
our video has a fancy boxed in here I'm
actually want to check this out I'm
gonna inspect this because I want to see
it should be giving me a a close button
and I want to know where it's looking
for that button so I'm opening this link
in a new tab and it's saying it's
looking in skinned front and LevelUp so
it's looking in the CSS directory for
images it wasn't really clear from the
demo how they were doing that so I just
wanted to make sure but imma grab all
these images throw them in our CSS and
this might look a little bit better now
I'm gonna X out of this and let's
refresh the page and try it again watch
our video okay we now have an egg
again we now have an X button up here
and we're light boxing the sweet video
into our site and it's all working and
check it out it's even sort of
responsive it it sort of adjusts here
it's not perfect but it's it's pretty
good so if in fact if we were to have
this smaller like this and then we're
open it yeah it's going to be the screen
size so we have a fancy box working we
have a slideshow you can add all sorts
of cool stuff to your site now with this
and these are sort of techniques that
you see frequently but really if you
learn jQuery you can do a whole lot so
as always this is Scott with level up
tons if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment in the
video or hit us up on Twitter and level
up Tut's less than what you're thinking
