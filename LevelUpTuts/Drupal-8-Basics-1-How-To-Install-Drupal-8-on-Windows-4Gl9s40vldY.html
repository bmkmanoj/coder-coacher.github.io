up tutorials and in this video we'll
show you how you can install Drupal 8 on
Windows now I'm going to be using
Windows 10 for this example however it
should work very similarly on older
versions of Windows as well so let's get
going on that right now so to get
started
we first need to download a couple of
things we need a server basically to run
our site that being MAMP because MAMP is
free and it's easy so we can click
download this is MAMP info i'll have
this link in the description of the
video itself but after you get to
download we can then click download
again once more and it'll download that
application that we can install in our
computer if you don't already have
something like this already and while
that's downloading we can also grab
Drupal 8 now Drupal 8 can be found here
at drupal.org slash 8 and you'll notice
this nice new look to Drupal's website I
don't even know if this was here last
week when I was just on this site
so in this so in the other tutorial
videos if you see drupal.org it might
look a little bit differently a little
bit more like this so let's actually
head back and let's click download
button right here now I personally
usually grab the territory but since out
of the box windows doesn't have a way to
extract these files when you click the
zip so if you do have a way or an
application that you can use to install
or to unzip tar.gz files then go right
ahead or just look in an app store the
Windows Store and grab something that
does that but for right now it's just to
keep this easy I'll grab the zip okay so
now that we have everything downloaded
we can come to our downloads and you see
we have MAMP here let's just double
click on map to install it's going to
ask us if we'd like to run it let's go
ahead and run it and it's going to run
the Installer accept the Terms ok and
we're going to have MAMP installed okay
so now MAMP is completely installed
let's go ahead and also unzip Drupal
here what we can do is just double click
on this Drupal compressed zip
and we're going to extract it into this
downloads folder so let's just go ahead
and click extract and then extract all
and it's going to throw it into our
downloads folder so let's go ahead and
do that okay so now that we have
everything downloaded let's open up a
couple of windows here my computer what
we want to do is have one that looking
at our local disk our C Drive and we're
going to open up the MAMP folder now
inside of the mam folder we have an HT
Doc's folder now htdocs is where your
website lives since we have a bunch of
files we want to be putting in here
let's actually just delete this entire
folder and what we're going to do is
move the Drupal folder from our
downloads so we have a Drupal folder
inside of that is a actual Drupal folder
inside of this is all the files we want
to move all these files but let's just
do so by dragging over this Drupal
folder into our map directory and now
that this is here let's rename this
htdocs because MAMP is going to be
looking for HT ducks
okay so we now have HT ducks we have
this should be full of your Drupal site
files let's go ahead and open up MAMP
now I'm going to close this window and
let's go ahead and open a map we can
just double-click on the application and
now ya man Pro is a paid product so you
don't need to worry about that just
check out MAMP for now it's nice and
free and after these two boxes have
green squares inside of them we have our
Apache and my sequel up and running we
can go ahead and click this open start
page now this open start page is going
to take us to localhost forward slash
map which is going to be where we'll
have some tools here now we also want to
open up a new tab and we'll just type in
localhost and as you can see after
coming to localhost we should be
redirected to core slash install now I'm
here we can select language and click
Save and continue now after this we'll
want to select a profile now we don't
need to worry about profiles just yet
but we want the standard installation so
we'll leave the standard checked and
click Save and continue
X is going to verify some requirements
one of which it's not going to find this
PHP opcode caching we don't need to
worry about this this isn't a production
server it's highly recommended for site
performance but since this is just for
development right now we don't have to
worry too much and we can just click
continue anyways now from here we'll
need to add a database information by
default in MAMP the database username is
root and the password is also root from
here we can have a database name but we
need to create a database first so back
at our map start page we can go ahead
and click tools PHP my admin now
phpMyAdmin allows us to create a new two
bit new database so right here on the
Left we can just click new and we can
give this a name like Drupal 8 okay now
that we have this database we'll just
click create and it's going to create us
a new database so here we have a listed
in the sidebar and in our database table
right here Drupal 8 and so now that we
have a database we can enter database
name so Drupal 8 let's click Save and
continue
now that the database is found Drupal is
going to install so we'll just let this
progress bar go as it installs Drupal
onto our localhost okay after that's
completed installing we now have the
options to configure our site so we can
just say site name level of tutorials
site email address is going to be my own
email username could be anything you'd
like I like to have this maybe not admin
but for this example admin is fine
people like to guess admin if you look
at your server logs sometimes if you
have a Drupal site you can just see a
whole bunch of hackers trying passwords
for admin so maybe give it something
else other than admin that way those
passwords won't ever work okay and this
very weak password here that I'm using
is only because this is a local machine
now if you were doing this on a any sort
of production anything you'll want this
password to be as strong as it gets okay
so now default country I'm going to set
to United States
and a default timezone I'm going to set
to my timezone just so everything is
displaying correctly to what I would
expect let's come to up up up up up
there's a lot of these okay and now you
can choose if you want email
notifications or not I'm going to
uncheck that just because I don't need
any more emails let's click Save and
continue
okay so we now have a new Drupal site
all installed and ready to go now I
should warn you that the rest of these
videos in the series are going to be on
the OS X install of this however it's
going to be the exact same so don't get
put off if you do not see this windows
bar down here the videos will be the
exact same content either way if you're
on Windows or PC so as always this is
Scott will level up tutorials if you
want the rest of these videos before
they're released head to store dot level
of tutorials comm and purchase early
access of this series as always this is
