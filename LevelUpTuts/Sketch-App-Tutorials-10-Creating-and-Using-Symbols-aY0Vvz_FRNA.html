up huts and today we're going to show
you how to use symbols in sketch three
now what we're going to do is we're
going to take a header from a website
and we're going to transform it into a
symbol that way we can use it across
multiple artboards and then whenever we
update it in one it's going to remain in
sync and updated throughout others so
like how we did textiles a couple of
videos ago however it's going to be with
whole sections of content symbols are a
really powerful feature in sketch 3 and
they're going to really speed up your
workflow so check it out we're going to
get started ok so to get started we're
going to need to create a new artboard
so we can click insert artboard now
let's select mobile portrait because we
want this to be a mobile site let's just
select this mobile portrait and we get a
3 20 width by 1024 actually let's trim
this height down to 600 just to make
this more visible here and what we're
going to do first is create a heading
bar or like the top navigation bar of
our website so I'm going to click R to
create a new rectangle and I'm just
going to click this out here sort of
generally and then adjust the size to be
320 pixels because that's our width now
the position we can set to be 0 and 0
because this is relative to our artboard
and it's the top left here now let's
turn off some borders and let's make the
fill a LevelUp tuts type of purple we
can come in here and just make it any
sort of purple perfect
we now have a rectangle here now let's
add some text I have the text tool and
I'm going to type level up tuts of
course we don't want this awful font
this a chalkboard font so we're going to
select
I like rowboat oh so we're going to use
that okay here we go and let's zoom in a
little bit and now what we're going to
create is the hamburger style navigation
menu so what I want to do is click R to
create a rectangle I'm going to just
click and drag and it doesn't have to be
too exact however I'm going to remove
the borders and make the fill white now
by selecting this I can hit command D
twice make two more and space them out
just a little bit like so now if we
select all three of these rectangles
using our alignment skills we can
distribute them vertically and then we
can align them horizontally
okay now this doesn't look quite right
so let's actually select all three of
them and click command G to put them in
a group and now we can transform them
like they were one shape so I'm going to
click and drag okay so we now have this
hamburger menu and let's position that
like so and let's zoom out okay okay so
this is our our header here and this is
our page let's actually say this is
let's rename this mobile portrait let's
say this is going to be the home page
and let's say we wanted to have an about
Us page so let's go ahead and right
click where it says home page and then
we can duplicate this we now have what's
called the home page number two we can
rename this to about page okay so let's
say we build out these sites these two
layouts are different we show it off and
one of our design leads is saying all
right this color purple isn't quite
right let's actually go ahead and make
this a teal instead of a purple so you
select the rectangle uh-oh I'm selecting
the about Us page rectangle and I go to
changes to a teal and the problem is is
that this one isn't updating now okay
this isn't a problem really right now
because you could always select both of
these and change them at once but let's
say you have an entire site Maktub
you don't want to have to change this on
every single artboard that's going to be
huge pain
so this is where symbols come into play
let's go ahead and actually delete
everything in the about Us page like so
now I'm going to create a group out of
this content by doing command G on the
after I've selected everything and I'm
going to name this folder header bar
okay with this folder selected I can now
click the Create symbol button what this
is going to do is it's going to
transform this group in to a symbol and
that symbol is going to be named header
bar because that's what our group was
named now it's important that you name
your groups and your symbols in a way
that's going to make sense because
really if you have a whole lot of
symbols it's you want to see how to
glance exactly what you're using okay so
how do we use this now we can click
insert now and we can say insert symbol
and then header bar that's going to drop
in our header bar now we can position
this exactly where we want it or we can
just use the inspector here to say
zero-zero of this artboard cool so these
are the same now we have the same
situation we select the rectangle and we
change this to teal and voila
they are both changing so it's not only
just the color if we change something
like the text let's make this a super
huge 50 pixels temporarily you can see
that changes on both we can set it back
to our 28 we want to add something like
a drop shadow we can add a shadow it
adds it to both we want to add a border
it's going to add it to both basically a
symbol is going to stay in sync every
single place that it's used it's going
to stay in sync across artboards and
even if we create another page and
insert a header bar it's going to stay
in sync there now let's say we didn't
actually get this named correctly at
first we didn't want this to be named
head
a bar we just want it to be header we
can select our symbol and then over here
in your inspector where it says header
bar if you click on that you can say
manage symbols if we manage the symbol
here's our our symbols we can double
click it change the name header enter
now let's click close this is now known
as the header although it still says
header bar in the group if we go to
insert a symbol it's now just going to
say header cool so we've now made a
symbol which is really one of the most
powerful and exciting tools in sketch 3
in fact it's probably my favorite
feature of sketch 3 you can create these
symbols and maybe let's say you create
an entire kitchen sink page of
attributes and elements and whatever you
style them to be the way you want them
and then you use them as building blocks
to build out your design it's like your
own personal UI kit and then maybe you
modify those elements in the process of
making the design and it updates
throughout your entire document as well
as your kitchen sink it's just really
unbelievable these things come in handy
so much so get using make some shapes
make some symbols and use them
throughout your projects make your own
tool kits whatever so as always this is
