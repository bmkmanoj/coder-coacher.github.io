up tubs and today I'm gonna be talking
about bolt content management and this
is a bolt that cm if you're interested
in checking out this URL and what bolt
is is it's a sophisticated lightweight
and simple CMS and you may be wondering
what it's like well it's open source and
it's written in PHP it's using a
Symphony if you're familiar with that
and it's under the MIT license you can
check out their code on github if you
would like but I would really just
suggest checking out the install video
that I'm going to do next and pawing
through bolt and really just trying to
build something simple with it because
from what I found
bolt is a really great system for
getting a nice site up and quick and you
can offers a lot of flexibility that
comes really easily to bolt and doesn't
come so easily to some other content
management systems both uses a lot of
terms that you're familiar with from
content management systems like Drupal
like taxonomy and a content types you
will see these words thrown around here
and they mean the same things that they
mean in Drupal however what both does
give you access to that Drupal does not
is easy access to all of the templates
which are written using twig which we'll
go over but really bolt is just a great
little content management system here
and it's capable of doing a whole lot it
even has a fully responsive admin theme
that works great on your phone and so if
you're going to be modifying content on
your phone or tablet it's going to be a
really nice experience pretty much no
matter where you're doing it so these
are a lot of upsides I personally
haven't had enough time to play around
and find it a whole lot of negatives
with both I can tell you after using it
for a little bit now that I'm planning
on using bold for quite a few projects
upcoming that I'm going to be getting
into that something like Drupal just
seems like too much of an overkill but I
would still like to be able to have
close access to my templates and write
my own custom content types so if this
sounds like something that interests you
feel free to check out these bolt
tutorials in it either
what you should probably just to install
it and check it out and see what it's
like you might like it
alright well in the next video we're
going to get into installing bolt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
