up huts and today we're gonna be talking
about the shorthand syntax for Susy and
this allows you to set up settings using
this shorthand syntax so if these last
sort of maps that we created seemed a
little verbose to you then this is
probably going to be right up your alley
because what these shorthand syntax
allows you to do it's really pass in
arbitrary settings right it allows you
to just pass in the settings into
functions or like mix-ins like the
layout mixin and they will just be able
to interpret what you were trying to go
for so as an example let's convert our
wide layout map into a shorthand syntax
that we can pass into this layout mixin
so to show you how cool this is all we
have to do is type 20 for space and then
we're basically going to be putting in
all of our our parameters inside of this
parenthesis separated by spaces so then
we could say the gutters were 1/4 it's
fluid floating is the style and we want
it to be inside so okay so now we're no
longer using this in fact to make that
obvious let's just straight-up comment
it out and click Save so here we have
our settings so the exact same as here
except for we didn't have to define them
in a map or anything like that now let's
come back to our page and hit refresh
and the site is using this 24 column
layout how incredible is that we didn't
tell these variables to be in any sort
of order or anything like that in fact
if we must pick up fluid and put it over
here let's save it
refresh it still works let's take this
24 delete it and move it to the end
now let's refresh and we broke it okay
so how do we fix this well the cool
thing about
this shorthand syntax is that it's
pretty freeform you don't have to worry
too much however there's an order to
things the order is that the shorthand
syntax wants span information first then
grid information second and then
keywords however the thing about
keywords is that they can go anywhere so
when we moved fluid from the front -
from the back to the front nothing went
wrong but when we moved one of the grid
variables to the back it didn't work
because our order needs to be spammed
grid and then keywords can be anywhere
well the problem is is we have this 1/4
here and that's also part of the grid so
now what we've done is we've had part of
the grid defined here and part of it
defined here in fact this would go back
to working if we once again remove this
and put it after the 24 saved it and
let's click refresh cool so the keywords
can pretty much go anywhere but a nice
order is span grid keywords just - I
mean if you want to keep it organized I
would probably just stick with that
anyways so now we have this layout that
we defined with all of this code here
done in one line with this layout
function now you can pass in pretty much
any weight while not pretty much you can
pass in any setting that Suzy takes into
here so please by all means this is not
the end of the line here for these
settings you can go into their
documentation and see all of the
ridiculous amount of settings that you
can just throw into this shorthand
syntax now for some more examples I'm
going to show you let's say we wanted
just a simple 960 grid you could define
the standard 960 grid that everybody's
used to by saying include layout then we
have 12 columns and they're going to be
60 pixels wide with 10 column gutters
which are going to be split and it's
going to be
medic let's come to our page and refresh
and now we have our standard 960 grid
although it's a bit funky here because
that we don't have a 960 width container
so let's actually go ahead and say the
container is not 80% it's going to be
960 pixels save and refresh and this is
maybe a little bit more of what you're
used to so this is just part of the the
shorthand syntax right so we're gonna
take a quick break here and we will
catch up to you in the next video where
we show you what you can do not only
with the shorthand syntax in the span
mixin but what you can do with the
layout function to create maps out of
the shorthand syntax so as always this
is Scott with level up Hutt's if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video hit us up at Twitter
Facebook anywhere let us know what you
think we'd love to hear from you and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
