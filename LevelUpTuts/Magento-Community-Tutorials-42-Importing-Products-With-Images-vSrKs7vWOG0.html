up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to import your products into Magento
and import the images with them and it's
not tough to do it just takes a little
bit of a setting up so what I've gone
ahead and done is I've exported the data
from our site by going to system and
then we have import and export in an
export from here
I chose products and as a CSV
I didn't filter at all and I just export
it completely now this is the way I
believe it's best to make sure that you
have all of the correct columns that you
need is to just simply export your
system as it is in fact we can see all
of our products in here already now
you'll see that along with their titles
and everything like we went over in the
previous video we have um right here for
image we have their image and that's at
the actual location that the image is
stored at we also have over here far to
the right far to the right far to the
right we have the media image which are
what as well is the location of the
image as well as the image and notice
how it's n-o so it takes the first
letter than the second letter to store
your images and then it also has media
attribute ID 703 and then we have media
position and media disabled so media
disabled you'll notice is either 0 or 1
a 1 is going to set the image to be
excluded we also have media position
which is going to set the image to its
position 0 1 2 so to illustrate this I
have the same Nokia phone opened in our
back-end of our site and if you want to
check to make sure everything is the
same if you look at open this image in a
new tab we have the Nokia - 2 phone
right here is this first image you'll
notice it's sort order 0 and has nothing
for its label and then it's excluded
now if we look at the Nokia - is zero
for its position and it is excluded now
if you're wondering of how we have each
one set to the store thumbnail and base
image you'll scroll over here and you'll
see it's where we're actually telling it
this is to the left by the way you'll
see where it's actually telling it there
is going to be a thumbnail column keep
going I'm going to see it so we have the
thumbnail image column and this is going
to be the image name the - - that we saw
there and if we keep going over we will
see the small image and of course we're
going to see the media image the one
that we looked at first so here we go
the image right here and so this is
where we need to define our image names
we're uploading these files so let's go
ahead and get rid of all of this
information so I'm just going to get rid
of this keep in mind I'm using
OpenOffice here you can use a you can
use Excel or anything like that although
I know there is some sort of a weird
encoding bug with the OS X version of
Excel that will cause some issues if
you're trying to import products that
might say the SKU is not available I
touched on this in the last video where
I gave a workaround that involved
uploading it to Google Drive or
something to get rid of it if you're
using OpenOffice like I am we can just
make sure we export it in the right
settings and it will work fine
especially even on Mac so let's go ahead
and create a product I have three images
here and there are these three images of
some T it says type of T that's like a
their little T balls that bloom you may
have seen them in these tutorials before
I frequently have these pictures because
my parents have ran a tea site for a
little while where they sell this type
of tea so I have I have a surplus of
these images so I have my images here
and I want to create my product and I'm
just going to make up a dummy SKU
because this isn't a real product but of
course if you had your story you're
going to want to make sure you have all
the correct information filled in now I
don't even attribute set T so I'm going
to have that as our attributes at T our
type is a simple product now I'm not
going to go over the rest of these other
fields just the ones that are important
here and have to deal with the images if
you'd like to learn more about what
these other fields are we have to fill
out these columns go ahead and watch the
other video on importing products this
one is specifically about importing
images themselves and now we're going to
be coming up to our first image and
let's grow over it's this image right
here so let's go ahead and pick one of
these images now I'm just going to pick
this first one right here and all you
really need to do is copy the name of
the image don't worry about location
airy thing because Magento is going to
put this image in the correct folder
itself once we upload it so now we need
to keep going over so let's keep going
over and we have small image here so now
for the same small image I'm also going
to have the same image and then for the
thumbnail I'm going to use a different
one just so we can mix it up here a
little bit use this one right down here
okay okay and I'm not going to worry
about any labels or anything we have so
even if you have all of those images
filled in right you have the thumbnail
or whatever if you don't have this media
image right here filled in it's not
going to do anything so we'll put in
this one which was the second image we
grabbed now I need to grab the first one
again just copy and paste this this
entire file name directly we go here's
the second one and let's grab this third
one
okay cool so now we have all these media
images now you need this media attribute
ID but you want to get it from your
outputs mine was 703 so all I need to
add here is 703 and you need that for
the images now this is going to be just
basically if you run an output on your
products that you have uploaded already
you can see exactly what this attribute
ID is we don't need a label for any of
these but we do want to have a position
for them so we can just say actually
let's do 0 1 2 and then just for fun
we'll have this be 0 1 0 just for which
one is disabled and which one is not so
now we have pretty much everything we
need here if I'm missing something
then this is going to let me know now
let's come back to our Magento site and
if we try to upload the products right
now as is using the same import file
it's not actually going to bring in the
images so how do we get those images in
there well we need to put them in a
folder and that folder is in our media
at the base level of our Magento
installation so inside of media is going
to be another folder that is import
notice how I don't have an import folder
you might as well not have an import
folder if you don't have one go ahead
and create one ok so I have this import
folder now I'm going to take all three
of these images copy them and just drag
them into this folder so I have them in
media import now when we run our import
X CSV file it's going to find these
images and upload them based on the
correct file names and put them into the
locations I need to be ok so now there's
not only if their images fields taking
care there are various other images or
fields in this that need to be filled
out and in fact I'm going to take that
up to you for to fill out all of these
because I don't want to have to show you
you know all of these quantity and stock
fields getting filled out so go ahead
and fill those out and then once you're
done come back to here where we can come
in save as our file and I want to make
sure I have this edit
your settings checked and that's going
to make sure that when we save it to our
desktop it allows us to use unicode
utf-8 and this is something that's
specific to Macintosh OpenOffice and
then a bug basically when you go to
upload I touched on this in the last
importing products video as well so
we'll click OK and now we have our file
let's come to our import screen now we
want to say we want to import our
products we want to append complex data
we want to choose our CSV
let's check the data here it's going to
say it's fine and now we can click
import ok our import is successful and
now let's come to our catalog manage
products and let's see this new product
we created here we have it is it's our
tea blooms so let's click Edit and then
when we go to images we can see our
images one two three
notice how the correct ones are set to
thumbnails store view and the correct
one is excluded as we even told it to so
let's just now that we have this let's
add it to a category so we can see it on
the front of the site and we can just
put it under we'll just put under lots
of stuff so that it's easy to find okay
it doesn't matter because it doesn't
really fit any of these categories ok so
here we have it let's go to furniture
then now let's confront ature living
room and if we scroll down here RT
blooms the correct thumbnail image the
correct zoomable image and they're the
correct images excluded or image
excluded so great we've now successfully
imported products with our Magento site
and their images the big thing is just
that you need to have your images in
this import folder and you need to fill
out all those correct paths you need the
attribute ID the image attribute ID and
yeah so that's it as always if you have
any questions or comments please do come
in the video below I just have to remove
laptops or check us out on the new
level of touch forum where you can post
and ask questions there so thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
