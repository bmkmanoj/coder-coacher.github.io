up tutorials and in this video I'm going
to show you a little bit about the what
and why of post CSS now we went over
sort of the very most basics in the
series introduction however this video
is going to give you a little bit more
in depth about what you can really
accomplish with post CSS and what we're
going to be covering so check it out
let's get going right now so now that
post CSS has been out for a little bit
the benefits and improvements over other
systems are becoming even more and more
obvious so you might be wondering why I
need another sort of CSS system I'm
probably already working with something
like sass or stylus or maybe you're
still working with less so why do you
need post CSS and you don't really need
post CSS but it makes your life a lot
easier
basically can you imagine just totally
forgetting that prefixes ever existed
so when sass first came out it was sort
of wild that you could use something
like compass and have all of these
mix-ins for every single css3 property
that exists so you could use a mixin for
border-radius or something like that and
then it would take care of all of the
prefixes for you well with post CSS and
it's packages you can sort of forget
that things like prefixes exist at all
so you can type your CSS your sass your
stylus new or less whatever you can type
your code as you would have typed it
years ago without any sort of idea that
a prefix existed so you could type
something like border - radius and then
define it with the properties just like
you would any other CSS property and
then the autoprefixer package for post
CSS will just come in and fill in the
prefixes for you now autoprefixer is
just one of tons of post CSS packages
now to understand a little bit about
what post CSS does and why it's
different from a preprocessor is that
basically it looks at your CSS and with
syntax in your CSS no special
of mix-ins and stuff like that with
syntax in your CSS it then processes
your CSS to then modify it so for
instance like I said we have border -
radius and you define it just like
normal like without any sort of prefixes
at all and then the output is with all
of the prefixes and you didn't have to
think about it so that's really the best
part about things like post CSS is that
it just adds nice little fixes and it
allows you to use things like the next
iterations of CSS the CSS that you can't
quite used yet but as in influx in
development allows you to use those
features so your CSS will be future
compatible however it's going to be
currently compatible as well because
after it's run through post CSS it's
going to be outputting everything you
need to have it working today so it's
important to note that post CSS is
really just sort of a wrapper for
additional packages on its own post CSS
isn't giving you a whole lot what it is
giving you is the ability use a whole
bunch of different plugins so as you can
see they're on a post CSS github page
they have plug-in packs they have a
various future CSS syntax plugins fall
backs language extensive like language
language extensions like using things
like mix-ins and variables and things
like that and maps then there have a
various color packages images and fonts
in fact the lost grid written by corey
Simmons is my personal favorite grid in
the world it it is awesome and then we
have things like optimizations shortcuts
and other sort of stuff and even
analysis so you can get and linters that
lint your CSS with syntax tiles like ve
m and can even give you a CSS statistics
we have reporters and there's some even
some fun things here that are just sort
of interesting so there's like Canadian
style sheets but to just essentially
change things like color to color with a
U and important is turned it to sorry
okay so we have Canadian style sheets
and things like that that are just sort
of fun but in addition
we're post CSS really shines is in these
packs things like style and rucksack
rucksack is just an awesome collection
of shortcuts pre CSS which allows you to
use sass like CSS so it's essentially to
use sass like syntax within your CSS and
then a pre CSS next which allows you to
use future CSS features today and just
compiles them correctly like you can see
rucksack says it's a little bag of CSS
superpowers and there's some awesome
little helpers in here so basically why
do you need post CSS well post yes this
is great because you can use it with
your existing system you can use it
without your existing system but
basically it just makes your life easier
which is what you set out to do in the
first place by learning any of the
preprocessor Xin generals so check out
post CSS we're going to get into a bunch
of stuff about how to add it to your
workflow right now as always this is
