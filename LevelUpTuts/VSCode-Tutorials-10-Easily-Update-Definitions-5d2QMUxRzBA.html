up tutorials and in this video I'm going
to give you a quick rundown of a feature
that I really really like in vs code
this is gonna be super simple so I'm not
gonna take too much time so first things
first I want to give credit where
credit's do I first saw this technique
in Raich Smith's tweets here you can you
can follow her I'll have the link to her
Twitter profile in the description if
you don't already follow her she's a
great person to follow so if you like I
said if you don't already follow her
give her a follow so I first saw this
technique on her Twitter feed here and
it's a feature that you might not have
known existed let's say you have a
function or literally anything it could
be like a react component or something
like that and you've decided that the
name of this component is no longer what
you want right maybe for some reason
this has changed so let's think about
this I have a component here that's
named header and I have a style which is
header wrapper now header wrapper made
more sense when this header component
was not living on its own mmm
since it's inside of the header and I'm
not exporting this wrapper anywhere else
I mean maybe I could change the name
from header wrapper to simply wrapper
because it's a wrapper with and header
right now not saying you that's the best
course of action but this is a good
example now one way you could do this is
by coming in here and changing okay
wrapper have a is an extension to change
the bottom one as well and then you'd
have to come in here and change at the
definition now a quicker way to do that
is to simply just select the function
the component or whatever it is you're
talking about and then you can hit f2 if
you have one of these fancy new Macs
with the touch bar you have to hit
function to get the F keys to show up f2
and then you get this nice little box
underneath your declaration here and we
can change this just by deleting the
word header and changing it to wrapper
now watch closely on line 22 where it
says Const header wrapper hit enter and
it's now changed to wrap
now this is super duper handy because as
you can tell I just did all then one
keystroke it changed everything and I
didn't have to go hunting for it the
definition if you have something like a
style component or even just general
functions right this isn't limited to
react or something like that
it's going to update both the current
one as well as the definition so if you
hate your functions name and you want to
modify it
check out f2 + vs code it's going to
allow you to update that function as
well as the definition name as always
this is Scott with low level tutorials
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
