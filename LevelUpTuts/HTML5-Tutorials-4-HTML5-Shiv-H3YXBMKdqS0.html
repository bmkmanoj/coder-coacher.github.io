up tuts and today we're going to
continue our html5 series by talking
about the html5 Shiv so what is the
html5 Shiv well it's really just some
JavaScript that adds the html5 elements
to earlier versions of Internet Explorer
and this is helpful because if you're
developing a site and you wanted to work
on ie 8 or i7 or anything and you want
to be doing it in html5 because you
should that you should have been and if
you aren't starting all your sites in
html5 right now you should start your
very next site in html5 because that's
just what you should be using but if you
need to support those browsers which a
lot of people do then you're going to
need this html5 Shiv
so go ahead to code.google.com/speed
slash html5 Shiv and go ahead and grab
it a lot of people call it a shiv or a
shim in fact people in our department
have even had this conversation but
there's even a note about that down here
it says is it a shimmer Shiv it says it
doesn't matter
so you've caught what you'd like
although this page says Shiv
so I'm gonna color Shiv in the video so
we're going to click download here and
all we're going to need to do is add
this code to our site and it's just a
one-liner or JavaScript you can even
grab it from here
so we're just going to throw this in our
JavaScript folder and since this is just
a one pager I can just throw this this
file right in here
and this also includes a readme with
some information if you'd like to check
it out
you can also get the code unwanted
what's going on which is always really
helpful with these utilities but you can
see it adds legacy support for an inter
Explorer 6 through 9 Safari 4 and of
iPhone 3 and a Firefox 3 and up
basically if it's adding these elements
that the browser does in half and not
only is it adding the elements but it
also adds their default CSS styling so
it gets correct if like a section should
be a block level item it's going to get
that so like it says all you need to do
is add this and we have our code here
and what you want to do is you want to
add it into your header they actually
say just edit after CSS for the sake of
performance and so we're just going to
paste in here make it look all nice and
then we're going to say this is in the
jas folder and before we're done we're
also going to throw this html5 print
ship in here too and we save this that's
it we have our html5 site is now the
elements should be recognized in older
browsers and we can get on with coding
our website and not have to worry about
the browser not recognizing these
elements as always this is got the love
Tut's if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video or
hit us up on Twitter and level up Tut's
as always we really appreciate you
watching and like I said we do this
stuff in our own free time and we hope
to keep pushing out videos as fast as we
can but keep the high quality up and
give you exactly what you want so as
always thanks for watching this is Scott
and have a good one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
