but if you haven't seen sketch before
it's basically a design app that it
feels very much like principle it it's
sort of like a lighter-weight
illustrator for web and UX design it's a
really great application and would
highly recommend now what's great about
principle is that principle allows you
to import directly from sketch now to do
so you want to make sure you have sketch
open first and what I'm going to mention
is basically what we need to do is the
artboard that you want to import it
probably should be on its own page
because otherwise if I were to import
with this window open
currently then really what's gonna
happen is it's gonna bring in all this
stuff and you know principle needs all
same-sized artboards these are all very
different artboards so it's not gonna
work it's gonna be just a total mess so
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to select
which is this mobile nav open artboard
I'm gonna copy this I'm gonna throw it
onto its own new page paste it in here
and with this open because principle is
going to use whichever current page your
browse to with this page open just like
this I'm gonna go ahead and open up
principle now from here I'm gonna select
the import button up top and you'll
notice it says sketch sketch and the
version of the file is Web Design
prototype now we could bring this in at
various sizes you could scale the assets
by two or three I'm gonna leave the set
by one here so it's just the same size
but as you can see here you're gonna
want to make sure that it says sketch
not sketch beta if you have sketch beta
open you know if you have if you're
running two versions of sketch or
something you want to make sure this has
the right version of sketch whichever
one you have up and running as well as
the correct document because it does it
looks at whatever the dot like if you
have multiple documents open it's gonna
look at whichever one is essentially
focused and on top along with whatever
page is focused at on top so there's not
a ton of options here
but you should be able to know hey I
have this open it's going to bring in
this okay so let's click import and as
you can see here our image goes below
the artboard bounds and that's alright
but we have our artboard and we have
this mobile navigation brought in
exactly from sketch so the reason why
this is cool is we can quickly do
something I'm gonna just hit command D
on this to open this up and in this one
I'm going to have the nav open in this
one I'm gonna pull the nav off to the
side here like this and now what we can
do is say hey when you click anywhere on
this artboard let's just actually select
the whole airport itself you notice we
have this billboard which is something
we can't necessarily touch here but what
we can do is we could select this whole
group mobile may have open select our
lightning bolt and say on tap let's go
to this other artboard here okay so now
on tap we click that and you can see
there's some weirdness it brought this
thing into this other artboard this
mobile move here let's let's go ahead
and try to get these a little bit
further apart principle kind of likes to
do some of this stuff for you like the
artboard position management so i'm
gonna have to nudge this over a little
bit at a time so it's not putting it on
to the other artboard okay so here we
are things have adjusted okay we click
this and now this now shows up just like
that but what it's not doing is it's not
animating for us right we tapped on this
this itself is not animating now you
might be wondering hey what's up with
that in the last video all we had to do
was say tap we moved this from here to
here and an animated for us well if
you'll notice there's some weirdness
going on here in fact it so we have
mobile nav open mobile Neve open too but
you'll notice this folder is named nav
too and this one's named nav
let's go ahead and modify that and keep
on hitting Enter by accident let's go
ahead and come in here and rename this
just by double selecting it and making
it named nav now well notice something
interesting when that happens when we
run our preview slides in though and
that's super cool right I mean sure this
animation isn't it's not great whatever
but we imported this design from sketch
and it's now being animated so you might
be wondering what was it here that
prevented this from animating just now
and the answer is is that the way
principle works it's going to be looking
for layers of the same name in your
navigation here so it's gonna be looking
singing in from this artboard to this
artboard is there another layer named
nav and if so let me get the before and
after position of it and let's animate
that but when this was named it nav to
it wasn't seeing that as being the exact
same thing as nav even though visually
it was the same thing so you're gonna
want to make sure if you're having any
sort of issues like that that you have
things named the same across artboards
okay so we've now successfully imported
a design from sketch directly into
principle with like little to no effort
it was super easy super cool so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you want to have access to
all of the principal files that we
create through the course of this video
you can purchase this series out right
from store dot level up tutorials
dot-com or you can become a subscriber
and become a LevelUp pro get access to
all of these videos before they're
available on YouTube
get access to all of the principal files
and get access to some exclusive videos
where I describe how to make some really
complex excellent principle files so as
always this is Scott thanks for watching
and I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
