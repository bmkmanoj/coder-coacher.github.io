up tuts and today we're gonna continue
where we left off and we're gonna create
a first Android app and it's gonna be
hello world but like I said it sort of
does it for you so we're going to go
through the steps of how you can create
a new Android application with the SDK
that we have downloaded and set up okay
well let's get started
so you can do is you can this build your
first app and if you're new to android
you can follow this and learn the
fundamentals of the api is for creating
an interface their response to input you
can design your app you can test your
app but really we're just going to start
a new app and we're gonna do file new
new android project okay so file new
Android application project click go and
now it's gonna ask for my application
name and report just go and call this
level up tons and you could see it's
done some stuff for you here it gives
you a product name that's actually all
with no spaces and it's giving you a
package name as well and this package
name is sort of like you know it's gonna
be sort of your company and it keep in
mind this package name is going to be
unique to your application so they
always start off with come and then dot
and then this can be like let's say
we're level up Tut's come and we would
want this to be our signature package
whatever that all of our packages are
going to have so if we had a whole
series of apps made by level up Hut's
this come would be then dot level up
let's just say and then this particular
app is named level of huts so this is
come and then dot what your development
name is going to be and then your actual
application name so here this minimum
required SDK is set to 2.2 Froyo and
nowadays I feel like and I don't have
official statistics on this but
definitely most people aren't in Froyo
or up so you can say that the minimum
required SDK is going to be for you you
don't really have to worry about
supporting Eclair anymore donut or
cupcake or any of those and
you know I personally would really like
to see phone manufacturers really step
up their game and upgrading their their
phones to the latest operating system
possible because jelly bean 4.2 is
awesome so you can even start with your
target SDK as the latest compile with
the latest sure and then the theme
there's holo light dark or liked with a
dark action bar this is all great stuff
because in the past it's an injury these
tools haven't given you any of these
options in fact you had to fill out your
project name your package name yourself
it didn't do it I'll do it for you and
you didn't get to choose a a theme to
start off with and certainly so this is
all really nice next and create a custom
launcher icon we're gonna be creating
our own launcher icon but we'll just
have a create a custom launcher icon at
the beginning so you can see how that
works and crane activity yes no this
project is not a library we'll be going
over what that means and ways down the
road and that create a project in this
workspace yes it's putting it at its
folder level up tuts
actually I see I might have capitalized
that P I'm gonna go back yeah I did that
oops no wonder that so funky okay
next and working sets add project to
working set this has been a part of our
working set so okay we're just gonna
ignore this until we're ready to get to
that so let's click Next and now it's
gonna ask us for our custom icon so
here's the icon they give you to start
and you can browse if you already have
an icon prepared but really we're gonna
be creating one at some point and will
actually be replacing the one that's
here so let's just choose one actually I
take that back
let's just have it be this image that it
comes with but you can see you can pick
some clipart if we click Choose here it
gives you some options actually sort of
like this guy better than the 3d one
anyways and then text you can add some
text if you want but I'm not going to
worry about this too much
I'm let's pick the purple blow-up totes
purple and
you know not too much other than that
maybe oh I take it back I keep on adding
to this I'm gonna pick the blue as a
background color that's just to give it
a little bit of level of Tut's look to
it but other than that nothing crazy
okay as you can see this is a nice way
to build a really quick you know icon if
you can't you know navigate Photoshop or
create one yourself so let's go to next
and it gives you some activities to
start with you can choose a blank
activity a full screen activity a login
activity a master detail flow and you
could read about what these are two
columns on tablets one column on smaller
screens master fragment detail fragment
two activities we're gonna get over all
this stuff in a second so we might as
well just create a blank activity and
we'll click Next and we're not gonna
want a navigation because you can see
you actually need a higher minimum SDK
and I don't really feel like going and
changing that now we're gonna get into
those in later tutorials as well so
we're just gonna leave this navigation
type is none main activity activity main
are fine and let's click finish and it's
going to create our app for us and now
you can see in our folder is created a
folder level up tuts with our Android
manifest orb in our resources file you
can see this is where our icon launcher
has ended up so take some time to go
through this file structure and just
look at it see what's there and you
don't have to know what any of this
means at this point but it's nice to
just be familiar with how this directory
is looking so I'm going to close out of
this and now that I've closed out of
that here is our app in fact if I take
this up here you can see a preview of it
right here and it even has a hello world
already centered for us so as you can
see here is our first app it's up and
running it says hello world in the next
lesson I'm going to show you how to set
up an Android virtual device and we're
going to be running this out of the
Android virtual device and you can see
how that works and test your apps in a
real Android phone environment
as always this is Scott with level up
Tut's if you have any questions please
hit us up in the comments and it's about
twitter at level up Tut's let us know
what you're thinking we want to hear
from you and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
