of Tut's and today we're going to go
over styling lists okay and this can be
really useful for things like a
navigation is a common way that people
use lists or just a bulleted list or you
know we'll check it out okay so let's
first off we need a list and I'm not
super happy I'm gonna start making this
document that we have here start making
it look more like an actual website that
somebody might want to visit so I'm
going to take off this this black
background color I'm going to make it
I'm just going to make it white because
of that I need to make our font color
once again black actually by default
it's black so I can just go here and
delete that and then this h1 we can have
this h1 see get rid of this text align
and get rid of this text transform like
I said I'm just sort of just making this
a little bit more standard here just so
we can have a little bit normal more
normal of like a base okay okay let's
check it out so I mean it's not a ton
better but we'll be making it better in
the next few tutorials okay so let's
imagine this is going to be a navigation
because a common way that people use
lists is for a navigation in fact you'll
see that on almost most sites so right
under this h1 I'm going to have a ul an
unordered list and then I'm going to
have a list item and I'm going to make a
couple of list items so hold on one
second let me just do this okay and as
you can see here it's not too crazy half
an order list the first item has a class
at first the last item has a class of
last and then I just have four links
here if we go to our page or refresh
this and you'll see pretty standard
bulleted list this one's getting a class
first because we had to use this class
first for this paragraph I'm just going
to go ahead and
delete this class off the paragraph and
delete it out of our Styles kit now
refresh this okay
we haven't pretty standard unordered
list so by default you'll notice that
there is a disk it's what is actually is
referred to as for the list style and
what you can do with list Styles you can
have it be a number of things let's
generalize this and we'll have this just
be actually let's give a class to this
this user this unordered list here we'll
do class equals nav ok and and we're
going to say dot nav ok and any items
inside this nib we want the list style
to not be the disk as it is default but
we can say list - style and we can make
this be a circle and now it's an open
circle I mean there's plenty of things
that like this you can use for your list
style I would recommend looking up a
reference to see what all the list style
types are there's nothing you'll
probably ever remember as being just
you'll probably never use these enough
to really memorize them so pretty much
the only thing that you see a lot used
is maybe circle or disk which is the
default or none in fact what we're going
to be using is none because even though
this is an unordered list or a refresh
we wanted to not have any bullet points
because this isn't an outline this is
not a text document this is the
navigation of the site okay the next
thing we want to do is we want to get
all of these in a line a horizontal line
just so it looks more like a navigation
maybe use something that's going
underneath the headline of the site and
you'll also notice here that there is
some padding here these don't line up
so I default the list itself has some
padding so let's remove that let's go to
nav padding equals zero and we haven't
gone over padding or margin anything
like that yet but for right now just
know that you have to put padding zero
here if you want this to be inline with
everything else or
be fresh and you'll see now it's in line
sorry this is so small any bump up this
text size or let me just zoom in here so
you can see they're all lined up here
and so now we want these to display in
one line well there's a way we can do
that with display and so we need to do
this on the list items themself so let's
do dot nav and then we're going to do Li
and then in our brackets we're going to
say display inline so by default some
elements on the page are given a
display:block display:inline-block these
items that are in a list right here and
it's going to display them in line one
two three four so now we have our nav
here if this was a normal site you'd
have your header and then here's your
navigation underneath when I'm hovering
over there as you can see an underline
comes out signifying which link you're
clicking on so well you can do all sorts
of other stuff with lists using list
style the most common things are going
to be doing with lists or having them as
a bulleted list or having them as a you
know horizontal or vertical navigation
item so this is how you have a
horizontal navigation item using lists
in the next couple of tutorials we're
going to go over the CSS box model and
I'm going to teach you how to fill these
out a little bit more so that there's a
little bit more air-breathing between
them and we're going to have this page
that we have here looking a little bit
more like an actual website okay so this
is Lists styling with CSS it's not too
crazy like I said we'll go over padding
when we get over CSS box and and then
later display but for now display:inline
is going to put these links on the line
padding is going to remove all that
extra space around them and
list-style:none is going to remove that
bullet point okay well this is styling
links if you have any comments or
questions please leave a comment of the
video I just up the level up to us
listen what you're thinking once again
this is Scott and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
