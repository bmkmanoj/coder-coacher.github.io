up tutorials and in this video I'm
really going over another one of my
favorite packages now this is the very
best package for working with mark down
in react but before we get started I
want to take a quick break to talk about
the sponsor of this video which is dev
Mountain
so what dev Mountain is is well it's a
coding bootcamp where you can go and you
totally immerse yourself and what I mean
by that is well it's full time so you
show up to one of their locations and
you stay and live there and you
obviously get free housing while you do
this and there's in several different
locations from Provo Salt Lake Dallas
and Phoenix and you show up and
basically you have access to full time
mentors tons of courses and the ability
to just grow as a web developer designer
app developer in a place that really
encourages personal growth so dev
Mountain is super cool because you show
up and get absolutely real-world
training you can see it's very
career-focused they have a huge network
companies like Nike and reddit eBay
Linkedin Apple HP the list goes on and
on and on
so if you're looking to really step up
your career head to dev Mountain dot-com
check out some of their locations check
out their courses request to syllabus
take a tour of the campus isn't just
contact them and step up your game by
taking the leap into becoming a full
time programmer designer any of that
stuff with dev Mountain all right now
back to the tutorial okay so in this
video I'm gonna be talking about some
more my favorite react packages and in
this particular video I want to be
talking about markdown - Jas no I'm not
quite sure when this package was
released but this thing makes working
with markdown super duper easy for a
long time what you've had to do is use a
package called marked which is a
JavaScript package and then you were to
have to dangerously set to HTML whatever
inside of your react now with markdown
to JSX it is an extremely easy setup you
can see we just install markdown to JSX
then we import
to mark down from mark down to JSX and
then we wrap our markdown code in this
markdown tag or component let me bump up
the font size you can see this thing is
super slick right it even works with a
basic string inside of here now as you
can see here it says you know this is
discouraged to just basically have new
lines multi-line text blah blah blah
basically keep your markdown files in a
separate file import them and then throw
them into markdown I'm actually using
this currently on level up tutorials and
I use it basically with some markdown
saved into my database and I'm popping
out the product description right here
inside of a markdown tag you can see I
use this little force block now force
block is one of the options in the
options prop and force block is going to
make this stuff come out as a paragraph
tag as in your basic text is going to be
a paragraph tag if so look what kind of
options do you get inside of this thing
let's head down and check out the API a
little bit so the options that come in
this thing
well options that force block we also
have options force line which is going
to force it in line right we also have
options dot overrides overwrite any HTML
tags representation you can see hey
we're going to override an h1 with your
own component so if you're using
something like styled components this
suddenly gets really interesting because
you can say hey make all of my H ones
into my header tag or card header or
whatever I'm giving you really full
control over the HTML that pops out of
here so these override options are
brilliant I absolutely love this you can
simply just give it a component like
this and you could see a few more
options here like I said this thing is
great as simple as it can be and it
gives you the freedom to give full
control over it if need be
so check it out this package is markdown
to JSX it is an excellent package that
like it mentions you can use with the
reactor pre-act or
anything right so anything that's using
JSX check it out markdown - JSX this is
the best package that I found for
working with markdown in react</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
