tux and today we're going to dive
further into building our own theme and
we're not going to quite get our hands
dirty yet there's still a couple more
things we got to go over first but
they're just some minor things and then
in the next lesson we're going to start
building our theme from scratch okay so
what we need to do first is we need to
go over a little bit about layouts and
blocks so you have these layouts in
blocks right this page is actually using
a two column layout despite it looking
like three columns if you remember when
we went into the static pages and we
went addthis there was actually some
custom layout code in there and it was
giving this a second column despite this
saying it was only two columns so this
main column here in this left column
were actually one column that is just
being done with CSS to prove it to you
if I were to go into CMS static pages
I mean pages non-static blocks and home
page you can see the design of the page
says two columns with right bar like I
said the reason why it's doing something
different is because of the default in
Magento here for the home page has this
left column in the code here so just
ignore this being three columns but what
a layout is is it's the actual layout of
the page as in this is two columns we
have one column which is this main
content here and then we have one column
which is the sidebar main column right
sidebar if we go to a particular product
you can see these are actually two
column pages as well main content right
sidebar and these can all be adjusted
let's say if we want to do it just one
of these specifically for like an
individual product or even let's say the
home page we can say the layout the
layout is now going to be one column
okay now let's refresh let's go to our
home page now it's one column and like
you said it may look like it's two
columns but like I showed you before
that second column is actually just done
for some reason on the page itself so
this is how you change
the layouts in Magento right so you have
these different layouts by default
there's just a one column two column
with their left sidebar two column with
a right sidebar and three columns you'll
be able to create your own but you
shouldn't really need to create the
outside of that unless you you want to
but the layouts is sort of like the
biggest the most global picture here and
then if we go down a little bit more we
have structural blocks and the
structural brach blocks are actually the
components of the layout so the header
this whole bit right here is all
considered a structural block the left
column itself is a structural block the
main column is a structural block the
footer it's a structural block and then
the content blocks are those blocks
within the structural block so let's say
this best selling products this is a
Content block this pole is a Content
block recently view products it's a
Content block okay so this is going to
be very important to understand what's
we get into sort of the XML stuff and
being able to change and move these
around okay we also have something
called widgets right which are
dynamically created pieces of content
that would be blocks on the site that
are sort of dynamically so this popular
tags is considered a widget but it's a
Content block so these blocks of things
can be not only just you know a static
image but it can also be a widget which
we did go over in a previous lesson but
I'm sure there is always more to go over
so let's talk a little bit more about
themes I'm going to show you something
real quick - let's talk about this role
backing that we talked about in the last
lesson so if you don't have any
particular files in your theme let's say
your themes name is default and then of
course it has the default theme in here
if you don't see you know if you don't
have a particular file in here it's
going to go well okay let's put it this
way let's look at the modern theme if
there's not a particular file in the
modern theme first it's going to fall
back to the default it's in your theme
package and then if it doesn't find it
in here it's going to fall back to this
default or your
bass default the lesson here is you're
not going to necessarily want to ever
edit in these bass default theme files
because let's say you mess something up
there's really you know not a whole lot
of ways to fix it if you can't go back
to these default files that you have
here so really the best practice would
be to create your own theme and then
just go from there okay but to show you
about how we change themes and how it's
really cool because you don't have to
have the AB layout stuff if you want to
do only CSS to your site you can do only
CSS by creating us by using just the
skin so if we look at our were in the
folder structure we're in right now is
in skin front end and then default
you'll notice that Magento has all these
themes installed by default with our
site so let's actually show you how you
can enable one of these themes and I'll
get you a better idea so in the next
lesson when we start to create the bones
of our own theme you'll know exactly how
to enable it okay so if we look here we
have modern a blue blank default let's
see what the blue theme looks like and
we're just going to use the CSS for the
blue theme if we go to our site when we
go to system configuration and then now
down to design here on the left you'll
see that we have our current package
name and then themes in your theme it's
allowing you to do different things here
we can see SS just the layout change the
default we're going to right in here
we're going to type in blue because if
you remember there was that blue theme
in our skin file so let's click Save if
we have this in here it saves everything
it should be using the blue theme
variant so let's go to our page and
let's refresh and you should see a new
theme so here here's exactly what it can
be accomplished with just CSS and it
really changes the whole look of the
site here you can do a whole lot more
than just this but this is a nice way to
change it up and you know let's say this
this fits the version of the company
that you're looking for you might not
have to do a whole lot extra
over write some stuff from this and in
the next lesson we're going to start
creating our own theme measure you some
cool developers tools and we'll get into
some neat stuff okay
