up Tut's and today I'm going to be
talking about selector inheritance
incest and so selector inheritance is
pretty useful actually to be honest
don't use it all the time but it can
keep your code a little bit more
organized and if things get sort of
cluttered it can sort of clear up that
and so from last time I didn't change a
whole lot
I pretty much wrapped the second
paragraph and a div and I called it
feature and I also gave the paragraph a
pair one a class name as well just so we
can illustrate that these are pretty
much the same except for the only
difference being this one has a heinous
blue border and so uh as you can see in
my CSS you know typically I mean if we
weren't using sass we would have to do
something like grad intro and then comma
grad feature and then for the next siren
a comma and then for if we want to do
like the pair one inside of that we
would also have to do grad intro dot
pair one and grad feature you get the
point basically we'd have to I mean this
this gets sort of long pretty quickly
although using sass it kind of clears it
up as you can see here with nesting all
the way to do is add the comma feature
and then it gets all of these these
things as well with selector inheritance
it pretty much allows you to keep
feature out of having to use commas here
and what you can do is you can extend
other classes or other other CSS
properties into other classes so let's
go to this feature here and then down
here in feature we're going to add a
at extend and then we're going to say
dot intro and then semicolon and so this
is just saying you know take everything
from dot intro and and then also apply
what else you want so we have a border
one solid pixel of blue so we save this
and we give this a refresh and you can
see nothing changed let's give this a
yellow just so you can see this in
action save as you can see feature now
extends intro and has everything from
intro except for it has a yellow border
as well so that's it for selector
inheritance and our SAS basics series I
hope with these five videos it can get
you going on SAS and then allow you to
experiment a little and try some
interesting things next up we're going
to be doing a advanced SAS series and
it's going to feature some pretty cool
things that you can do assess that you
might not have thought of yourself and
getting into a little bit more advanced
functionality we're also beginning to
things like compass that extend SAS and
make it even more useful so leave a
comment if there's anything you want to
see in that or if you have any questions
feel free to subscribe so you can know
when our latest videos are coming out
and we'll have lots more very soon
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
