love Tut's and today we're going to
and type because if you remembered in
the last lesson we created a t-shirt but
let's say we wanted to create another
type of product like a sunglasses we
wanted to create glasses as a whole and
have the option to have them be
sunglasses so to do that we're gonna
click products and then variation types
and we're gonna create a new product
variation so coming in here we're going
to click this add product variation and
we're gonna give it a name of glasses
cool and we're gonna leave automatically
generates SKU unchecked so this crepe
matching product display type what this
is is that in an older version of Drupal
commerce they had what were products and
product displays and product dis
displays are what shows up on the front
end and products are the it's maybe
maybe like the the root product so what
you would have would be like the product
would be the individual this is a medium
blue t-shirt this is a medium large or
medium red t-shirt would be individual
products and one product display would
house all of those products and display
them on the homepage and allow you to
select them well thankfully they've gone
this in a much more elegant way you
don't really have to worry about it too
much but we are gonna get into some
stuff with it later on in just a second
so let's click Save and add some fields
so by default we have price title status
and these are the things that are gonna
be in all of your products when you
create them as well as ask you because
they're the things that you have to have
so we want your users to be able to
change color you know that's just one
thing we want them so let's say field
reference and this is going to be a text
out of me
and and we're gonna leave this as just a
autocomplete term widget with tagging
because these sunglasses could have some
weird colors or something so we'll leave
it like that and we also want to have
whether it's a sunglass or not so we're
going to create a new boolean field
that's just
sunglasses and this is just gonna be a
single on/off checkbox and we'll move
that up here too and let's click Save
okay and we want the on value to be yes
the OP that you to be no that is if they
are sunglasses than they are if they
aren't then they are not so yes you know
if it's check they're gonna be
sunglasses if they're not nope and we
don't need anything else in here
to be checked because this is just like
creating a normal field in a Content ID
to Drupal and this is a color again
which we don't have to touch anything in
so cool
now that exists let's go and create
promit let's add a product and we're
gonna get these glasses and we want
there to be aviators and cool my color
is gonna be black and the price is gonna
be 50 bucks
perfect however you know this is if
there are sunglasses or not it looks
like we probably could have used to
label for that we want this checkbox to
be not in this variation we want this
checkbox to be outside of the variation
so regardless of the color you know any
of that stuff we want this checkbox
whether their sunglasses are not always
be yes or no so you notice that when we
were in our product variation type it
didn't really give us a chance to say
that this is part of the you know the
variables or not let's go to manage
fields and I'm going to delete this
sunglasses field because this is not
what we're gonna do it where you want to
do this is actually in content content
types
and then here you're going to find
scroll down glasses already made for us
and it says proc display yes so let's go
to manage fields here and you're gonna
notice something weird there's not our
same fields however there's a group
field for product variations so this
includes all of our product variations
and now if we take our existing field I
think I think it's saved as an existing
field even though we deleted it if it's
nothing I'll just remake it it doesn't
look like it is so I'm just going to
create a new field sunglasses and the
same thing it's gonna be a boolean with
a single on/off checkbox and it's gonna
ask you that at the very beginning let's
click Save and on value is yes off value
is no just like before save the field
okay help text we're gonna say are these
sunglasses okay Beauty use field label
instead of on value label yep okay let's
save this and so what's great about this
is now if we go to products add a
product and glasses we get to say
aviators and are these sunglasses yes
and we can say a v1 they're black and
they're fifty dollars click Save this
variation now when we add a new
variation a VI - they can be brown and
$50.00 but notice that we don't have to
say that there's sunglasses so we don't
have to do this over and over and over
again and just change the things that
change well so let's save this product
and we'll get to the product page and
beautiful cool so this has exactly what
we want
although it has those product variations
with this drop-down that says aviators
and it doesn't really give you a whole
lot to go on it does change this but
what's up there so let's come back let's
go to glasses manage fields here and our
product display and let's come back and
let's check out some of these
so we'll click Edit on the color and
let's scroll down here single value so
it's this is asking if this particular
attribute is going to be used to allow
customers to select a product based on
the values of the field so yes and we
want these to be radio buttons let's
click this and you'll immediately see
the effects on our product page let's
close out of here and there you go
instead of saying product variations
with the drop down letting us pick we
now have black or brown and while these
radio buttons could use some styling and
I don't have an image attached to this
it's working and it's working pretty
good so pretty much everything from here
on out would be adding an image and then
CSS so it's always if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment in
the video or hit us up on Twitter our
level of touch let us know what you're
thinking as always this is Scott and
thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
