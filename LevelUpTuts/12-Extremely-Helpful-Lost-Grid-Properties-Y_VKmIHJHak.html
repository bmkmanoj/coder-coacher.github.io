up tutorials and in this video I'll be
showing you two very useful lost grid
properties now these properties are
going to Lau you to build a container
around your columns as well as align the
content inside of them and it makes
centering things in the dead center
middle Center really super easy so check
it out let's get going with these
properties right now so first i want to
show you lost center now lost center is
a nice little property that comes in
handy when making a container now in the
last videos we were using this grid one
we told it to be a width of one hundred
percent and we had to assign it a lost
utility for clearfix because the divs
with inside of it are being aligned on a
grid via floating however it's nice to
know that this can be taken care of with
one line using lost center now loss
center is essentially just a container
element so we can come in here and
simply replace this with lost hyphen
center now we can say one hundred
percent save this and if we come back to
our page and refresh and if you come
back to our page and refresh you'll
notice that absolutely nothing has
changed now what's nice about this
container so it contains a clear fix
right and even though we're passing the
one hundred percent we could pass it on
something like eighty percent save this
and like you can guess based on its name
lost center it's going to make sure
everything has a margin of auto for the
left and right margin so as you can see
it's really nice to build a container
with this and if we come in here and
it's good to say background color of I'm
just going to do like a 333 that way
it's a dark gray dark enough that we can
see it and as you can see it comes right
to the edges of the grid here so now if
we wanted this to be a container with
some padding or something we could come
in here and simply just add padding like
so by saying like 20 pixels here and
refreshing
or what we can do is we can actually add
this padding built in to the Law Center
property itself I'm actually going to
change this to be a 666 that 333 isn't
working out for me it's a little too
dark so we can come in here and let's
say 20 pixels actually let's make it
bigger this time let's say 40 pixels
right here so Law Center the first
property it takes is the width the
second property it takes is the padding
and the third property is whether or not
you want this to be a flexbox grid or
not since we're not talking about
fluxbox grids yet it's okay we're just
going to leave this as eighty percent
what 40 pixels padding we can come in
here and as you can see what it's
actually doing is applying padding to
the left and right so in this instance
we would still need to apply padding to
the top of let's say if we want to do 40
pixels 40 pixels there we go we now have
a little container here but as you can
see it doesn't necessarily assume when
you have padding that you want it to the
top and bottom it's just assuming that
you want it on the grid itself so there
we go we've now had a center container
we've done it really nice and easily
using this loss center with one line we
can get rid of this background and we
can rid of this padding top for now and
just leave it with this loss center now
it's another helpful property that lost
makes really nice and easy to use well
there's this lost align property and to
illustrate this I'm going to throw some
paragraphs inside of a couple of these
divs here they're just a paragraph
instead of a div now let's come and
check it out I just have them so color
white as you can see there's not a lot
going on so let's actually hit to our
CSS and let's I'm going to come in here
i'm going to copy this i'm going to make
a new definition here four paragraphs
within grid 1 divs and i'm going to
force a margin 0 so used to get rid of
any sort of margin that paragraph might
have on it cool so
now have this text that's appearing in
the top left here we're just sort of
where you would normally expect it to
appear but let's say we want this text
to appear directly in the center of this
div not just the center but the middle
center so middle vertically is Center
horizontally now this could be a
tremendous pain at just trying to do
this normally luckily lost provides us
with a really super cool additional
property called Lost hyphen align and
you'll notice I'm putting this on the
container so I'm putting this on the div
itself that contains this paragraph text
now what I'm going to do for the lost
align property is first let's just try
to give it a property of center okay
Center well when you refresh you can see
this puts it in the absolute middle
Center now this is super cool this is
really easy i mean it saved us a ton of
time and let's even just check out
exactly what this is doing i'm going to
see in our CSS we can see that let's
scroll down here it's basically giving
everything giving the immediate child of
this div position absolute top of fifty
percent and then it's translating it
negative fifty percent back up and doing
the same thing with the left so as you
can see it's the sort of standard
technique for putting something in the
center at this point however I mean one
line texts a lost align center versus
having to write all of this I mean I'll
take that any day of the week so what
other things can we pass this well we
can really pass this all sorts of things
we can pass it hyphenated position so
like top hyphen left and that's probably
going to put it exactly where was and of
course tough right okay what about like
top center there we go we can even do
things like middle left cool and you can
even have middle center or you could
just have center which is sort of like a
shorthand for that or we could even have
something like just right and when we
have it just right you can see it
automatically puts it in the center
just puts it on the right if you want to
top right there bottom right you just
have to specify so with a hyphen cool so
this is lost align and Law Center to
really super helpful properties that
come with lost grid just one of the many
reasons why i use this all the time so
as always this is scott would level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments they become in the video here
to set that order or facebook at level
up tutorials i love to hear from you
thanks for watching and I'll see in the
next one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
