tutorials and in this video we're going
to be showing you how you can install
plugins within Gatsby and in doing so
we're gonna get sass setup in a really
really really quick way like zero
configuration we just install something
get it set up and we're up and running
with sass in no time so let's get going
on that right now okay so in this video
we're gonna be talking about plugins for
Gatsby now plugins can accomplish a
whole bunch of different stuff but they
mostly just help you out with the static
generation or bringing of in of data so
what we want to do is head to the docs
page so you just click on Doc's and
Gatsby J's org and then in the left hand
column make your way to plugins now
plugins as you can see are a whole
they're plentiful if we scroll down here
you can see a list of official plugins
so Gatsby's been at work making a whole
bunch of Awesome official plugins you
can see Gatsby source MongoDB Gatsby
source Hecker news I mean you can make a
hacker news aggregate in no time here
Gatsby plugin Twitter gets B plugins
styled components gets me plug in the
site map these are all awesome and a lot
of the stuff we're gonna be checking out
a little bit and the one we're gonna
actually doing is not styled components
like I had mentioned before but gets
beat plug-in SAS the reason why we're
doing this is you know I don't want to
have the overhead of having to teach
styled components while we're teaching
Gatsby SAS is a little bit more
Universal here so we're gonna go ahead
and just get started with Gatsby plug-in
SAS I'm going to show you how easy it is
to start using SAS on your Gatsby site
it's gonna be super super easy painless
all that good stuff so we're just gonna
copy Gatsby - plugin - SAS here and
we're gonna head to our command line
open up a new tab let me bump this up
font size a little bit okay we can do
NPM that mpk and PM install - - save
Gatsby - plug-in - SAS okay
now if you're not familiar with NPM or
note or any of this stuff like I
mentioned that you might want to be I
don't want to limit if you've never used
this stuff what this statement is saying
is that we're using NPM to install gets
be plug-in SAS
now the - - save what that does is it
adds it to our package dot JSON file
right under here under dependencies and
that way anytime we're firing this
package or or application up we can run
npm install and instead of having to
install each of these packages
individually it's going to look at this
and know exactly what to install Gatsby
Gatsby link ants be plug-in whatever so
if you're adding something as a
dependency you're gonna want to use the
- - save and we're seeing that right now
so get NPM install - - save gets be
plugin sass okay just like that our
plugins installed and let's head to our
config file which is our Gatsby - config
in which we just have an array where
we're going to just have our packages in
here let's open this up a little bit so
you could see this and with just had a
comma and we can have gatsby plug-in SAS
now these backticks all over here it's
getting more common to see these
backticks being used everywhere in place
of single quotes that way you can do
string interpolation wherever you want
in this config file I don't know if it
really matters
I'm just keeping with the style that
this file already has so simply by using
Gatsby plug-in SAS in our we should be
able to start using SAS and a good way
to test this out well is to actually
just modify our index file first thing
first let's head to our page layout
index j s where we're importing index
dot CSS let's comment this out ok we
should see our gatsby site you might
actually have to physically refresh this
look a lot uglier okay
and now change the name of index dot s
index dot CSS to s CSS okay so we're now
working with index that s CSS because
obviously a normal CSS file is still
compatible with sass so we should be
fine here and now let's see if this
works so all we need to do is re import
this but it imported as index dot s CSS
and let's see if we actually get real
working CSS out of this and as you can
see we're getting a big fat error that's
saying this doesn't know what to do with
s CSS you may need an appropriate loader
to handle this file let's go ahead and
do control C on our terminal here and
let's rerun gets B develop let's head
back to our page and once this is
compiled let's head back to our site and
you'll see something our site Styles
have now come back into place so what
just happened there well when we ended
the new plugin we needed to stop the
server restart the server it's no big
deal
we just added a plugin it's changing the
whole way the stuffs compiling you need
to restart the server so all we simply
needed to do was restart the server but
now our sites using sass and we didn't
do anything to get it really using sass
other than adding a simple plugin we
didn't have to write a web pack config
file we didn't have to touch the gulp
file we don't have to touch anything
that was sort of config e we just had to
import index dot CSS to prove that this
is working we can add a let's just do a
background G of black head back saved
you can see we can even test we can even
test them nesting if you want to do that
if you don't believe that this is
actually sass here and say color weight
and as you can see a paragraph inside a
body is going to be white so this is
legit sass here
we didn't have to do anything we just
simply added the plugin so this is as
easy as it gets right this is great this
is wonderful
all we simply did was add it gatsby
plugin SAS we installed it and we
imported index s CSS into our main
layout file so just like that we have
styles up and running and when we build
this all aesthetically you're never even
gonna know that SAS was involved anyways
so just like that we've added a nice
plugin we've added SAS and you've seen
how to modify the config of gatsby
config you can head over to the plugins
directory and check out all these other
plugins to see basically what you like I
mean you can use typescript if you like
typescript you can use pre-act if you
like pre-act
CoffeeScript styled components
responsive iframe cache any of this
stuff is super nice so check it out so
as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials in the next few videos we're
gonna be getting to some cool stuff here
I've sort of shows you how this works a
little bit but we're actually gonna
start bringing in some data we're gonna
be loading images fonts and files we're
gonna be just keep on extending and
working with Gatsby until we have some
more and more complex stuff that we're
working with that aren't just a few
separate pages so thanks so much for
watching and I'll see in the next one if
you would like to get a ton of premium
content streaming had to level up
