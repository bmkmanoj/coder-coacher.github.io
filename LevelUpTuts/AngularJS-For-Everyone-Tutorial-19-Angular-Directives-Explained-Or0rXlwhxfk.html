up tutorials in this video I'm gonna be
giving you an introduction to directives
in angular now this is going to be a
very very very basic glance at how to
use directives so let's get started
right now so directives are a big part
of angular now you've used directives
already even if you haven't realized it
even if we haven't necessarily said
you're using a directive we even simply
come to this home dot HTML that we'd
been working with you'll see a ton of
directives in your view already even the
fee I said you don't realize then there
might be hiding in plain sight we have
ng-click ng hide ng class ng repeat ng
if these are all directives and they are
all directives in a specific form of a
directive they are the directive that is
being declared as an attribute on an
element so these are all being declared
as an ng hide attribute on a button or
an NG repeat on a list item but
directives can also be used in the form
of actual elements so you couldn't write
a directive that looks like something
like hello world just like you would any
other HTML element and this can be
passed attributes it can contain other
custom elements there's a lot of stuff
here you can also define a directive via
a comment or even a class now they do
say that defining directives via a
comment of our class are really just
sort of in their legacy wise and that
you should use the attribute or as an
element so those are the ones I'm gonna
be focusing on in this particular video
we're going to create a hello world
directive and it's going to just output
hello world before making this a little
bit more complex and actually having a
directive to contain functionality and
pass in data and really just show you
why you'd use them so now I mean the
angular definition in there docks for
directive
says at a high-level directives are
markers on a Dom element that tell
angularjs the tell angularjs is HTML
compiler to attach specific behavior to
that Dom element I mean if you didn't
know what a directive was after that
sentence you may still not known it just
doesn't go ahead and say it however what
a directive is and it's very most basic
sort of understanding is it's almost
like a web component or web element
without it actually necessarily being
one so if you use something like polymer
you've seen that you can create your own
HTML elements via web components now
angular version 1 at least does not use
web components however you can think of
directives as something very very
similar essentially a directive allows
you to create your own HTML element here
and you can use that element to attach
functionality and all sorts of cool
stuff or you can just simply create a
directive that is on an attribute itself
instead of being its own element in the
same thing is when you use this ng when
you use this ng-repeat it's essentially
telling angular to do something ok so
let's go ahead and create our hello
world before diving in to too much of
the crazy stuff so let's first let's
just save this as is here let's head to
our directory j/s file that we had and
you can see we had our config we had our
controller and at the end here we just
have a semicolon now what we can do is
just like we had dot controller here and
in a larger application you'd want to
break all this stuff out but we can just
say dot directive now in here we're
going to give it a name now this name is
going to be hello world and notice how
this is camel case we're going to talk
about this a little bit more in a second
but this is important so this is going
to be camel cased and your should be as
well so let's type in function
okay so now we have the contents of our
directive inside of our directive we can
just simply say return spell it
correctly we can say return brackets now
let's say template and the template is
going to be in quotes just the words
hello world like so that's it at its
very most basic we're going to be able
to use the hello world directive in our
application and it's just going to
simply help put the text hello world so
now we can come to our home page and we
can say hello - world now so now this is
where the camelcase
emphasis really needs to be stressed if
you'll notice in when we're using this
as an element or even as a property on
an element we are using a hyphenated
syntax now this is really the way that
angular prefers you do this now is to
have a hyphenated word like hello -
world and then in your directive to
declare it in camel case now there are
some rules as to what will actually work
here with this hyphenated being turned
into camel case whether or not you're
actually using this syntax however for
this first example it's important to
just stress that this is this way for a
reason and you should follow these same
sort of guidelines okay so we have hello
world here in a camel case we have hello
world here with the hyphen and we have
hello world here with camel case let's
come to our application let's refresh
and boom we have hello world sitting
right here and any time we want to go
ahead and throw this hello world
directive in our application like so we
can just paste in your whole bunch of
times every single time it's gonna
output hello world cool so in the next
video we're going to be showing you a
couple of more exciting interesting
things about
directives before really getting into
some cool functionality what we're gonna
be doing is actually using the directive
to have our individual persons name and
age here so check it out we're gonna get
into the next video as always this is
Scott what level of tutorials if you
have any questions or comments they
don't come in the video hit me up at
Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials I love to hear from you thanks
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
