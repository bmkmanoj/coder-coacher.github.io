up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be wrapping up our intermediate
meteor series this is going to be the
last video we're gonna take care of some
loose ends and then talk about what's
next to come in the world of level up
tutorials and meteor let's get started
right now
so of the we're are at the end of the
intermediate series for meteor there is
a ton of more meteor content coming to
level up tutorials so do not worry about
that I'm gonna be showing a lot of the
things that everybody has been asking
for like image uploading using meteor
with react a custom login and user
registration things like how to write a
package pagination basically smaller
topics and meteor so don't worry about
that
and we're gonna wrap this series up with
one final video and it's going to be a
pretty easy one we're going to toggle
this new form so we don't want this form
here all the time in fact it's sort of
just annoying to have it here so let's
go ahead and just add a button and we're
simply going to add a button on to
recipes HTML and here you can see we
have this new recipe we can now just
have a button like so and this button
can have a class of BTN primary and it
will be I mean it will just be new
recipe okay
so let's head to our app and you should
be able to see a blue button up here new
recipe now we've actually used this blue
color for submitting a form I'm actually
going to just remove the class entirely
from it and let's just have this be new
recipe so this decision is made because
this action here is usually used to
submit a form if we use the just
standard button class that's in the CSS
it's going to be purple it's gonna stand
out a little bit different it's gonna be
maybe a different sort of feeling so
it's not necessarily submitting a form
here it's going to be now toggling
something okay so we now have this new
recipe we click it doesn't do anything
in addition we also want a close button
on this because when you open the new
recipe this buttons obviously not going
to be there so let's go ahead and add
that to our new recipe HTML right up
here and what we can do is add inside of
this new recipe container div
we can add an eye Surfer font awesome fa
fa - close like so and if we head back
to our application you should see
already styled and placed absolutely in
the top right is this X so now hopefully
what's going to happen is when we click
this X we close the new recipe now if
you'll notice in the last video we
wanted our reactive variable scoped to a
particular template however we want this
sort of toggling to happen between
templates so and this is a perfect
example of when you'd want to use a
session variable rather than a reactive
variable so what we can do is add a
couple of functions here first we need
to target this fa clothes and we need to
set the session to false and when we
click the new recipe we want to set
these session variable to true so one
thing we don't have is we don't have a
new recipe Jas so I'm going to click new
file and we can say new recipe Jas now
we can say template dot new recipe that
events and we can have a bracket inside
of here you enter now inside of here we
want to have a click and on the click
we're going to be looking for FA closed
now FA closed let's have a period in
there because we're looking for that
class we're going to be looking for a
function here and we can simply now just
set a new session variable so like I
said at this point this sort of thing
should be old news so this is a great
way to round out the series and we can
just say new recipe and we're gonna be
setting new recipe to false because we
want that closed okay now let's just go
ahead and copy this entire event this
click FA closed and we're going to head
to our recipe
is that Jas now it looks like we don't
have any events one so ever so what we
can do is template that recipes dot
events and then have our object here now
inside of our object let's go ahead and
have a click function and that click
function is going to be on the let's see
we have the new recipe button and we can
paste that in there at a period for the
class so now this we're going to be
looking for it click on this new recipe
button and we can have this simply as an
arrow function here and we can now set
our session variable sessioned
dot set new recipe and we can now set
this equal to true okay so this is
nothing crazy at all whatsoever and to
confirm that this is all working let's
actually just head it to our application
here and refresh make sure I didn't have
a typo anywhere or anything like that
okay so we now have these two buttons
here if I do ctrl M you'll see that's
really just something your you'll find
yourself doing a lot of times once you
have these meteor toys you you want to
be checking your session burials so when
we click X you can see it's set to false
click new it's set to true so like so
you could see that these both click
functions are working as expected
now let's actually go ahead and use one
of those template session helpers that
we have in a couple of videos ago and
let's actually use that to show and hide
this not only this button but this new
recipe form itself so we can do sort of
what we did before and we can have
double brackets and we can say pound if
dollar sign dot session dot get
we're looking for in quotes new recipe
like so and if new recipe exists then we
want to show this recipe form like so
otherwise with an else we want to show
the button that allows you to toggle
this so we only want to either show the
button or the form and we can wrap that
up with a /if so now we're getting this
new recipe if it's equal to true show
the form otherwise show the button set
to our page here and you should see that
by default now we just have a new recipe
button
now this isn't placed anywhere
specifically you could obviously style
this interface completely different but
as you see when we click perfect show
and hide awesome just what we want now
if you wanted to do this while animating
or anything like that you could use this
session variable to toggle a class and
have that class be like fading or
growing or doing anything you want to do
these sort of animations to build in
here so it's not just sort of a here's
the form you know but otherwise other
than that it looks great and this
application is totally fully functioning
now there's a ton of improvements we
could be making to this the view details
page could actually have all of the
information the view details could also
have an edit feature and there's all
just sorts of little things here and
there however functionally this thing is
working really super well and we've
built a much more complex meteor
application than what we built in the
meteor for everyone series so like I
said there's a lot more advanced and
intermediate meteor content coming very
soon so do not worry about that if you
would like to purchase this series with
the code examples you can do so at store
