level up tutorials and in this video I'm
going to be showing you a little bit
about what we're going to learn in this
series now this series is level to react
native and we're not only going to be
diving in to react native concepts but
we're also going to be diving into graph
QL using a service called graph cool as
well as Apollo client so let's check it
out let's check out the app let's check
out some of the techniques and let's
check out some of the code that you're
going to be learning over the course of
this series so over the course of the
series we're going to be learning all
about how to create a native app using
react native now I'm going to skip over
some of the things that we learned in
the first course such as exporting from
Expo actually getting this thing ready
for the App Store as well as all of
these sort of basics of react native and
in this series we're going to focus
primarily on working with an API working
with graph QL and Apollo client and some
of the intermediate topics like
navigation you can see that we have
created a journaling application here
and while these posts in these journal
posts aren't necessarily the most
descriptive titles or anything like that
we you can see that we have a post title
a post body we have an excellent
navigation that even includes gestures
we have a great layout here we have the
ability to use things like a floating
action button we have an interface for
creating posts and on top of this we
have a total login and logout system now
all of this included the greatest thing
about the series as this app is that
this app is going to look excellent on
both Android and iOS you can see the iOS
simulator version here and with Android
it's going to be fully material designed
and we're gonna do it all by sharing
components as in no special one-off
components so so this app is going to be
really really full-featured and it
should give you a clue of how to work in
a navigation system as well as
submitting forms let's check out some of
the code that we used you can see that
we have graph QL mutations
you can see we're using graph QL to
refetch our queries after a mutation
we're using native components like
activity indicator as well as other
things and we're able to completely
customize our navigation with a host of
navigation options there's a whole lot
of stuff going on in this course and
between posts and user accounts it's
enough to keep you busy now we will be
using graph cool as well as our graph QL
backend this will allow us to hit an API
such as this while creating a posts and
not have to worry too much about
configuring or setting up a database so
if this looks like something that you'd
be interested in learning head on over
to level up tutorials comm forward slash
store and purchase a series or become a
pro subscriber to get full access to all
of this content right now and if you are
already a paid pro subscriber thank you
so much and please enjoy level 2 react
native</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
