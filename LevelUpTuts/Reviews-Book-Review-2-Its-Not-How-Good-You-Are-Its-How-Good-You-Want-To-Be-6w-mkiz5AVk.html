tuts and today i'm going to be bringing
the second level of Tut's book review
and i am reviewing another one of my
absolute favorite books in this book
might not be for everyone but for the
right kind of people it's a it's a
really nice experience this is it's not
how good you are it's how good you want
to be the world's best-selling book it's
by Paul Arden and if you don't know
about Pollard and Hughes the former
curator director at saatchi &amp;amp; saatchi
and they are a ver tising agency with
over 140 offices in 76 different
countries they're responsible for a
whole lot of really cool cool projects
you actually owe it to yourself to go
check them out if you haven't heard of
them before however Paul Arden is a very
clever guy and what this book is is it's
a short and actually rather small in
size book it's like a hundred and twenty
some pages and it's these sort of large
bold images and text that get points
across some time there's a little bit of
a story sometimes it's just these loud
points okay here's an image i found on
the internet somewhere so he has a title
it's better to regret what you have done
then what you haven't and then he talks
a little bit of a story and then it's
usually an image that goes a long time
goes along with it but what it does is
every single one of these it's almost
like you turn a page and there's a new
one every single time is there just so
clever and and some of them if you
really let them sink in can really make
a large impact so it's one of those
great books that you you don't have to
read page by page but any given day I
mean I could still open this book today
at any given page read it and really
gained some wisdom even though I feel
like I've gone through this book a
hundred times uh it's just really really
great and if you're one of those people
that doesn't necessarily get pumped up
about this kind of thing you're more of
like a lung reader it might not be for
you you might not see the value in it
but at nine bucks on amazon I mean it's
really not losing out on a whole lot
it's it's a
nice it's a nice book and and it's
really great because each of these
things is designed really well as well
so a lot of this stuff sort of maybe
gears toward designers but it's really
applicable to anybody who's doing
anything creative in their life in which
them that could be pretty much anybody
and it really inspires you to do great
things so this is it's not how good you
are about how good you want to be it's
sort of like a pump you up kind of book
really clever observations and it's a
really great read I would totally
recommend reading this just having it
around you know throw it in your
bathroom or anything and just read it 11
page whenever you want and it's it's
definitely made my life a little bit
better a lot a bit better than it was
before I had read this book so as always
like I said this is a new series we're
testing it out let's know what you're
thinking lice are going to have more
review soon I'm psyched I got my
computer up and running again everything
is good and we're going to keep going
with some more reviews too so you should
see more book reviews elearning reviews
and a lot more tutorials okay and as
always this is scott with level up tuts
