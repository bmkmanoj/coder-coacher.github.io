up tuts and today we're going to show
you how to take what we learned in the
last video where we used a plumber to
help us with errors to prevent gulp from
stopping and we're actually going to do
that same thing using gulp itself so now
we're going to be able to handle errors
and keep Kalb running without using any
extra packages like plumber or anything
so keep watching we're going to get into
that now
so to get started let's go ahead and
take out this plumber command if we get
rid of this plumber command in our
Styles task and then go ahead and save
this let's see what happens what's
probably going to happen is when we have
a mistake in our CSS gulp is going to
crash so let's go ahead and just
completely eliminate some of this
information at the end here which would
cause an error okay you can see it
knocked us out of our gulp process
however you can easily take care of it
without an extra package like plumber
now plumber has some useful features
which you can check out on their page
however what we're going to do is
eliminate the need for plumber just by
using a simple counsel log to log our
errors so what we want to do is we want
to run this command we want to run this
directly after the thing that might
cause the error so let's say in this
case we had our SAS compiling as what
caused the air so what we need to do is
do dot on and now the event that we're
looking for is in single quotes going to
be error so on an error and then we're
going to pass us a nother argument here
so you need to a comma and now what we
want to say is Council and we can do
council error so council dot error and
then let's do dot bind and then inside
of these parentheses we can type Council
now it counts a log just counts all just
like that ok so here we have our line
council error bind and then in
parentheses passing it the counts
now let's go ahead and run our gulp
watch again and let's go caused some
problems in our CSS and looks like we
already here so let's save it and what
you can see is we do get an error in
fact we get this syntax error a line 7
okay so it's giving us this problem
about line 7 we come back you can see
that's because it didn't ever reach a
semicolon here so it got to line 7 and
was confused obviously if we put these
pixels back in and save this is going to
correct the problem so now if we come to
our terminal you'll notice that just
like when we use to plumber it's
starting up and can then compiling these
styles once everything has been fixed ok
so now that's an easy solution to just
go ahead and just go ahead and just drop
this in everywhere you might need
however maybe you don't want to type
this out maybe you don't want to copy
and paste it another option might be to
just write a function so you could write
a function up top here that just says
error log and inside of this function
you're going to be getting passed an
error
okay now the internals of this function
are just going to be this Council dot
error part so we can go ahead and
eliminate it all this and now we can say
instead of this error right here we can
paste in the air that's being passed in
now we'll finish this off with a
semicolon and we can finish this all
with this dot emit and then in single
quotes here just end honestly single or
double quotes doesn't matter I just
pretty much always default to single
quotes ok so now that we have our error
log function let's go ahead and instead
of calling Council err we can just run
our error log function okay and it looks
like we had an extra parenthesis here so
go ahead
get rid of that now let's go ahead and
run gulp that watch one more time okay
so it's watching now let's make a
mistake to our CSS save it we get an
error error on line four likewise again
it sees the error line four because we
didn't finish this off with a semicolon
we fix it and it's up and running so you
can tell that it is in fact using our
error log function here and now we can
just drop this maybe a little bit nicer
line in any time that we might have an
error so let's go ahead and throw it in
our JavaScript we'll just get rid of
this plumber right here and then after
the uglify will also paste in on air run
error log now these are the only two
texts that we have that could really
have any errors now we can also get rid
of plumber from our required variables
just like that and let's just run gulp
dot watch once more to make sure that
nothing is broken okay
we save this and we'll save our our
JavaScript looks like both of those
tasks ran without any issues so perfect
we're now no longer using plumber to
handle our errors with gulp as always
this is GABA love love Hut's if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment the video or hit us up at
Twitter or Facebook we always love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
