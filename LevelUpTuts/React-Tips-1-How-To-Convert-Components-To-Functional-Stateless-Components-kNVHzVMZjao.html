and so I thought it would be nice to
simply just show something that I had to
do already in a quick way so here we
have what is a standard react component
now this is a reactant meteor site but
this component would look the same
regardless I'm exporting a default class
login layout and extends component now
this component could be a functional
stateless component in fact if you're
using es Lindt and the Airbnb config
which I am here it's going to complain
and say component should be written as a
pure function now if we were to select
this it would let us know simply in the
github repo why you would prefer a
stateless component if you don't know
basically the rules are if you aren't
using state or any of the lifecycle
methods you should use a stateless
component so a stateless functional
component is a more simple way of
writing a react component that's going
to benefit from future react performance
optimizations because of course it
doesn't need to use all of that extra
stuff in addition you'll see in a second
that there's a lot less react stuff so
if you are moving frameworks or
something like that and they're still
using JSX
then this component will still be usable
without any sort of react stuff so let's
get the conversion process underway
you'll notice I had a footer in here I'm
no longer using this footer and delete
that line just for transparency here and
what I want to do first I'm gonna pull
out this export default just to make
this other part a little bit more clear
I'm going to put that below my prop
types down here I'm just going to leave
that here now what I want to do is I
want to turn this class into a Const a
constant variable what we're building
here is a function rather than a class
so the constant
variable login layout is now going to
needs to be a function so let's delete
this whole extends component and say is
equal to and right here we can do an
arrow function we can have the
parentheses equals greater than and then
we can have brackets and I'm gonna hit
enter now from this point forward I'm
going to choose what I want from here
inside of this because it's a function
here we do need a return statement so
let's cut out the entire return but
ignore the render so because of that
lets get rid all this extra stuff let's
paste this in here you can instantly see
how more simple this is this is just way
easier to read but in addition it's just
cutting out some of the fat that we
don't need and it's making a little bit
more Universal now we have lock and
layout is now equal to the return of
this you'll notice though if you were to
try to do anything here besides the fact
that we're not exporting it yet it would
fail out because we don't have access to
props and so this dot props no longer
exists to have access to props we could
access individual props for instance if
we just wanted children we could have
the brackets and using the new object
syntax for es2015 we could say children
in here and have access to simply
children as a variable itself but you'll
notice I'm also passing in props the
stop props here so let's get rid of this
children and inside of here and set up
the brackets let's just say props we now
have access to props and we no longer
need this so you can write your props
just like before props children
props passing those in here or literally
whatever you could possibly have inside
of your component here now if you were
to have interactions like unclick things
and stuff like that that aren't setting
state what you would actually be doing
is having those as functions outside of
your component
and then when you would call them with
the unclick you would not have to use
this because it's obviously not
referencing the same class that you're
in it's referencing just a standard
function now in addition we could also
export this layout so I'm going to copy
and paste this export default login
layout okay
now yes lint is going to complain about
some things obviously other than the
trailing spaces and I'll show you that
in a second but this right here this is
your react functional stateless
component the cool news is this can get
more simple like this isn't this isn't
the limit here because we're only
returning one thing right if you were to
have some logic like if some stuff you
know return something else then you
would want to write it like this with
the brackets with the return statement
and everything however if you are only
just returning one thing this is simply
just like a layout wrapper I mean this
couldn't be any more simple of a
component check this out we can delete
this we can delete the return statement
we can delete that and we can even
delete these parentheses
let's tab this over so that it fits the
tab spacing correctly save this and what
we now have here is a really simple
component and you'll notice we're not
using component anymore
we don't need that and what we have here
is a functional stateless component keep
in mind if you need to use state if you
need to use life cycle like component
did mount or anything like that then you
can't use this syntax however this is a
great way to really simplify your
components and in the future you're
gonna take apart in some really nice
performance benefits courtesy of react
so basically this is the way you're
going to want to write your components
if you can not to say there's anything
wrong with state or or lifecycle methods
or anything like that because many of
your components are still going to use
that for the
simple ones check it out this is just
really super nice okay so I'm just
trying something new out here this is
basically some code I was writing
anyways and I felt like it would make a
nice little snippet video so now if
you're wondering about this react clone
element stuff now this would be as
simple as just outputting our props
children however because I need to pass
in props to the props children I had to
do with this react clone element
business if you know of a different
syntax to do that that's less verbose or
maybe better let me know this is just
what I saw in stack overflow so just a
heads up there if you like this kind of
thing this free short quick little video
let me know I'm gonna keep on doing
these as I work here and anytime I see
something that might be of interest I
will post it up in this series but again
as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you like this content head
over to store down level of tutorials
calm and help support this channel by
purchasing either a subscription or some
of the paid series available there it'll
help produce more free videos like this
explaining key concepts in important
frameworks so thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you the next one
