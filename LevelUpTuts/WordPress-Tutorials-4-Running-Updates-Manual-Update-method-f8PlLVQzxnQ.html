up tutorial this is ben shaft in this
tutorial we are going to cover how to do
a manual wordpress update and then by
that i mean we're not using the
automatic update sometimes this fails
sometimes you just sort of want to be
more in control either way i'm going to
show you how that's done before i do as
always encourage you guys to subscribe
to our youtube channel you can also
follow us on twitter at level up tots
and you can follow me personally at n
chef alright so in the last tutorial
like i said we used automatic update in
this one we are going to use the manual
method to update WordPress core so to do
that you want to go to wordpress site so
we're going to go to wordpress.org not
calm right and download it going to take
just a moment here once it's done up or
downloading we're going to unarchive it
and upload it but not entirely so what
we need to do is sort of make a
determination of you know what file
should be updated and what shouldn't and
i'm going to walk you through that
process before you start you know up
loading files you should always
absolutely always take a backup I've
done that and because we are going to be
updating the database as well you want
to take an update of your database and
I've already done both those things so
I'm going to go to that downloaded
WordPress here it is on archive it
and I get rid of this other one alright
so let's maybe start with the files that
you don't want to just drag over to your
server and that is the wp-content this
is where all of your third party items
go including the theme that you've
worked so hard on so all these other
files in here can be overridden with the
exception of your WP config which should
not be overridden because remember once
you install WordPress you know you were
renaming this file so I'm going to go
ahead and start with this again I've
already taken my backup let's pretend
that I already deactivated my plugins on
the site i think i have like no plugins
installed so i'm not going to really
worry about that right now so the first
thing that the document documentation
tells you you for uploading this content
or uploading or upgrading core is to
remove or replace the wp-admin and
includes those aren't the two
directories so i'm gonna go ahead and
just drag these over and my ftp client
will ask me if I want to replace them or
merge them and I want to replace them in
this case
while those are going up let's go ahead
and just take a take a look at one file
in particular in this wp-admin and let
me scroll down until I find it here lots
of stuff so there's this upgrade file
after we you know successfully upload
this content what we'll want to do is
run the upgrade function and that's what
actually you know we'll update the
databases and tables and do all that all
that heavy lifting for us
so these are all the files that were
better being replaced so it takes a
little bit to do this typically so while
these items get uploaded I will pause
the video and come back once it's done
okay well that is finally done I've now
uploaded those two directories and so
the next step is to replace not
overwrite the contents of these
directories so for example there's been
updates to some of the core themes and
actually that's all I have so what I can
do here is over right these items um you
know and I guess I should say you don't
have to overwrite the themes if you're
not using them right like if you're only
using vanilla 20 11 or 12 or 13 whatever
then yeah then you can update them if
not I mean you can just delete them out
and then you'll never have to hear about
an update for those items again also i
think in yeah it comes with just those
two i think i have maybe no more no more
than that so i could update those right
now like I'm locating these themes not
necessary to what we're doing here
obviously because all we're going to do
really now is update core but that's
sort of the content that's in the
wp-content in core now in your
wp-content folder you will hopefully
have you know many plugins and the theme
that like I said you you painstakingly
work countless hours on and you dont
want to overwrite that if you do hope to
god that you made that update alright so
then the last item to update is if there
was any updates to in these individual
files so I'm just going to select them
individually and
drop them up here and these won't take
too long because they're just txt files
and not like folders and folders and
directories and directories of folders
so once this is done we go back to here
and we need to tell it to run the
upgrade and so that would WP admin /
upgrade its going to say that a data
data update is required say okay update
complete we hit continue and that's it
so now if I head back over to the
dashboard just to take a peek we should
see that there's no core update now
there or or theme update cuz I did
update the themes but there are some
other updates which were you know not
really going to run right now but here
we see using WordPress 3.1 alright so
that's it that's all we're going to talk
about how to run updates thanks for
watching and stay tuned for the next
wordpress tutorial at level up tux
thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
