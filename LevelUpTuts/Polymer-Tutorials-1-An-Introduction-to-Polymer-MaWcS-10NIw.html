of Tut's and today we're going to get
started on a new technology and we're
going to be using something called
polymer now polymer is a project that
allows you to create custom elements and
so that's reusable web components what's
cool about that is you can create your
own custom element that works maybe like
let's say like a select list right you
have a select list into the Select tag
with an options inside of it and then
the browser just knows how to handle
that it takes care of default HTML it
takes care of default JavaScript
handling the way that when you click it
it opens up and you don't really think
about this often because you just drop
the Select item in your project but that
select item is created in something
called the shadow Dom which is really
the components beneath the component so
what polymer does is it allows you to
create your own web components
essentially your own elements now I
strongly believe that this is part of
the future of web development you're
going to be able to create and share web
components instead of maybe throwing in
some embed code for YouTube or something
like that you're perhaps throwing in a
YouTube element with maybe an attribute
that passes in the idea of the video and
it automatically grabs the video and
brings all that HTML in there and knows
how to handle it rather than having to
copy and paste a whole bunch of code so
over the course these next few videos
we're going to show you all you need to
know about polymer we're going to create
small elements we're going to create big
elements we're going to create elements
that are really super custom that have
all sorts of data attributes and do some
really cool stuff so keep watching we're
going to show you all that stuff over
the course of these next videos as
always this is Scott with LevelUp Tut's
thanks for watching and I'll see in the
next video where we're going to get
started by installing and getting
polymer set up on our project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
