tutorials and today we're going to
expand on what we did in the last video
where we showed you the very basics of
working with the controller and in this
video we're going to show you some a
little bit more that we can do with
controllers in fact we're going to be
putting a small form we're going to be
adding a submit event on to that form
and it's going to be adding names to our
current list of people that we have in
our directory so let's check it out
right now so in the last video we just
made our scope variable and then we
iterated with the ng-repeat that we
showed in the first couple of videos now
what we're going to do is we're actually
going to put a form here and let's
actually just do that right down here we
can say form okay and I'm gonna leave
the action blank for right now it's
going to be input with the type of text
I'll just leave that place holder right
now instead of a label and the place
holder will just say name okay and go
ahead and make another input type and
still just be age okay so we now have
two inputs I'm actually going to make
this a number so we can say number here
if we check out our page refresh okay
name age let's go ahead and add a submit
button and will you just do that with an
input submit type submit and the value
will be just be submitted here okay now
if you remember when we have done things
before where we're trying to take data
from an input we use this ng model so
I'm going to go ahead and copy this ng
model and paste in here and this ng
model will simply just be named and
again we're going to have another ng
model here and this will just simply be
aged like so and we have our submit here
okay now you see we just have this basic
sort of unstyled form when you click
Submit it just sort of refreshes the
page like it's sort of a bummer for us
because we want this to be big ok cool
so we just have this basic form
now how do I get this form to do what we
want it to do and what we wanted to do
is we wanted to somehow add data onto
the end of this list what we can do is
remove this form action here and add
something another angular directive
called ng hyphen and this is going to be
submit now if you get the pattern here
our angular directives are prefixed with
this sort of ng hyphen so we have ng
I've been submit and now this is going
to be the function that's run when we
are submitting this form so we can say
add person just like that and then sits
a function we have our parentheses here
okay now let's check out our page here
we refresh we could click Submit and now
you'll notice it's not actually trying
to do anything with this form so this is
good it's sort of preventing the default
action of the form okay so now we
actually want to take this data that we
have in this form and we want to use it
within our JavaScript here so before we
made this scope list I'm actually
missing a semicolon here we have the
scope list which was just a list of
people we can actually also throw a
function on here so we can say scope dot
add person and have this be a function
so we can just say scope down add person
equals function and then with
parentheses and brackets like just like
how we're used to and let's go ahead and
determine what we're doing within this
function what we're doing is we're going
to be pushing a new item in to this list
and so we can put scope down list down
here and this is going to be scope that
list and we're going to use the
JavaScript method of push which allows
you to push new items into an array the
new items are going to be pushing is an
object with a name colon and then then
aim is going to be that scope value from
our form here we had ng model name so
from here we can say scope dot name okay
and it's going to be comma and then age
is going to be again scope that page
like so so as you can see I when we have
this ng model it's sort of passing
around variables onto this scope that we
can access with the dollar sign here in
JavaScript now once we get into the next
video we show you to use how the
controller as syntax that's going to
change instead of using scope we're
going to be referencing this particular
controller so for now this works just
fine and let's go ahead and wrap this up
with a semicolon at the end here and now
what we want to do is after this these
new items have been pushed into our
scope we want to go back and set these
scope name we want to reset these
variables so scope that name will now be
equal to an empty string and scope that
age will not just be a little do a
number like 0 okay so to reiterate on
Form submit we're going to be taking a
name and age and we're going to be
pushing them using scope name and scope
age into our scope dot lists which is
this item which is set to loop here and
what's cool about angular is that once
we may refresh this once we have this
new name and age so let's say we said it
Jeff and Jeff age was let's say 31 we
could hit submit and now we get Jeff at
the end of here and you'll notice that
not only did Jeff appear at the end of
our list but our name now became blank
inner age reset to 0 so what we can now
say is let's just add another one we can
say Jim and Jim is going to be 40
okay and what's great about this is now
if we start to search even the new items
that we've added to this list are being
filtered through with this filter so
this filter is looking through the
current scoped variable that we went
over which was scoped list so now the
downside all of this is if we go for a
paid refresh you'll notice any name that
we've added is now gone so there's no
persistent data here or anything like
that we're simply just pushing items
into an array and angular saying hey
there's new items in this array let me
display them great so in the next video
we're going to clean up this controller
a little bit you see a more organized
syntax to allow us to easily be able to
define things so instead of just looking
at item in list we're going to be
knowing it what this list directly
belongs to its controller and instead of
just the scope variable cool so there's
a lot more great things to learn about
angular and it's all coming up very soon
as always this is scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments if it come in the video or gets
up at Twitter or Facebook at level up
tuts we love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
