up tuts and today we're going to be
creating our first product in PrestaShop
by the end of this video you'll have a
good idea about how you can go forward
and produce your products for your own
store within PrestaShop so check it out
we're going to create our product now
okay so now we're ready to create our
first product let's go ahead and go to
catalog and then products once you're on
our products page we can see the
products that have already existed in
our store as well as some information
about them now let's go ahead and click
the add new product button to get
started adding a new product so we have
different product types we have a pack
of existing products we have a standard
product and we have a virtual product
these would be services downloadable
products maybe you're paying for a
booking or something like that we're
just going to have a standard product
for this example and we're going to give
it a name and this is just going to be
an html5 sticker and at any point if you
need to know what any of these things
are like a reference code you can hover
over and says this is an internal
reference code for this product allow
for special characters new that way you
can use underscores periods hyphens
pound signs that sort of thing we also
have an EIN high end ein 13 or a Janne
bar code now it says this type of
product code is specific to Europe in
Japan as widely used internationally
it's a superset of the UPC so as you can
see we have all of these different
options and none of them which are
required but if you wanted to add your
UPC information there you could alright
next we want to make sure this is
checked to enabled because we want this
product to show up and we wanted to be
visible everywhere now if you were to
have catalog only search only or no
where at nowhere would obviously not
drop anywhere
search only would come up in search and
catalog only would not come up in search
but would come up when you're looking
through your catalog and the front end
of your store since we want this to show
up everywhere let's just check
everywhere and it's available for order
so we can leave that checked we
obviously want the price to be shown and
we can check that it's online only
because we only have an online store the
condition is new this allows you to
select things like used or refurbished
and now we can add a short description
small sticker of the each html5 loading
okay copy that and then we're going to
have a longer description and is orange
and black okay maybe you want to put
more information here and a second we're
going to show you after we create this
product where each of these shows up if
they're curious about more information
anything that's highlighted in blue like
we showed you before you can hover over
so as it says appears in the body of the
product page next we want to add some
tags so you can see we just need to add
commas separating our tags so we can
just say this is a sticker it's orange
and there we go so we just have to text
there Alfie click Save and stay it allow
us to save this page and continue
editing if we click save as you'll see
it's going to kick you back to the
products page okay so now let's scroll
down and let's see our sticker here
you'll notice that there's a lot of
things missing we don't have a photo we
don't have a price we didn't ever setup
stuck so let's click back into the Edit
screen and you can see on the left hand
side here we have a whole bunch of more
options to add right here under prices
we can change the wholesale price which
will just be $2 the retail price will be
$5 because this is an expensive sticker
and we can set up tax rules if you'd
like however we have built in just the
generic tax rate for each state so since
I'm in Michigan I'm going to select
Michigan 6% sales tax and you can even
have a unit price if you'd like that way
if people are buying more they can get a
discount now if you were to modify this
price and you want it to be on sale you
could always click this checkbox and
then your users will see a badge that
says on sale on the product page next
let's come to SEO here we can give our
product a meta title this can just be
html5
sticker and then if you want to give
this a description you can let's click
Save and stay you'll notice that when we
change tabs here even though we didn't
click Save and stay after changing our
price it kept our price information so
even coming between tabs here you're not
going to lose your information now we
can give this some categories if you'd
like right now it's just in the home
category so let's click expand all and
now we can add this for fun let's just
add this to women's tops t-shirts that
way we can make sure that it's there on
the site after we save this ok now next
we have shipping and here we're going to
give this a package width height depth
weight that way you can calculate
correct shipping now you'll notice that
none of this information is required so
we don't have to put this information in
now next we have combinations this is
something we'll go over in the later
video we have quantities this allows you
to manage available quantities for your
products so by default all we need to
add is how many we have in stock let's
say we have 100 of these each time we
sell one it's going to remove one from
our inventory and you'll notice that
it's going to deny orders when out of
stock you can also have continued to
allow orders when out of stock or just
have it be whatever your stores default
is which ours is set to deny let's go
ahead and add an image in the next tab
let's click add files ok now that we've
added a file let's click upload and you
would see we now have our image here we
don't really have any features but if
you had a height width maybe that sort
of thing if you wanted to put in your
values for a house the size the
dimensions of this you could do that
here next we have customization if you
wanted to add any additional file fields
or text fields and if you wanted to have
any file attachments you could attach
them here next we would have our list of
suppliers and now we only have a fashion
supplier in here by default we'll show
you how to create new suppliers in a
later video but so for now we're just
going to check our fashion supplier and
let's click Save because we should be
all set here
okay now if we scroll down we see our
sticker has some more information it has
an image it has a price and it has a
quantity and it has a green check mark
so let's come to our store let's go to
women's t-shirts and let's scroll down
and here is our sticker you can see that
we can add it to cart and it's been
added or we can click on the product
title here and see our information a
small sticker with the html5 logo and
scroll down further for the additional
information you can see this is our long
description and this is our short
description so just like that we've
added our first product and we're ready
to get started adding the rest of our
catalogue so as always this is Scott
