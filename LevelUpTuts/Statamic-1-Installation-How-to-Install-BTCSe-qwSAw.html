tots thanks for coming back and checking
out our this new series on Stata make so
Stata mech is a PHP based content
management system that uses no database
and flat files to give you a dynamic
website that read alone was very
intriguing to me and is why I decided to
dig in a little bit further because this
uses flat files and no database the
resulting site is quite quick right so
there's no querying of databases or any
of that type of stuff you know the files
are existing on the server and ready to
get picked up so it's fast because it's
all file based and directory based that
means that um taking a backup of the
entire site is a cinch unlike maybe a
WordPress or Drupal or CMS C CMS that
uses a database where you're having to
backup you know multiple things the
files and the database so this makes it
easier for sure and so right the
installation process is quite simple
because this is just flat files the I
really just need to upload them to our
web post or localhost for those out
there that are doing that and and then
that's that's almost it so what you'll
need to do is for CRO for $29 or $99
depending which one of these roles you
fit into if you're just playing around
with this or doing your portfolio site
or something like that that's $29 is all
you'll need so go ahead and purchase and
download and once you've downloaded it
we're going to on archive it and upload
it so I haven't actually done anything
here yet that's why we're getting this
Apache test page so I'm going to
upload it and so I grab all the files
and throw them up here and now while
they go I'll just talk to you through
the structure so this is the entire
application or CMS you know there's no
database there so there's no creating of
a database user or any of that type of
stuff everything is right here so what
that means is you know the system will
run and it's you know uses PHP and when
the system runs it's going to you know
write files and directories within this
structure so it's just something you
know that you'll sort of need to get
used to
once the files upload there's you that's
really sort of it but there is one
config file that I'll have you take a
look at in the settings dot config and
I'll go ahead well this is my stuff
uploading it I will or uploading still I
will just walk you through this to the
Settings dot gamal file so Lister we're
gonna put your license key if you
install this in the sub directory you'll
need to change where the site route is
now this is where you can change your
name the name of your site so let's go
ahead and say level up oops
tutorials
yeah that's good enough for security you
can rename your content directory this
is sort of that guns back to expression
engine and here we can change the URL so
I'd install I'm installing this on my
domain and we can change the theme and
some other configurations you know we
can set what we want the primary content
parsing syntax set to this is markdown
you could be marked on edge HTML text
whatever and there are some other
settings here too so if you were
uploading this locally and you know if
you are installing us on your localhost
and if probably is going to work just
fine so anyway there are some other
configurations here which we're not
really going to get into but you know
this is the entire configuration for the
site so I made some changes one minute
go ahead and hit save here and close Oh
actually you know what that
unfortunately was on my local one so I'm
going to go ahead and replace that file
and that's it
there's no run install or anything like
that let's just give this a refresh and
see if the site comes up indeed it does
level up tutorials alright well that's
it that's the installation process super
easy not much to it thanks for watching
in the next tutorial I'm going to show
you how to actually log in and manage
the site through the control panel
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
