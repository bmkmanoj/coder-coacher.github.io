up Tut's and today I'm going to be going
over the configuration page and your
been gentle installation in this
configuration page houses most of the
configuration settings that you'll need
for your entire site so if you'll notice
it starts off on general and general has
your country options these are the
countries you want to allow if you want
to only allow certain countries you can
just click click click these kind of
lists of Magento anytime you see
anything like this they want you to
shift click to save it so we're actually
only going to allow United States
because I don't have to deal with
shipping to other states so okay we'll
select that and okay we'll click Save
config as you'll notice here each of
these things are sort of like an
accordion so you can actually go through
each of these before you click Save
configured snow it's no big deal
this is States options states required
for and then any of these countries
since I already already selected the
only country we're going to be allowing
is the United States it doesn't really
matter anymore local options so we want
the weekdays the weekend days to be
Sunday and Saturday we want the first
day of the week be Sunday this is all
pretty normal stuff but you can change
it if you want to change to your
timezone and our store information so
here we can give our source a store name
let's call this um let's just call this
a test store of course you can call this
anything you want the contact phone
number I'm going to put in just a a spam
phone number there but we can have
something in here please select the
country ok and you can have your contact
address here ok we'll click Save this is
where it's going to pull some of this
information if you are using like the
email templates it's going to grab that
ok you'll get this notification when
kind of configuration has been saved so
let's go to web here next up and URL
options so ad storico d or it says ok
when using store codes and URLs in some
cases system a network property URLs
okay so I'm just going to leave this
check to know Auto redirect to base URL
yep okay and server engine's
optimization no we're not using server
rewrites unsecure so this is basically
your base URL on secure base URL
unsecure skin meat okay so you can
change any of these things and then you
can go ahead and change these folder
names but I honestly would not recommend
it
it says saying when using a CDN
javascript may not run properly but
that's not really something you have to
worry about unless of course you were
using a CDN insecure this is if you have
an SSL installed I don't have an SSL
installed if I did I would just type in
HTTPS here that way your base URL would
be secure in Magento uses that HTTPS
anytime you're making a check out it
won't run it on any of the other pages
so you don't have to worry about your
PageSpeed being affected by the SSL you
know certificate doing its thing
so default pages default web URL CMS
okay none of the stuff you really need
to change unless you want to poles
disallow voting in a multiple times from
the same ip address yeah no you can do
that if you want again like I said no
this definitely matters unless you want
to change it it's basically all set up
to be just in just the default so I
would recommend just sort of pawing
through all these menus and a lot of
it's pretty self-explanatory if you read
these and see what it says design this
is where you're going to change your
template or a theme so our default
package name default themes so now if we
have a theme folder we would have right
in our different theme folder in here so
this allows you to use different
templates skins or layouts or anything
like that
you don't have to you can use different
layouts or different CSS with default
layouts or whatever let's say you just
want to use images in CSS you can type
in whatever the name of your theme is in
here and it should work just fine this
is the
information that's going to be in your
HTML head you can upload your favicon
here you default title default
description keywords these are just
going to be things that are in your head
in your website
so here's header this points to the
location where the logo images if you
wanted to change us to be something
that's not this logo Jeff like a gif
however you pronounce it or you want it
to be a PNG whatever you can type that
in there logo image alt welcome text
default welcome message let's change
that welcome to test store okay just so
it's not you know the default this is
your footer and case the copyright you
could put some miscellaneous HTML in
here maybe you want to put like as a
script tag or something image watermarks
you can upload an image watermark that
would watermark your images for you
pagination you could say how many likes
to display once leave it at five and in
your transaction emails this is the
image that's going to be used in the
emails that sent out you want to have
you know if you have like a specific
email you want to use for email template
this is where you do it currency set up
base currency US dollar we sort of
already you know went over some of the
stuff you don't need to change this
unless you need to have a different you
know base currency if we've already set
this up you don't need to really touch
it this is we're going to set up your
store email addresses you know here is
your general contact you can change the
sender name and this is general contact
email sales email customer support email
and chances are these could all be the
same thing so you could probably put all
these as the exact same thing or if your
store is more complex than that you have
different needs to send out different
emails to all these different people
then of course you can have that set up
the way you want contacts this is where
you're going to say you know you want to
contact us sure okay send emails to at
using which one of these email senders
you've already come up using
this email template if you were to
create an email template under your
system transactional emails it would
show up here reports this is just going
to ask when you you know some
information about configuring your
reports content management your WYSIWYG
options is enabled by default Yap and
you stay with your ELLs no okay so you
know we want our users to be able to use
a WYSIWYG when they're editing their CMS
pages okay even more so this just keeps
going here like I said if you can pop
through this stuff you know we're going
to go over some of these things in more
detail so catalog you can just sort of
set up if you want recently recently
viewed compared products product alerts
allow guests to write reviews yes/no
basically if you go through any of these
things there is tons of options so if
you want to have a Google sitemap you
know you could say how long it
regenerates daily whatever generation
settings enabled I don't want a google
site analysis just locally but you're
going to want to if you want people to
you know have your site indexed really
well and everything some of your
inventory options your stock options
your newsletter options customer
configuration so some of the stuff
that's really important is the payment
methods like PayPal let's say you want
to set that up or your checkout process
your tax stuff this is all really
important once you're setting up all
this we'll go over how to set up tax
classes how to configure your PayPal or
if you want to use Google Google carts
or anything like that we can show you
how to do that if you go to payment
services here you'll notice actually I'm
sorry you get a payment methods here
you'll notice there's all sorts of stuff
you can use authorize net check or money
order PayPal and it's all pretty easy
of course we'll go over that in a second
in advanced admin stuff you could enable
CAPTCHA for admin enabled charts on the
dashboard
like I said all sorts of stuff so my
recommendation to you would be to just
come in here go to configuration and
just click through all of these there's
a ton of stuff in here and chances are
if you're looking for a setting on your
site it's going to be in system
configuration ok well that is the
configuration menu if you want a more
detailed walkthrough or anything or have
any more questions feel free to just
leave a comment on the video and we'll
try to get to whatever you're going to
whatever you suggest err are having
problems with there anything so in the
next couple of tutorials we're going to
go over creating products creating
categories creating attributes and then
we'll eventually after that go through
the whole purchasing process and then we
can set up our Tech's our shipping all
that cool stuff and your site will be
ready to go ok once again this is Scott
with level up tuts and thanks for
