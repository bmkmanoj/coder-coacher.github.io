up tuts and today we're going to be
talking about customizing WordPress so
we're going to take our previous
knowledge that we learned with WordPress
before and we're going to take it
further to know where you're actually
going to be working in some code now
don't worry if you've never worked in
code like PHP or CSS everything like
that we're going to make it really easy
what we're not going to do is we're not
going to teach you PHP and we're not
going to teach you CSS however we have
CSS videos to watch that you can apply
to this and you will acquire WordPress
specific PHP and even some general PHP
knowledge just from having to modify
templates and writing your own so don't
worry if you don't have experience we're
going to make it nice and easy for you
we're also going to cover pretty much
everything that you would need to know
to learn how to get into it and to get
better and advance your skills so what
we're going to get into first is
customizing your site by creating a
theme now we're not to be creating a
theme from scratch in these first few
videos we're going to be creating a
child theme now that's actually a
mistake that people make when they first
start using WordPress or other systems
is that they get in here and they want
to make a modification to this theme so
what they do is they come into the
themes files and they start modifying
those files directly now there's a big
problem with this and the big problem is
is that WordPress these themes and
things you download from other places
they might be in flux right these these
themes can be updated just like
WordPress itself and if you go ahead and
make a modification to a theme and then
you update it your updates are going to
get overridden and so that's a big
problem in fact we don't want that at
all we want to make a child theme
because we're going to do things the
right way so at first we're going to
make a child theme for this 2014 theme
and then we're going to get into some
more advanced things because what's
great about WordPress in the community
around it is that people have made some
excellent parent themes that are built
for exactly this purpose customizing and
they even have ones that are completely
stark but give you all sorts of features
to build your site like you absolutely
need to build it that way you can make
it to be whatever you want or if you
just want to make some modifications to
a theme then you can do that with these
so for this first video all we're going
to do is create our child theme and then
as we go piece by piece and modifying it
you're going to learn about the
different components of a theme and then
we're going to move that into more
advanced topics and then we're
eventually going to be writing our own
theme from there we're going to be doing
even more advanced things like
completely modifying the loop and
modifying the templates themselves and
then we're going to get into actually
writing you know plugins and all sorts
of complex stuff so this is the first
video in customizing WordPress and let's
get started so the first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to open up our site
in a text editor I have my WordPress
folder here with the contents of my site
and I'm actually going to throw it into
sublime text 3 I encourage you to use
whatever text editor you're most
comfortable with
I prefer sublime text 3 although there's
a new Atom dot io that github just sort
of teased the past couple of days that
I'm pretty excited about too and when
that comes out I'm definitely going to
have to not only dive in but make some
videos on it but for now I love sublime
text 3 and I'm going to continue using
it so we have our site here and I've
opened up the site as a project here and
you'll notice we have some files now our
themes files are located within WP
content and then themes and we have our
for our three themes here now we're
going to go over in detail WordPress is
file system later on but everything you
need to know is like we said don't
modify default themes and don't modify
themes make a child theme that holds
true with WordPress don't modify the
core files
if you want to make a modification and
you think oh well okay the perfect place
to do it is in you know one of these
files I found maybe in I don't know I
found I found basically a modification
that I want to make well there's always
going to be a better way to make that
modification and modifying the core
files is not the way to do it so do not
hack the core files pretty much anybody
who's working in these systems will tell
you that I mean the same things even
true for like Drupal or any of these
systems they all have a way where you
can override the defaults I'm going to
do first is create a new folder in
sublime text I can just right click on
the themes folder and go new folder
otherwise you can do this in finder or
something like that the folder is going
to be within themes but outside of any
of our themes individually now what
you're going to want to do is name this
after the parent theme and then - child
now you can even add a hyphen and then
the name of your site just in case
you're moving this around to another
site or something just as a signifier
but for now we can just say 2014 - child
just like that and when I hit enter here
it creates this new folder okay so now
we have our folder here and you'll
notice there's nothing in it well we
need to make a style dot CSS file and
this CSS file is going to contain all of
our style overrides this is going to be
the styles that get added to the site
after the 2014 so it allows us to make
our modifications while keeping the 2014
styles so we're going to right click on
our 2014 - child and select new file now
when I click command S or save the file
I'm going to give this a name and the
name is just styled at CSS just like
that now this theme this CSS file
actually needs some information at the
top because WordPress is going to look
at this information so we're going to do
a forward slash and an asterisk to make
a comment
to a new line and we're going to give
this some information we need to give
this a themed name so a name its theme
name with a colon and then you're going
to want to give it a name so we can call
this level up child and on the next line
we're gonna have theme URI and now this
theme URI is actually just like whatever
the URL for your site is it's not going
to be doing anything crazy so we can
just say WordPress it's just whatever
your URL is now next is the description
and this is pretty self-explanatory you
just want to have a brief description
about your theme
okay now the next thing we have is
author and keep in mind there's a colon
after each of these titles and I'm going
to put my name here now we have author
URI now this is just the metadata for
this theme we can say HTTP 4 slash
forward slash and this is just my URL
for my website sorry it has have CSS
this thinks it's a CSS file so keeps on
wanting to give me like auto completion
on it ok great
and now we have template now for
template here you're going to want to
give this the name of the parent theme
so ours is going to be 2014 just like
that just the the name of it and then we
can give it a version and the version is
just going to be 0.1 sure whatever now
on the last line we're just going to
have an asterisk and another forward
slash ending the comment now let's come
to our wordpress site now that we have
that information in there we're going to
want to go ahead and go down to
appearance
now under our parents we have our 2014
theme right here but you'll notice we
also have our level of a child theme now
this appears here because of the
information that we put in to our CSS
file in fact if we click on this it's
actually going to have by Scotch Lansky
with a link to my website the version
it's going to have the description and
it's going to tell us that it's a child
theme of 2014 so already you can see
this starting to take shape
if we click activate our new theme is
going to be activated now let's come to
our site upon refresh you're going to
see something maybe a little frightening
all of our styles are gone right we just
wanted to override we didn't want to
delete everything so to make this
possible we need to come back to our CSS
file and in our CSS file we to import
with at import and then space URL and
then in here inside of quotes we're
going to say dot dot forward slash and
then the parent theme so our parent
theme is 2014 forward slash and then
style dot CSS now we need to finish it
off with a semicolon there and what this
is doing is it's importing the styles
from EDX actually importing the style
that CSS file from our 2014 theme and
then therefore any sort of modifications
we make after it let's say we want to
say body background uh background is
equal to blue if we want to say
something like that then we come to our
site you're going to see that even
though this main area showed up as
whatever it showed up as white for a
second we saw a little bit of blue there
it's because we have this div ID of page
or site has a background of white but if
I were to go ahead and turn that off you
can see it's actually definitely getting
our blue override so from here we can go
ahead and start not only overriding
themes or overriding the theme with our
CSS but we can start making other
modifications to template files because
we're using the theme that goes going to
override the main theme so this is the
very basics of customizing WordPress
we've created a child theme and we've
imported the old styles and we're ready
to go making further modifications to
customize this theme so as always it's a
Scott with level up tuts if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video our heads up at Twitter or
Facebook or the level up touch forum we
love to hear from you thanks for
watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
