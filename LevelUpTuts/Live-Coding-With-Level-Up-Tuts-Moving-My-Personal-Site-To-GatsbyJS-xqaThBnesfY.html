so I'm gonna be monitoring let me turn
the volume down okay so I'm gonna be
monitoring this stream the chat
everything like that so if there's
something going on I know every single
time there's been some technical
difficulties so if we're having any of
those let me know I'll do my best to
resolve it I'm hoping that this time I
finally have it down I have the audio
hopefully as stereo or at least mono but
not out of one year okay cool okay so
first and foremost I wanted to get
started by promoting the new podcast
here which is syntax dot FM where West
boss and I discuss all kinds of web
topics the first episode is on react
tools and we have two more episodes
coming one this Wednesday and one next
Wednesday and then those two topics are
going to be web RTC person we're gonna
be doing like talking a lot about video
and sort of what projects you can do
that are maybe not centered around just
building a you know a web cam thing
we're gonna be talking about some really
interesting projects that both west of I
have done using web RTC and just web
video in general okay what else we have
the third episode is going to be on
basically CSS preprocessors what Wes and
I both likes you know how we organize
what features we like to use so head
over to syntax at FM subscribe really
really fun podcast okay
so that said let's get to the point of
this stream what we're gonna be doing is
we're gonna be moving my site which is
got to Lewinsky comm over to Gatsby
now there is a some issues here that I
haven't quite addressed yet and I'm not
going to be able to address them on this
video so by the end of this video
we're not going to have is we're not
gonna have this thing done but the
components are gonna be there the react
stuff's going to be in reason being my
whole site is in stylist there's a lot
of CSS well there's not that much CSS
but either way there's you know about
400 lines of stylus code that I would
prefer not to totally rewrite but stylus
itself it's not currently working in
Gatsby apparently there's a pull request
in it's just not in the latest version
yet so we cannot use the stylus web pack
loader that I've been wanting to use so
I'm considering just moving this all to
styled components or just inline styles
with react so I can get that nice
server-side rendering stuff but so the
Styles aren't going to be there that's
that's pretty much it I might get some
Styles in here I just want to get these
components over and get this sort of up
and running and for the comment about
720p is the best quality yeah my
computer my network are just they're
just not strong enough to handle
anything more right now I'm gonna work
on that get a new computer and hopefully
everything will be better but right now
as it is this thing's like ready to blow
at 720p and if I do anything more than
that the stream is just laggy we found
out that it last time so that's why it's
7:20 okay so here's website this is what
we're gonna be replicating and not OBS
let's head to vs code there's really
nothing fancy about this website we are
using react router for there's four
pages the home page the about page the
projects page and the contact page and
like I said really nothing fancy
there's a lot of stuff they could be
refactored right like there's some wet
code here I'm repeating myself a whole
bunch you could turn that into an array
of objects right so yeah so while we do
this we're gonna improve upon it we're
gonna take this up and we're going to
we're going to put this into Gatsby and
the site's gonna be way faster
um I did make my webpage yeah just by
myself it's pretty much how I work on
most things so let's see I should note
that the current site is in meteor and
you might be wondering why the heck I
would do a site in meteor that's just
for static pages the answer is because
there was a bunch of admin back-end
tools that I was using for myself to
keep track of a bunch of stuff i I just
totally deleted all of those features
send me recently cuz I just wasn't using
them they're stagnating because of that
there's really no reason for this site
not only to be on meteor but to have a
database or anything right so one of the
reasons why I'm redoing it I probably
won't change the style a little too much
though because I think I just refreshed
it okay so enough of me dancing there in
the background let's go ahead and I've
installed Gatsby already and might be
worthwhile to have that open well okay
I've had Gatsby installed already just
MPI installed Gatsby and we can now say
Gatsby not develop new and I'm just
gonna name this what I named this before
thank you as st 2015 so we'll do as T
2017 and let's see how long this takes I
would make break dancing tutorials but
there's a ton of good ones well I don't
know if there's a ton of good ones but I
just have to get a lapel mic and all
that stuff I've taught lessons a lot to
children to adults whatever but never
online
okay so this is just basically gonna get
us up and running install a bunch of
stuff
bring our dependencies in
see
when this is all done I'll be available
in my folder here Gatsby is a static
site generator it's built using graph QL
and react and webpack I would prefer if
you don't ddos my website just cuz
that's mean like I don't need to be mean
to people
okay this is still installing it's gonna
take a little bit to install my CPU is
going crazy because of this live
streaming
this will be saved on the channel you
can watch it anytime so question gets
bjs I could be an amp website you know
I'm not like I don't I don't know
necessarily where I stand on the amp
website thing if you don't know about
amp it's basically an accelerated mobile
page for Google and it adds a little bit
of overhead sort of it's a Google only
thing I just don't know how I feel about
it just yet the sites are super fast but
once we get this up and going with
Gatsby other than the video itself
loaded up here this site's gonna load
really super fast like I said this is
taking forever to install because my CPU
is going nuts doing this live stream it
might help if I close out to Lenski calm
or at least get away from this video
but yeah the reason why Gatsby's great
basically allows you to use your react
webpack tools to build really super fast
static sites in addition it also allows
you to connect to all sorts of things
using plugins you could connect to a
wordpress back-end and all sorts of
stuff like that and bring in your data
using graph QL so there's a lot of
really nice positive things for the
future of gatsby in terms of using it
for more than just maybe like a website
like this but I mean you can bring in
data from markdown files in a blog
really easily you can bring in like I
said Drupal or WordPress and use it as a
front-end for that ok so it looks like
this is all in I'm gonna change
directories into st 2017 and I'm going
to run gets be develop and you'll get
this up and going I'm also going to drop
st 2017 and 2 vs code here
I'm considering a series on Gatsby I'm
just this is my second time using it the
first time was during the level up first
look and that was literally the my first
look at it this time we're gonna dive
into a little bit more although we're
not not doing anything complex so okay
so check it out we have this installed I
have my source folder which is basically
we're going to be spending most of our
time where we have a layout which is
basically just our index layout and I
have we have pages in here index page
two we're going to obviously you wrote a
page to or at least change the name of
it
utils there's a type of graph typography
utility here that allows us to set font
sizes I haven't decided if I want to use
this yet I will maybe do that but maybe
just not on camera because I need to
take a look at it yes I do use vias code
over atom because it's much faster that
is literally why I use it Adam
when I was getting into larger projects
was just totally slogging down and as
much as I liked Adam it can't handle
large projects or at least can't right
now okay so check it out first things
first I want to start to move in some
things like my header and stuff like
that also the site is up and running at
port localhost 8,000
okay cool so I have this Gatsby header
let's get into some code here and you
can see I'm working with my main
template I have my page tile which is
set by react or said here by the Gatsby
default starter
I can just say Scott tollens key okay I
might actually change that to be my
actual header whatever it is I'm not
gonna worry about the meta right now
I'll change it now we have some things
here we have this header which is some
divs we have this div with a background
of Rebecca purple we have another div
that contains the header link yeah I'm
just gonna start nuking some of this
stuff out of here so first and foremost
let's let's get rid of this header stuff
cuz I don't need it I'm going to maybe
come back and look at some of these
Styles like I said these this some of
the site is probably due for another
look or a rewrite this theme for vs code
is material design
I think it's material dark something
color theme should do this at the
beginning of each material theme pale
Knight it's under the material theme
group there's a whole bunch of them I'm
using the insiders build a vs code so
it's the the beta beta version
okay so we have a header just copy this
thing over the styles are gonna be an
absolute mess
that's okay and what's cool about this
gatsby is that they are using react
router even though you're using it from
gets B link or at least I'm pretty sure
they're using react router from what I
saw when I was looking at in reactive
tools but if you're already using the
link tag you don't have to update your
link tags to something else
we just have linked so that's nice I
don't have to update this you could save
this
yeah okay cool okay so nothing crazy
obviously this is gonna be a lot of
copying and pastry now now we don't need
to add it is I don't need to add this
switch right because before we had our
reactor router and the reactor was
taking care of the routing and gets B
we're not going to actually be doing any
sort of switch or Route tags it's going
to all be based on these page titles and
it's going to be output through this dot
props children okay so for instance our
index page is actually going to be our
index page here or I believe my home
component so I'll get to that also I
have a footer here might as well throw
the footer into this layout yes Google
will index these pages because they are
just straight-up HTML that's the best
part about this is that you're not like
it's not Google having to render a react
file you know like a I mean it can do
that but it's it's actually just
straight-up HTML
so there's these HTML files are
generated via the build tool and then it
also gives you a JavaScript bundle so
initial loads really super fast all of
your pages load super fast and it's
really nice okay
so this is a like I said it's gonna be
ugly for the most part because I'm not
worrying too much about my Styles right
now cuz they're in stylist as I
mentioned before let's actually go ahead
and refactor this footer for instance I
have a list of links and really all I
need is a name for them and a link so I
could do that in an array of objects
just a collection here so let's go ahead
and do that I'm gonna just do it above
my class here when you just have a
constant we can have footer links
make sure this heads be named
and link
let me get rid of the sidebar here you
can see this a little bit more basically
what I'm doing here as I'm pulling all
of these links into an array of objects
reason being just to save some I don't
know I don't have to rewrite all of my
classes you don't have to rewrite all of
that code just a little bit of keeping
it nice and dry here let's actually do
this let's get rid of this again this
one of the coolest shortcuts for vs code
and other things but if you hold shift
option and then hit the down key it will
copy and move down a line like that
super easy so that's scrolling down back
and forth kind of stinks you tuned
right now I'm just refactoring the
footer a little bit so I want to save
some space here I don't wanna have to
rewrite this list out and I'll make
adding links in the future easier bit
bucket
I'm gonna pull this LinkedIn link
because I really am NOT a fan of
LinkedIn overall so not gonna bother
with that one it's not gonna make the
cut
okay let's close this object off there
we go so now that we have these footer
links check it out like this right now
what we can do is simply just map over
them in react or in JavaScript down here
we can write this stuff once so inside
of social I can do footer links dot map
I can have a link okay
no each link is simply just going to be
this now I actually notice I have this
target --blank thing I need that rel no
loopback what's that uh I believe it's
rel no loopback I don't know it offhand
I have to copy and paste it
oh well nofollow I believe that's it
okay rel equals nofollow cool so if
you're not familiar with this just
Google rel equals nofollow and target
blank you'll see that there's some
vulnerability of using target blank and
single page applications without using
rel nofollow' so until I get this new
version of the site please don't explain
my site okay check it out what we need
here inside of the HRF because we want
the link so we can say link dot link
referencing link dot link and for the
title we want it to be linked that name
name okay and what we should see now
what I'm doing is I'm right here is I'm
iterating over that array on outputting
essentially just the same thing over and
over again what we should see in our
code
because this is just react is the where
to find me list is doubled right it's
got everything kind of twice so now I
can just go ahead and get rid of this
what this is doing is its transforming
you know I don't know X amount of lines
of markup into really just four lines
five lines of markup but then we have
our like data structure up here so I'll
main Amin didn't save you any lines
overall in code if I wanted to change
any of the markup itself and now get
super easy and I want to use the link
name here for the class name however I
need this like to lowercase I believe
the property is to lowercase yes okay
see if everything is all good here I'll
put on my dev tools should be able to
see that this has a class of lowercase
Twitter okay
it has a class of lowercase Twitter we
should be oh good okay so I now have the
footer in here I have the header in here
things are reflect or just a little bit
and now I get to work on the individual
pages so this will show you the strength
of Gatsby whereas before in the site I
had to write my routing config I had to
write all these routes
I had to import each of my components
and well you know all that stuff's great
you can see exactly what's going on
sometimes it's nice to have things that
are just a little bit easier and like I
said we can compare exactly what's going
on here so let's check out let's first
bring in the home page so the home page
is going to become my index component
and you can see the home component is
really nothing fancy here it's
essentially just a video and like one
line of text so let's head to Gatsby
yeah I know there's if there was a
YouTube I don't know if you can do
YouTube live BOTS or something like that
would be nice for T theme okay here we
are in our index page what I want to do
is paste that in here just like this
so this is our index page the only thing
is is it's not going to find this
showcase dot mp4 because it doesn't
exist in the site so we're gonna get a
big old fat you know cannot find error
404 right here we do have our text you
can see how fast this is so already as
I'm developing so I'll come back to this
video right now I want to get all my
pages in here okay so I'm gonna change
page two let's open up page two and just
rename it to be about about okay I'm
gonna get the about component from my
pages directory again these are all
really simple components my indentation
is kind of not great right now when I
did this I was indenting it for lines
for some reason now I'm not also my es
lint is currently not running probably
because I need to install all the es
lint dependencies
okay so basically I'm just copying and
pasting so what I have here is the way
Gatsby works is that it's looking inside
of your pages directory for these pages
and it's going to look at this file
about j/s and inside of pages since it's
not inside of another folder when you
route to forward slash about we're gonna
get the about content so like I said I
haven't written any routing I haven't
done anything to indicate that other
than naming this file about now if I
navigate to this page you can see my
resume is showing up my bio showing up
this bio is outdated it says I work for
Team Detroit which I haven't worked for
Team B tour in like two years
yeah no I will install prettier and yes
lint I have it all set up
but it's the configs not here and stuff
like that so right now this is just kind
of quick and dirty get this stuff over
and then I gotta need to figure out my
what I'm gonna do about these Styles if
I want to do inline styles or wait until
stylist is working with and gets beat to
move further so as you can see here
because I don't have a projects page
there's no dot project CSS or Jas it's
giving me a 404 and this 404 is
automatic I don't have to do anything to
configure this 404 we simply have a 400
for Jas and you know Gatsby knows what
to do here so this is really brilliant
for us because you know who wants to
write routing and then all that stuff
every single time like I said cool okay
so we have about we have index I'm gonna
make a new page and it's going to be for
my projects yeah this indenting is
killing me right now I need to get this
es lint set up
this site was made in 2015 if you're
wondering so or all is it was originally
made in 2015
so obviously coding styles and stuff
have changed a lot so what I'm going to
do for this page I'm simply just going
to copy this stuff I have used
typescript I'm not gonna even bother
with typescript
for something like this I think the page
is just projects yeah projects
so like I said Gatsby is using react
router but you don't have to write any
routes you don't have to write any route
config it just sort of does everything
based on your directory and once again
this this indenting is terrible and I
apologize for it but this is just my
project page it's essentially a link of
lists another one I could abstract out
into a collection of data but as you can
see here man this thing is so fast you
know you save it and you tab back and
you can't even beat it see here this is
my projects page now if you want my
personal opinion on how to do a
portfolio page I've never been a huge
fan unless you're like a visual designer
those you're a visual designer I've
never been a huge fan of linking to
images and stuff like that maybe if it's
a website that's no longer online you
could link to that kind of thing but if
it's a site that's no longer online do
you really need in your portfolio for me
it's like this stuff is is stuff that's
somewhat relevant so it's good to have
in here I would say react is not
overkill for this because I like react
and look at how fast this is we're
getting all of the benefits of using
react without having to have server I
mean this is all compiled into HTML and
then with a small bundle so yeah I guess
maybe there's nothing dynamic going on
here but it's gonna be really easy to
add page transitions to add all this
like none
you know the pages don't refresh
obviously in between we're doing it all
with JavaScript this is why would any
Jas why would you use any Jas framework
library for a static one page well in
this particular instance you could
access to like I said all of the nice
things about react you can add dynamic
things page transitions and stuff like
that you get this really fast routing
between pages because each page load
isn't an HTTP request
right we're doing one we're doing one
load right the initial load request and
that's statically generated into HTML
files so the reason why you would use it
is because if you had several different
HTML files and you were just loading
those up it's going to be you're gonna
be doing HTTP requests through each page
each page is gonna be a slower load time
each routing is gonna be slower really
this thing flies and it flies because
it's using a JS framework not because
it's well in addition to being static
okay so let's go ahead and pages we're
gonna do a contact so you could go with
Express write but why would you use
Express when you don't need a server
like I don't need a node server to run
this if it compiles just HTML files
right you know HTML files can be loaded
up anywhere where if you have an express
server your expressive rest to be
running all the time for the site to be
working if it's static HTML pages you
could load a static HTML page anywhere
really even on github pages so you don't
have to pay for hosting that way okay
last one is the contact page again I've
always been a fan of simple contact
pages so like not having a contact form
because why do you need a contact form
people could just email you H do I
recommend using HTML pre-processors I
like them but since I started using
react I stopped using them only cuz
majority the community doesn't also when
you're doing tutorials a lot you uh you
want to make sure you're using stuff
that other people are are using and so
it doesn't really help me in any sort of
way right now but there was a time when
I really liked using Jaden in that sort
of stuff
all right I don't think I need react
helmet well I'll want react helmet on
most these pages actually to be honest I
don't get to be linked okay contact feel
free to contact me
projects about and just like this we
have this site you can see the source
you can see you know we have some styles
and stuff in here
but this is just the dev site if we
wanted to compile this all out I believe
there's a gap see command it's like
shoot I don't know it offhand I'd have
to look on their page yeah but as you
can see here I wrote no routing I didn't
actually change a whole time I just copy
and pasted a bunch of stuff over and
just like that I have my entire site up
and running obviously it's not fancy
just yet now let's talk about something
interesting here cat's PJs okay so I
want to bring in this video so my Scott
talansky comm I have a video in the
background of me dancing and I want to
bring that in but I want to show you a
good way to do it here or I don't maybe
not a good way but like something fun
here let's see I have st 2017 st 15 and
so one way we could get this working as
simply in the public static folder we
can just toss this in or at least I'm
under the assumption of like I said this
is my first time really using Gatsby so
I'm under the assumption of that we can
just toss this footage in here
I have a bunch of videos here I'm trying
to figure out which one I used and use
this one okay yeah uh well I use the
same one I used before cuz I like this
one a lot
some use the same video I have a WebM HD
version I have an mp4 and let's see
they're in the static folder as far as I
know from looking at this documentation
just by simply being in the static
folder we should be able to access them
at just flat slash the the URL here but
like I said this is my first time using
this so we're gonna find out and there
is actually a way you can import them
which we're gonna be also be doing in a
second
I'm going to my index file where I have
or actually I don't want my index on
with my index page where you can see I'm
loading up showcase mp4 or showcase to
see if this works at all
it's okay it doesn't look like it's
finding these videos so I'm wondering if
they're inside of static like this we're
gonna see this works I could always just
read the docs but this is more fun there
we go so that's the whole thing
this yeah okay there's a ton of videos
of me doing this online so if you follow
me on Twitter or Instagram I'm always
posting I'm always posting videos like
this so okay here we are videos up
videos working so looks like it needs
the aesthetic now I'm gonna try
something interesting here I am going to
load up this video it says here you can
import right into a JavaScript package
or right into a javascript file using
the standard import so the way they do
it is import logo from logo dot ping
right so you can import a logo and then
use its source right here and it says
you can do this with mp4s and web M's
and stuff like that so that's gonna be
exciting for me to try so let's figure
this out it looks like it wants it to be
in the same directory here as the file
so let's break this by pulling this out
of static now and into source pages and
just drop these in here like I said I
haven't done this before
so we're gonna see if this works
when you import it I'm wondering if it
needs the same title like import logo
from logo ping like doesn't need to be
logo or could you import it as anything
these are questions that I'll find out
right now okay so we're gonna import
will do will take we'll leave this as
will have this
the import vid I'm gonna see if this
works kid experiment learning through
experimentation show case to dot mp4
okay now let's go ahead and do what they
say and just counsel log this variable
to see if this can work okay
yeah looks like the index is logging
this out maybe seems like it should be
so now I'm going to change the source
from this to this I'm also going to just
comment out the web M version because
why net and it's back cool
this will be on my channel this will be
totally saved here as a yonas Jonas here
Jonas
I hope tell me if I'm spelling your name
or saying your name wrong I'm terrible
with stuff like that Jonas says that you
could name it anything and he is
absolutely correct so we can say we
could name this billboard yeah mp4
I'm gonna do the same thing but with
WebM now why would you do this import
syntax for this it talks a little bit
about it in the docs after I get done
typing here I'll show you
I actually have no idea how much this
part of it works for video but we'll see
I am moving from meteor because the site
does not need a database I used to have
a database and I used to have some admin
tools built into it since then I have
totally abandoned all that stuff deleted
it and now this site is like and does
not need a database one so ever so it's
gonna be a lot faster it already is it's
already a lot faster
I'm also reason why there's no Styles
here is because my Styles are in stylist
Gatsby is currently not supporting
stylist at this very second although
there is a pull request in for it so it
should be very very soon and I can't
decide if I want to do inline Styles for
this yet I know the instant inline
Styles the inline Styles debate is like
raging pretty hard right now so this
kind of projects are great ones to see
how much you like doing inline Styles on
ok let's do it let's see here so yeah ok
check it out to read through this to
reduce the number of requests to the
server importing images that are less
than 10 thousand bytes returns a data
URI instead of a path so I'm not
confident because when I count this it
return to path so we will see if there's
any benefit at all to me importing this
because they're not images and their
large videos like I said I would
probably need to read a little bit more
about that
okay yeah so this is really it right I
mean this is nothing to those the ways
you could obviously change that our
instead of importing react component
react we could change this like this
there's a little code style things you
could do the connection dropped test
test test
let's see I'm like turning off any
device I have that's on the Wi-Fi right
now maybe that's doing it I'm working on
getting fiber internet over here at the
house so hopefully that is a thing very
soon
I'm currently struggling on some Comcast
that's way too expensive for what it is
you know classic classic okay cool so
check it out nothing really crazy here
but everything's up and running I've
refactored a few of my components
everything is working like I said the
Styles aren't in here cuz I got to redo
all of the styles for this entire thing
I am getting a not an error but a
warning about not having a key on this
map key equals link dot link that name
those are all unique
right so as yonas is saying if you
import it it's now basically under the
control of web packing gatsby rather
than just sort of like just being a
standard request okay but yeah that's
pretty much it here
nothing nothing crazy I guess the next
step for me is to spend a lot of time
going through and taking my stylus and
all that code I have there and either
using inline styles or waiting til
stylus is working and getting this up
and running because the last thing I
want to do is well I don't want to
rewrite this since in sass right now
just because I'd rather do something a
little bit different if I'm going to but
yeah that's it here we have a new fast
site we have all sorts of cool stuff and
I'm gonna get working on getting this
inline Styles or the Styles up so that I
can have my site back to where it was
this is Gatsby j/s this is my first real
time spending any time with it I'm not
doing anything complex but head to their
site there's a ton of cool complex stuff
you can do there's good examples I'm
excited for when the rest of this
tutorial is done because I want to learn
a little bit more how about how this
bringing in data works here and yeah
that's pretty much it cool so thank you
for watching this live stream like I
mentioned before syntax dot F M for West
Boston eyes new podcast or you can check
out level up tutorials Oh
yonis is suggesting I build a static
version so that's actually a good idea
because this is the version of the site
that you can take with you you can see
under the getting started we have
different commands for the CLI like
there's Gatsby build which will form an
optimized production build of your site
generating static HTML per route
JavaScript code bundles which is what I
like to hear
there's also Gatsby serve which starts a
local HTML server for ten
in your build site so obviously the one
we want here is going to be gets be
build and Dean by the way who says you
would love to see a livestream of the
styles I would love to do that except
for I don't sort of know what I'm doing
with it yet and that won't make for
super compelling live stream as I try to
figure out if I want to rewrite things
or not but we'll see if I get halfway
through it and things are going well I
can do that okay so I'm gonna run gatsby
build I'm thinking you should be able to
run gatsby build at the same time as
you're running or what does this do
exactly
again I could probably read the docs but
so Iran gets B Iran
oh it's compiling it right now okay I
was like where's it building to okay why
did I leave meteor J s I haven't left
meteor for most things I have several
projects running on meteor this site
just like is the last thing in the world
that needs be dear J s at one point it
had a database and I had some stuff in
here and I've abandoned it I want to be
going straight up static because I'm not
bringing in data from a database I'm not
doing anything real-time so nothing
against meteor there was just really 0%
reason for me to use it on this okay so
it looks like our production bundle is
finished
it took 52 seconds it won't take you
that long my CPU is struggling with this
live stream and you can see here my
public folder looks very different my
public folder is very very different so
let's check this out and whoever says
RTC for life yes okay so check it out we
have a bunch of different JavaScript
bundles which is great because we have
source maps too so you can see here we
have our layout component all those
stuff is nothing you're ever going to
touch because these are obviously the
minified and compressed versions of
everything and we have my index.html
right here what you can see is built as
like a standard HTML page right
index.html we have all our good stuff
it's loading up a bunch of our
JavaScript bundles here so we get our
correct bundle but you can see it's
completely rendered out all of that code
into straight-up HTML that's going to
load very very fast so whoever says
meteor or node meteor is node so I guess
you would say both
and then we have just basically a
style.css which I'm not using because I
don't have any styles in here yet but so
it looks like that's what the build
command does it generates this public
folder and this public folder you can
see has all of our pages completely
rendered out into HTML pages and this
this static for this public folder here
that weight public stat yeah this public
folder over here that we're getting out
of everything is the one that you would
just throw up on a web server you could
just open this up anywhere you could
open this file in a browser whatever and
it's gonna it's gonna be sweet now for
deployment I'm I have a digitalocean
server that I have a bunch of node stuff
running on and this would just be fine
you just throw it up there I have an
engine X on there points to this index
file and should be a-ok the cool part
about this is we don't need a like a
node server anything to run this right
so an instant becomes easier to host
anywhere you want you could host this on
like GoDaddy if you wanted to if you
really wanted to you could host this on
GoDaddy but yeah so okay so this is
Gatsby so you can see here I built a
public version does anybody have any
last questions here before I sign off
yeah they do taht they do talk about
surge in the docs for Gatsby which seems
pretty cool if you already have an asura
though it's not super necessary but it
seems like a cool place to host nice and
easy
howdy to Adam who I met at dinosaur Jay
s super nice guy you should check out
Adams YouTube channel but yeah okay if
there's no more questions I'm gonna sign
off here we got this up and running like
I said I'm gonna dig around on the
styles here and actually start to finish
this build out and I'll let everybody
know when the site's up online so that
you can check it out
PAH through at see how fast it is you
can host these on github pages that's
actually one of the benefits that gets
be lists on their home page if you
scroll down it's like here's where you
can deploy this github pages search a
static host s3 self-hosted any of this
stuff so part of the thing part of the
great part about about this this
platform and static websites in general
you get to use all your cool react tools
you can make it as dynamic as you want
but you still get all the benefits of
straight-up HTML so that gets a big you
can't see my thumb for some reason I
don't know why it gets a big thumbs up
for me okay cool so that's it
no biggie hit me up on Twitter or
Facebook at level up Tut's look for me
at level up tutorials comm you can go
level toriel's comm slash store to
purchase anything from the site a lot of
tutorial series up there I just put up a
react native for every one series which
is not intended to be like the end-all
be-all of react native but it's for
people who have limited react and react
native understanding so that you can get
up and start running real native
applications that compiled to literal
native applications using just react and
you don't have to know react to do this
course I teach react while I'm teaching
your react native so react native for
everyone and somebody says can you host
your meteor app in Heroku I host a
couple of meteor apps in Heroku using
meteor build pack our horse meteor build
pack horse check that out if you want to
be hosting on Heroku it's a nice
experience I just moved up level of
tutorials to meteors galaxy platform
because of the you know the Pedro
enduring sort of stuff and overall just
platform stability I was running on a
digitalocean droplet am up or meteor
deploy got a little too awful for me so
I bailed Adam says a good sequel to West
bosses react courses it's it's a little
bit more basic than
Wes's react course because it
react native react native is a huge huge
beast so to say my original react native
series was like 10 hours long and the
moment something became invalidated and
ruin the entire series so what I'm doing
now is I have a very basics one and then
I'm gonna move on to intermediate and
advanced stuff because there's so much
there in react native I am a freelance
developer I'd pretty much do level up
Tut's full-time I've been working in
agencies my entire career up until now
and yeah just doing level up huts and
doing freelance yeah so hit me up check
out my website check out level up
tutorials hit me up on Twitter or
anything like that
thanks so much for watching and this is
