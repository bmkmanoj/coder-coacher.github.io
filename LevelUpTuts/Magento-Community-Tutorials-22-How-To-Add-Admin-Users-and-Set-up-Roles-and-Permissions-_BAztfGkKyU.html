up Tut's and today I'm gonna be talking
about user accounts for Magento and I'm
not talking about customer user accounts
but admin user accounts so let's say you
have other people that are helping you
run the site which in most cases that's
probably true unless you're a small
business but let's say you're using this
as a larger business so you have people
that aren't always you aren't always
going to be the one doing everything on
the site and you don't want to have one
login that everybody shares so you can
do is a set up other login accounts and
even set up roles with permissions for
what they can edit so today I'm going to
show you how to create a new role we're
gonna give them permissions to only do
certain things and then we're gonna
create a user and then we're going to
login with this user and see what that
experience is like for them so if we go
to system we go to permissions
we're gonna go to roles first and we're
gonna create a new role so right now the
only thing in here is administrators and
if you look at administrators they're
gonna have resource access all and if
you go to role users it's gonna show
admin which is me so this is good
because admins need to access everything
and built into Magento that's how its
set up however not everybody's gonna
want to have access to everything so
let's click this add a new role and
we're gonna have this just be edit are
so this is just somebody who's just
gonna be in here okay the name at this
point isn't particularly important to
this lesson it can be whatever that
specific role is in Europe company so
role resources here we can have resource
access all which is what an admin is but
you already have a role with all so in
that case you would just create another
admin one is custom and we want them to
be able to look at we want them to be
able to let's say here's the list right
so there's a ton of stuff here you can
really have it down to anything that
they want to do so I'm trying to think
we'll just have them do
we want them to be able to manage
ratings and reviews we want them to be
able to manage customer reviews we want
them to be able to manage tags we don't
want them to really be able to change
tax stuff because why would they have to
change that maybe that seems like more
of like an admin thing let's see we also
want them to be able to edit the
newsletter we don't want them to be able
to or no we want them to be able to edit
CMS pages that way in case there's like
typos or anything you don't have to be
bothered to get in there to do that what
else you know let's see there's all
sorts of different things in here right
so you can have this be so finely tuned
to what you need them to do and have
only have access to those things we
don't want them to be able to import or
export I'm just minimizing this we don't
want them to be able to create users we
don't want them to be able to install
some things with Magento connect web
services we don't care about them seeing
notifications they do not need to touch
configuration North Mobile so pretty
much need the system stuff they don't
need to touch let's go back up here and
let's see we want them to be able to do
anything with orders because they're
going to be the people that are handling
the orders invoices shipments and mmm we
don't need them to touch billing
agreements tax so this seems pretty good
again they can also manage customers but
not change attributes or anything okay
so this is good so let's just save this
role this is our editor like I said you
have to go in there and finely-tuned
this to be exactly what you want the NIP
access for but it's really laid out and
those menus are in the same order and
same layout as these are so you should
by looking at that you should be able to
tell exactly what that person is going
to be able to do so let's come over here
and now we're going to go to permissions
users and we're going to create an
editor so I'm going to add a new user
and this username let's see this is
going to be their name we'll just be
like let's just say it's Tim right just
for whatever reasons that's their
username
and Tim Tim okay I don't want this to be
a real email if I can have this just be
my email okay okay and it's going to be
active you can also have user accounts
here that are disabled so that if
somebody is no longer working at your
store but you don't want to leave them
out of the system you can just have it
be set to inactive so now we're gonna
have them be an editor okay and we don't
need a touch rest role let's save this
oh then I'm just going to add him cheap
password okay so it's getting mad about
my email and then I'm just gonna use
Scott I level up tuts
I'd like a thousand emails okay
okay that should be good now we'll save
this cool now we have Tim Tim okay it
was an email Scott so I'm going to open
this up and a new window were not logged
in it's just an incognito window in
Chrome and this is just so we can see
that this person isn't logged in and now
I can login as Tim so Tim and then his
password okay so he gets his message
this is what his admin section looks
like if you notice he doesn't have
configuration he doesn't have anything
really I mean he has got CMS so he can
get in here dead at this stuff
he's got newsletter templates he's got
customer stuff he can do catalog reviews
and tags but he cannot add products but
he can also view orders invoices and
shipments so here you can see that he's
getting in here viewing this he can edit
it and so yeah so this is what it look
this is what the site would look like in
the admin section for Tim as a member of
our story this way he's not able to get
in mess with any of the stuff and he can
only do the stuff that you need him to
do or whoever
okay well that's adding a user in
Magento and being able to configure
their permissions as an administrator as
always if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment on the
video hit is a bit Twitter or level up
Tut's and you know just let us know what
you're thinking and you can you know hit
