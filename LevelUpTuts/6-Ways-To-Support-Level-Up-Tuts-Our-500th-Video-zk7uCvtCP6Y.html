of huts and today I'm so excited to
announce that this is our 500th video I
can't believe it's only been two years
and we're at 500 videos and even more
exciting we just hit three million views
now I hope maybe by the time you watch
this it's in the future and maybe we
have more millions of views than that
but three million is absolutely gigantic
and I cannot be thankful enough for
anybody who's watched LevelUp huts or
learned anything so thank you so much
for anybody who's watched LevelUp Hut's
participated in the comments reached out
to us via email or forum or Facebook or
Twitter so I wanted to take this video
to give you six ways that you can help
out level up huts and now the first one
is the most obvious and the best way the
absolute best way you can help level up
huts is by sharing it posted on blogs
post it on places like Reddit post it on
your Twitter your Facebook anywhere that
you can get people to watch it I would
absolutely love if you would spread
LevelUp huts that would mean more to me
than anything all right number two is we
have a service called level up pro and
level up Pro is $8.99 a month or 95
dollars for the year and it gives you
access to downloadable video content it
gives you access to an ad-free forum and
some other nice features we're even
having in code examples to the tutorials
right now so keep watching head on over
to level up Tut's calm I'll put the link
in the description so it's nice and easy
to find if you want to sign up for level
of pro now the third thing you can do is
to sign up for a hosting plan with our
referral code to digitalocean
now digitalocean isn't a sponsor of
level up huts or anything I just really
enjoy their hosting platform so check
out digitalocean if you need hosting I
highly recommend it alright the fourth
way you can help support level up huts
is by flattered if you go to level up
tux comm and at the bottom click the
donate button you can see that we have a
button to flatter us now flatter is a
great way to support content creators
you basically set up a monthly amount
that you're willing to donate to a
content creator
and that amount can be spread out
amongst as many or as few content
creators as you want and those people
get like a monthly but chunk of that
subscription cost you're paying to
everybody at once now another way is
just above that we have this donation
button and that is simply for anybody
who wants to just basically give us
money to keep doing what we're doing and
improve upon and prove what we're doing
so if you want to just donate to the
free tutorials we're producing you can
go ahead and click that button and the
donations are accepted through PayPal
and the six way that you can help
support LevelUp cuts is by checking out
our patron page patron is similar to
flattered and where you're saying you're
going to give a set amount however this
time no matter what you say you're going
to give to a given content creator that
much is going to be charged per month so
check out patron it's a great way to
support content creators on YouTube by
giving directly to their goals so I've
had a great time making these 500 videos
and I can't wait to make 500 more so
keep watching support level up tuts and
thank you I'll see you in the next video
