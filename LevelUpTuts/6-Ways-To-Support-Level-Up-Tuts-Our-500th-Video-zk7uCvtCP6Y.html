and today I'm so excited to announce
that this is our 500th video I can't
believe it's only been two years and
we're at 500 videos and even more
exciting we just hit 3 million views now
I hope maybe by the time you watch this
it's in the future and maybe we have
more millions of views than that but 3
million is absolutely gigantic and I
cannot be thankful enough for anybody
who's watched level up Hut's or learned
anything so thank you so much for
anybody who's watched level up Tut's
participated in the comments reached out
to us via email or form or Facebook or
Twitter so I wanted to take this video
to give you six ways that you can help
out level up Tut's and now the first one
is the most obvious and the best way the
absolute best way you can help level up
touch is by sharing it posted on blogs
posted on places like reddit post it on
your Twitter your Facebook anywhere that
you can get people to watch it I would
absolutely love if you would spread
level up Tut's that would mean more to
me than anything all right number two is
we have a service called level up pro
and level up pro is eight ninety-nine a
month or ninety five dollars for the
year and it gives you access to
downloadable video content it gives you
access to an ad free form and some other
nice features we're even having in code
examples to the tutorials right now so
keep watching head on over to level up
Tut's com I'll put the link in the
description so it's nice and easy to
find if you want to sign up for level of
pro now the third thing you can do is to
sign up for a hosting plan with our
referral code to digital ocean now
digital ocean isn't a sponsor of level
up totes or anything I just really enjoy
their hosting platform so check out
digital ocean if you need hosting I
highly recommend it alright the fourth
way you can help support level up tuts
is by flattered if you go to level of
Tut's calm and at the bottom click the
donate button you can see that we have a
button to flatter us now flatter is a
great way to support content creators
you basically set up a monthly amount
that you're willing to donate to a
content creator
is and that amount can be spread out
amongst as many or as few content
creators as you want and those people
get like a monthly but chunk of that
subscription cost you're paying to
everybody at once now another way is
just above that we have this donation
button and that is simply for anybody
who wants to just basically give us
money to keep doing what we're doing and
improve upon and prove what we're doing
so if you want to just donate to the
free tutorials we're producing you can
go ahead and click that button and the
donations are accepted through paypal
and the sixth way that you can help
support level up Tut's is by checking
out our patron page patron is similar to
flatter and where you're saying you're
going to give a set amount however this
time no matter what you say you're going
to give to a given content creator that
much is going to be charged per month so
check out patron it's a great way to
support content creators on YouTube by
giving directly to their goals so I've
had a great time making these 500 videos
and I can't wait to make 500 more so
keep watching support level up Tut's and
thank you I'll see in the next video but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
