of Tut's and today we're gonna continue
this blog that we've been doing and
we're going to be adding to it the time
element and the time element is a new
element in html5 and really what it does
is it tells your browser that the
content inside of an element denotes a
time and this can be used in all sorts
of ways so we could say in our blog post
time metadata here that we have we could
go ahead and use a time format with the
time element so let's go to our code and
right here on this first ignore it says
time metadata inside of here I'm just
going to have a time element and now I
can put a date so I'm going to put
today's date which is the year 2013 and
the today is the I believe the 22nd of
June so oh six and then 22nd all right
so this is our date so let's save this
let's come back here and we now have
this date that looks like what you'd
expect because it's exactly what we just
typed and we bump up this size here so
you can see a little bit better and it's
just today's date so at its most simple
you can use this time element and it's
gonna pick up this content and pick up
that it's June 22nd 2013 that's because
that it's looking for a a specific
format inside of here it's looking for
year year year year - month month - day
day so what happens if you're you want
to express time for this blog post in a
different way
so we're gonna have here I'm just gonna
say post it on and with a colon and then
inside of here I'm just going to have it
say June 22nd 2013 and now we want this
to be able to pick up this correct time
format for us so there's actually an
attribute of the time element that we
can use called date
and we can set date time to the actual
date format that we were using before so
it'll be 2013 - oh six - 22 so this is
going to let the time element know that
the actual date time is is this date the
year 2013 June 22nd regardless of how
this is typed this could be complete
nonsense in here you could have just
have numbers in here and this would see
this as this date so you might not want
to do that for your users sake but just
an example now if we refresh this we see
posted on June 22nd 2013
so you notice this date time doesn't
affect the actual output it's just an
attribute that the browser can see and
know that this is the correct date so
what's in other ways we can use this
well we can have this instead of being a
date here we can have this be something
like 7:00 p.m. and we want this day time
to actually have the time so we could
use this as 1900 so now--so is going to
see this is 7:00 p.m. in the fact this
is actually looking at UTC so it's in a
24 24 hour clock so you could actually
specify the time zone here as well and
if we wanted to say we were in the
Eastern time zone we could say - zero
five zero zero so this is back five
hours and so this is going to be 7:00
p.m. Eastern Standard Time so that's
pretty cool and what else can we do here
well we can add this to a specific date
so we could say 7:00 p.m. on a specific
date and so we had that date before so
it was 2013 - 0 6 - 22 and then now
we're gonna have a tea here notice how
you could also have just a space I sort
of like the tea because it's significant
oh it lets you know the time but let's
say June 22nd 2013 7 p.m. and now it's
going to read
this regardless of what you have in here
as this exact time so let's say this
let's check out our page its refresh
cool so why might this be useful well it
really just helps the browser and search
engines and all sorts of things know
that this is not only a tie but here
this is the specific time and it might
be really useful if for these blog posts
this says post it on but this time alone
that doesn't necessarily know that this
is the published date so what we can do
is we can actually add a boolean
attribute in here and notice how you
don't have to have a value for it all
you have to say is pub date
so if we say pub date just like that
save it what this is going to do is it's
going to tell the search engines that
this blog post was published on this
date at this time right here that way
maybe in a couple years down the line or
something it might not see this as being
relevant just because it's old or ok you
know could totally affect how people are
searching for this it's giving it the
exact publish date that way search
engines don't have to guess anymore now
keep in mind we can also have this
saying even less so we don't just have
to have a date time it doesn't have to
be this specific it doesn't have to be
an exact date and we can just say 2013
and it's grabbing the whole year
likewise we can say 2013 oh six and it's
grabbing the month June in 2013 we can
also say it's grabbing the month of June
and the 22nd as the date and this is
going to be saying it's the 22nd of June
on any year now we can even specify a
week so let's say if we have 2013 we
want to say it's the second week in 2013
we can say w-2 this means the second
week in 2013 so it'd be January 8th the
week of January 8th so great so this is
the time element it's pretty cool you
your blogposts use it where you have
time that might be relevant and just add
more semantic meaning to your code so as
always this is Scott with level up times
if any questions or comments leave a
