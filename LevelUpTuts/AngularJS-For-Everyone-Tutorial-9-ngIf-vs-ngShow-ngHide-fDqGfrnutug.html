up tutorials and today we're gonna show
you a couple of new directives in
angularjs now these directives are
things you might be using all the time
to show and hide content one of which is
ng-if and one of which is ng show or ng
hide so we're gonna be showing you what
the difference between show and hide or
ng if actually is so to do that we have
this toggle names that we have the show
names button coming up and it basically
turns on the names here but what we
really need to do is turn this into some
sort of a toggle so to do that I'm going
to show and hide buttons that say show
names and hi names based on what the
state currently is let's come to our
HTML and let's go ahead and add another
button here we had show names this is
going to be simply hi names and what we
want to do is have this mg click set the
toggle to false okay now if we come back
we have both buttons we can click show
names they show up we can click hi names
and they go away just like that
okay but you know clicking show names
all the names are there including hi
names while they're not is really just
sort of not something you want to have
available to your user so you don't want
to have a control that doesn't do
anything at that given time right now
what we want to do is show these based
on the toggle value now in the last
video we showed it you showed you how to
do that using ng class where we were
just toggling at class up hidden now
let's check out some other approaches
okay now on our first button we can say
ng - if equals now for ng if we can just
put quotes in here and inside of these
quotes we're gonna pass it this value
and the value is going to be dur List
toggle okay so let's see what this does
let's come to our page and refresh
you'll now see that it the show names
button isn't showing up at all okay so
we're saying only show if this value is
true
but because it's false the buttons are
not showing up so by default we want to
have an exclamation point in front of
this for show names so now the buttons
going to show up as long as the names
are being hidden now for the height
names button we want to have the exact
opposite because this is a toggle we
want ng if if this value is false then
don't show the name hide names because
the names already hidden okay let's
refresh you can now see we have this
show names button you can click it and
now we just have the hide names button
you can click it show names hi names
show names perfect let's actually check
out our HTML over here and our inspect
and let's see what's going on so as you
can see what's really interesting about
this is in this class approach that we
did before with these items to show and
hide them when they're hidden let's
click hide in the HTML it's still there
it's just this class of hidden is
display:none
however watch this area right here where
it says button button show names when we
click this show names button it
disappears so ng-if isn't just adding a
class to something that hides it it's
actually removing it from the Dom
entirely and replacing it or adding it
to the Dom entirely so you can see
there's a little comment here this is
ng-if so it's just letting you know
based on this comment that there is
something there with this toggle and
even the one that's visible has that
same thing watch as i click this again
again the Dom has changed okay so that's
ng-if now we also have directives
ng-show and ng-hide to show and hide
things let's check out what those do so
we can say ng show if this is equals to
true so in this case we want this
variable to equate to true for this
variable to show and we're accomplishing
that but with this exclamation point
once more so ng-show and ng-hide
to act the exact same way so we can just
change this ng - if - ng - show now if
they act the same way what's the
difference well now let's take a look at
our dumb look right here we have two
buttons okay and I'm clicking they're
still showing and hiding each other just
like we wanted them to however the both
buttons exist in the DOM and you'll
notice that we have a class of ng - hide
so remember in the last video when we
made our own class of hidden and applied
to this to this URL
well we actually didn't have to do that
because this is the exact function of
ng-show and ng-hide right so it's adding
a class already for us and let's
actually see that class I'm gonna close
the terminal there and let's scroll up
you can see it gives it a display:none
important so it's gonna override
whatever you have so we didn't actually
have to do our previous example with ng
class just with ng show and hide because
it's a feature that you know you're
probably gonna do more often you don't
have to write it every single time so
angular gives you the option of doing
ng-show and ng-hide now we also have the
option to have ng-hide instead of ng
show here okay now if we go to mg hide
again okay and refresh you'll notice
that we have the opposite the hyda names
button is showing up even though the
names aren't I'm showing so for this
particular instance we'd have to swap
and stay like this if this is true then
hide this button since this is going to
be false it's going to show it and
likewise the exact opposite for our
second button if we come here again
refresh show names hi names show names
hi names perfect cool so that's ng show
ng hide and ng-if are all different ways
of hiding and showing things you can see
that these two are just adding a class
like we did in the previous video ng if
is removing and adding things to the Dom
so these are directives you'll find
yourself using all the time as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
you have any questions
comments if it come in the video or here
stuff at Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
