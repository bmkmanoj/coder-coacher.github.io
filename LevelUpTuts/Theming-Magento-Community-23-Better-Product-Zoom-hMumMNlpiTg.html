tubs I'm gonna show you how to replace
the default jQuery zooming feature they
have with your own that's maybe a little
bit more updated we're gonna be using
this jQuery zoom it's a little bit
easier just hover over and said I have
it to do that slide in and all that
stuff that whatever the default one does
so to get started I want you to download
this jQuery zoom my jQuery plugin here
and we can get using this so just like
before we're gonna have to add this
jQuery file this jQuery zoom plug-in
this min we're gonna add this to our Jas
folder for our theme that's under
front-end molds under skin front-end our
theme name a default Jas just like we
have before if you have any trouble with
that you know feel free to go back to
watch any of the other ones where we
show you how to add a JavaScript file an
initial JavaScript file or something
like that I'm gonna throw this icon in
the I'm just gonna throw this in the CSS
folder for now and that should be good
we shouldn't have to do anything else
than that and in fact I'm gonna fix this
icon pack later so I'm just not going to
worry about it so for this jQuery zoom
plug-in all we really have to do is to
give this an element to zoom and it's
gonna be finding the full sized image
and it's gonna take care of the resizing
and everything for us but first off if
we go to our actual product page we
never have done any styling with this so
this image is just full sized and in
fact if I wanted to give this I'm gonna
say width is 50% well no actually I'm
gonna say this width is 200 pixels so
it's gonna be here okay
because it's unreasonable to be that
gigantic so in my CSS I'm just gonna
make a quick note here and it's going to
say in fact this has this product image
inside of a paragraph I'm gonna I'm not
gonna do that I'm going to say and it's
gonna be the class product
IMG box and I'm going to actually delete
that paragraph in our source code so
we're not gonna have to worry about that
but then in here we're just going to say
the image so the image that's inside the
product image box is going to be the one
that we want to tackle and this is going
to be width and it's going to be 200
pixels I'm gonna say this we can refresh
this page to make sure that as took and
here it is okay so the next thing we
want to do is we want to make sure that
our java scripts being added to the page
so as always we've been going to this in
our front-end file under layout and our
theme we've been going to local dot XML
and we've been adding in here so where
we've added other ones just like we have
before this is I'm gonna add this as a
new one and it's gonna be the same thing
except for this J's file has a different
name which I should have just copied I
could type it but you know there's no
there's no you know if you get it wrong
then you might be troubleshooting
something that you don't need to so I'm
just gonna copy this paste this in here
like so
okay so it's got that so now we should
be able to refresh this page and check
the source we should be able to see that
Script is one of these sources so I'm
gonna say zoom done okay
here it is here's the plug-in it's
really nice and lightweight to minified
and everything already for us cool so
all right back to here now we need to
edit this template that's generating
this image and modify it so it's using
the script we want it to be using so
that template is the media P HTML and
this is located under your the default
theme you can find this under template
catalog product view and then under view
there is a media P HTML so make sure you
grab this and keeping the
their structure the same drop it in your
own template catalog product view and
then we're gonna throw it right in here
okay actually this is the wrong one open
so I'm just gonna throw mine in there
you media here it is just gonna drag
this down copy it over just like we've
done every other time no I don't want
that app it come on I keep going and
instead of here it's gonna go and view
product view video description okay cool
so now let's open this up in our text
editor here and here we have this file
again as always I like to just make sure
I'm in the right file you know you
should probably know you're in the right
file and it's getting looked at but
there's always a good way to you know
just you do a test here and confirm that
okay so check this out if we have this
file this media Dappy HTML this file is
what's generating pretty much all the
image stuff and you can sort of tell by
like I said you know maybe you put a
test at the beginning in the bottom to
see exactly what this is modifying but
it's really just the image the media
stuff that you'd expect it to be editing
and certainly the first thing that's
checking for is if the product image is
not equal to no selection and there's a
product image so basically as long as
there's a product image then output this
code so this paragraph tag that we have
here and I really want this to be in
here I'm actually just gonna change this
to a div anyways it just makes more
sense to me as a div but it doesn't it
doesn't really matter it's fine because
we have this class of product image zoom
that we can key off of for our script if
you notice there's a bunch of other
stuff in here there's oom stuff well
this is all what the old jQuery zooming
it stuff and I don't want it so I'm just
gonna get rid of it so if you'll notice
here there's this script tag in fact I'm
just gonna go ahead and delete this
whole thing because that is the old
jQuery script and this is basically
saying if there's not an image it's
going to use the the default
image and then if you go down here it's
getting into the gallery images and
stuff like that so we don't really care
about too much other than this a little
bit right here what we have is our div
class with a product image zoom right
here and actually I want to make one
small adjustment to our CSS before we
get into this I want to have the class
that were actually having the image in
be also or I'll I'll give that the width
of 200% here so this product image zoom
I'm gonna give this a width of 200
pixels I apologize 200 pixels and I'm
gonna give this image width will just
show you 100% inside of here that way
the spans to the entire width of this
this box here but this box is gonna have
a width of 200 pixels we should save
this and now the next thing we want to
do is come in to our script and our
script jeaious is where we have been
editing our jQuery stuff you know you
could have this javascript in this file
as well but I'm sort of keeping all my
scripts together in one file so you can
do it how you'd like but this is just
how I'm doing it for this example
so in here just like any normal jQuery
I'm going to be culling I'm the class of
product image zoom and then all I have
to do to trigger this plug-in to work is
doc doom and then I'm gonna give
parenthesis and a semicolon I'm gonna
save this and let's come back to the
page here I'm gonna refresh this close
out of this and now when I hover over
this we get this nice zoom effect it's a
little bit a little bit better than
before and in fact if let's it make
let's make this a little bit easier to
see just by putting a black shadow on
this so I'm just ahead a box shadow it's
gonna be one picks one picks four picks
and then cool just a a small little drop
shadow here or something so now you can
actually see where the borders are a
little bit better and check it out it's
working awesome it's just going really
good it's it's perfect let's see when
this icon where it's actually looking
for this icon if you see this zoom class
icon it's going to be trying to pull in
that icon itself so to get the zoom icon
if we just need to add some CSS to this
div class of zoom icon and you can
actually find that CSS within your HTML
file here if you open up the demo we can
throw it over here
and there's a class zoom icon optional
style icon and we're actually going to
change this URL to just be dot dot slash
and then images because this is where
images are located right yep right here
images and we're going to copy this
whole class right here and we're going
to throw it in our Styles file just
don't write it down here and I'm gonna
have to comment some of the stuff out a
little bit but yeah so here we go now
let's refresh this and we should see
that icon oh it didn't like that icon I
think I'm gonna put in the wrong folder
yeah I put in the CSS folder by accident
so it needs to go into images oops okay
refresh this and we should be all good
perfect
now we have this is just looking just
like theirs we can treat this however
you want but in my opinion this is a
better version of what their resume is
their resume looks sort of outdated in
my opinion so check it out jQuery zoom
it's on a Jack Elmore dot-com slash zoom
it's a nice little jQuery plugin here as
always this is Scott with love-love
