tutorials in this video we're going to
be using one of those modules that we
installed called a path Auto now path
Auto is going to allow us to set up
rules to give us nice clean URLs for
every single piece of content we create
it's a really great handy plugin and one
I'm always sure to install it right
before I get going on any sort of Drupal
site so let's get started right now so
now that we have our modules installed
we're ready to get started on our Auto
path aliases or our path Auto aliases
now if you do not have path Auto
installed as your module head back to
the previous video where we install
modules because in that video we
installed path Auto token and C tools so
if you have path Auto installed we're
ready to get started what we can do is
now come to configuration let's just
click on this link it's going to take us
to a configuration page now if we scroll
down you'll see URL aliases if we click
on URL aliases you'll see the alias
we've already created where about us is
linking to node 1 so well that's all
good what we really need to do is add
some automatic aliasing so how do we get
to that well we can come back to extend
we can look for path out of simply just
by searching for path Auto and we can
see this downwards arrow here now when
we click this you can see there's a
configure link if we click configure our
going to allow us to get to our
configuration now if you wanted to add
this to your shortcuts you could come to
here if you are planning on visiting
here more often it might be a faster way
to get here and what you see here is we
have a tab called patterns now these are
just some patterns for our aliases and
we have no patterns yet so let's get
started by adding a pattern now a
pattern allows us to essentially say
well by basically a specific type of
content so we'll select content we are
able to automatically set the URL so
let's say for all articles
we want to set the pattern to forward
slash post forward slash now we need to
browse the available tokens we want the
in this particular example we want the
current page name now triple essentially
refers to pages or articles or anything
like that as a nodes so if we click node
you can see we have access to all sorts
of things including the node title if
you click node title it automatically
inserts this pattern into our URL path
now there's a whole lot of tokens you
can use here and they're all going to
give you different values but we want
our URL to be the title of the node plus
the post and we can just save this label
as posts so our articles every single
article we create now is automatically
going to get the path of forward slash
post then the nodes title let's click
Save so now that we have this in place
let's go and click and create a new post
when you do content and let's add
content and it's going to be an article
now in this article we can say our
second article and we don't have to do
anything in the URL path settings in
fact you'll notice it's jet clicked to
generate automatic URL alias so we don't
want to worry about that and we can just
say hello
okay so no big deal there no tags no
image nothing let's just click Save and
publish now here's something interesting
we've published our post this post
exists as our second article but you'll
notice the top the URL path is not node
slash 3
however it's post our second article it
does everything for us it even does the
hyphenating in the title this couldn't
be any more perfect I mean now we can
reliably know that our post titles are
always going to be the post and the
title if you had your post as like a
category or tag you could maybe
potentially have the the category in
there or something there's all sorts of
different strategies but just sort of
keeping your posts and your pages having
their own sort of separate pattern is
great idea now in addition let's come
home let's look at my first edited post
if we come here you can still see it
still says node /to we don't really want
this so let's say we wanted to update
this knows URL we can click Edit we can
come to URL path settings and let's just
simply check this generate automatic URL
alias box upon checking that saving and
publishing it our post URL is now
updated to post my edited post so we've
now successfully set that up
however we were to create a new basic
page let's do content add content basic
page we could say new page now this page
is still going to get this a note node
forward slash 4 so we need to set up
another pattern we come back to our
patterns we can click Add path Auto
option and we can click content once
again the pattern is simply just this
time let's do browse available tokens I
personally don't have these memorized
and I always have to come in here and
click one so don't worry about that
we can click title and now once again
let's just click basic page so we can
say for all pages once you're created
just give the path the title that way we
have things like the about Us page would
have an automatic path of forward slash
about - us so we now have our two
aliases setup pages and posts and you'll
want to do this for each new content
type or things like that that you create
so that your URLs are always looking
nice and you don't have something like
node forward slash 4 let's go really
quickly just update this URL alias just
so you can see this one in action we're
gonna click generate path settings and
we're gonna click save and keep
published now we can see the new URL is
new forward slash page so great this is
how you can set up automatic path
aliases in Drupal using path Auto module
this is something that's been around for
a long time in Drupal and something
you're definitely gonna want to setup
early on in your site's development so
as always this is Scott with level up
