up dots thanks for coming back for some
more free web development tutorials in
this tutorial I am going to explain the
two methods for running updates on
wordpress and so what's hop on in as
always don't forget to subscribe on
YouTube seeing it notified when we
upload new videos so if you remember
I've done just a couple wordpress
tutorial there's going to be more very
soon but it's a much time as past and
this site is actually ready to be
updated so instead of just doing the
update I figure you know what I might as
well show folks how to do it and there's
two ways to do an update both require
you logging in so if you remember in the
very first video when we installed this
and we stall this off the root so to
access the login area for wordpress is
just WP hyphen admin i've already logged
in and you'll notice here where it says
you know there's a new version available
please update now and you know down here
on on your site you know you're always
notified in the bottom sort of what
version you're on you know what what the
latest version is so we're out of date
this will happen from time to time and
you notice also that there's a little
circle indicator here with a with a
number in here and this is telling me
there's also some plugins that are out
of date so we're going to go through how
to update this and in this video we're
going to go through the automatic update
so that is by far the easiest and for
that all you do is you can either click
on you know update now or you can go
through tools and do this but I'm going
to go here and it's going to say you
know sort of like what is out of date
some themes a plug-in and core itself
and so what you want to do and as it's
saying right here and this is an
important step because it doesn't do
this for you when you're running your
update it is not going to back up your
database and files so that is you know
obviously an important step I've
actually already run the back running
back up and kind of you can use to get a
backup your database you can use PHP my
admin or command line and files you
might be able to go through your web
hosts maybe they have a interface or you
can do that through command line and
that's what I've done so I've got my
backup I'm ready to run my auto update
and I'm going to click update now I'm
not going to update the plugins or
themes in this tutorial so what it's
going to ask you if it doesn't already
have this it's going to ask you for your
the host name so in this case its design
the user name is my it was my username
if you've already successfully done this
like put this in another time it doesn't
ask you every single time it will store
it off if you change your login and
password it will kick you to the screen
and make you re-enter it so it's
downloading it's unpacking it's
installing what it's not doing is you
know what one optional step would be you
can turn off your plugins I really
haven't had a problem with that but in
the documentation you know as they say
you can do that i have just don't bother
in this case i didn't upgrade my plugins
so i'm going to do that like one at a
time but here we go that was it pretty
easy right alright well thanks for
watching this tutorial I'm going to now
use my backup and undo this and then
show you guys the manual way to do
updates thanks for watching and remember
