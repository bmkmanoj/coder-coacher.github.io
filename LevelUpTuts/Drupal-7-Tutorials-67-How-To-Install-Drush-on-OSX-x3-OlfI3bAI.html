up Tut's and today I'm gonna teach you
about drush and drush is one of the
coolest things it's hard to articulate
how exactly cool it is until you get in
to using it and things that you do all
the time in Drupal they come really easy
so what Rush is is it's a command-line
interface for doing things in Drupal and
that's a way simplified version of
explaining it but you can go to
drupal.org slash project slash drush and
keep in mind if you're on a server
you're gonna have to have like SSH
access and you're gonna have to be able
to install things on your server and if
you're on Mac OSX then awesome I will
show you how to do it here and we're
gonna be doing it manually because you
could install it with something like
pear or you used to be able to install
with homebrew oh I don't see that on
their github page anymore but those
tools and ends up being basically a loop
of trying to find stuff to have pear
working on OSX you have to get X code or
the Xcode command-line tools and then it
actually just ends up taking a long time
when really it's not that hard to just
install it on your own so we're gonna do
it the manual way and it's gonna be nice
and easy so if you're scared of
command-line and there anything like
that don't worry I'm gonna tell you what
to type and everything's gonna be
alright cool so we're gonna go to this
project on github and don't worry you
don't have to know get and you don't
have to have a github account because
all we're simply going to do is click
download zip you could clone this if you
wanted to if you're a good person but I
don't want to have that barrier into
this video so maybe once I do get
tutorials we can go back to this or
something like that but we're just going
to click download zip right here and you
know it's very well github layout may
have changed by then but if it isn't
it's going to be right here in the down
and the low
right and you'll notice it has
downloaded a zip file to my downloads
folder and here's that zip file what's
in here well not a whole lot you really
need to know about you can check out the
readme file if you want but there's not
a whole lot in there other than how to
install it and in fact these videos are
gonna go over most of what you need to
know so what's the first step to
installing drush well if you haven't
installed any command line anything
before it's gonna seem weird but first
thing we have to do is put this in our
user local libraries folder and I don't
notice we have to but it's a good idea
to have it there so I have this drush
master folder I'm actually just gonna
rename this to be just drush just like
that
so the first thing we need to do here is
we need to actually see be able to see
invisible files and stuff like that in
fact it's nice to be able to turn those
off and on to do that I've copied and
pasted this it's I'll have this in the
comments here it's defaults right comm
dot Apple dot finder and I'll cat or
finder and caps and then space Apple
show all files space true so this is
going to turn on hidden files and then
we can say kill all and then finder and
that's going to reset finder and once
finder has been reset here if I you see
my dragging my finder in here you'll see
now we now have all these are grayed out
folders and files that you never saw
before well these are your hidden files
and they're gonna come in handy for
something like this because Apple hides
a bunch of stuff they don't think you
should be able to see so we're gonna
scroll down here and look at this user
folder us our folder and keep in mind
you want to be careful with these hidden
files because chances are they're hidden
because if you delete them or modify
them then they can mess things up in
your system so be careful with what
you're doing here we have the user
folder and then we're gonna make a local
folder it's gonna ask for my password
local and then I'm gonna have a live
folder and now let's put this drush
folder in here entirely now I need to
make this this brush executable I have
to make this actually executable so to
do that I'm going to have to run a
command and that's going to be chmod so
we're gonna type sudo and then chmod
then u plus x space and now we're going
to type a forward slash and then we're
gonna go to that directory that we just
put this drush file so it's us R and
then a forward slash and then local and
now keep in mind if you're not if you're
new to command line you can start typing
the first couple of letters and then hit
tab and it'll complete it for you then
Lib then brush and now we want this to
actually be on the drush executable file
so this just dry shall we do slash brush
and then just the word drush now we can
hit enter it's gonna ask for my password
enter cool now at this point brush is
executable so if we wanted to just say
user slash local slash Lib slash dry
brush we could hit enter and it's
actually going to run jarash in fact
this is what it normally looks like when
you type the word drush it tells you all
of the drush commands that are available
so when I explain that drush is
extremely useful I think that this super
long list of dead rush commands is proof
enough that there's a lot you can do
with drush and even things like clearing
cache becomes effortless so we have
drush installed here technically but if
we type the word rush in command line it
says command not found so we need to
create a link
to our user bin folder so this is super
easy and it might scare you the you know
creating a link but it's not so we're
gonna type sudo space Ln - s and then
we're going to browse to that drush file
so again /usr
and then local Lib brush brush just like
that space and now we're gonna want to
put this link to our bin folder and
we're gonna do a forward slash user and
then bin and then just the word brush
know forward slash so what this is
actually doing is it's really just
creating a link into our user bin folder
for this brush so that when we type the
command brush it's gonna look in our
user bin and that's going to point it to
our word X where it's actually living
our local library judge so if we hit
enter here the command is done and we
should be ready to go so let's type in
brush and now instead of command I found
we have access to all of the cool things
that drush can do so in the next video
I'm going to show you some of the most
basic drush commands in fact it's gonna
be really basic but we're gonna get into
some really cool stuff so as always this
is Scott with LevelUp Tut's if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment on the video or hit us up at
Twitter at level up Tut's let us know
what you're thinking we'd love to hear
from you this is going to be one of many
new drupal tutorials because after we do
drush which is a great thing we're going
to be going into Omega for which
actually uses drush in some very cool
ways so keep watching and we're gonna
make some really cool drupal stuff
happen so as always this is skepta
Lansky and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
