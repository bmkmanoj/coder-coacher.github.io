up tutorials and in this video start
looping over that data that we receive
from our Mongo database and actually
start to output our resolutions so let's
it going on that right now okay so in
the last video we left off with being
able to have our things in their own
components and it's looking really nice
so far we're essentially just having a
unordered list but we openly have one
resolution despite having access to all
of the resolutions with this dot
resolutions so let's talk about how we
can loop over this object this array of
objects and actually display our
resolutions so this is going to be fun
because it's a little bit different I
mean if you've used something like
angular you know you have the ng-repeat
if you've used something like blaze we
have the each any other sort of
handlebars or JavaScript templating
language even going into PHP based
templating languages like twig or
something they all have these like each
or for loops well react doesn't have
something specifically for that so what
we actually use is a standard JavaScript
map now this is gonna be where you
actually see what the brackets are good
for okay so let's add some brackets here
now what we want to actually loop over
as you could probably guess is this stud
resolutions and as a function so this
start resolutions let's actually go
ahead and get rid of this res variable
but we won't be using that anymore okay
so this start resolutions is what we're
gonna be looping over so now we can use
map so by saying dot map in this case
we're going to have parentheses and
inside of map we really just want to a
function that head we want a function
that passes in the variable that is
going to be used to iterate each one of
these so we have resolutions if we map
over this we would like each one to be
referred to as a single resolution to do
that we need a function in here but we
can use the es6 arrow function to say
resolution and then we're going to have
an arrow
here so as you can see we have
parentheses resolution equals greater
than then we need some brackets so this
is pretty fun here we have bracket
parentheses bracket to close it off and
this seems totally weird but I can
assure you this is a nice simple way to
do this and the best part is VIN is
using essentially vanilla JavaScript
here so we don't have to learn like an
NG if we don't have to learn in each we
don't have to learn something new that's
not going to be transferable to other
walks of life we can now use the map
here and map is going to take us through
each of these resolutions and then have
access to them as resolution now inside
of here we simply just need to return
because this is a function we need to
return this component so let's cut that
component out put it right here in the
return and now we want each resolution
to be passed in to the prop of
resolution so what's going to happen
here is it's going to map over every
single one of these resolutions which
there are five of right now it's going
to take that entire object as resolution
and it's going to put it into resolution
single as the prop of resolution so now
when we head back to our site what we
should see is every single one of our
resolutions okay so even the one without
a name here that's just this false so
i've do handstands dance in my office
finish react native finish react meteor
let's say record web dev cue and a
number two and then i can hit enter and
as you can see instantly without doing
anything it adds it to this list now
this is brilliant because it's already
connected to our database that's saving
all this stuff in our database it's
updating our UI without us having to
even write any methods api or anything
like that yet obviously like I said we
stuck these prototyping packages so it's
going to get a little bit more complex
but in Riau
this meteor system is so easy to get
going with and so easy to just really
build something really complex so
quickly I just absolutely love working
in meteor especially with meteor and
react to be honest so we have this form
now anytime we anything new hello
instantly added instantly put on our
list perfect although if you head over
to our console you'll see we're getting
a warning here each child in an array
should have a unique indicator that
should be its key now this is an
annoying thing however we have to do
this
so let's actually head back to our code
here and on our individual resolution
what it's saying is if you're iterating
over data like this we need to give each
one of these items a unique ID as a key
so the key is now going to be equal to
some unique value now the cool part
about all of this is is that the MongoDB
collection actually gives us an ID now
that ID is completely unique so we can
say inside of this key resolution dot
underscore ID its underscore ID because
that's how it's saved in the database if
we were to head to our site and do
control m click on a resolution you can
see that it's underscore ID and you can
see immediately without refreshing or
anything that error has gone away now
one more thing I want to do is let's add
a class to this unordered list here this
unordered list can just now have a class
of it should be resolution so let me say
class name is equal to resolutions okay
and looks like I missed the quotes on
that one for some reason perfect okay
and check it out all right these are
huge now it's only because I have my
screen size bumped up let me bump this
down cool so we now have all of our
resolutions being listed out now in the
neck
to video we are going to take a little
bit deeper dive into some of the meteor
core functionality that we need to learn
about for instance we have these
prototyping packages in here such as
Auto publish and insecure which are
going to be a bad experience if you push
your site to live production with these
packages and for various security
reasons which I'll go over in those
videos in particular either way what we
want is we want our websites to be nice
and secure but we still want them to be
easy to build luckily meteor makes it
really nice
by offering meteor methods so as always
this is Scylla level up tutorials if you
want to help support these free videos
had to store that level up tutorials
