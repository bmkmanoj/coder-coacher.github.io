up tutorials in this video we're going
to be creating our first real component
for our new project called contacts list
now this contacts list component will
need to be imported into app it will
need to be exported from itself so
there's gonna be a lot of new es2015
goodness in this video so check it out
let's get started right now okay so now
let's talk about creating a new
component in my source folder I'm just
going to make a new file and now this
new file is simply just going to be
contact its contact with an S list I'm
doing this in a camel case where the
first C is capitalized and I'm going to
hit enter now once again let's go ahead
and just copy some code out of the app
dot J s right here I'm actually gonna
copy all of this first stuff and I'm
going to ignore that render because
we're not going to be rendering this
into our at our application so we have
contacts list now it says class app but
I want this to be class contacts list
okay now this is going to be essentially
the container that contains the
individual contacts themselves so we'll
have an unordered list of individual
contacts so I'm gonna go ahead and make
an unordered list UL right here UL okay
and inside of here I can just have a
single list item and it can just be
something like Scott and a phone number
okay and let's close off that list item
right there like so okay so now what we
can see is we have here is the class
contacts list extending react component
we're importing react once more and
we're essentially just rendering an
unordered list with a single item with
some dummy content with a name in it now
you might be thinking okay great how do
we get this to actually output anywhere
in fact it's not gonna be happening and
in the last video we showed an app that
J s we just used react out render now
what we want to do now is actually use
this component that we just built so
with react everything as a component and
components should really only have
essentially one feature smaller
components are always better so we can
say contacts list and then forward slash
and then close our bracket we always
need to close our tags in react or else
it's going to complain now you might see
this and think perfect we're now using
the context list and we have it here it
should be outputting this unordered list
on our page but the reality is actually
just a little bit different if you come
to our code and refresh we're getting an
error because contacts list is not yet
defined so to have context lists to be
actually usable in this particular
component we need to import it so we can
say import and then we want to import
contacts list from and then in quotes
here we want to say from the same folder
so dot forward slash means in the same
folder look for contacts list okay now
I'm going to end this with the semicolon
so we're importing now contacts list
from this contacts list file so now when
we use this it should be findable it
shouldn't be not found as you can see
when we refresh our page and you'll
notice we still get an error now you
might be wondering
what's going on here we've imported
contacts list we're using it we have
contacts list defined but we're not
doing is we're not exporting this
component so it's not actually even
available so with this new excellent
es2015
syntax we need to export if we're going
to be importing so if you're new to the
es2015 this might be a learning
experience for you and if you're not
then you might be wondering why the heck
haven't I export it already so what we
can say is export default and then we
want to export the word contact list now
I'm going to copy and paste this as I do
to make sure I have no spelling errors
and wrap this off with a semicolon here
come back to our page refresh and we now
see contacts list Scott five five five
five five okay so this might be your
first taste of importing and exporting
other than what we just did in the last
video by importing react but here we
create contacts list with class contact
list extend react component we render
just like we would normally and we have
exports default contacts list cool so in
the next video we're going to be
creating our individual contact
component and we're gonna pass data in
it to this all from the top down of our
application so that data gets passed
through component into component and
things are aware from a parent-child
perspective so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video or hanging up at Twitter or
Facebook a level up tutorials I love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
