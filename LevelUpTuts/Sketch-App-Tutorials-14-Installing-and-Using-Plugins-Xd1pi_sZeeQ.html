up tubs and today we're going to take
your sketch skills even further by
extending sketch with plugins now sketch
has a great community for plugins
there's tons of them on github you can
find them nice and easily and in fact
we're going to help you do just that so
in this video we're going to install our
first plugin which is nothing nothing
crazy it's going to be a lower if some
generator that we can throw into sketch
that way you don't have to go off to
your browser to grab some lorem ipsum
text ever you can just do it right
within sketch and then after that we're
going to show you where you can find
even more extensions also in future
videos we're going to be going over some
of my favorite sketch extensions and
showing you how those work so keep
watching and check it out now a great
place to look for sketch plugins is this
sketch plugins plug-in directory repo on
github you can come here and they're not
going to have plugins themselves in this
repo but what it is it's a great list of
links to really really useful plugins so
you can scroll through here and see what
they have to offer for our first use of
sketch plugins we're going to go ahead
and install this lorem ipsum plugin for
sketch now I've opened that repo in this
window here and I'm going to go ahead
and download this dot sketch plug-in
file so let's just click downloads up
here and it's going to give us a zip of
that file here you can see we have just
a license a basic readme which you can
read here and we now need to add this to
sketch so how do we do that well the
easiest way is from within sketch we can
come up here where it says plugins and
come and click reveal plugins folder now
you could of course browse to this
plugins folder but it's located in your
system library and that folder under
modern versions of OS X is hidden so if
you have hidden folders being shown you
can always just browse to it if not this
is the easiest way to get to it
I really prefer to get to it this way in
general just because of how fast it is
but from here all we need to do is click
and drag this dot sketch plug and file
into our plugins folder and there we
have it we've now installed this plugin
now if we go to the github page here we
can see that all we need to do to use
this plug-in is after its installed hit
shift option command L so if we come in
to sketch 3 here and we hit shift
command option L you've seen nothing
happens right we just hit it nothing
really happens so what do we need to do
well we need to actually make a text box
you can just click it says type
something now I found it works only a
few select off the type box and select
again so not not when your cursor is in
the text box but when the text box is
actually selected and then we do shift
option command L and you can see we now
have lorem ipsum text in here if I make
this box a proper size you can see we
just have one tiny little paragraph
maybe a couple of sentences actually
let's make this all darker so you can
see it better and bump up the size maybe
something like 40 pixels great so we now
have this lorem ipsum text and you might
be thinking well that's cool but I want
more than just this well for this you
can always just copy and paste it just
like that to give you as much or as
little as you need so here we have lorem
ipsum text generated directly inside of
your sketch file with you know no
additional configuration needed so you
can now go ahead and in the middle of
your designs get some dummy text out of
nowhere whenever you need it this is
extremely useful and something that I'm
sure I'm going to use all the time so
let me know what kind of cool plugins
you come across for sketch 3 I'm sure
there's new ones coming out every day
there's a lot of people making it
there's a lot you can do with
check it out and further videos we're
going to get into actually how to make
your own plugin and that's awesome so as
always this is Scott with level of Tut's

Facebook or wherever we love to hear
from you thanks for watching and we'll
see in the next one tight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
