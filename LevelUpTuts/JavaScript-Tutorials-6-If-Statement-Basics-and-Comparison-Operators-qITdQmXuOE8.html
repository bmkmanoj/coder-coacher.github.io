up tuts and today we're gonna be talking
about something that you are going to be
using a lot in JavaScript just like
everything that we've gone over in the
bit the basics here but this is
something that's more exciting right
this is gonna be if statements an if
statements allow some sort of you know
some sort of thing where the computer
does some work for you and check
something and then it does something
based on these values so we could do
something here I'm gonna get rid of this
code and I'm gonna make a variable I'm
gonna get rid of all of this code
actually I'm gonna make a variable
that's just my name my name is going to
be equal to Scott there we go just like
that
now I'm gonna do an if statement to
check my name so it's going to say if my
name is Scott then I'm going to council
log Scott is cool okay because I you
know that's logical so we're going to
say if and it's just the words if I f
notice how my code coloring changes it
red so you know it's something and next
we need to have parentheses and inside
the parentheses is the thing that it
checks right so we said we wanted to
check to see if my name was really equal
to Scott so we can reference our
variable and we can say name and
remember this has the value of Scott we
can say if our variable and in the last
lesson we learned that two equals checks
things right and now in JavaScript
there's some inconsistencies with how
these equal signs work so people often
suggest to use three equal sides and it
isn't just that one more equal sign is
better than two or something like that
it's it's really a bit deeper than that
and
a bit too much to talk about in these
basic videos but it has to do with
what's really equal to what right and
some instance says like a string that's
equal to two is incorrectly said that
it's equal to a value of two if you use
the wrong one so so you don't run into
any inconsistencies and that things
operate the way that you'd expect them
to for now use three equal signs and
that's just for this comparison and till
you learn more about it and you can
distinguish when to use the two or three
or when it's going to affect you so we
can now say Scott and this is going to
check if name is equal to in quotes
Scott now we wanted to do something so
to give this to do something we need to
use curly brackets and you do it like
that so this is saying if name is equal
to Scott then what's ever inside of
these curly brackets is going to be done
and if the name is not equal to Scott it
would just skip all of this entirely so
I'm gonna go ahead and had a comment
checks to see if name is Scott and then
another comment that just says outputs
something so we're gonna say console dot
log and then here we can say name plus
and then in quotes
is cool period and now we're gonna
finish this line with a semicolon
notice how we didn't finish this if
statement with the semicolon this is our
sentence here we're gonna finish this
with the semicolon
you'll get quite a bit more used to win
or we're not to use these as we go on
but for now on here we're using a
semicolon at the end of this statement
and just like this one so this if is
everything is correct when we refresh
our page it should say Scott is cool
Scott is cool so we did if you remember
we went over this plus ads strings to
strings so this is a string plus a
string equals one long string scott is
cool so that's why that plus works we
could have also just said like this but
this isn't as flexible maybe if we
wanted to change the name at some point
or something like that so now let's try
something else right let's leave this
how it was and let's say the name is no
longer Scott but it's Scott with one T
now i refresh the page doesn't show
anything it doesn't show anything at all
because it's just glancing over this
stuff now this can be pretty basic right
it's in a few if you've done any
programming for this is anywhere but if
you've never done programming this is a
big concept so this goes back to our
boolean's right this outputs a true
therefore it's printing my Scott is cool
likewise if I would just say if true
and refresh the page it's going to say
Scott is cool but if I were to say boss
and refresh does not so whatever takes
place inside of here if it's true then
it happens if it's false it doesn't so
let's go over some basic comparison
operators so we did the three equal
signs right and we did two equal signs
whatever but let's say if we want to say
is not equal to right so we want to say
if name is not equal to Scott which it
is not then print Scott is cool so you
learn this exclamation point in the last
video sort of negates things so where we
had two equal signs and it was equal
this sort of means not is not equal so
if if name is not equal to Scott with
two T's then print out the name and for
confusion fake letters changes to bill
okay if bill is not equal to Scott then
print out bill is cool now what happens
if we wanted to check numbers right so
we could also say if three is greater
than and you're familiar with these
symbols from basic algebra math if 3 is
greater than to save then print bill is
cool and it does however if we'd say if
3 is less than 2 it won't print so we
have this greater than or less than we
also have greater than or equal to in
this case 3 is equal to 3 or this I
believe sorry this is less than or equal
to less than or equal to or greater than
or equal to and using these things you
can check any sort of value and use this
in your statement to output a boolean
which then can validate or invalidate
your if statement and then print out
some stuff or
do some cool stuff for you so in the
future this is going to be a very
important concept because we're gonna be
checking things a lot and doing things
with that data and all sorts of
meaningful ways so this is an if
statement this is how you write it
if parentheses your statement your
conditional parentheses bracket and the
near what should be evaluated if it's
true and then a closing bracket this is
the spacing I have here this is some
stylistic choice notice how if I take a
lot of these spaces out save it it still
works
that's one thing with JavaScript is that
sometimes it doesn't really care how you
write it in fact we could write this all
on one line and still work but it's it's
nice to have this open stylistic changes
there's all sorts of people who write
style guides and stuff like that that
will show you how to write nice-looking
JavaScript because it's not super strict
and this is really just how I prefer it
to look so as always if you have any
questions or comments please comment on
the video hit us up at Twitter level up
to us let us know what you're thinking
we always love to hear from you and and
yeah this is great so there's gonna be
lots more videos coming out in the
pipeline very soon as always this is
Scott to Linsky with level up tuts i'm
on twitter a test Alinsky we're on
twitter at level up tuts you know
contact me in any way we just can't do
technical support but you know I'm
always happy to talk to people so thanks
for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
