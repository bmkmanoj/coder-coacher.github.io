tutorials and today i'm bringing you a
level update for october 2015 so here's
what's new and exciting in the world of
level up tutorials first off you can now
head over to store dot level up
tutorials com and you can actually
purchase now the meteor for everyone
series with code examples now it's 22 HD
videos all of the videos are in mp4
format and you get code examples for all
of the relevant videos there's a couple
of videos where there isn't any changes
to the codes however for every single
video that there is there is a code
example so that just gives you another
way that you can help support level up
tutorials if you enjoyed the media for
everyone series or potentially you're
interested in learning meteor you can
now purchase that for 999 and you can
get all of those HD videos to download
okay so that leads me to my second
really exciting announcement there are
three really exciting announcements in
this video the first which is the
digital downloads the second of which as
I most of the way through my very first
ebook and I've been writing this for a
long time and I've been dying to mention
it or talk about it or anything but I
didn't want to get ahead of myself so
now that I'm enough of the way through
it that I can tell it's definitely in a
good place to be I figured that I would
announce it to the world that I will be
releasing an e-book called developing
the developer now this is going to be
sort of a practical guide to becoming a
professional front-end web developer and
it covers some of the base technical
aspects of becoming a front-end web
developer but it also covers a lot of
the other aspects like where do i go to
learn what to learn when to learn it
what should i know before moving on to
the next thing and just sort of how to
see your way through this career that
doesn't have the sort of typical or
standard onboarding and learning process
like many other degree based careers do
so i really hope that developing the
developer is a nice clear way to
understand what to do when you want to
become a front-end developer or even how
to increase your skills to maybe get a
better job or move up in the world of
front-end web development so the last of
the really super exciting things i want
to announce is the addition
of a new type of level up tutorial now
this is called next level next level is
a new type of serious i'm going to be
doing with level up tutorials that is
going to be exclusive to Pro users and
anybody who wants to buy it on demand if
you were keen you may have looked at the
new level up tutorials beta site if
you've seen the link floating around and
you may have seen on the front page of
that you may have seen the sort of
spoiler of the very first next level
tutorial series it's called next level
CSS animations and transitions it's
about building really nice high-end
professional transitions for your
websites and it talks about the
principles behind building nice
transitions and animations and how do
theoretically build nice animations but
also technical practical examples along
with lots of code examples and nice
little tools and tips along the way and
this isn't how to build animations with
an animations package or javascript or
anything like that this is CSS
animations and transitions built from
scratch by you now I'm hoping to have
that released in early November or even
late October I finished recording need
to do a lot of work with editing and
just bundling everything up but it
should be done and available very soon
so keep your eyes open for that
announcement I'm really really excited
about it now let's talk about the normal
tutorial stuff going on I just ordered
the intermedia meteor series and I'm
already eight videos into that there are
going to be more videos released for
that tomorrow I also started the web
performance series where we're going
over all sorts of tips and tricks to
make your websites faster and that's
going to be a sort of long time running
series where I'm going to just cover
more and more topics as we go and it's
going to be around for a little while so
don't worry if things aren't pouring out
for that there will be new videos for
that next week now in addition to that
I'm also working on a lot of other cool
series and I don't want to get ahead of
myself and announcing them too early but
there will be some react stuff whether
that's react by itself or react with
meteor or both in November I'm going to
continue always making sketch videos I'm
going to be covering a really cool
application called principal for mac and
I'm going to dive into se
yo stuff there's a lot of tutorials to
do and to cover in addition to
continuing my how to build your first
website series so keep your eyes open
November is going to be a huge month for
level up tutorials again if you want to
help support head over to store doubt

meteor for everyone series and the
