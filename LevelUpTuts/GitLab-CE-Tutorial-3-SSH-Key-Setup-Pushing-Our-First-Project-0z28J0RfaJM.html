up tutorials and in this video I'm going
to show you how you can add your SSH key
and get going so we can actually push an
actual project up to our git lab okay so
let's head to our project which you just
had as test and as you can see we won't
be able to actually do anything with
this until we add our SSH key so let's
just click this add SSH key to our
profile and in here you could see we
just have a way to paste in the title
and a key now you're going to need a key
for each computer you want to use this
system on and that's the same for any of
these bitbucket or github and what we
can do is generate an SSH key if you
need one if you don't need one and you
already have one then feel free to just
paste in the key here if you know
exactly what that looks like
let's also open this up in a new tab and
so as you can see we have some
instructions here basically it's saying
that before you create a new one let's
go ahead and just check to see if we
have a key here so we can do that simply
by typing in this command here so let's
head to our terminal and I'm just going
to have a new tab and type in this
command and as you can see here this is
my public key here now I have my
blurred-out so you can actually see it
but what you'll see is a long long
string here follow all sorts of
different characters now if you don't
see that we'll want to go ahead and
create one let's go ahead and if you do
see your key you can come back and paste
it in here now and you'll see this long
string in here and we can save it with a
title and we can just say you know
desktop this is my desktop computer ok
and we can click Add key so we can see I
have this key here let's go through the
process of actually creating one I'm
going to select yes I'm sure and let's
scroll down here and you'll see we can
generate one with this command here with
this SSH key Jen ok so let's head back
to our terminal and as SSH - key Jen
space hyphen T space RSA space hyphen
capital C and then our email address
let's go ahead and just say scut net
level up tuts comm cap now get it enter
and you can see it's going to create a
new key in this directory and you can
just hit enter it's asking if I want to
overwrite I can just say sure and enter
our passphrase I'm not going to use a
passphrase so I can just hit enter twice
and you'll notice our keys been created
now that we have this we can run our cat
tilde /d SSH /id underscore RSA pub once
more and this is just going to output
the new key that we have now I have mine
obfuscated so you can't see it but I'm
going to copy this here and I'm going to
paste it in to my SSH key again you
won't be able to see this but I can
click Add key now and we should now have
our key in here if you refresh your
project you'll notice this little
warning has gone away you can see we
have this empty project so just like any
sort of other get system we could clone
this repo change it and then push it up
or we can take an existing folder
already initialize it forget and remote
add this origin so I'm going to do that
one let's head to my terminal I'm going
to change directly into sites I'm going
to just go ahead and this react native
folder let's go into my movie DB I'm
working on a huge reacted native series
right now so this might be a nice time
to talk about that if you want to
support the creation these free
tutorials check out store dot level up
tutorials calm and coming this month as
an April is going to be an awesome
really super large react native series
so from inside of our projects directory
we can just do get in it we now have a
new git repository I can add in a new
origin you can see get remote at origin
and let's go ahead and just do get add
dot I don't have an ignore file here so
this is going to push up everything and
we can just do get commit initial commit
forgot the - em we need - em okay git
commit initial commit and let's do get
push origin master let's just hit yes to
this
and now our repos going up as you can
see it's being pushed and we're almost
done there we go
so let's head back and this is the first
commit of a project when i refresh this
you'll see that we now have what an
interface that is sort of like what we
would see with github we have our
project you can start you can fork it
you can copy the the git path here we
can add notifications for it but more
importantly we have an initial commit by
me right here and because this doesn't
ever read me yet we're not seeing any
sort of readme but now that we have our
project here let's go ahead and head
over to files and you'll be able to see
our default file view where you can see
all sorts of cool stuff like our indexed
Android Jas and in here not only can we
view this file but I mean you could edit
it if you want you could click Edit and
edit this directly in this text editor
if you want I'm not going to do that
right now
but it's definitely a possibility and
you'll see that I'm browsing within this
commit you can click browse files here
and see all of the files from that
commit itself you can see that by this
drop-down right we have this commit
number so if you just simply were to
come here files you could say I want to
view the master branch and that's
obviously the latest state of the master
branch or any other branches that you
possibly have in here so you could swap
by branches and always sort of see the
files you can download them right here
you can download it I so tired i GZ
whatever you want but as you can see
this is a really nice interface and it's
not out of place in anything that you're
used to right for being a totally open
source project it looks and functions
really really nice so we can now see
let's click commits and you can now see
the commit it was done by me when it was
done by who where from and when you can
even browse the files
you can even click branches to see the
various branches of our projects we can
tag specific points in the history as
being important you could think of like
a tag as like a larger commit it's not
necessarily like committing files but
it's like a commit message in fact that
it lets you know what sort of going on
so a tag is a good way to say like this
is major version change for whatever
this or breaking changes at this point
now let's select graphs and as you can
see we can see commit graphs we could
see commits by different people
contributors we can see commits per day
we can get a lot of information
what sort of languages and we have these
nice user experience all things for
instance this react native project has a
lot of objective-c it's a lot of
JavaScript as 9% Java because this is
iOS Android and react native so that's
pretty much it here is our project here
is the projects page and once we have a
readme this is going to be looking
really super nice cool so we now have a
project we've pushed it up and I have
access to this right but I'm the only
one with an account so in the next video
we're going to actually take a look at
some user management or we can have
multiple users on this now in the next
video I'm going to take a look at user
management so what we can do is create a
new user and get that user the
permissions that they need to be able to
clone and check out this repository as
need be and they can only do the sort of
things that you would want them to be
able to do so we're going to be taking a
look at user roles of permissions and
sort of creating new users in the next
video as always this is Scott with level
up tutorials if you'd like to get the
rest of these videos before they're
available on youtube head to store doubt
level of tutorials comm and purchase
this series to support you can download

I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
