up Hut's and today I'm gonna bring you a
couple of quick little tip videos and
the first one is going to be OS X based
in the second one is not going to be
it's gonna be more for your terminal
environment and both videos are gonna be
about how to affect your working
environment the reason I wanted to take
these videos light and easiest cuz I've
had a crazy day at the my first day at a
new job
I know a senior developer at Team
Detroit in Dearborn Michigan and I have
built a new computer so this is my first
time running tutorials on my new
hackintosh my previous computer was a
hackintosh this one I just built
yesterday so I just hoping that it's a
total fresh install I'm hoping
everything goes alright so that being
said I want to configure this computer
to look a certain way and one of the
things I really like to do with the new
computer is I like to turn the menu bar
black so how do you turn the menu bar
black in OS X now regardless of what
operating system you are running whether
it's Mavericks or Snow Leopard or
whatever this obsidian menu bar comm and
I'm gonna have the link in the comments
or the description I guess I always say
comments when I mean description
whatever we have the link I'll put the
link in there and really what you can do
is just go ahead and download this now
what this is going to do is just
download it an installer however there
are a couple of steps to get it working
so I'm gonna unzip this and I'm going to
install it with the install obsidian
menu bar okay now keep in mind to return
yourself yeah okay this is basically
just saying it's a hack that'll affect
all users are you sure you want to
continue yes I do I have I've installed
this on many computers and I've never
had an issue at all so
okay so I've installed it now and keep
in mind if you want to uninstall it ever
you need to use this restore default
menu bar
and it just runs in it it takes care of
everything cool so I've gone ahead and
downloaded and installed it now why is
it not black well we have to do a couple
of things we have to first change our
settings to say in System Preferences
we're going to turn to desktop &amp;amp; screen
saver and then we're going to uncheck
the translucent menu bar so we now have
our black menu but you'll notice it's
sort of weird it went away when I
unclick that well that's cool what you
have to do actually is log out and then
log back in now since that's going to
cause this video to stop recording I'm
going to log out log back in and I'll
see you once I've done that okay so now
you may have noticed that we love that
we log back in we have this black menu
bar but the text could be more readable
and some of our icons here are just not
you know white essentially so what can
we do it says step number three here is
to basically grab this dot menu file
throw it somewhere I'm going to throw it
just onto my desktop you can put it
anywhere maybe perhaps your Documents
just somewhere you're not going to
notice it and now from here you're gonna
want to open it so by double clicking it
it opens it now you're also going to
want to make this run when you log in so
we can come to system preferences and
then users and groups and then login
items and we can add this there I simply
just dragged it over and that that works
cool so we now have this pretty good and
there's some additional steps you can do
you can turn off LED font smoothing I
personally don't mind that one if you
want to move some of your icons here
into a bartender tab then you can use
the app bartender to do that it also
talks about how you can't hide the
shadow that's all right and basically if
you have an app like any of these
you don't like the icon for because it's
now dark on a dark background you can
come into the Obsidian menu bar folder
go to install our content and then the
applications folder and you will see a
whole bunch of icons here unfortunately
doesn't really help me out because the
Dropbox icon looks alright but uh you
know they don't have a ScreenFlow icon
and they don't have a clip menu icon so
either way whatever it it you know you
can follow this step and basically
replace the icons if you have any icons
that you need replacing but so now we
have a nice looking black menu bar in OS
X and I think it looks great I
personally have this set up on all my
computer's cool so that's just a small
tip it might not help you out anyway
functionality wise but it's just
something interesting so as always if
you have any questions or comments leave
a come in the video hit us up at Twitter
or Facebook anywhere we love to hear
from you thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
