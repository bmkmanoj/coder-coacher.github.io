Tut's and today we're going to be using
Drupal commerce and we're going to be
installing it from scratch installing in
a fresh Drupal site and we're going to
be using something called commerce
kickstart 2 and so commerce kickstart 2
is basically Drupal Commerce has a lot
of pieces involved and the best way to
start a Drupal commerce project if
you're starting a commerce project from
the beginning is to use this kickstart
because it gives you a whole bunch a lot
of the key components and configuration
to get you going and really it would it
would be really you know a huge pain to
develop a Drupal commerce site without
this so if you want to go to Drupal
commerce org slash commerce - kickstart
- - so actually install you can go
through these directions here and we're
going to follow along and download and
install Drupal commerce with the
kickstart so to get started we're going
to go to the commerce kickstart page on
Drupal so that address is drupal.org
slash project slash cupboard underscore
commerce underscore kickstart and you
can scroll down here you can see that
we're running version 2 and we can click
notes here under links and if we want to
grab this core one this is going to give
us not only the commerce kickstart but
it's going to give us Drupal core so we
want to download this whole thing so I'm
going to let this download and then
we're going to extract it and throw it
into our site's folder and we'll get
going okay so I have our commerce
kickstart folder that I downloaded and I
rename the folder to drop or a drupe or
however you want to say it and I have my
mam Pro looking for that folder drop or
a drupe and I'm setting this a host to
be here and so we're going to start up
these servers and then I'm going to set
up our database so by clicking this web
start I can open up this PHP myadmin
here and let's create a database of
McCrea new
database and we're called d7 comm for
commerce and I'm going to create click
create and here we have our database
it's all good and I browse to our
location that our servers running so we
have dropped out level up and so here is
my localhost and it's already taking us
to this Drupal install page and the one
thing you might notice immediately is
how much nicer this looks then Drupal
normal install page and that's one of
the benefits to using something like
commerce kickstart is that they were
taking the time to put in the details to
make this thing nice and just a better
experience on you so if you know I mean
I sort of wish that Drupal core would
take this time to do things like this
and put thought into the details because
this looks nice and you know it doesn't
really affect how it works but it's a
good thing for it to look nice so let's
click let's get started
and just like the normal Drupal install
it's going to give you some requirements
and it's going to get mad because I
don't have a site's default files and it
doesn't have the right permissions or
anything and my PHP memory load is 32
instead it says this as it needs at
least 128 so we'll have to change that
in the HT axis as well and we also need
this settings file so this is all normal
Drupal installation stuff and let's get
handling this right away so I'm going to
go to this folder I'm going to sites
default files and I'm going to take this
default settings and I'm going to copy
this file and I'm going to remove the
parts of it that say default settings
there we go and what else do we need we
need our memory limit so I'm going to
open up the htaccess file in sublime
text so I'm just going to add this line
right here however it does want 100 let
me minimize this it does 128
I believe so let me make sure that's
right 128 we could save this
and let's come back here so this should
be close if I give this a refresh it's
going to probably whine about the
permissions so it needs this files
directory to be writable and it needs
the settings file to be writable and
this is out just temporary things we're
going to change these back after we
install Drupal and I'm just going to do
it real quick here through transmittance
at opening up terminal and and doing it
that way if you know you know if you can
do it with chmod then by all means go
ahead and do it that way but not
everybody knows that the terminal
command so we'll come here and go to
sites and under default files is going
to be temper is going to be seven seven
seven apply it and it's also wants the
settings file to be temporarily writable
so we're going to we're going to give
this a seven seven seven just
temporarily but after we install we're
going to of course change that cool
so I've refreshed it's now saying I've
completed all the requirements I want to
use a my sequel database I've already
set it up in that name was d7 underscore
come and the database username with a
lamp is root and root and it looks like
I might add to my password wrong I think
typically if you're using vamp out of
the box your passwords rule but I
actually remember that I did set a
password on my map and that's my bad so
now we're back in and I clicked go and
we should be good so as you can see it's
initializing it's installing everything
and hopefully we'll have a nice working
site when we're all done here
cool so it says that all the necessary
changes to sites default and say it's
default settings have been made so we
should remove the white write
permissions and we should be all good
you can consult the handbook for more
information it's nice to sort of go
through the handbook whenever you're in
a new Drupal site anyways just to make
sure you didn't forget anything
so our store name is going to be level
up Hut's store and this is going to be
Scott at level up well typing it's not
great today alright
and I said maintenance account admin
admin I don't want to go ahead and
change this password just to something a
little bit more familiar and it's not
even any really that secure but just a
little bit more familiar so let's click
Save and continue and we should have a
working site here
sure I'll save it and it's going to ask
some stuff do we want to install the
demo story
hey let's install the demo store it
might as well especially because we're
seeing how it's working and we don't
need to this is just going to be a u.s.
store so we don't need to do any
translation and u.s. dollars is good and
no tab and actually will do no sample
tax rate just so we can set it up
ourselves but if you're you know setting
this up for your store you might want to
just have the sample tax rate it's going
to bolt so and installed and it took us
to this getting started page which is a
lot more than most Drupal installations
can give you so here we are and perfect
ready to get started
as always if you have any questions
leave a comment in the comment section
is about Twitter any of the stuff we're
on Twitter Facebook you can reach me
personally a test olenski on twitter i
always say i try to get to all the
comments I really do but there's a ton
of comments we get like I don't know
just way too many to handle the day so
you know I apologize if I never write
back to you but I'm really trying to get
through all of them so as always this is
Scott with level up tuts and thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
