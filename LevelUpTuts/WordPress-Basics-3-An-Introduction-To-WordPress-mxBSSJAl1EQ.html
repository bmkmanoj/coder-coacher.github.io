of Tut's and today we're going to be
explaining a little bit more about what
happened when we installed WordPress so
that we can understand exactly what
we're doing
now most people just run the
installation and if you're not familiar
this sort of thing you might not be
familiar with what exactly happened
well the installation basically
connected to our database let our
application have a configuration file
written that not only connects to our
database but is configured into the site
but it also installs the tables
necessary for the application to run in
our database and you can see the tables
are all in here and this is basically
what WordPress looks like after you've
installed it if we're familiar with
other content management systems like
things like Drupal Drupal has a lot more
tables in this and WordPress is just
different in its structure and you may
have got well this is this it yes this
is it this is all of the the database
information that WordPress needs to
install and you can see this installs
around 500 kilobytes so let's come back
to our site here and what does this mean
we have the site running we can now
create posts create pages and themes we
can now install plugins we can log in
and we can basically just get blocking
and because WordPress is primarily a
blocking interface in a blogging CMS
it's really set up to do just that out
of the box
however WordPress is capable of lots
more things and many large sites that
you visit frequently are built on
WordPress it's one of the most used
content management systems and the best
part about that is is there's lots of
resources available for it now if you
want to get into the back end of the
site or the administrative section of
the site you can do so by clicking this
log in now if you click log in here it's
going to take you to WP - login dot PHP
likewise you can just type in the
address to your site and then type WP -
login dot PHP and it'll take you here as
well
now when I log in this is the
administrative section of the site like
you would have seen at the end of the
last video this is where the content
editors and managers of the site can
publish an unpublished posts and
basically control all aspects of the
site and that's how you can drag things
around here and really customize it to
your liking WordPress is really great
about making the content editing
experience is really nice so in other
solutions like Drupal you may have
installed it and right out of the box it
wasn't super useful without installing a
bunch of modules with WordPress it's a
little bit different because the
solution is a little bit more wrapped up
right out of the box you're pretty much
ready to go if you want to use this base
theme or you've installed another theme
already you all Y of your functionality
that you'll need to get up and running
with a basic blogger site is already
here so from here in the backend all we
have to do is click this house and then
visit site to take you to the front-end
of our site and from here we can click
around you can see this hello world post
if we're on the home page back here we
have a title and a basic blog post
that's just a teaser if we click on the
title it takes us to the page of that
blog post and it has the full content
with comments and we can even leave a
comment right now if we want it ok
inserting hello comments posting a
comment and you'll see it already has
says that the admin has posted a comment
here now we can even search this page
already if we want and it looks like my
last search terms were a tiny MCE and
penguins which is great we could search
for either one of those things wherever
it probably won't find a whole lot
because we don't have that content in
our site but if you wanted to check and
you just wanted to say let's search for
hello it's going to find this hello
world post already for us so search is
working out-of-the-box our blog posts
and pages are working on the box
comments is working out of the box in
our admin section pretty much like I
said everything you need to get going
and we have this basic theme up and
running
so this is all you need get started
posting stuff just play around this is
WordPress installed on your computer and
now you can fully explore a wordpress
interface and everything for yourself
and don't be afraid to break it there's
all sorts of ways that we can cover if
you break your your WordPress how to fix
it and stuff like that but really you
just want to explore and explore it if
you mess up you can always start over if
you don't know how to fix it so just
take this time to click around and just
experience WordPress the front end and
the back end in the next video we're
going to be giving you a tour of the
backend and we're going to be showing
you where everything is that way if you
know what you have to do already you can
just watch this video to find out how to
exactly get to where you're trying to go
then after that we're going to take it
in to actually working with content
itself and then how you post and publish
and monitor and everything with your
content including sorting it categories
and stuff like that
and then from there we're going to just
take more and more customization until
you're a wordpress master if you have no
experience with PHP or anything don't
worry about that we're going to be
covering all of what the WordPress
specific PHP code is like and you're
going to be understanding not only what
the code is doing but how to write it
yourself so as always this is Scott with
