up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be working more with security
by checking what sort of variables
actually come in to our server let's get
started on that now okay so now that we
have our public and private settings go
ahead and talk about something that's
very important to the security of your
meteor site right now we have a forum on
our page and allows us to submit pretty
much anything we could submit an object
in here and you could do that through
the command line with the meteor column
and you could submit anything in here so
what we need is a package called check
so let's go to our actual packages here
let's go to packages scroll down and add
check that's all it is just check you'll
see that it's going to go ahead and grab
this okay so we now should be good to be
able to use this package check now what
is this this is basically a package
that's going to allow us to check our
code before it gets allowed to run on
the server so for instance we always
want to it know what's coming into our
meteor methods right we want to make
sure what's coming into our methods is
exactly what we would expect so let's
head to our methods jas so if we check
out our resolution form we're sending in
just the single text value to add
resolution so we would know that if
anything came in to hear that this
variable resolution and if anything came
in here that wasn't a string we would
not want that to be able to happen right
that just we don't want being something
to be able to sit submit an object to
hear if we're expecting a string so we
can use this package check which is a
meteor package to just say check and
then we can pass in the resolution
resolution and that should be a string
ok so it's what the variable is as the
first perimeter and the second is what
the what it's expecting so resolution
here it needs to
BS string in fact we can confirm that by
heading to our front end and let's go
ahead and type meteor call and pass in
the method that is ad resolution and
inside of here we're actually going to
give this a number so we're going to
call me your resolution ad resolution
and we're going to say the values 21 now
we're getting a method error at
resolution match failed now if we head
to our command line we see that signet
eyes and reported to the client as match
failed so check accept expected a string
got a number so by running check on all
of your methods you'll now be able to
make sure that nobody is able to submit
anything into these methods that they
shouldn't for instance this resolution
here is going to be an object okay and
let's check this delete resolution this
delete resolution is as using both the
object user okay so this is going to be
an object as well now we're passing in
several variables in here we could check
all of those variables it's extremely
important that you do this that way if
people do know what your methods are
they will only be able to submit the
types of data that you want them to have
now another way around this is to use a
package like collections to which
involves the simple schema package now
simple schema allows you to define
schemas and in those schemas you can say
like text is supposed to be a string you
know this is supposed to be a boolean
and that package will actually check
your variables for you and make sure
that when they're submitted that they're
the correct type so make sure that
you're either checking right here in
your methods if you're adding to a
collection or that you're using a
package like simple schema which I
actually do go over in the intermediate
meteor tutorial so if you want to learn
simple schema head over to the
intermediate meteor tutorials it's going
to be just as viable and react as it is
in meteor now the only difference is you
will be able to use the package that
allows you to automatically create
cornfields based on the schema other
than that though simple schema is a
great option if you want that protection
as well cool so check your variables
please do it do it do it do it it's
definitely a good thing to do for your
site and the security of your site as
always this is Scott would level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments if you come in the video or me
about Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials as always these videos are
available on the store level up
tutorials com if you want to get the
code examples for these as well as extra
videos that are only released along with
the digital purchase or level up pro
subscription so thanks for watching and
I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
