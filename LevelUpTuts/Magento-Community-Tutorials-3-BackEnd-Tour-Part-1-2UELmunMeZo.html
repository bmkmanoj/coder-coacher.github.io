tuts and today I'm going to be giving
you a tour of the back end of Magento so
take it to the back end all we have to
do is type in admin after our URL here
it's going to take us to the login and
it's just going to ask for your username
and password here so we can have it as
it was how you entered it when you
installed Magento okay and it's telling
me Magento community one point six point
one stable is available now I'm not
quite sure why it's telling me that
because we have one point seven
installed this thing these messages like
they like to pop up and annoy you all
the time so what I would recommend doing
is going here message inbox right away
here and then here's all these different
messages looks like this one is actually
from October 2011 we're just going to
select all of these and we're into
actions remove submit and we're removing
all of the messages that came on our
site when we installed it no big deal it
also says up top one more your indexes
are not up to date if you haven't done
this already we're just going to click
this index management right here we're
going to take care of that when click
select all actions going to be re index
data and we're going to click Submit and
they'll just take a second here and it's
just going to rien de Mar data okay once
that's done you're going to see all
green lights here cool let's click up
top here to get back to your home page
so this is the dashboard this is what
you'll see anytime you go to your admin
section right away
it's going to tell you some bit of
useful information here once you have
some orders this is going to be a graph
of your orders you can actually change
it to be last seven days current month
whatever by default it's set at 24 hours
here I'll have a tab here this is your
best sellers most viewed products new
customers as you can see the customer
account that I made is right here and
customers these are people that have
actually ordered from you
so on your left column here you're going
to see left hand sales average orders
last five orders classified search terms
top five search terms saw a bit of
useful information to see right off the
bat here is the dashboard does a nice
job of giving you everything you'd want
to know right when you log in so that's
the dashboard you can always get back to
it by clicking right here or clicking up
top here this Magento admin panel the
next one is sales under sales we got a
lot of stuff we have orders invoices
shipments credit memos pretty much
anything that has to do with your sales
on your site is going to be under here
your orders if we click under orders
you're going to see a list of all of the
orders in the most recent ones on the
top however there's live sorting
features here you can sort them by all
sorts of things whether they're open
closed complete processing by order
number invoices the same thing it's
going to look the exact same in fact
this is sort of the way a lot of these
screens look you'll notice you'll get
really used to this layout here
shipments credit memos transactions so
this is all of your sales stuff under
catalog we have a lot of really
important things so manage products this
is where you're going to see all of the
products that are created on your site
if you look now we have all of these
products and the most important
information about them like the type the
attribute said the SKU number price and
again you can sort by any of these
things and it's going to do that nice
and quick for you you can do bulk
actions to lead change status update
attributes which is really nice it's
super easy to do let's say if you need
all of them to all the sudden be enabled
you could select all select enable and
then under actions update attributes and
it's going to make every single one
enabled in so that's pretty cool under
categories you're going to have the
different categories in your categories
if you remember let's go to the home
page for a second our categories our
furniture electronics apparel and then
inside of those categories are
subcategories and then some of the
have even further subcategories you can
keep drilling down as much as you want
as you can see these have looks like
three levels so that mimics this right
here we have furniture and living room
and bedroom and then electronics we have
cell phones cameras instead of cameras
we have accessories and digital cameras
so this layout right here that you see
in your categories is going to be what
is in your navigation here click back
here we can see the important
information about our categories if you
recall when we are on let's say the
furniture page it's going to have this
header image and if we look down here we
click furniture here we see that this
image is our header image so this is
where you would upload that header image
based on what theme you're on this is
also the name you can give a description
so meta description stuff under display
settings you can say you know what it
shows a custom design category products
you can you could change all this stuff
it's really nice and cool every single
one of your categories can look
completely different if you so choose
you also notice that there's some
numbers here this is saying that there's
four products that are under livingroom
and two products that are under bedroom
this is nice and you know quick at a
glance if you just need to see how many
electronics you have on your site you
got 42 PRL 66 so this is your categories
we'll get into more with categories and
the next couple of lessons will show you
how to create your own and what kind of
options now attributes and attribute
sets are really interesting and really a
robust part of Magento so let's click
our attribute sets just so you can get
an idea of what they kind of are so our
interview sets are what types of
attributes your products will have so
obviously like a t-shirt is going to
have like size and color let's click on
this you can see this out the attributes
for tee shirts
it has name a model SKU weight status
some other stuff and we have price
see images descriptions so t-shirts
specific attributes gender shirt size
color so this is where you would have
these sort of options here let's go to a
t-shirt so I can show you a little bit
more about how that is
let's go shirts and in this shirt on
this product page you're going to get
options that you don't have in other
products like this drop-down where you
get to choose your size between small
medium or large and in here you can see
that you know what model it is some
details so this is where you're going to
be these are sort of what your
attributes are doing they're allowing
you to create product information that's
specific to a particular type of product
and so you can create your new
attributes you can add them to attribute
sets and then when you're creating
products you can assign those attribute
sets to specific products so manage
attributes this is where you create
individual attributes so remember before
we had gender for the t-shirt you'll
notice that gender is right here we
could use gender across other attribute
sets if we wanted to so gender was just
not specifically tied to t-shirts
however we can associate it with
t-shirts in the attribute set so again
like under the other any of these other
screens you can do sorting you can do
some bulk actions
pretty cool you can add new attributes
here URL rewrite management these are
just sort of your URLs you can add some
URL rewrites if you want depending on
what story you're in everything search
terms these are what people are
searching for
by default when we install the sample
data it's just sort of populated with
this people aren't really visiting my
store but it's you know it's going to
say that these are search terms and
these are what people are searching for
and this is what came up so you can
actually see what people on your site
are searching for okay so reviews and
ratings customer reviews reviews by
default go into pending
see if we have any in there no but when
so a review will go into pending and
then you have to come in here and
approve it unless of course you want all
reviews to be approved by default you
can do that reviews and ratings they
sort of work like how you would expect
them to just like anything you've gone
to Amazon a customer can leave a
reviewer rating on any of your products
under tags this is where you're going to
tag your products so you can see there's
a whole bunch of stuff in here already
Apple and Acer whatever this is where
you can create your own tags if you want
but usually this is where you're going
to be modifying tags that customers have
placed on your products if you give them
that capability Google sitemap you can
create a sitemap to submit to Google
this will you know how about with your
page ranking just sort of gives Google a
good idea about where your content is on
your site just like sort of a like
exactly like it says it's a sitemap okay
so that's the first couple of categories
as I said before this back-end is really
robust there's a lot to go over in the
next lesson we're going to showing you a
few more things in here just to not
overwhelm you in these videos you know
we're just split up
so as always if you have any questions
let me know
once again this is Scott with level of
Tut's and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
