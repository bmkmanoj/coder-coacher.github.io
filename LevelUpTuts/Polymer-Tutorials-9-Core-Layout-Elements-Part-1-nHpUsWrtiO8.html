up tutorials and today I'm going to show
you how to use core layout elements
within polymer now these things can be a
little bit tricky if you haven't used
them before but we're going to get into
a little bit of things called layout
attributes which we're going to cover
more in later videos we're going to get
a basic example going using a basic
header toolbar area and then a Content
area using the core toolbar and the core
header panel custom elements so now
these core layout elements work a little
bit different than what we've seen
so let's actually get into a right now
and start exploring ok so in the last
video we had our core element that we
dropped in here and it just created this
tooltip nice and easily well in addition
to elements like things like a tooltip
polymer also offers layout elements now
layout elements do useful things for you
like creating toolbars and headers and
stuff like that so let's go ahead and
get started with using some layout
elements so the first core element we're
going to be using for our layout is the
core header panel so like it says is
really just a panel for your header what
we can do here is just simply copy this
last core component and I'm going to use
this as a template for my second core
element here so instead of a core tool
tip it's going to be core header panel
okay and I'm just going to copy and
paste this in here and we're also going
to be using core - header - panel HTML
for the file itself and let's go ahead
and start using this so just like before
we just need to call our element and
like we saw with the core tool - element
this elements going to be wrapping so we
were able to put a span within this last
element and we're going to be putting
stuff within this element - so we can
type core - header - panel as our
element here so we now have our core
header panel here and what this panel is
actually doing is it's basically saying
you have a header section and a content
section
and we're going to have to define that
code so this is merely just a wrapper
for our content but before we get into
that we're gonna have to go over
something really quick called layout
attributes now you don't have to worried
the specifics right now however we're
going to use some layout attributes on
our body tag to specify some things I've
read a document so we can say that just
like any other attribute here we can say
that this is going to be full bleed this
is going to be a layout and it's going
to be vertical now like I said we're
going to go over the specifics about
layout attributes in other videos you
can always check out polymers
documentation in the meantime however
let's go ahead and refresh our page you
can now see that we have this shadow
here and you'll notice that on our body
if we inspect our code we're getting
some really interesting stuff going on
we have you know flux Direction column
we have a display flex zoom margin zero
and a height 100 VH so if you want to
see more about what's going on there you
can always check out the layout
attributes section and see what each of
those is doing however like I said we're
going to go over a layout attributes in
depth in a few videos okay now let's go
ahead and add a second core element here
we've been using the core header panel
let's go ahead and import the core
toolbar so just like before I'm using
this as a template here because these
are all going to be located in the core
elements folder in the bower components
so just like that core - tool bar okay
and then core - tool bar HTML okay so
now within our core panel we can use our
core toolbar so we can do that by typing
core toolbar as an element just like
we've been doing already okay cool now
for our core toolbar let's just go ahead
and throw a div in here and say hello
let's go ahead and delete the tooltip
I'm gonna delete the link here as well
as the tooltip core
element that we had here just to clean
this up a little bit I also deleted this
platform Jess that we had in here it's
been changed from platform jazz to web
components Jess which we added in the
last video is the last script having
both of those scripts is not necessary
so there were a little bit cleaned up
but we still want this to work correctly
so what do we have to do here
well we actually need to give the header
panel and explicit height now one really
easy way to do that is to use the layout
attribute flex on the core header panel
itself now we're also going to want to
apply some styles to the core toolbar so
just like we deem any element with CSS
in our CSS we can use core toolbar just
like that and we can say that the
background color for the core toolbar
can be something like let's use 333 I
know that's not really colorful or
anything and for color we'll just say F
which is white so we have a darkish gray
and then a white okay so keep in mind
that we have these layout elements but
they come don't come with any default
styling other than some things like
maybe like a drop shadow or layout stuff
right so you shouldn't expect them to
look any particular way until we add CSS
okay now let's go ahead and check this
out upon refresh we now have this tool
bar at top that says hello and if we
come back to our HTML within the core
header panel in the core toolbar and
just underneath the core toolbar here is
we want to put our content so we could
just say anything here I don't have like
lorem ipsum text or anything handy so
I'm just going to paste in a bunch of
hellos okay sure that's fine
now let's refresh and as you can see
here we have our our tool bar up top and
we have our hello text down below now
this is just a basic version of using
these layout elements but as you can see
they're adding some flexbox
stuff for us and they're adding some
basic CSS layout stuff for us and
leaving the
Eiling up to us in the next video we're
going to take you through some more
advanced layout elements we're going to
create things like tabs and navigation
drawers and all these things really
easily just by dropping in some elements
and in the middle of that we're going to
teach you a little bit more about layout
attributes and give you the full rundown
on what you can do with them
so we're just getting started as I keep
saying with polymer there's a lot here a
lot of stuff that will make you really
believe that web components are the
future of the web itself so keep
watching and we're going to get into
that later as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials thanks for watching
and we'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
