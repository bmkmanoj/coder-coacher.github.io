up tuts today we're gonna pick up right
where we left off and we're gonna make
this header even better
okay so we now have this whole header
section spending the entire width it's
this purple this content is all white
white white okay perfect
I'm going to change this right here okay
and we should see everything show up
again okay cool so let's let's play
around a little bit more with this we
want this level up Tut's to take up
let's see it's the image itself is 287
pixels we want this to go to a certain
amount of columns let's check out
skeleton since this was 287 pixels looks
like five columns if you hover over this
with the grid it's just not enough so
we'll go to six and then we'll want the
other item the search bar to be pushed
over to the right but let's don't worry
about that lets go to the logo let's go
to our header here and we're going to
say this logo here is also going to have
a class of six columns six spaced column
so it's giving a class of columns and a
class of six and I'm going to go ahead
and put that down here on this h2 as
well now let's check out our page
refresh it and you'll see this stuff
shot up because if you remember when you
add something to your grid its floating
it so it's taking it out of the document
flow cool okay so we have this this logo
here it's Cohen here we want this search
bar to be over on the right so if we
remember we have 16 total columns
therefore this is taking up 6 columns so
therefore we have 10 columns to have
this be here if we want this to also be
6 columns wide we're gonna have to push
it over so let's check out skeleton and
you can see that you can push columns so
let's see this offset I'm sorry this
doesn't like it when you click on it you
see this down here 5 columns offset by 1
this offset by one is pushing it over
one so let's come back to our code here
so let's first do something quick I'm
going to take the search bar this top
search I'm gonna take it outside of the
well not outside I'm gonna put it below
this quick access stuff so by cutting
this this line that says PHP echo get
this child top search this is the search
bar and then we have the welcome message
the top links the store language all
this stuff here I also want this a
welcome message to get out of the quick
access cuz I want this stuff to be a
little bit cleaner so I cut that out and
no just above this top container I'm
gonna paste that in there I'm gonna save
it I'm going to come back here and
refresh okay this is look sort of crazy
now but this what do you want to buy is
right here we can put this wherever we
want now this stuff is still it sort of
doesn't know where to go because of how
this is floating but let's give this the
HTML classes it needs and it will push
in the right spot so we want this quick
access we want this to have a class of
six as well because we want to be six
columns wide so we'll say six columns
and then we'll say off set I think it's
under school boy let's check - offset -
by one actually four because we have six
and then we'll offset it by four and
then six more to equal total of 16
columns come to our site let's go to
refresh this cool so now we see our
quick access it's pushed aside four
columns it's up against the right here
one more quick small thing you'll notice
that this is getting a margin to the
left because we're saying six columns
and this quick axis is getting a margin
to the right we actually want these to
be snugged all the way up against the
wall we don't want an additional gutter
on the end these margins are called
gutters by the way so we're going to add
a
class of alpha to our H ones and we're
going to add a class of Omega to our
Quick Links or quick access this Alpha
Omega stuff is pretty standard it's from
the 960 grid system it's a way that they
used to say if this is the first item
use alpha if it's the last item use
Omega that way it lines up and it
doesn't have gutters so let's refresh
this and if you hover over this now
you'll see that this no longer has a
margin right this no longer has a margin
left we're one step closer to getting
this site going so we have our header
tag our h1 h3 we got some good html5
stuff going on but as we keep going the
site's just going to get cleaner and
cleaner and it's gonna start to just
look a little bit more like a real
website okay so as always this is Scott
with love-love Tut's if you have any
questions please leave a comment the
video or hit us up at Twitter level of
Tut's let us know what you're thinking
