of tutorials and in this video I'm going
to be showing you how you could make a
symmetrical grids easily with loss now
these are going to be grids where your
columns aren't necessarily going to be
the same with there's some small
challenges that come along with that
that will address but let's get going on
that right now so in the last video we
showed you how to get some basic grids
going we showed you how to work with
something called cycle which sort of
allows you to say hey every few of these
items remove the margin on the right to
allow it to reflow so let's actually
come back and let's modify this one
third cycle to it with 15 pixels just to
be one-third once more and i'll come
back to our page and refresh you can see
we have a nice grid going here so that's
pretty awesome right but let's say we
wanted some sort of an asymmetrical
griddle if you view something like Suzy
you know that working with asymmetrical
grids is pretty easy in those systems
however let's see how easy that is using
lost now the thing about an asymmetrical
grid is that you need to use the concept
of sort of rows rather than having a
flowing objects right because it's going
to be one column than an uneven column
and then another column we're going to
be removing a cycle entirely and it's
going to be using the fact that there's
a last item the to remove the margin so
to see what I mean in action let's come
in here and i'm going to reset this HTML
to only have three items in it so we
come back here so we got three items
right okay now let's make the one in the
middle one half of the width and let's
make the other two let's make those one
a quarter of the width so where we can
do that is simply by coming in here and
I'm gonna just say colon nth child and
then I can say the second item I want
you to be one half now if we come up
here I want all the other items to be
one quarter now we come back to our page
and refresh and you got in you
we have some sort of wonkiness here we
have the first item which is clearly a
quarter and then we have these two which
it's getting this one with the cycle in
it and because of this cycle it's giving
this a margin right of nothing and then
the last one it's also not giving you a
margin right either because it's the
last in the container so you can see
these are sort of butted up against each
other so how can we get rid of this well
we can actually do this simply by coming
in here and saying hey just don't cycle
these because we're not doing multiple
rows so by placing a zero after the
division here we sit basically are
saying don't worry about the cycle and
only sort of remove the margin on the
last child so now as you can see we have
great item larger grid item and then the
last grid item now what would you expect
to happen if we just duplicated all of
these and added a whole nother row so
let's save this and let's refresh and as
you can see it gets messed up basically
this approach is working if you're
having a row of divs not necessarily
multiple rows within one container so
let's go ahead and fix that just by
copying this entire section like so
pasting that in there refresh and now
you can see we have multiple grids
because essentially of a section here
which is serving as a row then we have
our row items then we have another row
with our rope items so these are sort of
how you do asymmetrical grids using lost
you can use this end child or you can
give this specific item a different
class to modify the actual division and
sizing here so there we have it
asymmetrical grids in law now if this is
something that you're doing throughout
instead of setting the cycle 20 all of
the time you can actually just
completely turn off the cycle for your
entire project if you'd like so we can
actually turn off the cycle
for our entire project using a variable
we can just say at lost and then we can
say cycle is none okay so that's going
to be a setting that allows us to not
have to define any sort of cycle here we
can simply get rid of these zeros like
so and as you can see when we refresh
our page everything is the exact same
because that cycle property is being set
to none so we can get rid of that as you
can see it breaks it once more okay
let's set this back here I don't want to
leave that cycle setting to none all the
time okay and you can see we have a
fully functional grid once again okay so
as always this is scott with level up
tutorials in the next video we're going
to be talking about responsive grids
using lost and then we're going to get
into some of the more different grids
that lost offers like vertical grids and
things like that we're going to be
talking about the flex box fall back and
then how you can make lost grid work on
two browsers as far back as I e8 so as
always this is Scott would love love
tutorials if they have any questions or
comments if I come in the video hurt us
up at Twitter or Facebook we'd love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
