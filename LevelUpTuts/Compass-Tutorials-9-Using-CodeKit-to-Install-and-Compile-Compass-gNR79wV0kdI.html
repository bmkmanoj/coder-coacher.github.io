up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to use an application called code
kit to not only install your compass
however watch your s CSS files and
compress them it will also optimize your
images and compress your JavaScript it's
a really nice app and right now it's in
beta so you can try it out for free if
you go to incident 57 comm slash code
kit you can see that the latest version
is available for here for download so
you can just click download and then
open the app ok once you have the app
open this is what it looks like so I
just have a new project here that I just
made a folder for and what I'm gonna do
is I'm just gonna drop this entire
folder my entire project folder I'm just
gonna drop it right here
as you can see it's recognized some of
our files it says okay here's an S CSS
file it's gonna watch and here's an
index file of course I don't need
scripts and I'm having the images so it
doesn't see those however if I were to
save my sass it could compile for me in
fact I could tell it to automatically
compile so to setup compass on this
project I'm going to right click on this
folder here and I'm gonna say compass
and then use compass on this project
what's really great is that it says
there's no configuration file what do
you want me to do so I'm just going to
say install compass and here if you
recall about the config RB file this
will generate this config RB file for
you and you can set your image folder
and everything directly here which is
maybe a little bit nicer interface than
you're used to with doing it and the
configure RB file in compass so we're
gonna keep our CSS and CSS our style
sheets and style sheets and JavaScript
this will be j/s although we don't have
a JavaScript folder and I want to say I
want my CSS output to be compressed
because that's nice and ready for
production okay so in environment I'll
also set to production ok we can click
Add compass to project and you can see
it's edited our ie print and screen
style sheets just
when we install the compass via the
command line okay
so now you can see that the little
compass logo is a next-door project here
that means we have compass in code kit
let's open up my S CSS file here and
we'll just do it add import and then
compass I'll save it and you can see it
says you know if you have growl
installed this will pop up here and sa
compass ran successfully we can check
out our code kit and if there's any
errors they'll show up an error in here
however since we're not doing anything
yet there's not gonna be anything really
in your CSS file however you could see
that because I ran this at import
compass I saved it and there was no
problems that means compass is correctly
installed here so just to further verify
that it's working let's just add a style
to an anchor it's also worth pointing
out that Kok it only runs on OS X 10.7
lion and not any older version of OS X
so if you want to check out code kit I
would recommend checking it out
downloading it while it's still free and
getting to try it it's a really nice
little app that sort of speeds up your
production time and makes it so you
don't have to deal with the terminal so
much well that's it for code kit once
again this is Scott with level up tuts
and if you have any questions or
comments feel free to leave a comment on
