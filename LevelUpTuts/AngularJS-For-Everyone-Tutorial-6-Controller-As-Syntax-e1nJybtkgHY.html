up tutorials and in the last video we
showed you how to make your first
controller now we're actually going to
take this in a way we're gonna show you
a best practice for controllers by using
the controller as syntax this sort of
gets rid of the scope variable that we
introduced and now when you look at your
templates things will make a little bit
more sense in fact if you have more than
one controller per your template then
now everything will be much more
organized so using the controller as
syntax is something that is really
helpful to start doing early on so you
don't get in the bad habit of just
putting everything on scope so let's
check it out right now hey what's up
this is Scott with level of tutorials
and today we're gonna continue our
angular series by showing you the
controller as syntax now the exact
functionality of what we're doing right
now isn't necessarily going to change
however this is a best practice and it's
going to be a way that you can ensure
that your code stays readable and
organized in the future so what we're
gonna go ahead and do first is modify
our JavaScript file so what we had here
is we had this angular module and then
we had our control area okay so inside
of our controller were passing in scope
we have our scoped out list we have
scope dot add person and if you remember
by adding things to scope we're making
it available to our controller within
our HTML right so we can just say add
person and it's gonna know what to do
it's gonna know to go to this function
but what we want to do is instead of
just using the scope variable we want to
namespace this to the controller so the
way we can do that is using controller
as so now what we need to do in our
JavaScript is to create a new variable
so we're gonna say far and now we can
just add this as directory list but I'm
gonna shorten it to just dir list like
that and what it's going to be equal to
is this okay now this is referring to
the controller itself now we don't have
to do any more so we don't have to have
the scope variable pass through this
function so this can simply just be
empty like that now every time we're
using scope we need to actually use dir
list instead now
notice how I have this in camel case so
underscore first and the second word is
upper case okay so we now have der list
dot Lister list ad person okay
and again anytime that we're going to be
using this scope we're gonna not want to
use scope anymore so again we can just
go and replace all the times that we
used scope okay and last one is scope
dot age right here okay and as you can
see by browsing to our site you refresh
it's totally broken and if you came into
your inspect element checked out year
council you'll see you're not really
getting any errors because enough data
is on the scope variable none of us
getting output so to resolve that we
want to use controller as in our
ng-controller so now here we can say
directory controller sure but now we
just need to say as and then we can say
dir list okay so now we're saying we're
going to use the directory controller
but we're gonna use it as Dirar
list now the only thing we really have
to change here is anytime we're using a
variable that was previously on the
scope we need to now use it with der
list instead of without anything so
before we just have list even though it
was scoped out list in the JavaScript
but now that we're using controller as
we can say Duras dot list okay otherwise
it just won't find list so we need to
say do list that list and now any time
we're using anything so like this
function and person is going to be der
list dot add person and since in our
directory Jas we're using der list name
and dearl SH as part of this ng model we
actually need to include that here so we
can say Duralast name and der list dot
age okay perfect now let's go ahead and
refresh our page as you can see
everything's working fine let's go ahead
and add a new name we need to say Jim
and Jim is 40 and
and now we have a gym is back here
perfect so we can just keep on having
names Tim and Tim is 30 and tare perfect
cool so this is now working exactly as
it was before however we're now using
this new controller as syntax now this
may seem just a little like extra typing
right now I mean we we added extra
typing pretty much everywhere to get
this same exact functionality but it
really comes in handy and if you're
going to be having multiple controllers
or something on the same template if you
have things that are on the scope
variable such as add person if this was
just on the scope variable you wouldn't
really have an idea of what controller
that was representing so by having der
list add person you always know which
controller if you're using multiple
controllers so for the remainder of the
series we're going to be using this
syntax with everything we do because it
is the best practice great so now that
we have this out of the way you can work
with controllers you can add a little
bit of functionality here now what we're
going to get into is showing you really
a lot of what the angular template
language is capable of accomplishing now
we're not going to spend a ton of videos
on it but I want to show you the things
that are super useful like ng class and
G show and G hide a bunch of the
directives that you're gonna be using a
lot to control your pages and that way
you have a nice arsenal of things to use
with your new controller before we get
into some more advanced topics like
factories services directives grabbing a
content from an API and things like that
cool so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave to come in
the video herd us up at twitter or
facebook at level up tutorials we'd love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
