going to take this a little bit further
and we're only going to change this text
once we push that button that we made if
we come back to our Android device you
can see we have this pressed me button
right now it's not doing anything with
Texas has changed by default it's
loading up saying changed we want to be
able to have this button push and do
something and so there's a nice basic
example I think this will suffice so the
same way we referenced our text view
this fine view by ID and then we pulled
the resource right here using our ID dot
text view 1 we're going to do the same
thing to find our button the data type
here is actually going to be button this
time instead of text view and we're
going to call our button we're just
going to call it push me and notice the
camel casing on the naming of that
variable and we're going to say push me
is equal to find view by ID and we're
going to say our dot ID dot and then we
can find our button number one right
here I'm going to end us off with
semicolon save this and likewise you
remember we had this underlined right
here that says underscore button or it's
underlining button here and it's wanting
you to import if you had multiple things
you could import and let's say we want
to do all the ones we had to do at once
instead of just doing them individually
we can always go to source and then
organize imports or you can see it's
command shift o on the Mac for Windows
you'll have to check out what your
scripture cut says for you but as you
can see as you can see up top here that
at our Android widget button import so
now we don't have to do that and it's no
longer underlined and just like before
let's add a cast to this by hovering
over it and just select add cast now
let's save this and there we can have
access to our button now so how do we do
this how do we access this button and
it's pushed me
and when we push it how do we have it do
something well if you're familiar with
other types of programming you may have
heard of something like AD
onclicklistener what we need to do is
have an onclicklistener on this button
so let's type our variable that's
referencing our button this pushed me
and we're going to use the method set on
click listener and this is really
listening for a click when this button
is clicked it's going to trigger
something so what is it going to trigger
it's going to trigger a new and then
view dot on click listener and if you'll
notice when I hit enter there it
auto-completed that and it gave me all
this stuff now
I'm not going to go into the specifics
but this stuff that's happening inside
of this onclick method inside here is
what's going to happen once this button
has been clicked so let's take this text
one set text let's cut it from where it
was and we're going to paste it into
this method here it's also giving me an
error here because it's wanting a
semicolon you'll most eclipse is really
good about giving you errors anytime
there something is not going to be
working for some reason and usually you
can hover over it and find out what's
going on another case of something sort
of funny here it says cannot refer to a
non-final variable so really what we
don't to do is we want to change the
modifier of text one to final and this
is really saying that this variable
cannot be reassigned so I'm going to
click this and I'll go over more about
when you're going to use this and not
going to use it in future lessons for
now we're just trying to get this
working so let's leave it here final you
can see our errors gone away we can save
this and now let's click our play button
and it's going to launch our new app and
one second here once this boots up we'll
be able to see it says the hello level
of tuts that we have it set in the XML
and then when we press this button this
is changed crazy-cool and we can keep
pressing it it's not
do anything I mean you could see down
here in our logcat it's giving up some
some messages here but other than that
it's not really doing anything so great
every time we launch this app it's going
to say changed so another thing that you
should notice here is if you're in your
emulator let's say you hit the HOME key
by accident for some reason and here is
your home screen but where's this app
that you've just been running well when
you actually run an app using this
emulator it's installing it to this
virtual device and you'll be able to
access it by clicking on the app drawer
and just like any other app or just like
any Android phone you can see we have
our level of touch app is installed in
the ranking or listing here so you can
even get an idea of what your apps going
to look like on somebody's real phone so
we can click and hold and throw this
under the desktop if we want that way if
we ever accidentally click out of the
app you can just click it up and start
back into it perfect so as always if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video and it's a vittoria
level up Tut's like I said there's a lot
of craziness going on um but you're
going to understand more and more the
more that we do and eventually we're
going to be getting into some really
complex interaction and we're gonna be
making some great Android apps as always
this is Scott with little touch thanks
