of Tut's and today we're going to be
moving our CSS along with some
positioning and so positioning what it
allows you to do is it really allows you
to take control of how your elements are
positioned on the page so the first
thing we're going to show is probably
what you'll be using the most and this
is position:relative so a relative
position element is positioned like as
it says so relative to its normal
position so right now if I were to give
let's say on this div right here if I
were to give this a top of negative 10
pixels it's not going to move you see
it's not going anywhere
that's because it's not being positioned
if we want this to be 10 pixels or this
is in this case negative 10 pixels from
the top of where it is we want to give
this a position relative so we'll call
this position relative now if you notice
it jumped up 10 pixels to make this a
little more obvious let's make this be
50 paper 150 50 pixels okay so here it
is this is now has a top of a negative
50 pixels so it's getting pushed up
relative to where was before if we give
it check that off you can see it go
right back down there goes there goes so
this might be used in a situation let's
say if you're making like a banner and
you want the banner to go a little bit
underneath something like maybe you have
an an image and you want the banner to
just creep up underneath that image this
would be used to move that whatever
you're trying to move just relative to
where was and it can come in very handy
if you need to move it like I had top
here you can also use left and then left
once you give it a 30 pixels you'll see
it move left right it's going to do the
opposite it's going to move right from
the right 30 30 pixels likewise if we
had this be negative 30 pixels it's
going to move towards the right okay so
this is a position relative of course
there's also bottom this
as there is top top left right and
bottom okay so the next one we're going
to talk about is position:absolute so
now this position:absolute is is
interesting because it can be used to do
a couple of different things and the
absolute position element is positioned
relative to the first parent element
that has a position other than is what
it normally is which is static so if we
have something wrapped around a position
if we have something that's positioned
relative wrapped around something as
position absolute that absolute item is
going to move relative to its wrapper
the relative item but if there's no
wrapper like in this case this div has
nothing around it that says position
relative if we make this position
absolute you're going to see that this
one their negative 30 pixels from the
browser window so no matter how big we
make this this div is always going to be
negative 30 pixels off the screen
likewise if we put 30 pixels it's going
to be 30 pixels from the screen and it's
always going to be that way so right
here it's always 30 pixels from the
screen so this is positioning something
absolutely likewise top negative top is
going to send it way above here but
let's see what happens if we open this
div up and we give our h1 leave this a
position:absolute and then now we're
going to give this a position:relative
the wrapper again and I'm actually going
to get rid of this right on here too so
now we have this h1 and now it's
positioned absolutely inside of a
relative item so if you'll notice the
flow of the document is all moved up
because it's taken this text this h1 out
of the flow of the document okay and
what it's doing is its positioning it
absolutely where it is what we want to
do here is we want to say maybe top
negative 10 pixels okay so now you see
it's moving up and positioned relative
to its parent if we were to
off this position:relative on this thing
it's going to be moving absolute to the
browser window just like this div was
when we had it with position:absolute
itself so using absolute position can be
nice if you want to take something out
of the flow of the document and move it
around somewhere on your page it's
probably more useful if it's wrapped in
a position relative tag and then you're
moving it relative to something else
but really it's whatever you needed to
do in this particular case we don't
really need anything position absolutely
because it's all going to go in the flow
of my document and this is all really
how it needs to be okay we just want the
title here and everything like this so
we don't need position absolute or
position relative this next one is
position fixed so we're going to do for
that is we're going to create a above
all this I'm going to create above the
rapper and everything I'm just going to
create a new div and it's going to be
this is just going to say feedback and
so this is going to be a feedback that
all its going to have as an anchor in it
that's not going to be anything but it's
just going to be safe feedback okay you
save this now I'm going to tell this
feedback feedback I'm going to tell this
to be positioned fixed and if you
remember what position:absolute and a
position:relative do then physician fix
is pretty much one of the only other
things you can be describing a position
with what it's going to do is it's going
to fix this relative to the browser
window it's even going to move when you
scroll so if we fix this position and
we're going to say top it's going to be
um 10 pixels it's going to be 10 pixels
from the top and left zero if you can
guess where this will be this will be at
the very top 10 pixels down and then all
the way on the left side so let's save
this go back to our document refresh
and now we have this feedback right here
ten pixels from the top stuck to the
left side and when we scroll down you
see it's always there so this is a
position fixed type element people
sometimes use this to have a navigation
that's following the side of a page if
that's being scrolled down but really
you can be creative this is just fixing
something to the the window of your
screen okay so this is CSS positioning
in the next lesson we're going to go
over floating which is a really powerful
way to control your content and what
we're going to do is we're going to
create a two-column website for the
first time okay so as always if you have
any questions leave a comment heads up a
Twitter level up Todd so let's nurture
thinking this is Scott with level up
tuts and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
