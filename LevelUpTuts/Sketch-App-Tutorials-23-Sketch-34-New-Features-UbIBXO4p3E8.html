up tutorials and today we're gonna be
talking about some of the new features
in sketch 3.4 now these things are going
to be groundbreaking but they will be
nice things that add on to your
experience that's already great and
using sketch so let's check them out
right now so very recently at the end of
October bohemian coating released an
update to sketch that has fixed a bunch
of little minor issues and added some
nice little features that really come in
handy in a lot of situations and there
are things that maybe aren't
game-changing for a sketch however
they're certainly adding to its
impressive set of features and usability
options so I thought I would take this
video to talk about some of the
improvements that came along in sketch
version 3.4 now there's an additional
update sketched at three point four dot
two that's finding its way into the App
Store right now so you should be able to
see those updates as well but they're
mostly just bug fixes performance fixes
some additional iOS templates and some
very minor things like preset updates
and stuff like that so we're not going
to talk too much about three point four
point two just know that it's there and
it's coming as well three point four is
where a lot of the features came in now
one of these features which is going to
be now that you can preview designs in
your web browser on basically any device
so it's not just iOS mirroring at this
point you can actually browse to that
design at a URL on your Android device
and see your designs on an actual device
as well so that feature is going to get
a video its own just so you can see that
in action on a real phone now other than
that we now have the option to actually
browse a plugin directory we come to
manage plugins and we can now get get
plugins and it's going to take you to a
downloadable plugins repository on
Sketchup calm now the great thing about
this is that this is an official like
filtering we can really look for things
easily here we can say palette palettes
and it's really super fast now this is
still new I'm not seeing some weird CSS
stuff in here so I
basically this is going to be getting
better and better when you click the
download button it takes you to that
given packages github page where you're
going to download it and then from there
you can then click the show plugins
folder and drag it into the plugins
folder yourself so this by no means
takes over the functionality of the
sketch toolbox which we know and love so
you might be continuing to use that but
it is a step in the right direction for
plugins within sket in addition to that
there's some great new pasting that when
we now paste something into an art board
it's going to be pasting where you're
expecting which is a topic that we've
actually talked about in some of our
packaged videos let's see if I can
actually get some functionality going
here really we copy this paste into this
art board at paste where you think it
would be nothing too fancy but we now no
longer have to use a plug-in to get the
pasting features that we would want it
with in sketch another feature that I
really like that's new is the disabling
of autosave now if you've ever seen a
file size get gigantic because the files
are constantly Auto saving with these
revisions you can now uncheck autosave
in general preferences so that the files
are only saved when you told them to I
know that sometimes I get in to make a
one-time change to a file to export and
then when I accidentally click out of
the app without undoing my changes and
it saves that then disabling the undo
functionality I'm occasionally not super
excited so being able to turn off
autosave is a nice feature that I'm
going to be using personally but of
course if it doesn't fit your workflow
there's no reason to uncheck this box in
addition to that there's some new
artboard presets for Android users which
is really great as an Android user
myself there's now things like Android
icons where you have the 512 by 512 and
they're labeled how you would expect for
those Android developers out there I'm
really happy to see Bohemia encoding
embracing Android and not just sort of
sticking to their iOS only because this
is an OSX app that doesn't mean they
should only have templates for iOS
devices when Android is so popular as
well so that's exciting for me just to
see more Android things coming in
to sketch they've also made significant
improvements in boolean operations for
combining shapes basically it's going to
just be a bit faster and more accurate
for combining shapes which we have the
Union subtract subtract intersect in
different stools up here you can also
create a quick mask for a bitmap just by
selecting the mask icon up here let's
actually drop something into the canvas
here and see this in action I have this
glitched photo here
it's a bitmap I'm gonna select it I can
now select this mask right here and as
you can see it's quickly created a
folder here's the image itself here is
the mask that that's created and then we
can then modify this mask like so so
that's just a quick tool now to get a
mask going we don't have to create two
separate layers and then to tell one of
them to be a mask and now we can also
even right-click on this image here and
select replace image to replace the
image in the mask itself so just some
nice little things like I said these
features aren't groundbreaking but
they're just some nice little things
that definitely make working and sketch
a little bit better now here's one I
really like in addition to lock layers
in the past you would have to right
click lock layer now it's as simple as
holding down the option key when you're
hovering over the eyeball and you can
see that we can now lock a layer just
simply by holding down the option key
this is a small small change but it's
certainly one that I'm going to be using
a lot in fact I've already used it once
or twice today already
in addition zooming has also seen a
bunch of changes under the hood to make
it more fast and effective especially
consecutive zooms so that's nice and we
can now drag SVG's directly onto the
canvas from your browser which is
actually something I'm going to be using
all the time I make a lot of my
thumbnails for these videos in sketch
and I'm constantly grabbing SVG logos of
different technologies so for me just
saving that time to just drag the SVG
directly from the browser onto the
canvas is going to be a nice feature now
we can also modify layouts or grids for
multiple artboards at the same time
let's say this artboard has a grid and
this artboard has a grid as well we can
also tell it to select this one over
here and this one has a grid as well we
can now select both of these and
a let's change let's see their show the
layout or just show the grid or we could
come in and do grid settings and do
something like let's make a red grid
okay so as you can see we've now
modified those grid settings together so
that's a nice time saver as well in
addition when pixel fitting is now
turned off the layers will no longer
move by one pixel increments and when
pixel fitting is on your layers will
always move by one pixel increments
which is a nice little thing it's just
getting things more exact like I said
all of these features are just nice
little additions to sketch and it's
great to see it improving at such a
steady rate that make it more and more
of a complete replacement for your old
tools so like I said in the next video
we're gonna talk about how to get your
designs mirroring on to your browser so
that you can view your designs in a
browser window and see them on a mobile
device exactly just so you can get a
feel for the fitting and size and stuff
like that so as always this is Scott
