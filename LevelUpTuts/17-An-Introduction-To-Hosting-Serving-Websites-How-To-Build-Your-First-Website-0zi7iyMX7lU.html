off-hook tutorials and in this video
we'll be starting the process of taking
our website online now so far we've just
been mostly working on some static files
in our own computer now we're gonna
learn about hosting the difference
between hosting and local hosting and
what you can do to actually get your
website on the Internet okay so while
our web site isn't really looking
amazing yet in fact it's okay however
before we get things really finalized
and start to make things looking a
little bit more like something you'd see
here let's go ahead and talk about
hosting now right now our website if we
head to it lives on a folder in our
computer and if we access any of our
files you'll notice that when we open up
this page it has this big long path here
now locally when you're working on
websites you'll want this path to not
necessarily be a path to a file but
you'll want a web server running on your
computer essentially just means a system
running on your computer and when it's
looking at this it's not looking at this
as this path to this file however its
hosting it at a specific port or even
local domain now this isn't something
that you'd be able to see on another
computer however locally this sites
going to function much more similarly to
what it will online for instance in the
last video we added these links in the
footer that had a slash in front of them
now that slash removes the entire path
so if these links were actually
functional let's actually head to our
footer itself you'll notice that we just
have slash here so on a web server this
slash would just take you to the very
root of your page for instance if you
are on Google this forward slash would
take you to Google's index page and this
is slash about will take you to about
where as these links in the header will
take you to this page relative to where
you are currently so if you're at a path
that is a few
hats deef for instance right now like we
are when you go to about it's just
replacing this index with about but if
your domain let's say we're on a
Bluehost
let's just go to one of these pages here
and you were to change that low that
path it wouldn't be changing the route
of the path just the end of the path and
that's obviously now what we want moving
forward okay so what are we going to do
well the first thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna set up a hosting account and
there's a ton of places you can get your
site hosted from anywhere from blue
house to Gator host or a whole bunch of
these shared hosting services if you're
using just a basic HTML site these are
great places to start after we sign up
for a hosting service we're then going
to be using an application that does FTP
or File Transfer Protocol to connect to
our server where we can then upload our
files that we're working on here where
you'll be able to visit them on the
entire internet anywhere just by
browsing to that domain now a lot of
these services like Bluehost allow you
to get a domain with your purchase so if
you get started for 395 a month you'd a
free domain and you get some things like
24/7 support you can even get like a
one-click WordPress install and free
site builder stuff like that actually if
you're going to be signing up for
Bluehost check out a link in the
description of this video if you sign up
using the level up tutorials affiliate
link it helps this channel out a whole
ton and if you don't want to help me out
that's totally fine too however what you
need is to sign up for a hosting account
you need to end up at what's called a
cPanel here so after you've signed up to
either Bluehost or Hostgator or
something like that and that you have
access to your cPanel then proceed to
the next video where we're gonna talk a
little bit about FTP now back to the
local server after we get this all set
up then I'm going to show you how to
setup a very simple home local server
now there's all types of server
technologies from Apache to nginx
now we don't have to go into in depth
about what these are doing because right
now we're just
primarily learning about the front-end
tools of web development so for now you
really don't need to worry about the
technicals however after we get this
site up and running on a real host we're
going to be using some software to power
a local server so that we can access
this site add something that's not a
long file path and so that our links
will function just like they do online
so as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials in the next we're going to
show you how you can set up your FTP to
sign in to your hosting platform as
always thanks for watching and I'll see
you the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
