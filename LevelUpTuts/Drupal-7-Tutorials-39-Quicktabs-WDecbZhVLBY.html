of hugs and today I'm going to be
showing you how to add some jQuery tabs
to your site using a module called quick
tabs well if you're familiar with jQuery
coding up you know using jQuery UI or
anything or a certain plugin you can do
sort of tabbed browsing no problem and
that's certainly something that you can
definitely do in Drupal
however with Drupal there's always
modules that can sort of just help you
along and do it more of the Drupal way
if you'd like to do it that way so we're
going to show you how to do this using
this module called quick tabs and in the
end we're going to be able to tab
between content on a page so we're just
going to go ahead and download this
module grab the latest one and I'll just
throw it into my modules folder like
usual and we'll just install it okay
let's go here to modules and if he knows
my module page might look a little
different than yours right now I'm using
this module called I think it's called
module filter actually I can verify that
in a second module filter yet so here it
is module filter it provides this nice
little interface for finding modules on
your own site because I know that the
default way of looking through modules
is sort of obnoxious it's really long
and it's just always a pain to sort of
find what you're looking for
so check out module filter if you like
the way this looks I personally am
probably not going to use anything else
until I find something better because
this is just it's made my life a lot
better with Drupal so we're just going
to type in quick tabs here we'll search
for word okay so I'm going to enable
quick tabs and let's see I don't you
know quick tab Styles this sort of lets
you use some of the default styles I
usually just code my own with CSS but
just for an example we'll turn it on
just so you can see how that works and
we'll click Save
okay so now that we have this installed
let's actually go to structure and let's
click on quick tabs right here this is
where it shows up and this is where you
create your quick tab blocks so let's
create a quick tabs instance okay and
we'll just call this my tab and the
renderer we're going to use quick tabs
you can also see that there's UI tabs or
accordion we're just going to use quick
tabs and the style see like I said this
is what you could from installing all of
those other styles since we're using the
Garlin theme I'm just going to select
Garland in my actual theme I'm not going
to be using this and so this Ajax option
this allows you to have the content
loaded when you select that tab
originally so we'll click this yes we
want to use that because it will help
out on our page load times a little bit
that way it doesn't have to load the
content in all of your tabs and so it
only loads it when you select the tab
that you're clicking on okay so next you
can see here that this is where you
actually add your tabs and it gives you
a whole bunch of options here it lets
you use a block view whole node a cue
tabs instance and a callback so you know
we're going to do this with one block in
one view so I can just show you how that
works so we're just going to grab let's
see what's a good block that we can use
we can use this latest projects block
here and we can say this tab title is
going to be latest late as okay and then
in here let's use a view and so here we
can select from our different views so
we have all sorts of fun so let's do
featured projects and then I'm going to
do black one featured projects so it's
going to be late latest and featured
okay cool so I'm not adding the
arguments here this allows you to pass
an argument you can use tokens you can
grab things from the URL by using this
percent zero percent one
and that would grab like the position
out of the URL an argument right so if
you have this percentage zero it's going
to be grabbing the first bit in your url
percentage one as this bit presented too
and so so on and so forth we can go over
that more when we go over the contextual
filters in views right now
we're not using arguments so it doesn't
really matter so we're just going to
have these two if you want to add more
you can just click to add more here if
you want to hide tabs that are empty you
can select this box these are both not
empty so I don't want to hide empty and
it doesn't really apply to this okay so
now we have this quick tabs block and
it's going to show up in our normal
blocks so let's click over to blocks and
then we can enable this somewhere I'm
just going to have it show up on the
content so just we can see it above
everything here where is this this will
be under my tabs right here it's our
name and we'll put this in the content
and if we scroll up here I'm actually
just going to bump this to the top of
the list just so it's the first thing
and we'll click Save okay so now let's
just go to our home as you can see
here's our tabs this is the garland
default style like I said I just want to
make your own my tabs latest featured
let's click over to featured as you can
see it loads the content and then
displays it it's funny because this is
what's on the home page already right
now so it look like nothing changed
there but if we click back and forth you
can now see that it's loading between
the latest and featured so if you wanted
to have a whole bunch of tabs or if you
had nodes that you just wanted to use
their content you could also do that
just by going to structure quick tabs
and then let's edit this really quick
let's change this one to a node really
quickly so featured will just change
this to a node and it wants to get a
node ID so the easiest way to get a node
ID is really just to go to your content
page see our your content if you hover
over one of these edit paths in the
bottom left corner of my web browser
you'll see the path it says my URL this
is slash node
14 so this is node 14 so in quick tabs a
node ID is 14 and okay we're hiding the
title and we're not we're going to use
the full view let's click Save okay cool
so let's click out of this and refresh
ok now let's click over to featured and
here it is here's that entire node of
sass mastery and has the body text it
has everything including the image and
so that is how to use the content from
the node in quick tabs ok so that's how
to easily add jQuery tabs to your
website you can even do Ajax loading
with this it's a nice useful module if
you're going to be doing any tabbing
like I said you could do this you know
yourself with jQuery UI or just jQuery
but this really took pretty much no time
to setup and it's using all of our
content that we've already created a
Drupal it's a really nice system ok so
that's how you use quick tabs if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment on the video below or hit us up
at Twitter or level up Tut's once again
this is Scott and thanks for watching
