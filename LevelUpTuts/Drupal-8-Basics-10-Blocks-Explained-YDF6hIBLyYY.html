up tutorials and in this video we'll be
explaining the concept of blocks in
Drupal
now blocks are a big part of how you
manage your content on the site and how
you move things around so there's a lot
to learn about how you use and move
around blocks it's a very powerful thing
so we're going to take a couple of
videos and talk about blocks so to
understand Drupal and how it differs
from other content management systems
it's important to really understand the
block system now as an administrator if
you hover over some of these sections
and we click this you'll see a lot of
configure block and now that might be
confusing if you've never used Drupal or
maybe don't know necessarily what a
block is now if we were to think about
this layout you can see that when we
hover over the pencil we get an outline
around something and that little
grouping of code is a block for instance
we hover over this you can see that it's
an M menu but it's also a block this
header this logo area is a block this
search section is a block and you can
think of a block as any grouping of
content and you'll notice that going
throughout your site you'll find lots of
blocks everywhere so to start let's get
rid of this powered by Drupal so we
could do that simply by coming to this
pencil and clicking configure block now
what this is going to do is take us to
the block configuration page now some of
these may be very different you'll see
in a minute that when we look at the
header block there's some options there
and we have some options here such as
display the title which is unchecked so
if we were to check display title save
the block now when we come down here you
can see that it says powered by Drupal
twice because this is the title of the
block and this is the content of the
block let's go ahead and come back to
configure block here now there's a lot
you can do in here for instance you can
restrict this to particular content
types you can restrict it to specific
pages of which using a
pattern which will have to go over in
another video and you can restrict it to
roles let's say for instance you have a
website that only shows ads to anonymous
users you might have a block that has an
ad and you would just check only show to
anonymous users now in addition we have
region now the region is the area of the
site where this block is displayed
you'll notice we have footer 1st 2nd 3rd
4th 5th featured sidebar content
breadcrumb header all sorts of stuff now
this list is going to be different based
on what theme you have your theme is
going to be able to provide the regions
that these blocks are placed in that
makes it so that Drupal system is
endlessly flexible you can swap out
themes move your blocks to a new region
and still have them show up correctly
let's actually head to structure now and
let's come to block layout you'll note
from block layout we'll see a big long
list of all of our blocks it's going to
be from top of the page down so you'll
notice we have header or primary menu
and if we keep scrolling down you'll see
we have footer 5th for instance we have
this powered by Drupal block that we
just saw and it's in footer fifth let's
say we don't want this block to show up
at all well we can actually move it to
none now if it's in the none position
it's not going to show up anywhere and
we can just click Save now after saving
let's scroll down here once more and
you'll see in footer 5th we no longer
have powered by Drupal but just footer
menu and then disabled we have powered
by Drupal if we head to the front of our
site you'll notice that that block no
longer shows up in addition let's see we
have the search bar here and the tools
right here let's say we want the tools
to be first let's actually head to
structure block layout once more and
from here we can scroll down to what
would be the sidebar
so side-by first has search and tools
now we want those to swap so let's click
and drag this and move a tools above
search now you'll notice it has an
asterisk next to it which essentially
means that there are unsaved changes so
we have to come to the bottom of the
page and now click save blocks for this
to take effect if we come back to our
site and you'll see that tools is now
above search so working with blocks in
Drupal is really intuitive and it's a
really nice system if you're coming from
other content management systems it
might not be what you're used to but you
will get used to blocks very quickly now
blocks can contain all sorts of stuff it
can contain as you see a search
functionality can contain a menu it can
contain at just basic blocks of text it
can contain a logo you'll notice it can
contain a menu up here and we're gonna
get into all of those different types of
blocks in the next few videos so as
always this is Skyway level up tutorial
so if you have any questions or comments
leave become in the video help me up at
Twitter or Facebook I level up tutorials
I love to hear from you if you want to
purchase the rest of these videos before
