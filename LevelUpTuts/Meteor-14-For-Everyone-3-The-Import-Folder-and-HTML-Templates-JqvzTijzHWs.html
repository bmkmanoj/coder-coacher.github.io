up tutorials in this video we're going
to be talking about templates along with
the import folder what's new about the
import folder where it was in the last
versions of meteor and why it's
important so let's get start it down
okay so we had our basic app we went
over some of the files in here now let's
get started just deleting stuff now what
we don't need to delete is anything at
the root directory so we can keep the
get ignore we can keep the package file
and we'll also want to keep obviously
the dot me to your folder because if we
don't have that this whole thing will
blow up so what we want to get rid of is
pretty much the stuff inside of the
client folder we can leave the server
folder because this code isn't really
doing anything we have this meteor
startup which is just running a function
on startup which is why when we council
logged we were able to see that council
log let's head it to our main dot j/s
and let's get started deleting some
stuff I'm gonna delete these template
events on created all this stuff because
what we're gonna do is we're gonna come
back to it okay gone and we're also
going to delete this import main HTML
I'm gonna tell you why it a little bit
and basically these two import
statements at the top here let's
actually make this a little bit bigger
here let's get rid of just all this
stuff gone okay so main dodgy s is now
gone and you'll notice when we click
click you we no longer have any sort of
anything happening so let's head to our
main dot HTML and let's get rid of these
templates we have the welcome to meteor
with our body and let's that's fine we
can leave that here let's get rid of
these two templates these hellos and now
you'll notice we just have welcome to
meteor here and let's actually just get
rid of everything from our templates to
the body text until we just have in main
HTML we just have our
header tag now remember may not HTML is
the stuff that's going to be loaded into
the site so let's go ahead now and what
we're going to do is create a new folder
now this folder is going to be the
import folder so we're going to say new
folder and we're going to name this in
ports with an S imports now the reason
why we use this imports folder is
because the things inside of this
imports folder are not automatically
going to be loaded into our build
process let's go ahead and do that same
experiment when we had a test dot CSS we
can have a body and we can say the
background is black we can save this and
you'll notice nothing's happening but if
we take this same exact code and put it
inside of the CSS file inside of our
client folder paste this in here we
instantly get a black background so this
is why we're going to be using this
imports folder not to make things more
difficult or more confusing but so that
we have access to basically have full
control over what's getting imported and
used at all times on our site let's go
ahead and delete this now I should note
that even though we used a CSS file as
an example you won't often put your CSS
files inside of imports I can't imagine
doing that to be honest I know maybe
some people will but even if I use a CSS
preprocessor which is like always I'm
pretty much putting those inside of
let's say if I'm using stylet I'm using
a sty L folder or if I'm using sass I'm
using it as a CSS folder or something
like that i J keep that stuff separate
and it shouldn't much matter I kind of
want all of my CSS to be self compiling
okay so now let's actually get started
adding some things instead of just
completely subtracting so inside of our
imports folder let's go ahead and create
a new folder which will named UI so this
is going to be for our user interface
elements okay now inside of UI let's go
ahead and create a new
which we're just going to call body so
new file is going to be body dot HTML
and now inside of here we can say body
now if you're not using Emmet is a code
autocomplete or you'll notice I just
typed body and hit tab you can say a
body tab I'm using Emmet so Google
around I have a video on Emmet under
level up tips it's a nice speedy plugin
for writing fast CSS so if you're
wondering how I'm doing some of this
auto-completion it's by using Emmet okay
so now we have our body and let's go
ahead and simply have a header with an
h1 inside of it and this one will just
be voting app little let me make this a
level up voting there that's that's a
little bit more interesting okay now
obviously remember we mentioned that the
things aren't Auto imported if this file
was going to be inside of our client we
might actually see this showing up here
but we don't see anything so how do we
get that going right how do we get the
body to show up here well one thing we
want to do is let's go ahead and inside
of our UI folder let's create an
accompanying j/s file for this so we can
say body dot j s and now we can use this
import statement where we're going to be
simply importing the HTML file say
import and then I'll wave to say is dot
forward slash body HTML actually let's
wrap this up with a semicolon here okay
so we're going to be importing the body
dot HTML now in addition we want to head
to our client main j/s and now let's
import that body JS file this seems sort
of unnecessary but I promise it's going
to make sense once we all get going so
we can say import and then we can say
inside of quotes dot dot forward slash
in case you don't know the dot means
back one
directory so the dot dot puts us in the
route that so we then need to say
imports /ui /ba t.j.s ended all off with
a semicolon
so you'll see upon instantly saving that
we're now have level up voting like I
said this seems sort of roundabout right
we have our main digest file it's
importing body dot J s body J s is
importing body dot HTML and body dot
HTML is then loaded into our site but I
can assure you that there's a reason for
all of this and I I made turfs
programmer I really like to keep things
concise where it doesn't need a lot of
extra code some people like to make
everything very explicit I'm one of
those people that likes things to be as
clean and not necessarily as overly
verbose as possible and I could say this
is entirely necessary so as you can see
here we now have our body being imported
into here and we have this level up
voting now we witnessed before a
template tag let's actually go ahead and
make a template tag we can do so by
simply saying template we can
autocomplete have a full template tag it
looks just like a standard HTML tag and
we can give this a name this name is
going to go ahead and this will be test
ok and inside of here we can simply just
have an h2 that says inside the template
ok so at the very least we have saved
this and we got a little page refresh
but we don't have anything showing up
here we're not telling this body
template to use this other template yet
so let's go ahead and do that we can
make this and say bracket bracket you
notice my editor automatically has
closing make sure you have your closing
brackets as well so two brackets then
we're going to have greater than then
we're going to say space and we're going
to use the name of the template in this
case it was test you can see upon saving
it
we now inside this template
now let's check out something kind of
interesting let's say we wanted to put
tests in its own file let's say new file
test HTML okay now inside of test out
HTML I'm going to cut templates name and
I'm gonna paste this directly in here
into tests at HTML and then I'm going to
make sure I save body dot HTML as well
and you can see we're having some issues
if you are open up your terminal here if
we were to head to I term you you can
see there's nothing going on but if we
were go to our client side council we'd
see there's an error it's looking for
tests here if I delete this you can see
our level of boating comes back so how
do we use tests well let's go ahead and
import tests and see if that works right
so I'm gonna paste test back in here I'm
gonna save this once more so that we
have nothing that way we can instantly
tell if this is working and let's head
to the top of this document and let's
head to body j/s and let's import from
the same directory test EML rounded off
by the semicolon and hit save and you
can see that our importing has now
allowed us to import an entirely new
HTML file now you can see here that we
have test out HTML it's being imported
via the body jus body that Jesus is
making this aware inside of our HTML
that test exists so because we broke
this into a separate file it then needed
to be imported the same way we imported
body we imported tests at HTML that was
both imported into our JavaScript so
that when our HTML loaded it knew that
tests belonged to this file right here
this just makes everything nice and
explicit saying hey this is the exact
page to load this one and when you use
tests that's the template you're going
to be using ok so this is
a decent start we've had some basics
into templating we've created our own
template and we've imported it into
another file now in the next video we're
gonna be talking about some of the basic
elements of blaze including some
template helpers and a template events
no we're not gonna be doing anything
fancy with these just yet but we're
going to be just showing you the general
idea there so as always this is Scott
