to show you how to use a really awesome
module
book called features and what features
does it allows you to bundle up a whole
bunch of features on your site or me a
whole bunch or can be a whole little
whatever just what you would declare a
feature and it creates a module out of
it this module you can then move around
to other sites and install it there so
let's say you created an awesome view
that maybe it's like a news roll or
something like that that's something
that you feel like you're going to use
all the time maybe it's like a blog or
just something that you've created that
you want to use over and over again so
you can actually create this make it a
module and then move it on to another
site and so to illustrate this I've
actually have features installed on our
level of tuts comm site and as always I
want to reiterate that this site is just
an active development it's currently
totally broken I just haven't found any
time to work on it you know just we're
doing these videos all in our spare time
so you know I find whenever I can to
work on it and hopefully we'll have some
more updates on it very soon but as you
can see I have this module installed
it's just called features so if you want
to go and get it it's at drupal.org
slash project slash features and please
check it out it's really cool so we have
it installed here right so what can we
do
well features is going to be located
under structure and to illustrate this
we have this importer this feeds
importer that what it does is every
single time you know multiple times a
day it checks to see if we've uploaded
new videos to YouTube using YouTube's
API and and then it grabs them and
publishes them as content to our site so
we have this feed that automatically
grabs all of our videos for us which is
a huge thing and I want to use this
somewhere else
maybe I'll swap out the YouTube feed or
something but I just want to use this
YouTube importer somewhere else without
having to do all the work again so let's
go into feeds importers and we can see
it's just called YouTube videos let's
just bring in our video and this is the
just pretty standard feed
that's bringing in our videos however we
are using some additional modules to do
this
some media modules and some YouTube
parser so it's not just supercut draw
I'm just not going to install feeds and
copy my things I want to I want to have
features do this for me so let's go to
structure and let's click features here
you can you look at their data migration
example however we're just going to
click create feature I'm going to show
you how easy it is to get started with
this so here is your basic feature and
you can see that we have access to all
sorts of stuff here under our components
we have content types a content or
context we have feeds we have views so
any of this stuff we can just click on
and bundle into a module itself so we
can do all sorts of stuff we could take
every feature on the site and put it
into a module but we're not going to do
that right now we're going to do a basic
example so the description is going to
be imports I level up tons videos you
can give it you can organize your
features into different groups this is
just going to be a feature so leave it
at features we can even give it a
version so I'm going to give this 7x -
1.0 saying it's the first version and
it's going to be running on Drupal 7 and
I go over here to components we're going
to ignore Advanced Options for the
moment and I'm going to click feeds so I
know that our feed is named YouTube so
I'm going to check that and you notice
it's giving me some dependencies what
this means is basically it's going to
say that when you go to install this
module it's going to say it's not going
to work without chaos tools and feeds
installed now I happen to know that this
particular feed importer also needs
feeds YouTube I'm going to go ahead and
say it needs see if there's any of these
other ones it might need it needs a
media internet sources media YouTube and
I just know this because we built it but
most part most of the time it gets these
dependencies pretty dead-on
so they
like that here and because this is a
feed importer and it's importing into
these videos content type I'm going to
want to create this videos content type
as well on the new site so notice how I
check that it brings a whole bunch of
stuff in more dependencies field basis
fields instances and taxonomy so it's
going to bring all the stuff into our
new site when we enable this mod of this
module this feature so that's good for
now let's click download feature and
it's going to download this as a module
so now here are my blank Drupal site
notice how I have my the only module I
have in here is features I'm just going
to drag this YouTube importer feature
that it gave me i unzipped it and here
it is so let's come to our Drupal 7 site
and click modules and down here sure
enough YouTube importer in it it's
listed just like a module normally would
be and it's going to tell me all of
these modules that I'm missing so I'm
just going to grab all these modules and
then we could enable this and see how
this is paying off for us okay so I've
got all these modules installed I've
installed a soon's like module filter
the stuff I like to have just around
here and now all of them are enabled but
most of them are loaded onto this site
so I'm going to go do features and then
the module that we created was YouTube
importer I'm going to go ahead and
select this and then click Save
configuration and we'll see some magic
in a second so now that that's been
saved now if we've got a structure if we
go to feed importers will now see that
we have YouTube videos as a feed
importer here so if we go to our slide /
import like we would if we were
importing any sort of other feeds our
feed from our last site is already in
here and it's asking for a feed URL so I
can go ahead and grab that feed URL that
we're using and let's grab this
it's grabbing the 50 most recent videos
and paste this in here and let's click
import it's going to initialize and they
should import our videos no problem so
now that the import is finished I click
content and you'll notice not only I you
know did the feed importer work but we
have our content type with videos and if
we go to one of these it looks like
everything is working fun however I
would probably want to do some more
configuration but it did look like our
importer was working and with that
yeah we're getting the video URL and
everything and so we didn't import this
cut or we didn't bring this content over
from the old side we imported it with
the feature that we created and that's
pretty pretty special so now you can
create your own features and export them
now I'm going to go over some of the
more advanced features like how to keep
your features up to date sort of thing
and a migration extension and that way
we can get to some workflow stuff so
that we can do version controlling and
stuff like that because as you all know
Drupal saving a whole lot of stuff in
the database and that's not always easy
to manage so as always this is Scott
