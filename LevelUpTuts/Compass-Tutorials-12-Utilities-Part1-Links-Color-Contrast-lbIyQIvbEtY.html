level up Hut's and today I'm going to
show you some cool tricks using
utilities encompass
so the first off I want to get started I
actually uncommented this font face with
trunk five because I could not stand
looking at chunk five on my entire
document any longer so just heads up on
that one if you watch the last video
it's set back to Helvetica so actually
one thing I'm gonna do first is let's
take a look at this and you see we have
these links that are green and
impossible to read down here
well first I'm going to actually remove
this hover State I'm going to show you
some cool things you can do with links
with some mix-ins that compass has
built-in that can just save you some
typing you know nothing crazy so I'm
actually gonna take this color off too
let's save this and see what it renders
is it should be like the default or
something yeah the blue okay so one
quick one is going to be an unstoppable
in
so let's say you want your anchor any of
them to just fit right in with the
paragraph that it's in so in this case
our links would be the exam white color
they would have no underline whatever so
that mixin is nice and easy it's include
and then unstyled link and when you'd
say that and now if we refresh this you
can see our links blend in you can't
even see them it's really great
encompass isn't doing anything crazy
here I mean it's just inheriting the
color inheriting the text decoration
it's giving it you know no outline on
focus or active so it's you know not
doing anything crazy but let's say you
know you just wanted your links to blend
in for whatever reason that's you know
one line of code instead of a few okay
well let's say you wanted your link to
hover and have an underline on it and
then not have an underline when it's not
hovered well that's really easy to we
just do @include hover
- link
and refresh the page as you can see our
awesome blue links have no underline we
hover and they have an underline and
it's might be kinda hard to see let's
actually let me just change this link
color to something not so awful right
now gosh let's just make this I can't
think of any non awful colors right now
actually what even just yellow would be
easier to see although this is gonna
look bad too
so its refresh okay so yeah no underline
hover underline so that's really just
adding it's really adding two lines it's
adding a text-decoration:none
and then a:hover
text-decoration:underline again not
super crazy but saving you a couple of
lines I mean it's saving you having to
write the hover state it's saving em to
write text decorations for both so again
you know compass just saving you some
time cool well let's show you one more
for links this one allows you to specify
your links normal hover active visited
and focus States in that order so if we
get rid of this color yellow because
we're gonna be specifying our color here
if we say include link - colors and then
in parentheses we're gonna put our
colors so first state is the normal
state we want this to be yellow okay now
come on now we want the hover state we
want this to be yellow - 10 and then we
want the active state we want this to be
yellow - 30 , we want the visited state
well we just want this to be yellow we
don't want this to be a anything crazy
and then we want its focus we'll just
have this blue for fun
okay so let's save this and now let's
check out our CSS to see what it's even
doing so scroll down here it's actually
giving it a visited a focus a hover and
an active State awesome so it saved us
all that typing
come back to our page let's see so it
looks like that hover isn't even like
it's not really not even bold enough to
see let's change it to something a
little bit more crazy so we can do blue
on hover and green on active okay so
check out a document to refresh okay so
now it's blue on hover green on active
awesome and yellow unvisited so that's
how to use the links mix-ins
for sass I'm gonna show you one more
thing that's sort of related it's not
having to do with links but what it's
gonna do is it's going to do something
that we actually did in the sass
tutorials where we built a color
contrast function so this thing actually
does something very similar the mixin is
called contrast color and it's gonna
help you do some contrasting in the
previous lessons we did this whole thing
where we built our own color contrast
I'm gonna comment all this out save this
refresh our document here okay so we
want this text to be contrasted on this
first two paragraphs so let's come up
here to where we have our background
image is a gradient honk I'm gonna come
at this up too and so we want the text
to be contrasted and we're gonna use
that cream color stone so what this
mixin actually does is it not only sets
your background color for you but it
sets your text color for you so here we
would say @include and then we're going
to say contrasted and then we're gonna
pass in what our background color should
be so we want to use this cream and
semicolon here so this is going to set
our text color for us so let's check out
this class of grad and see what's going
on here in our CSS as you can see it's
giving us a background color of our
cream and then it's given an automatic
color to our
next as black so let's refresh our page
and as you can see this text that's in
the grad class which is actually this
whole thing here is black now
so let's actually put that on our
paragraph one and two and I'll show you
let the inverse example of that so let's
see so on our intro here I'm going to
get rid of this space this out a little
bit more so it's easier to see I'm going
to comment these two things out and
we're going to say include contrast did
contrasted and then we're going to pass
it what colors do we have well actually
let's just pass it a black so we can see
white text and black so it's going to
set the background of this to black and
should give us a white text we refresh
our page as you can see our intro
paragraphs
now have black background white text
nice and easy
if you remember when we did the since s
I mean it it took a few lines of code we
have this if-else you know change the
thing so it saved us from having to
write this and here we have an automatic
text contrast built for us so these are
just some utilities built into compass
in the next lesson we're gonna go over
some more awesome compass mix and
utilities and you show you kind of cool
stuff they can do some little
time-saving things just a nice way to
not have to write so many lines as
always if you have any questions or
comments feel free to leave a comment on
