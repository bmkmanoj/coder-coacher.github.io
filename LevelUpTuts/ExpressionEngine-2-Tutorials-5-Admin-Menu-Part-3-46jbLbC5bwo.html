up Tut's and today we're going to level
up our expression engine skills this is
tutorial number five and we're still
going over the admin tab and we're going
to cover channels so before we do that
quick reminder subscribe to our YouTube
beat that was quick moving on admin tab
channel administration channels from
here this is where we create our
channels channels are or channel is a
way for you to separate different pieces
of content so on your website you may
have pages maybe you have news items
maybe you have blog entries those are
all different pieces of content and so
an expression engine through expression
engines tagging system or templating
system the easiest way to separate
pieces of content is by putting them
into separate channels so I'm going to
go through how to create a channel so
we're gonna say again those admin
channel administration channels create
new channel we're going to create one
called news it automatically assigns it
a short name this is actually what you
use and when you're writing your
expressions and tags there you basically
say channel equals and then whatever the
short name is so in our case channel
equals lowercase news and if we do that
it outputs all of our only our news
entries pretty cool we'll go into that
obviously in a lot more detail when
we're doing templating duplicate
existing channel preferences we haven't
created a channel to date so there's no
option here we'll go over channel
preferences in a minute edit group
preferences groups are there's category
groups status groups and channel field
groups two of these items we've covered
we've created we've covered how to
create category or groups and how to
create status groups so let's go ahead
and assign those now this is new so
we're gonna use those news categories
we're also going to use statuses we
haven't created channel field groups yet
what flick the next video to do that
and then also and finally under create
new groups for this channel we have new
templates we haven't actually covered
templates yet so we're gonna skip this
but that's another shortcut that they
provide from the screen but we're not
ready for that so go ahead and hit
submit
channel filled our new channel another
one let's call this one page gonna let
it autofill this we now have an option
to duplicate an existing channel
preferences but we didn't go through
those yet so i'ma leave it as is here
this time I'm going to say no on edit
group preferences because I want to show
you the alternative way which is by
signing it right here under edit group
assignments so this is the alternative
way of doing this no category is really
relevant statuses sure let's use we'll
see statuses update so now those have
their group assignments completed let's
go through the Preferences there's
actually quite a few preferences
so we've already assigned the full name
but this is where you can rename it same
with the short name under path settings
we have couple things here
search results URL this is an important
one if you're using expression engine
search this is a field that you'll want
to assign and basically what you want to
do is tell it where the entries for this
channel live so if this is the news
section maybe our site is structured
like this where it's you know our our
URL news section article and then
whatever the URL title is for that entry
so it would look something like this
administrative preferences this is where
you can set defaults pretty cool it
could maybe you always want to feature
it or maybe not everyone has the right
to publish things
maybe you have like editors or something
like that and in that case you'd want
the default to be closed or in drafts
remember we created another status for
drafts i'ma leave it as open we can tell
to that we want comments to be off by
default and we have the option to select
a field for search excerpt didn't create
any fields yet so this field is blank
channel posting preferences these are
probably fine one of the tricky ones is
automatically turned URLs and emails
into links I've seen where someone has
this check to yes cause II issues where
it's trying to convert something that
the users already converted to a link
and so it just has some wacky stuff here
so I just leave it as no enable
versioning this is something I do like
to do for every one of my channel
channels so I just take that over to yes
ten is fine there's some notification
preferences for you guys to look through
if you're doing that depending on the
scale of your site this might be like
way overkill on my sites we haven't we
haven't had to use that commenting or
allow comments on this channel I'm gonna
go ahead and say no this is just gonna
be a small site but this is where you
would say yes if that's what you want we
already sort of took care of that above
when we set the default to being off but
now we're saying not only the people off
but you also just can't do it
CAPTCHA is available for that here's
automatically turn URLs and email into
links for comments know how this one's
on yes so again that's one of those
tricky things to be aware of and that's
that's about it you can send at entry
titles you know if you want if like all
your entries start like news and then
something you can do that but anyway
that's all the Preferences go ahead and
hit update and finished and now I set
the preference for the news channel in
the next video we're going to cover
custom fields or channel fields so
thanks for watching this video
again please subscribe to our YouTube
channel we'd really appreciate it thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
