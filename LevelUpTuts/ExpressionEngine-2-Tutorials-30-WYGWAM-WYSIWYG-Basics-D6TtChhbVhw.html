tuts thanks for coming back and checking
out some more of our free web developer
tutorials on a wide variety of topics
including html5 css3 Magento WordPress
and like you're watching now expression
engine and many more before we continue
on with this tutorial I would encourage
everyone to please subscribe to our
YouTube channel and follow us on Twitter
and check out our website now level up
tuts calm and on twitter at level up
Doc's can also follow me on Twitter have
been chef all right so we've done that
you subscribed you're ready to learn
about Wigwam so wigwam is another add-on
from pixel and tonic and what this does
is what you're guessing and it's a
WYSIWYG editor and in my opinion it's
one of the best or the best WYSIWYG
editors for expression engine and the
reason why and there are alternatives
and this one is paid it is a paid
product $35 get you it it's one of the
reasons why I think it's the best is for
one it's built on top of CK editor which
is this fantastic open source project
it's highly customizable add and remove
particular functionalities for example
the ability to add images or flash or
whatever we're going to go into that in
a second but maybe also what sort of
sets this apart from others is it's it's
pretty pretty well put together very
sexy so let's go ahead and dig into this
stuff so right where this picks up is
I'm assuming you've already bought
downloaded uploaded and installed this
module we've done that before in
previous and we don't need to see it
again and so once its installed we go to
add-ons to modules and the very bottom
we see a wig Wham
so we'll go ahead and select that and on
this screen is something you know
typically you're gonna sort of fly right
over this screen and in this video
that's exactly what we're going to do
and so there's two screens for the for
the Wigwam add-on and we're currently in
the settings will top over to the editor
configurations this is where we're gonna
really dig in one thing that I should
probably say should have led with was
why is a WYSIWYG important in the first
place and maybe this is obvious to you
but if you're new to expression engine
and web development we could probably
take the two seconds to explain it so
what a WYSIWYG editor is supposed to do
is you know gives your content managers
those are people that are interfacing
with your website on a typically on a
daily basis or less I guess and you know
it gives them a nice sort of you know
what they versed what they used to say
is you know Microsoft Word type of
graphical interface allows you to very
easily add styling and links and imagery
and embed video and you know whatever
else onto the screen and so you know
that the reason why it's important is
because a lot of people that are content
managers don't necessarily have that
same level of expertise as we do and it
allows them to manage the site as they
need so we now know that's really
important so let's get into configuring
this when you first install the Wigwam
module there's two configurations
already set up for you out through out
of the box I guess and we're gonna dig
into this and I'm going to show you how
to create a new one which is super
simple but what what a configuration is
is basically you just think of it as a
set of features that are available to a
user so for example as you might guess
the full by default
as all of the function turned on this
would be a list of all the available
options that you that are or all the
options that are available to you but
not turned on so for example I could
drop this down here and now this is you
know the the pool of disabled items and
right now it's a pool of one you'll
notice that there's also this break you
can sort of drop this wherever and it
will you know push the buttons down this
is sort of what you're paying for this
is the level of configuration that I was
talking about you could do this with
just using like a CK editor but it just
it's a lot more difficult and banner and
his crew over at pixel and tonic have
done a great job of making this easy for
everybody so we've looked at the full a
little bit I'm gonna hop back over to
the basic and I've actually configured
this a little bit and I'm just gonna dig
a little bit deeper into this as well so
what we're seeing here are your sort of
your basic you know and in advanced more
advanced buttons if you are looking
through these and don't recognize maybe
some of these what you can do is you
just hover over it it's gonna tell you
you know after a couple ticks there and
so I hovered over this one tells me it's
a blockquote
and then I can determine do I want my
content editor to be able to do a
blockquote or not and you know you'll
have to think about this is you know
neat to each user and each even field
and so you might say you know what I
don't want that and the way that you
turn this off items off you just click
on them and then they have a red line
throughout their home and they go
somewhat transparent and then they are
not available to the user when they are
editing a piece of content so right so
you may have for example set this one
out this will be a sort of a weird thing
but you may have a custom field that you
really only want that this individual to
upload say or in
a video or something like that so we can
do and we can create a new configuration
we'll call it like you know video field
or something and we don't want any of
this stuff so we just drag it down just
drop it anywhere down here and it sort
of just goes to wherever it's supposed
to go and then find the one for video in
this case of I'm looking for this flash
one now I have to drag up this whole
long bar but then what I can do is I can
sort of just like turnoff the ones that
I don't want so maybe I want them to be
able to do just these two things okay
and then what I can do is I can come
down here and hit submit so now I have
three so I have three different editors
which again or edit configurations which
again are just think of them as you know
separate pools of you know functionality
and we're going to tell you could tie
each one of these and to custom fields
so now let's do that so I'm gonna go
under admin channel channel fields I'm
gonna go ahead and under I may have some
junk in here from last time but anyway
let's go under page fields I'm gonna add
a new field here just so we can see it
and I have wid WAMP I'm gonna call it
video embed if I scroll down I have the
option here between editor configuration
and defaults the first one but then I
can choose video field hit submit
Hey oh yeah I already have something
called video let's just say video embed
let's do that sorry go ahead and do that
save it
that worked let's look at the body this
is also a clam field and this is using
the basic editor okay
so now what we'll be able to do is sort
of compare so I'll say publish a page
I'm not even gonna fill this out but
here we have the body and you can you
can see this set of buttons right and
then if we look at the video embed we
only have those two buttons that I
enabled so I can now hit you know this
little in this little media come over
and I guess I won't do this but then I
could you know pretty easy and then I
want to scatter eyes videos and hit okay
and submit so there you go that's the
best of basics of Wigwam in the next
video we're gonna go over some of the
advanced settings thanks a lot for
watching and guys don't forget YouTube
