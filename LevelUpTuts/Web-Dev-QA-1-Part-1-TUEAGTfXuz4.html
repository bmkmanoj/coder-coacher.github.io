up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be doing a questions and answers
with questions that you sent in to me
via comments or emails so we're going to
take this time to answer a few questions
my wife Courtney is going to be asking
the questions here and I'm gonna do my
best to give you the best possible
answers I'm also joined by my dogs Lucy
and Sammy who may occasionally get in
the way and be super annoying
this is Lucy the mob Lucy them up and
then Sammy the monkey man all right so
should I just read the questions yeah
let's go start now okay good all right
so our first question comes from Kevin
kevin says I would be curious to know
how you got into web development and
what that process was like maybe some of
the lessons that you learned from that
journey as well this is the dog okay
yeah so I think I got into web
development pretty organically it was
really just I'd be making my own
personal website for just having a
website really I was a music major in
college and pretty much everybody had
their own website so it was really just
sort of a necessity and my first web
site was filled with tables and bad
practices but at the time it was sort of
like how you just made websites
especially if you didn't know any better
so I really made a website and then the
next year I made another website because
I didn't like that one in the next year
I made another one and then eventually I
put it on WordPress and then eventually
I put it on Drupal and then eventually I
wrote my own from scratch
it just kept every single year I wanted
to make it better and better the more I
learned but it was it was really like a
I liked I liked doing it and then I got
sort of tired of doing my own website
over and over again maybe like three or
four times so by that point out I
started to look for freelance clients
and then started actually really
developing my skills more and then
looking for a web development actual job
so really it was it's not what I set out
to do but it's really where I ended up
because it just was what I like to do I
found myself doing it in my free time
like I would come home from work and
work on websites so there was some point
where I just was like why don't I work
on website that worked because that's
really what I like doing so it was
really an organic process for you would
you say yeah yeah it just really sort of
just happened I suppose yeah
were there any lessons that you learned
from your journey yeah I think the
lessons that I learned mostly or just go
where your energy takes you were you
personally I found I wanted to work on
something and that led me to something
else which led me to something else but
was all driven very much by I find this
particular topic interesting so for me
you're going to learn more you're going
to learn better and you're going to
learn faster if what you're learning is
interesting to you so don't taste don't
don't waste time pursuing topics that
are just tedious to you because in the
end if you don't need a particular topic
to be a great web developer you can
always narrow your focus and be good at
really good at one particular thing
maybe CSS and HTML and some some basic
JavaScript or something but either way
you're narrowing your focus to what you
find interesting and in the end you'll
be a better developer because of it okay
so you're saying follow your passion
right and not just go for something just
because it's hot or yeah yeah I think so
yeah there's a lot of trendiness in web
development and in some of it is is fun
in some of it I mean personally I really
like a lot of the the trendy stuff but
it it's only because I like to hack away
that stuff and sort of see see how it
works and things like that but if that's
not you then then don't waste your time
trying to make that
you all right awesome okay so our next
question is from Danilo Danilo I'm sorry
if I pronounced that wrong the question
is what is your workflow like and how do
you stay productive to use any tools
that help you in this regard and he says
he often finds himself really
overwhelmed and not sure what should be
done in a particular project and ends up
losing track of what he should do or
maybe spends too much time fixing little
things that might not be a part of the
task so really how do you stay
productive and like keeping that flow
would you say yeah and this is a
question that hits close to home because
I have as you know I definitely have
this problem too I mean I end up being
pretty productive but really I can get
in these big ruts where I'm not
productive at all and I'm feeling
completely disorganized and overwhelmed
especially with larger projects for me
the best thing is to always have a list
a to-do list a list you can scratch off
of really definitive things I use the
application and the website todoist
which is a just a big list making
application it's really no different
than a lot of other checklist
applications other than it it has just a
lot of classifications and things like
that so you can really organize
everything a lot of people like to use
Trello which is did you read we maybe
use Trello a little bit yeah we moved
here yeah yeah so trouble has all these
boards where you can move tasks to
different boards and stuff and I find
that maybe more productive using that in
a work environment with others rather
than in a single like just myself when I
when I have Trello just myself I don't
use it at all
so todoist is much easier for me but
personally I find I work best on a to-do
list even like a pen and paper I usually
have a notebook I'll write today's date
on it there's a really good book that we
both listened to was it eat that frog
Brian Tracy right Brian Jessie yeah yeah
he really talks about finding this the
one thing that's the most important
thing for you to accomplish that day to
eat that frog which is this big you know
thing that you have to accomplish today
but maybe it's a very specific task
right so he talks about getting in and
just doing that first inviting the
bullet but really prioritizing what you
need to do make Sammy make something
your absolute like highest priority and
then go from there so for me I used to
do list I make a lot of lists some list
end up getting thrown away before
they're ever completed I to start each
day with making a list there's that
whole like Benjamin Franklin morning
thing where he like plans out his whole
day in the morning so a lot of that
stuff really really super helps but for
me it's just having
concrete things to do and knowing what
you can do and staying to those and
checking them off anybody who's worked
with me ever knows that I am the worst
abuser of having like thirty tabs open
as well and I'm from like my my chrome
is bad so try to stay away from that I'm
doing my best to get better at that but
it's you know that's a hard hard thing
to break really just make lists stay
focused those lists know what your
highest priorities are and in in go
forum yeah I would just say from a
psychological perspective I don't know
if anyone's tried the Pomodoro Technique
yeah there's different apps that you can
download one is I think for Android it's
like Palma Pomodori oh I don't know but
you can google that and you work for 25
minutes and stay focused and then you
take like a five-minute break and you
continue that cycle for I think three
times and then after that third time you
get a ten minute or two 15-minute break
you know to kind of do what you want
whether that's check email or grab a
snack or go to
bathroom you know whatever you need to
do but it really helps you stay in that
flow and they even have some that will
block you from being able to check on
the websites like Facebook or whatever
that is yeah so if it can really help
there's a lot of different techniques
out there if you just kind of explore
yeah I actually have an app for OSX
called focus actually on that it's not
it's not Pomodoro but if you can have it
set up to block certain applications and
websites and I have a block Facebook
reddit a whole bunch of stuff so that if
I'm really needed of a zone and I turn
that on and what it does is you go to
this website if you go to the website it
pops you up with a quote that's
basically shaming you into working yeah
yeah I found it to be really effective
because I always feel really bad when I
get that the code that's like you know
the heart and the hardest working people
or whatever you know so yeah we should
actually mention too I don't know if
this came uh I don't know if we
mentioned this earlier but Kourtney is
actually dr. talansky she's a PhD
clinical psychologist here yeah and I
work mostly with kids and teenagers but
I'm also able to give advice and do work
with adults yeah yeah ow
save the web development questions for
this guy but I can take some mental
health yeah mental health questions
right here alright let's continue on to
Sam J so Sanjay wants to know is stylist
or SAS or is it less less yeah last best
right now so what do you prefer what's
going on there yeah I mean this is a
tough question because like any of these
technologies people like to get into a
camp and like it's almost like you're on
a sports team or you're like waving your
flag like go team SAS or something like
that's a big thing and people get really
really defensive about whatever
technology they they use personally I
use stylus and all of my particular
projects it has some features that I
just like it
you know check out the the stylus
tutorials on my channel you can see just
some of these neat little extras that
don't exist in the other preprocessors
it's also JavaScript based and plays
nice with everything so I believe
Silas wins the award for most underrated
there's also a huge community and a lot
of tools for its yeah so Silas for me is
really the the most underrated and then
you have SAS which I feel at this point
is really the most likely preprocessor
that you're going to get in a job
interview or when you're looking for
work I feel like any project that I've
been on that's not using SAS IV they're
lobbied for it to use SAS because that's
what most people really know at this
point but it also has the best community
the most amount of people working in it
the best amount of tools just like
really SAS really takes the cake in
terms of top dog right now
for CSS preprocessors and for good
reason SAS is great lips s which is a
non ruby based C based version of SAS is
really nice you can use it with node
really easy with notes s so for me says
SAS wins out stylus is most underrated
it's most likely I'm going to use and
then bottom of the barrel is less less
got a little huge adoption rate early
because it was bundled into Twitter's
bootstrap okay and and that was really
like a big popular thing so a lot of
people use bootstrap and they use less
because it came with it and it was easy
to add because there was even like a
JavaScript version that compiled at
runtime and instead of a build process
so it was easier to get people into it
was just all-around easier the problem
is compared to stylus and less the
syntax is clunkier there's less features
and the community there there's just
it's not as good right
so step sass and stylists both have
better like grid frameworks and
extensions and packages like that I
would say don't learn less unless you
have to for a particular project spend
your time with sass and then if you want
to do free time stuff spend your time
with stylus cuz I think you might really
like it so they're both used for CSS
there all three of them are CSS
preprocessors
so essentially they take what you're
writing in CSS and give you additional
features that don't exist in CSS they
make your life easier it makes it faster
to write CSS
there's extensions and things like that
and they that it takes that code and
Sasser stylus or less takes that code
that you write and transforms it into
CSS that the browser can actually read
okay yeah okay so that I can understand
yeah okay next question from Jay Mac to
170 X do you see PHP 7 being competitive
in the current web development spectrum
yeah I don't think PHP is going anywhere
I mean just if you look at so many of
the most popular sites on the Internet
are built with I mean WordPress Drupal
or even Joomla they're all PHP based
there's more PHP based systems and we
can really like put to end at any point
it would it's gonna take a long time
before PHP isn't is not like the major
language for server-side on the web
really I mean and now you have laravel
which is taken hold their votes really
super cool there's a lot of just other
frameworks either way PHP has such like
a hold on the web in general that I feel
like PHP 7 being even you know it's new
version new features stuff like that but
even though it's you know something that
people are going to have to implement in
their their workflows and learn
I don't think PHP is going anywhere so I
think learning PHP 7 is definitely a
good idea especially if you want to stay
current so people want to use whatever
whatever's trendy they want to use node
they want to use elixir they want to use
Ruby they want to use Python
pythons not trying to eat neither is
Ruby really at this point but they want
to use these things but at the end of
the day PHP is so ingrained into how the
web is right now I just don't think it's
going anywhere anytime soon yes you
think
it's a still a solid standard for
everyone yeah I think it's it's a it's a
definitely something that you should at
least have a good understanding of I'm
not saying you have to learn how to
write an app from scratch in PHP I
certainly don't and and haven't I mean I
have the long time ago but I haven't I
haven't really dove into PHP that much
but let's say I'm working on a wordpress
site or something and I need to make
some modifications to the loop do I know
how to write the PHP to do that
certainly yeah so I think it's a a good
thing to have PHP in your in your tool
belt and learning the new features and
PHP 7 is definitely something that you
should be doing all right sounds good
j-mac I hope that helps cool so that was
a good amount of questions well we have
a bunch more a bunch more here so we're
gonna take another video and we'll catch
you in part two where we finish
answering the rest of the questions
so we'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
