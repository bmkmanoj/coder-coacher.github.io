of Tut's and today we're going to be
creating an explaining bundled products
and now bundled products we haven't gone
over them yet in fact they're really
quite useful however they're only useful
for the right type of product so I'm
sure many of you are familiar with going
to buy a computer perhaps you're on
Apple or Dell or whoever's website and
you select your computer and it's the
base model and that's the computer
itself and then it allows you to
configure components and you can say add
this processor for two hundred dollars
more add four more gigabytes of RAM for
a few hundred dollars more whatever so
that is what you would use this bundled
product for now the bundled product is a
whole bunch of products that you would
only buy together and you can upgrade or
change or whatever so using that
computer example I'm going to be using
the sample data and I'm going to create
a simple bundled product and we're going
to enable that and see exactly that
process so keep in mind that a bundled
product just like a configurable product
just like a grouped product uses simple
products to fill it out so let's go
ahead and we're going to create a a
bundled product and we're actually going
to use simple products that already
exist within the sample data so keep in
mind that that step of the process
you're just going to be creating a whole
bunch of simple products with their SKUs
their price whatever like normal and
then we're going to come to catalog
manage products and then we're going to
add a new product and so from here we're
going to just select a default attribute
set and we're going to go down here and
select bundle product continue and let's
just call this level up computer
and the skew is going to be dynamic and
this is just going to be the first half
of the skew the weight is going to be
dynamic so this is um you know you could
say that no matter what the whole
package is going to be a hundred pounds
or you could say it's dynamic and it's
generated by the individual components
and the skew itself this is just like a
prefix so the other parts of the skewer
added to that we're actually just going
to keep this simple for the weight and
just say it's 100 fixed and then it's
going to be enabled of course and that
should be good here and text class is
set to none because I guess that's due
with the individual products associated
and now we just want this available in
catalog good search now let's add our
pricing and of course it's going to be
dynamic so we're not going to add
anything here and we're going to see
that price add up as we add our
components our meta information here is
this going to be our normal meta
information our image we could use any
image if you want I don't have an image
ready for this I'm not going to bother
it that's not the most important part of
this so description we can just put some
filler text in here I'm going to use the
same text as I use for the last video
which talks about blooming tea blooms
but again it's not important it's to
fill up the space for this video now
design of course we're not having
anything for design like usual no gift
options and we're going to say this is
in stock and now you keep in mind that
the individual components also have to
have their stock set up correctly we
want this to be available on the main
website for categories electronics and
then we're going to put this into
computers and we'll put this into build
your own and now let's go to related
products we're not going to have any
custom options we're not going to have
any in fact a bundle with dynamic
pricing cannot include product options
so don't even worry about those what the
big thing here is this bundled items in
this screen is going to be like
something I mean it looks the same as
their product screens but it's going to
be something truly unique to bundle
products so you can ship bundled items
separately or together since this is a
computer it's going to be built and then
shipped together so we'll leave this is
together and let's add a new option so
this is going to say what what items you
know are you going to select since this
is a computer we want to say maybe
processor and then now we can have it be
a radio buttons a checkbox multiple
select I think a radio buttons makes
sense for this and we can say absolutely
this is required and the position is
going to be zero because we want this to
be the very first option they select now
when you click this ad you now bring up
this familiar sort of way to look for
products and you can come down here and
look at specific attribute sets so we
know we're looking for a CPU if we look
at that click search it's going to give
us all of our available CPUs now of
course I don't really know which ones
are going to be compatible with what but
I'm just going to click this checkbox
and it's going to add all four of these
as an option to our computer ok awesome
that's great so we now have four CPUs
available to our bundled product let's
actually click Save and continue
of course one two three is not a unique
SKU that's my fault for always using the
same SKUs ok our product is saved even
though we just have four different
product or four different items to
select as radio buttons let's see it in
action to sort of see what's going on
it's going to computers build your own
and now we're going to look for the
level up computer and if we come to our
build your own computers you'll see it
didn't show up ok so this is a very
important piece after you add your
products you need to actually click this
button
let's so let's come back to here too
bundled items that's how we come back to
here we have nothing
I thought we selected something well
after you come here select your CPU we
search we click this check box you then
need to click this Add selected products
to option without clicking this button
nothing's going to get added you're not
going to see anything your products not
going to show up so let's click that and
now you'll get this other information
you'll not only see default quantities
user-defined quantity yes we won't
actually sell this to notice they can
have more than one processor in this and
then you could rank them in different
positions so let's go ahead and do that
just for fun we'll have these out of
order and this this one can be the
default option now let's of course save
and continue now and if we refresh our
products page we're going to see our
computer here level up computer and
notice how we have this from 98 99 to
2000 dollars and this is because the
cheapest right now that you can get away
with this computer for is 98 99 and the
most expensive is 2049 and this is
something that comes with the bundled
product simply by just create a bundled
product as long as your theme supports
this you're going to see this from into
and now let's click this and you can see
we have our product information just
like normal but now we have our
processor and it's a radio button and it
says okay if we want this intel core 1
it's going to be too grand if we want
this one's going to be 98 dollars and we
can only select one processor here here
is our total prices configured and it's
just like buying a computer so let's
continue to add parts to our computer so
let's click add new option it notice how
it creates another option if we want
this to be the second thing they select
we're going to put one for weight and we
can actually make this
a drop down just so you can see some of
the different options and I probably
would use I'll probably use radio
buttons again if you notice you go to
like apples I think it's all radio
buttons and we're going to click RAM we
want a memory here and now let's click
search again and we can add our various
RAM options click Add to select add
selected products to option and we want
them to be able to define their quantity
so we can say they can add more than two
gigs of RAM if they want and that's cool
okay and let's add another new option
and it's what's going to be our drive
space so we can say let's say what hard
drive they want and for this option just
to show you some of the other ones we
can have check boxes because hard drives
and computers you can probably have more
than one let's say that I mean this is a
desktop computer right you could have
more than one hard drive and we'll give
them all options here that way you know
if you have multiple hard drives in your
computer that's always you know cool so
we could say they could have default
quantity of one and let's say the one
terabyte option is the default okay so I
think we have enough here that you get
the idea let's save this product and
let's check it out on our front end of
our site and just like any other
experience when you're purchasing a
computer isn't like that you could say
ok I want the highest end processor for
memory I guess I want to gigs of RAM
even though it's not that much and I
want a one Western Digital hard drive I
also want a 500 gigabyte Western Digital
hard drive - I want both of these in
fact if you wanted to be able to have an
adjustable quantity like you need these
fields you'd probably do something like
a radio buttons with a quantity that way
there'd have to get
hard drive this this checkbox is just a
little bit different okay
so let's add to cart and let's see what
happens instead of adding each
individual product to the cart like we
saw with the grouped product we have
this level up computer as one product
the complete total price and the
contents of our product in here keep in
mind every single one of these is a
simple product itself but bundled
together in this bundled product so
that's how you create bundled products
in Magento it's really flexible you can
do all sorts of stuff with it and I
invite you to see other uses other than
just maybe building a computer what you
can do with this so as always this is
