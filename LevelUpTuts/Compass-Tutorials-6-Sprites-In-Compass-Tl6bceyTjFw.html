up Tut's continue we're going to be
going over sprites within compass and if
you're not familiar with sprites I
suggest you do a little bit of reading
first because I'm not going to go over
all the basics but really it's going to
take it you'd be used in a situation
where you have images like this let's
say there's four images here you would
use a sprite to load one image instead
of however many you have in this case
would be four and then you would just
use CSS to show and hide the relevant
parts of the image so right now we just
have these four images and what's great
about compass is you can give it a bunch
of images in a folder and then compass
will automatically generate that sprite
for you so this is really powerful
because you know sometimes creating a
sprite and then having to grab its
background position everything takes a
lot of time and this pretty much takes
no time in comparison so it's really
exciting in the last lesson we made sure
that your config RB file was pointed to
your images folder and if you browse
here let's see we see in my images
folder we have our icons so what the
first thing you want to do is you want
to put them in a folder when you're
putting them in a folder I'm just going
to call it social you name it something
relevant to what the sprite is going to
be okay and in the meantime I'm actually
going to comment out this code here
because we're not going to use it ok you
can see our images have gone away okay
so our images are now living in this
social folder so the easiest way to use
sprites with compass is is actually
really easy so we're going to do at
import and then we're going to say the
location to where that social folder is
but you don't need to say image because
it's already looking in your images
folder so you just have to say social or
whatever the title of your sprite folder
is and then slash in the near going to
star and then that PNG and so this
signifies that it's going to look for
all of the files
in social that are of the same so
transparent PNG files so that is what's
going to build your sprite if you we
save this out you'll notice in your CSS
nothing's changed because we're not
doing anything yet except for saying hey
look in social for these files but if we
go to our finder you'll notice that a
sprite has been generated for us already
it's that easy and so from here let's
say you know that's all you wanted to do
you could rename this file and then just
use sprites as normal
however compass makes it super easy to
do way more than that
so in the most basic implementation
let's just do @include and then we're
going to say all slash and then whatever
your folder is social slash or - sprites
and then we're going to finish it off
with a colon or semicolon we'll hit save
and now let's check out our CSS and this
is pretty amazing
ok so what it's done is it says ok
social sprite social Facebook social RSS
social Twitter social YouTube it's grab
these from the image name and it's
saying use this background image and
then it's now giving us classes social
Facebook background image of this
position so if we go into our HTML and
we actually just add social - save
should refresh and there's our images if
we inspect this you can see it is using
let's see yet we're in it is using the
sprite and then doing all of the
background position and everything
calculation for us this is extremely
easy this this took me absolutely no
time and two lines of code to generate
all of the CSS sprites I mean that
that's just pretty staggering it's
awesome so let's say you didn't you know
you don't want to rename these all
whatever social so
let's say L so you want to have more
control so it's refresh okay they're
gone so let's get rid of this line and
let's say you just want to call the
Twitter one and so like before we
already have a class called deaf Twitter
so let's where they have a class called
Twitter so let's do dot Twitter and then
inside of your declaration here we're
going to give brackets and we're going
to say act include and this is the part
where it's awesome
we can just say social slash or - sprite
and then we're going to do parentheses
and then just the name of the file so
we're just going to say Twitter okay and
then we finish the life of the semicolon
we'll save it and let's check out what
our CSS says so our CSS is grabbing this
we refresh and it's the Twitter icon
it's absolutely perfect it's still
loading the social sprite and then just
giving us just the Twitter likewise if
we wanted to Facebook see and again it's
at include social sprite Facebook okay
semicolon save refresh there's your
Facebook is awesome if you notice about
this of this this social is the name of
our folder if we changed our folder this
would also be changed so just like in
the other example where we did the all
social sprite that social comes from the
folder you change your folder you change
this so as you can see from this basic
example sprites with compass is
effortless I mean that's just really how
it is it's just as easy as it gets and
that's all you really need to implement
this of course there's some more
features and they make it much more
flexible in case you need that
flexibility and you need to adjust them
so in the next lesson we're going to be
going over some of the flexible options
within sprites for compass if you have
any questions or comments as always feel
free to
comment on our page hit us up at Twitter
and level up HUDs or shoot me an email
it's Scott at level up Tut's calm you
know let me know you think okay once
again thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
