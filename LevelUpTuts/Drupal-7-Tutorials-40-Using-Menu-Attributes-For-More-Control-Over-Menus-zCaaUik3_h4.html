up Tut's and today I'm going to be
showing you this module called menu
attributes and I don't know if you've
had enough experience with Drupal yet or
you've been playing around with Drupal
and you may have noticed that when
creating menus in Drupal's interface you
don't get a whole lot of options and
it's really unfortunate that they're not
there by default I mean it seems to me
like that should be pretty easy to be
able to select the class just you know
add a class or the target by default in
Drupal
however it's not luckily there's this a
module called menu attributes so if you
want to go to this page drupal.org slash
project slash menu underscore attributes
or you can just search for menu
attributes and Google or Drupal search
bar you can find this go ahead and grab
and install this menu this module okay
so I'm just gonna click here to download
it we're gonna install it just like last
time
and every time actually so so I'm just
going to drag this into my modules
folder refresh my modules page and then
I'm gonna search for it and I don't know
if you caught the last tutorial however
if you were menu or if your modules
screen does not look like this it's
because I'm using a module called mini
our module filter and it really allows
you to sort through search through your
modules nice and easily it's really
great nice a module that I've grown very
fond of in the past couple of weeks here
so I'll click menu attributes and we're
going to save this and this is instantly
going to give you a whole bunch of
options in your menu screen so we're
going to go to structure and then menus
and then we'll just look at our main
menu because that's you know the the
most important one and let's just take a
look at a particular link here let's go
to projects we'll click Edit here okay
so now if you'll notice there's this
drop down under here the didn't used to
be here and this is menu item attributes
cool okay so this allows you to specify
a title and ID a name relationship
classes style although you'd probably
just want to add a class to it and then
you can have it at Target you can give
it in a new window same window parent
window all that cool stuff and you can
even give it an access key which is a
keyboard shortcut that uses to access
this link so it's pretty cool and then
you attributes it does all sorts of
great stuff here in fact I mean I
personally think the sort of the sort of
use should be built in by default
however you know what can you do that's
why there's menu attributes so if you
want to soup up your menus install menu
attributes then you have access to
classes relationships all this great
stuff and it's easy as you know adding a
class of projects will just do those
projects and we'll click Save okay and
now let's exit out of here and let's
look at this inspect it okay and as you
can see it's given the the anchor tag a
class of projects and if we go to the
any of these other ones you can see this
about has a title of about me but that's
just sort of Drupal is doing and no
class so if we wanted to style this
projects link in particular we wouldn't
necessarily have a way of doing
experiment became off of this list item
but let's say you needed to add a class
or at a target this is how you do it
it's a lot easier than you know going
into core and writing the PHP yourself
so menu attributes that's it nice and
easy
not too much here if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment on
the video hit us up at Twitter or
