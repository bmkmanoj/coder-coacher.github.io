of tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be talking about one of the main
concepts in view which is going to be
directives now if you're coming from
angular land a lot of this is going to
feel a little bit familiar we're gonna
be talking about some of the default
directives that come in view and how to
use them so let's get started right now
okay so in the last video I hinted at
that we're going to be talking about
some different things in the templating
language in this video now what we're
gonna be talking about is something
called directives now if you've used
angular before this is all going to seem
like old information however if you
haven't used anything like that before
the word directives can be kind of scary
it's kind of a long name it doesn't
exactly say what it does explicitly but
really what a directive is is a
attribute on an HTML element that
modifies your code in some sort of way
if we wanted to do an if statement you
would primarily do these things through
directives now another type of directive
is something that would bind a value
into an HTML property and another one
would be something like a user event
such as a click function so let's talk a
little bit about the syntax the first
thing we're gonna do is have eight new
div in this div I'm going to go ahead
and just put our hello world in there
we'll leave this Scott says out of here
just so we can have some things in and
out of this div it doesn't really matter
what's in here and what's out of here
but you can see here we have this div
app and we have another div inside of
here now we can use a directive called
if now in view all of your directness
need to be prefixed with a V and a
hyphen
now this is to let view know that what
you're about to do is well managed by
view and we have several different
directives well the one we wanted to
talk about first was if so V - if now
inside of here it accepts simply a
string now most of the things you're
going to be doing inside of these
directives are strings so get used to
having
like JavaScript variables in a string
you're not going to be using these
template tags in here like you do in
react now if we have V - if that we can
now have our property you remember we
had our is true property so we could do
V if is true you can see because is true
is set to false
this entire div is not rendering this is
very different than some other types of
if statements you might be used to in
other languages maybe JavaScript or in
PHP or any other templating language
where you're physically wrapping your
code in and if and here we're saying hey
only show this div and its contents if
this property evaluates to true and we
were to change this to true down here or
we would once again see our hello world
that pop-up okay so this is a very basic
directive we have V if now there's a
whole lot more to conditionals and then
just V if and that something will be
going over at in later time when it's
actually useful to us now in addition to
things like V if we can also bind HTML
properties now another one of these
directives that you're going to be using
a lot is bind now let's go ahead and add
a button for bind here and we can say
press me okay now press me is going to
look like a standard button which you
can press now what happens if we wanted
to have the disabled state of this
button be rigged up to some of our data
now you might think we would do
something like well disabled right so
maybe V - disabled is equal to and then
maybe is true this is not the way to do
it this is not going to work right you
can't just prefix V to anything there
has to be V a specific directive so in
this case what we want to do is actually
tap in to an attribute that exists in
HTML already and to do that we want to
use the directive of V - bind and with V
bind you actually need to give this an
argument
so what are we binding it is going to be
a colon and then the property or the
attribute we're binding so
in this case we want to bind to disabled
okay now it's actually going to use the
is true status to look at this and say
hey the HTML property of disabled is now
set to the variable is true you can see
our button is no longer enabled again
it's sort of weird writing JavaScript
variables as strings in properties on
our items especially if you're coming
from other front-end frameworks but
that's how it is and if you're used to
that and angular then you should be used
to it in view so V bind is another one
you're going to be using a lot of times
and we don't just bind things if we want
to attach to HTML properties and we'll
go over that more now another common
directive is something called the on so
if we do V on we also need an argument
and this is going to be something like
on click or these are going to be sort
of user events like you're used to so if
we wanted to do an unclick we would do V
- on click is going to be equal to and
then we would need to pass in the name
of a method that we want to run now we
have not defined any methods in our app
so obviously we can't do anything with
that just yet but right now you can see
how these directives work and as we go
we're gonna be talking more and more and
more about different types of directives
from the for to do for loops V if all
that stuff that goes along with that
different types and reasons why you
might bind something in different types
of events and modifier surrounding that
so as you can see here we have some very
basic code we're using some new
directives such as V if to show in hide
bits of our code or binding our
variables to various properties in our
HTML and all along this is getting a
little bit dynamic so in the next video
what I want to do is have you write your
first method and that we're going to
then use that method inside of this
button here we're going to click it and
have it do something giving us our first
little bit of interaction from there
we're going to dive into handling user
inputs and then we're going to dive into
the view CLI we're gonna get up and
going with a
real project and you're going to start
to understand some of the finer points
of views component based workflow
component based structure and all of the
cool stuff surrounding that so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
