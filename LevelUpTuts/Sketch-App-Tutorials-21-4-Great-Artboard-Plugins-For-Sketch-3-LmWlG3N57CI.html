up tutorials and today I'm going to show
you some of my favorite sketch plug-ins
for working with artboards they're going
to allow you to quickly arrange our
boards and even a lot more so let's get
going on that as I show you some my
favorite plugins for artboards with
sketch 3 so to get started we're going
to head to our sketch tool box which is
where we've been going to get our
plugins and the way we're what I want to
grab our plugins is simply by typing an
artboard up top and the search because
all of these plugins are going to have
to do with artboards now let's scroll
down just a little bit the employments
we're going to want to grab are going to
be let's see we have cover artboard
which it basically allows us to resize a
layer and have it cover the entire
artboard which is something I find
myself sort of doing by hand with values
a surprising amount now if we scroll
down we can find some other ones like
artboard zoom which is one that we're
going to want to grab okay and let's
keep going down here and we'll have
sketch arrange artboards which is
another favorite of mine and let's grab
the last one which is going to just be
sketch artboard right here let's click
install on that so to recap we have
cover artboard sketch arrange artboards
sketch artboard and artboard zoom so
let's actually head to a document here I
really just have some different layouts
here this is the template for mobile and
actually let's just throw sort of
different rectangles in here so it's
immediately identifiable which box were
in just so it's it's not all looking at
a a white thing with them so it's just
not looking at like a white box with
nothing in it
okay so here we have we have our four
different sort of artboards here so
let's say we're in this outside view the
sort of macro view of a project here and
we want to zoom in completely on this
artboard well using the artboards zoom
plugin that we just downloaded what we
want to do is make sure we have
of our artboard selected so you can tell
the selected there's an outline around
the whole thing
and even here in the left column it's
highlighted saying desktop HD now what
we can do is do command 4 and with this
plugin you're immediately snapped to
having a totally full width version of
this taking up your viewport so it's
100% it's not getting cropped off or
anything like that so that's awesome I
use this all the time now let's say you
want to immediately jump to the artboard
directly next to this one now we can
hold shift command and hit period and
it's going to jump to the next artboard
we do it once more it's going to jump to
the next one once more it's going to
jump to the next one you'll notice
there's some weird stuff going on here
if you get to an artboard and it's not
sized up correctly you can always say
command 4 and it's going to zoom you up
correctly so now that again is shift
command and now a get hit comma and go
backwards okay and just like that we're
traversing through our artboards without
having to use our mouse hold down shift
and maybe grab here or use your trackpad
and slide you around it's a really nice
way to take it around your sketch file
and you'll notice that a message pops up
saying that for best results you can
disable automatic zooming so if you come
to your sketch preferences you'll notice
that there's this animate zoom so if we
uncheck animate zoom now if we come back
to our document when do command shift
period it's going to jump us the next
one jump us back and forth here and now
it's a quick and nice little jump we
don't have any sort of weird animating
and you can click command 4 and size up
whatever you're working on to be the
height that you need it to be taking up
your fold height and then you can hit
command 4 to take up your whole height
to make sure you're on the right
artboard okay so that's two really easy
ways to traverse your document without
having to do a whole lot with your mouse
click and point find something typically
when you get better with keyboard
commands and you you build your arsenal
that way
can work with an application not much
better so let's check out the other art
board plugins that we've downloaded now
let's go ahead and select this square
that we have inside of this artboard
here I'm going to zoom out just a hair
so we can see the entire tablet artboard
now what I want to do is hit ctrl F so
ctrl F with the background cover plug-in
that we installed is going to take any
given layer and make it fill the
dimensions of your artboard exactly and
that's really useful if you're doing
background colors or anything like that
I've received comps from designers
before that have a square going off the
artboard in all sorts of ways and then
when you try to do exporting or they're
clicking around things you may not the
document may not react the way you
expect it it's just sort of sloppy so if
we select any given rectangle whether
it's to small to large control 11 sizes
it to the size of the air board just
like that
cool so I use that all the time
especially when you're doing background
colors or anything like that so the last
artboard plugin i'm going to cover here
is going to be the artboard arrange
let's say you're creating a bunch of
artboards I'm going to create a couple
more just like here and here now we sort
of don't want these all to be in
no-man's land here we have sort of a
nice system going how can we get these
in a nice ordered manner well with this
plugin we installed we can come to
plugins and arrange artboards is just an
option here if we select this it's going
to ask you how many rows you want them
in I'll for now say 1 we could do two in
a moment and now you can see it's line
them up it's maintained order of our
other ones but it's just added these two
new ones that we created into the row ok
now again we can select the arrange
artboards from plugins and let's do
arrange artboards again but this time
let's say let's put them in 3 3 rows and
as you can see we now have three rows of
evenly spaced
ranged our boards and this is super easy
to get around with again I've had a lot
of comps given to me as a developer and
I see maybe our boards all over the
place and not lined up sort of just not
in a good situation so this is just
something that adds a little bit of
professionalism to your sketch documents
that way if you're handing it off to
anybody else or even if you're browsing
yourself later it's just a bit more
organized now unfortunately with this
arranged artboards I wasn't able to find
a way for only to affect certain
artboard so it's going to take all of
the artboards on a given page that
you're working on and it's going to
arrange them so keep that in mind when
you're using arrange our boards to
arrange your stuff but usually when I'm
working on a page of stuff I kind of
want everything to be together and if
things need to be separated I will move
it to another page on my sketch file
cool so I hope you found these four
artboard plugins really super useful I
use all of them all the time pretty much
any time I'm working as sketch I find
one of these come in handy especially
the zoom fullscreen that's command 4 so
check it out let me know what you think
let me know if you have any artboard
plugins that you like that I didn't
cover here as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials thanks for watching
and we'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
