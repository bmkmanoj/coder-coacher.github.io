I want to take a quick video to do in
between this and the next one because
it's important it's important to get to
the stuff kind of early a couple of
things here we're doing this static site
generation and we've use the command to
develop which we simply gets be
developed which starts up a server at
port 8000 for us and everything's all in
good but at the end of the day this
thing is a static site generator and how
can we actually take advantage of it and
generating a static site for instance
right now all we're doing is simply with
our develop command is having it run a
server that's compiling a web pack the
web pack server for us so like what do
we do to actually spit this thing out a
real web site well now the first one can
simply just be gets P and then we can do
build now what this is going to be doing
for us is it's going to be compiling our
site and generating out a whole bunch of
HTML files as well as JavaScript files
now the cool thing is here is that this
site will function just like any HTML
site so if we wanted to just simply open
this HTML file up in our browser as long
as the paths and stuff are set correctly
it's gonna find everything now the
important thing about that is that you
can literally just throw this site onto
your server anywhere right and this
thing could live on a GoDaddy basic
shared host if you wanted to see we
could go absolutely anywhere including
like github pages or an Amazon bucket or
something like that I mean the cool part
here is just by running this build
command we now have a folder which well
the folder existed before but the
folders now been populated or at least
up-to-date with all of our stuff so that
folder is the public folder you can see
right here let me bump up the size of my
editor so you can get a little bit
better vision here but we get here as we
get everything we get our pages we even
get a 404 page we get our index.html
which you can see loads up our script
and everything like that and even minify
is everything for us and if we scroll
over it let's keep scrolling over this
is kind of a pain but to demonstrate my
point here
let me just go to the end of this thing
okay you can see that we actually have
our real HTML that's been rendered into
an HTML page you can see the div second
blog post whatever so in addition to
just getting us all all of our
JavaScript that's going to load as we
need it it's also just giving a
straight-up HTML files which are gonna
be good for SEO it's gonna be good for
performance I mean this thing's gonna
load fast because what's faster than
just a straight-up HTML file right now
obviously it's going to then load up the
JavaScript and inject react and have
this thing totally dynamic so on first
load write if we were to do on first
load it's gonna be loading up that HTML
page but then on page changes and stuff
like that it's gonna be all JavaScript
so you're still gonna get taken
advantage of that really great features
of building and react in the first place
okay so in addition to this gatsby build
which generates the public folder like I
said you can just go and drop this
public folder anywhere and that's your
site right there that's all you need you
can even get an old-school with it and
just go and drag and drop it via FTP up
to a server somewhere and a ok nothing
no problems with that
now another command that we can run here
is to see our site in more of a
production mode so let's go ahead and
run this
now this next command we're gonna want
to run is Gatsby and then serve now this
is going to fire this thing up on in
production ok and as you can see I'm
getting this deprecation warning and
might be coming with a just version
change maybe I need to bump some
versions here or something up as you can
see it's listing ahead to port 9000
instead of 8,000 and right here is our
Gatsby site now if we view source on
this page you're gonna see something
maybe a little bit different I'm not I'm
not a hundred percent positive done this
but I believe that when you're viewing
source on the develop version you were
just getting straight JavaScript and
here we're getting all of our HTML
output as if it were the actual static
site in fact this Gatsby surf command is
loading up our actual built site and not
the development site right so this is a
great way that after you build your site
you could come in here and just say hey
this working looks like it awesome cool
so these are just two commands I thought
we should get out of the way before I
take it into any further as we start to
build more of our data out so this is
how you can build your site and how you
can test your build site using gatsby
build or gatsby serve two things you're
gonna want to know to do when you are
getting ready to wrap up production on
your site or even just push up a version
somewhere so this is building your a
static site in Gatsby as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials in the
next video were to get back to it by
adding some more information to a
frontmatter and then doing a little bit
more graph QL stuff so thanks so much
for watching and I'll see in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
