up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be introducing a graph cool what
it means for us in this overall stack of
things we're working with and we're
gonna be talking about graph QL overall
and how we're going to be using it over
the course of this app so let's get
going on that right now okay so in the
last video we talked quite a bit about
of getting set up with our navigation
and now that we have our navigation set
up well it's time to start thinking
about our API which is gonna be one of
the cooler most interesting aspects of
this entire series because in addition
to having a fully functional app we want
to save and add data into it and one of
the greatest ways to do that is using
graph QL now one of the cool things
about graph QL is that there's a new
service called graph dot cool now graph
cool is basically your entire back-end
you can think of it as a system like
content folder one of these CMS as a
service types of sites where you don't
have to worry about managing a database
and you don't have to worry about really
anything but connecting to their
endpoint and in my opinion this
framework or graft are cool is just
extremely exciting now if you're
concerned about while hosting your stuff
on other people's servers or you want
more control well luckily for you
there's this introducing Prisma which
really just came out a couple of days
ago january 16th as it is so as I'm
recording this yeah it definitely just
came out well what is Prisma it's the
open source graph QL API layer for your
database aka you can use Prisma to
basically use an open sourced version of
graph cool so if you're one of those
people who likes to use all open source
stuff there's a Prisma here for you
since that's not going to be the focus
of this course I want to actually go
ahead and use the hosted version of
graph cool which let me tell you is
excellent so to do so we're going to
click open Council and from here it's
going to ask you to login
I'm just going to log in with my github
profile you can certainly create a new
email or any of that stuff if you'd like
and from here it's going to take you to
your council now I have an example
project here already but what we want to
do is click this drop down arrow in the
top left here where it says example
project click a plus button and we're
gonna create a new project and you can
choose the region of your where your
database is essentially going to be
stored and we can just change this name
to Journal now there are probably are a
lot of questions about this graph cool
service right it's a database so well
what kind of database is it and
according to their documentation at
sequel based and if you use your own
hosted version of this you can sort of
use whatever kind of database you'd like
but one of the coolest things about
graph cool is you don't never have to
think about your database I mean you
almost think about this as your database
so let's get into this interface a
little bit in this introduction to graph
cool so what we have here when we load
it up is our schema page and now here is
going to be these schemas for all of our
data for instance they give you a basic
file and a basic user now this user ones
certainly going to come in handy when we
want to do our authentication and over
here on the right side you're going to
see a graphical and when I say graphical
I just mean like using graphics a user
interface version of your schemas here
so this is the actual graph QL syntax
version of your schema and this is sort
of just a CMS style version of your
schema now I'll be going into quite a
bit about some of these syntax and what
everything means here so don't worry if
you aren't familiar with graph QL it has
its own language right so this graph QL
schema language is its own thing but
it's highly reminiscent of JavaScript
didn't the main differences are our that
well we have what could be considered
JavaScript objects here but there's no
commas so each line you don't have a
comma
we're also defining things as types you
could also define things as queries and
mutations a query being something where
you pull from the database a mutation
being something where you modify
something in the database and what's
cool about Graf cool is that we can come
in here and if you know graph QL you can
just start typing type post is at model
you can start typing this and write your
schema this way or if you don't know
graph QL you can do it via the interface
and haven't build it for you and while
you're doing that get a total
understanding of exactly the syntax and
how things should look so what other
things are in graph cool here well we
have a data page where you can add data
in here and we're going to be using this
after we create our schema here in a
second and you can actually come in here
and add a user you could add a post or a
file or anything in a graphic interface
that well allows you to have this
function a little bit more like a CMS
it's pretty cool now next we have
permissions and this is going to be
where you set your permissions for your
different schemas and your data right
right now everyone can read create
update and delete users as well as
everyone can read create and update
these files as we get in here we're
going to be tweaking these significantly
okay now next we have integrations which
you can see I'll go Lea just like a
hosted search API of an auth integration
on 0 integration and we have email
password off and not amis off so we're
going to be using some of these too you
can see there's more to come this is
still a new service now lastly we have
functions and if you're wondering about
functions well you can see that these
are sort of server-side serverless
functions that you were going to be
using we might not be getting into these
too much in this series lastly we have
our playground which if you are familiar
with graph QL is similar to a graphical
sort of a query builder where we can
test out our queries and
with a basic auto-completion look what
we on to search for if we want to search
for all of the users and then maybe give
me their IDs we can hit play and see
this information now obviously this
query is going to fail and it's going to
give you a nice little message saying
hey none of the arguments are provided
AKA we wanted a user but we didn't give
it an ID if we were to do something like
all users which is brilliant that this
autocompletes this for us we do all
users and you could see we are returned
with an empty array because there is no
users okay so with that basic
introduction to graph cool here let's go
ahead and get started writing our first
model here and we're going to be doing
this through the GUI just so you can get
a feel for the lay of the land here if
you know your graph QL you can certainly
do it through the typing as well I'm
gonna click Add type here and the new
type is going to be a post which we've
already decided as the word we're using
for this journal post if you are using
something else that's great you can add
a description if you want journal post
it doesn't really much matter I've never
used these descriptions for anything
important and I can just simply click
Save now we can click add field and that
we want to have a new field which is
simply just going to be a title ok this
is going to be our journal title like
the individual post title now we're
going to need to select what type of
value it is it's a string it doesn't
need to store multiple values right so
it's not going to be an array and well
we don't necessarily need a description
if you want some Advanced Options there
in here whether or not this is a
required or optional field this field is
going to be required we can always tweak
this stuff directly in the graph QL
schema itself so just with that we have
a title it's going to be a string and
hey well this a button is now grayed out
ok this is going to be a common thing
here if you're if you have something
wrong and this now is immediately
obvious but if you do attempt to
the button whatever is the problem will
be highlighted I just want to make this
obvious here you do need your fields to
be lowercase okay
so you can see now we have a green
button and it's all good so we have a
post ID and a post title now this may
seem ridiculous but this is all we're
going to leave it at for right now
because what I want to do is I want to
sort of get this information in here and
I want to be able to hit our API with it
I want to set up our Apollo on our
actual application and then we can see
some data coming in before we get any
more complex with it so why complicate
things any more than we need to other
than having an ID and a title right now
so check it out we now have our schema
in here we have the ability to start
adding and querying on some data I
mentioned in the playground that we
could have auto completion on our
queries and we're going to get to see a
little bit of the power of graph cool
here you'll remember the schema that we
created was post and if I just start to
type P you can see graph QL is
automatically created two queries for us
now in a typical graph QL or Apollo
setup if you were controlling the server
side party you would have to be creating
all of your queries and stuff yourself
but graph cool does this all for you
which is incredible so now we can see
that we can get an individual post
that's going to be looking for an ID or
we can get all of our posts and we can
look for the title like this now let me
bump up the font size here I wish this
was an easier way to do this and the UI
here but the syntax that we're working
with is open brackets like I mentioned
before the word all posts then brackets
and then the field that we want to grab
now if this is not familiar to you and
you are not using graph QL for anything
else
this may seem super weird and I
apologize if I breezed over it for a
second ago while I just type this in
here but we are going to be writing a
lot more queries and I will be going
pretty in-depth when it actually
matters okay so as you can see here
where we we're asking for all posts
title and it's saying hey here's your
data and here's all of your posts which
we have none so what we're gonna be
doing in the next video is actually
installing Apollo and getting it
connected to graff cool and getting our
app up and running that way okay and
after that we're going to add some
database in here and we're actually
gonna see some posts in our application
so before you know it we're gonna have
some data coming in directly from our
API into our native app and sooner or
later we're going to be having the same
thing going on where we can add our own
posts so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorial saying that if you
have any questions or comments leave
them in the video below if you'd like to
complete this series head on over to
level up tutorials comm and where there
are a ton of new series a new series
every single month and what's gonna be
great is there's gonna be a ton of graph
QL content both within react native
react and all sorts of other ways so if
you are interested in graph QL like I am
there's gonna be a ton more graph QL
content on the level up tutorial site
this year if you aren't interested in
graph QL that's cool too because if you
become a level of pro you can actually
vote on what up and coming series are
going to be the next Pro premium series
so as always the Scott thank you so much
for watching and I would really
appreciate it if you would support level
up tutorials by becoming a pro
subscriber or purchasing some of the
series I have available thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you in
