up tuts
and today we're gonna be doing more with
sprites using compass so if you're
caught last time we created this
vertical social sprite out of icons that
we had in this social folder and you may
have thought while it was super easy it
was really cool but you know this
doesn't this sprite that doesn't
necessarily cover all use cases you know
what what if you wanted it horizontal
what if you wanted spacing in between
them what if you wanted you know hover
States and stuff like that well we're
gonna go over all that right now
and so first off I'm gonna show you
spacing cuz it's super easy so let's say
you know this default spacing that's in
between those wasn't enough let's say
you want like 20 pixels in between well
luckily you know compass makes it really
easy for us and is pretty much
everything so we're gonna do it's a
dollar sign and then it's going to be
whatever your maps name is and our in
this case ours is social so it's gonna
be social and I'm gonna do - and then
the word spacing and then if we said and
then that's a colon a semicolon so then
if we set this what this is is a
variable if we set this variable to be
20 pixels it's going to make the padding
or the spacing between all of our images
20 pixels so let's save this and see how
it changes our sprite if you notice it's
generating here right in front of our
eyes and here's 20 pixels in between
each image that's awesome
if you wanted more control over this
let's say you don't want 20 pixels in
between all of them but for some reason
one of your images needs a little bit
more padding around it a little bit more
spacing so we can say social and then
whatever the name of that images let's
use Facebook as an example so do
Facebook - so now says dollar sign
social - our image name - spacing : and
then our value than 20 and then
semicolon
so we saved this and now Facebook should
be the only one with 20 pixels spacing
around it so that's pretty fine control
/ the spacing there I would check out on
compass - style org there's all sorts of
other options for the sprite maps they
all follow this pattern so the name of
your map and then the and then the
option so other options are you know
whether its position its whether it's
repeating or not you can give it your
sprite map a base class you can give
your sprite a dimension so I mean those
are the other features and just be aware
I would go and check out and see what
else you can do but this is the the
general format of it here okay so that's
cool right but what if the vertical
thing wasn't doing it for you what if
you needed your icons spacing
differently let's comment this out save
this okay well that luckily that's
really easy to do with compass it's very
similar to how we did the spacing as
well so what we're going to do is do
dollar sign and then our maps name in
this case again it's social and then
we're going to say layout and what do we
want to set this layout to since its
vertical right now let's try horizontal
okay save this check out our sprite
horizontal awesome easy okay
so if you wanted this more customizable
what if you wanted it say diagonal well
luckily compass has that feature as well
and check out the sprite here they are
diagonally it's awesome allows us to use
the space and to the right of it without
having any conflicts with any of the
sprite images okay well there's also a
feature called smart and when smart does
is if you have a bunch of different
icons it's sort of gonna compact them
into them the most effective layout so
let's do smart here save this and we'll
see what that does with our icons as you
can see it just does vertical if any of
these icons were to be different shapes
it might fill in this sprite a different
way
to make this image a little bit
different so okay so let's actually
throw in another image here since I
didn't have any images handy I really
just made this Instant Messenger icon
super large so it's I mean it's like 200
pixels and so it's gonna be super
pixelated because that's not the you
know the native resolution of it but
let's save this and of course compass is
going to generate our sprite for us and
as you can see it's actually changed the
layout it's made these vertical and it's
have this taking up the horizontal space
here so this smart layout is good if you
have a bunch of different icons and you
just want to sort of compactly put them
into your sprite okay well that's cool
but let's say you want to add something
like a hover state or an active state
and you have a bunch of images well
luckily compass makes that super easy as
well so we're just gonna go to our
folder here and since I don't actually
have another rollover state or you know
a target state for any of these I'm just
going to use this RSS one and this will
make our point pretty visual here so
we're going to actually have this be the
hover state of the Facebook icon and
that's really easily obtainable by just
having the file name be Facebook
underscore hover and that's it so we
don't have to actually make any changes
to our sass so let's save this and let's
check out our CSS as you can see it
automatically knew that that was the
hover State so Facebook hover and it's
giving it a change in background
position so now if we hover over this
it's going to change the background
position to this RSS icon of course you
would want to use this with actual hover
States and right now there is a CSS
transition on it which is why it's doing
that
run to it but typically it would just
switch out the image like a normal hover
State well that is the magic with
sprites and
compass as you can see it's pretty
impressive it can handle almost anything
that you need to throw at it and if you
need to dig a little bit more em you
know feel free to go into the stocks and
encompasses site because there's lots to
see here and there's you know almost too
much to show but it's absolutely awesome
check it out it's very good well that's
it for this lesson if you have any
questions or comments or you know you
just want to know something else feel
free to leave a comment and let us know
how we're doing or you know let us know
what you want to see once again this is
Scott with level up Tut's and thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
