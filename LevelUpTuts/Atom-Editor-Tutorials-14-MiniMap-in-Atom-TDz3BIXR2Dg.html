up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you one of the most installed
packages on atom and now this is a
feature that comes by standard into
sublime but a lot of people turn it off
this is the mini-map
so as I'm gonna show you how you can
have a mini-map and change the different
settings with an atom let's get started
on that right now
now another piece of functionality
that's in sublime text by default but
you can easily and quickly add to atom
if you so would choose is the mini-map
if we just head to the packages and
search for mini-map now you can see just
how popular this package is because of
its amount of installs yeah the first
one looks like it's just finding
replaced then we have mini-map cursor
line mini-map pigments what we actually
want is the one that's just labeled as
mini-map which has over 1 million two
hundred thousand installs so this is
definitely a highly used package and one
that you might be used to with other
text editing software now what's cool
about this mini-map is you can disable
it if you'd like some people just
disable it by default in sublime text so
the fact that you can have it here if
you wanted or uninstalled it if you
don't want it is really nice we can also
have it be toggled auto toggle and you
can see there's actually a bunch of
settings for the mini-map you can even
display it on the left you like so as
you can see here we have our mini-map
with tons of options you can really have
any of these options you'd like now if
we click index or let's come to one of
our longer files like this stylus file
you can see the mini-map just like we're
used to exists here and and if we click
this gear in the top right here we can
say if it's on the left or right we can
say it's an absolute mode which means
that it's going to sit on top of your
code otherwise here it is where your
code is just push to the right you can
show the code highlights or not that's
not going to be immediately apparent in
this file it set to this JavaScript
where we can turn off code highlights
and we just have gray code highlights
makes it colored left
right wherever you so choose so this is
the mini-map in Adam its feature I
really like from sublime text I know
some people don't like it it's something
that I would personally be using all the
time in my projects so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment the video over me up to Twitter
or Facebook at level up tutorials I love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
