to the beta of N key which is a new app
for learning web development and it
certain facts like some of these other
apps I have in my app drawer us like
memorize or duolingo however it's a
little bit different it's a really well
done application that basically allows
you to Train web development topics now
let's go ahead and head into n key now
this isn't the first time I have opened
this app so yours will not look like
this as you can see I've already done my
workout today in fact I believe they're
still in a beta so what you want to do
is you want to download n key today you
would just want to download it and you
want to sign up for the beta and once
you get access it would be really nice
as you can see I don't have a streak
going
here or anything like that I have been
using it but I haven't been as religious
on it as I need to be however what's
cool about this is let's say we go to
settings and let's head to topics at the
moment when this was first released it
wasn't much other than JavaScript now
there is Java and CSS as you can see I
can say CSS expert get I'm confident
Linux unfamiliar JavaScript I'm
confident and coming soon there's a
whole bunch of other stuff now as you
could see already based on the color the
design the interaction here this is a
well-designed app and it's not just
screens like this it's pretty much the
entire experience which is one of the
reasons I've been just very very
impressed with this application in
general so as you can see we have some
information it's just basically our
settings and the way it works is that
you have workouts
now the workouts are essentially just
giving you a fact about something and
then you swipe left or right based on if
you know it or not it's not necessarily
like a quiz like you haven't duolingo
however as you can see they look
something like this it gives you a user
splice to remove an item from an array
so basically use splice rather than
delete because delete is going to give
you undefined where that is rather than
actually removing the item so it's just
little tidbits like this with a
learn more button and you can come
through and say hey I knew this or I
didn't know this now it will track your
streak and as you can see there's some
really nice animations and stuff going
on in here and we have some insights
where you can star like here we have
keep track of failed
sssssh login attempts so I can come in
here and star this and this is going to
save this within my start now there's
learned and also this is anything that
you've ever hit in your workout learned
is essentially what you just swipe to
say that hey I didn't know this before
now let's go ahead and head to games
right now I've unlocked three games I
have a pseudo foo I have you can't
handle the truth and be strict now these
are already named really well I like
this about this app it doesn't take
itself too seriously but at the same
time it's just well done let's go to you
can't handle the truth so this is a game
where basically falling blocks come in
with what are either truthy or false II
values and you have to determine whether
that's a truth or false value pretty
much as soon as you can because you get
more points for how fast you do it and
if you get it incorrect they start to
stack up if too many step up you fail
now it's really nice because it gives
you a little chart at the end of our how
you've done over past time so let's go
ahead and click play and check this out
so as you can see I'm tapping this
truthy or false e based on what the
value would equate to for instance an
empty string is going to be false
some key of an empty array is going to
be or an empty object it's going to be
false now the number we have an empty
array here which is actually true we
have negative one shoot I believe that
is true we have the let's see this is a
truth e talking and doing this at the
same time isn't that super easy so as
you can see true new number true/false
is obviously false oops double clicked
false err false no empty object is true
undefined is false length of an empty
object is false the array infinity is
truthful and K and then an object with
something in it even though that is
false and as you can see here man this
the work is really really nice I'm in
terms
of just the overall experience and you
can see you can compare your scores and
review your answers and stuff like that
in other games be strict is going to
basically put you into strict mode and
have you finding the line in the
JavaScript that is going to be a problem
so in you strict I unlisted there there
was a space and use strict and here you
strict we're not allowed to use eval so
I select eval is incorrect now here
there are no arguments okay and here we
have a variable named let's so we can't
obviously name a variable name let here
why is not defined as you can see here
these games are really nice at tuning
you're sort of knowledge of things like
JavaScript
okay and as you can see there I got a
nice little boost seven of eight and a
little time bonus so this is really good
it's not like groundbreaking or anything
like that but to be honest I really
really enjoy using this application and
if you're developing a learning tool
that's just something that is very
important so check out n key that is e n
ki check it out on the I believe it's
for Android and iOS this is the Android
version they should be the exact same as
far as I know but it's really super
super nice and it's only gonna get
better I've noticed each consecutive
update just brings new and new better
stuff and it is just really good as
always this is Scott without love
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments so they come in the video hurt
me up at Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials thanks so much for watching
and I'll see the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
