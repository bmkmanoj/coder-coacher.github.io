of Tut's and today we're going to be
playing around with this graphical
layout of our new app and we're going to
open it up into our new Android virtual
device that we have already booted up
and if you haven't booted this up please
go to your Android virtual device
manager select yours and click start
because it will take a little while for
it to boot up so I got mine already okay
so this is actually if your file up top
here says activity main this is what
you're going to see in fact when you
create an app this is what they're going
to show you automatically if you don't
see this click on your folder that
should be over here in your package
Explorer and then you're going to go to
res and then layout and it's gonna be
activity main right here so if this gets
closed you can always double click this
and open it again here and go away Apple
okay so this this is your main layout
right now this is your main activity
layout in fact everything in this res
folder are things gonna you're gonna be
looking at or hearing there's gonna be
all your images layouts your audio that
kind of stuff so this is where your
resources go so of naturally this is
where your layout files would go and
this is an XML file if you see down here
we have the graphical layout tabs or the
XML so this is actually tabbing back and
forth this is the same document if we
make a change on the XML it's gonna make
a change on this graphical editor in the
next video we're gonna go over some of
the XML stuff that just a brief
introduction about how we can work with
the XML and that way you can get a
little bit more comfortable there
because to be honest a lot of times it's
really just easier to work with the XML
but this is cool too
there's all sorts of great stuff so I'm
actually gonna click this hello world
text and I'm gonna delete it I'm just
gonna hit delete and it's gone next if
you look over here and your palette
you'll see there's some different things
here we have a textview large medium we
have buttons we have spinners we have
all sorts of stuff and you can actually
for the most part just click and drag
and drop these on to your app so let's
actually click and drag a textview you
know since I'm dragging it there's these
green arrows and this is going to show
you where to
put it if we get too close to the middle
it's gonna want to snap to the middle
likewise if we get too close to the
middle horizontally it's gonna snap to
the middle too well what happens we just
throw it here but now we decide this is
a terrible spot we want it to be in the
middle well there's these buttons up
here we can say Center middle and then
Center middle okay cool perfect well now
this is textview we want this to say
something else
if we click right click and then select
edit text you'll be able to change this
text from textview to anything you'd
like so we're just gonna have you know
any sort of text that you would want to
put in here I'm saying hello to myself
hello level of tuts and I'm gonna grab
something else I'm gonna grab this
button and this buttons not gonna do
anything yet but it's gonna be cool to
have around so I'm gonna keep the
centered but I'm gonna place it just
below the text here button and I'm gonna
I did need to click that and I'm gonna
right-click this and select edit text
I'm gonna say press me cool so this is
press me button right here and you'll
notice that there's a little maybe it's
like an exclamation point within a
triangle and if you go down here to the
problems tab and we click this you'll
see that there's two warnings and right
now it's going to complain to us that
these strings are hard-coded I'm gonna
go over what that means basically we're
hard coding these strings into the XML
which is not a practice that is
considered a best practice so what's
good about this is that this Android
linter is going to tell you exactly
things that it's our best practices and
it's better to just fix these things
when you can rather than let them pile
up so we're gonna go over that as well
but for right now don't worry about it
so now we have our fantastic app that
says hello level up tuts and it pushed
me button let's get this thing running
in an Android virtual device so if I
click this play button right here this
is going to run the main activity in
fact if you click the little arrow next
to it you can see run as an Android
application so first I'm gonna you see
this last rose up here that means you
need to save it so I'm going to command
yes I'm gonna save this and then I'm
gonna click this play button right here
which is going to run this main activity
and by default it knows this is an
android app so it's going to try to run
it into my emulator and so if you see
down here it says it's launching LevelUp
tuts it's at 100% it says would you like
ADT to automatically monitor logcat i'll
put messages yes I would sure I'm gonna
I want to have logcat monitor my errors
so I'm gonna click OK and it looks like
there's some stuff here we're just gonna
ignore for now we're gonna ignore
anything in blog cat we'll go over that
later but if we control over to our
emulator we click into it you can see
our app is up here and you'll notice
there's this button you know you can't
click on the text but if you click on
this button it's gonna have a button
press state just like an app would if
you were running it on your OS so it's
really cool we have our first Android
app here it's not doing anything fancy
just as hell a level up tuts
it has a button you can push that does
nothing but I encourage you to push it a
thousand times anyways and and we it's
pretty cool so in the next lesson we're
gonna go over editing the XML directly
but it's not gonna be a total in-depth
complete covering of the XML because
there's lots of stuff there and we'll
get to it in time so as always this is
Scott with level up types if you have
any questions or comments please leave a
comment the video or hit us up at
LevelUp tuts on twitter and just let us
know what you're thinking thanks but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
