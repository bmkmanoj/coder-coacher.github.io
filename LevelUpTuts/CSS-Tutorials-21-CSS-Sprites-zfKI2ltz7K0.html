up tuts and today I'm going to show you
a technique called CSS sprites and
sprites is not necessarily a new concept
in the terms of what a sprite is what it
does is it reduces the amount of
requests a browser makes therefore
making your page load faster and it does
that by putting many different images
that you use throughout the site on one
image instead of a whole bunch of
different images because every single
one of those images that your site loads
has to be a request that the browser
makes and that every single one of those
inquests increases the page load time so
if you have one request for an image
it's a little bit larger it's going to
be faster than 10 20 50 requests for you
know whatever smaller images sizes so
what I do what I have here is I have a a
sprite and it's called logo sprite in
and has the logos for the different some
of the different types of tutorials we
do we have Drupal assassin compass and
all this stuff so we have all these
logos here and if you'll notice it's one
image if you open this up in Photoshop
it's just transparent in the background
and it has these four images and what
you're going to want to do is be sort of
cognizant to how these are going to be
output if you're going to have one of
these and a whole bunch of stuff or the
thing that this needs to be the imagery
placement needs to be really tall you
might want to have your images laid out
horizontally instead of vertically of
course this is something that is only
going to be really making sense once
you've douve into sprites and check it
out yourself keep in mind that what
we're going to be doing is loading this
whole image and then we're only going to
be displaying a little bit of it okay so
to get started I'm going to go into our
HTML and I'm going to change something
really quick so we had this sign F thing
and we had this main main call with the
class of nav I'm going to change this to
be a Tut nav and these are going to be
the different types of tutorials we have
and in my CSS I'm just going to go ahead
and nuke everything we had in there as
well as nuke this second list that we
had
in the middle of this list so which is
going to be four items Drupal cess
compass and I think expression engine
and likewise I'm going to give these
anchors I'm gonna give them a class
which is the same thing it's going to be
this class is equal to I'm just going to
have this be EE for expression engine
you might win your class needs to be a
little bit more descriptive than that
but this is just a quick exercise
compass s and I'm going to make this one
be triple okay and we want these images
to appear to the left of this text we
don't really want all of this text to be
gone like we did in the past tutorial
where we had an image replacement but
we're going to have this be a background
image on this text and let's go to our
CSS I think we had some stuff under this
nav that's all gone now so we might as
well just delete this which is totally
cool with me and we're going to have
this be it was Tut nav so Tut - nav and
so if there's one thing you'll notice
about all of these it's going to be
using the same image so we need to give
all of these anchors so inside of techne
of list item our anchor and since we're
only having these items this is fine to
do this way we're going to give these a
background and we're going to give this
add background image of a slash logo
slash sprite
I believe it's called PNG okay let me
just Oh with the head no - okay
and here I'm going to say no repeats I
don't want this repeating and we're
going to leave it like this so now if we
check out our page we give this a
refresh here you'll see that each of
these items sort of has whatever this
this background image it's a
I'm not looking the way we wanted to
look here but what we're going to do is
we're going to come in here let's do
some more stuff first I'm going to get
rid of this left column sort of in the
way right now okay so this is here okay
these are these we want these Tut nav
Tut nav items these list items to have
all the style of none okay and we want
each of these to be a display:block
so in our anchors we want these to be
display:block okay it's a little bit
better and now we want this text to be
pushed all the way over to the right and
not not all the way over just as much as
this image so when I inspect this and
look at this I'm going to give this a
padding and let's give this a padding of
20 pixels on the top and the bottom and
actually let's keep going up you can see
as I increment this there it fills out
our image here so now our text is right
in the middle so I'm giving it a padding
of 28 pixels on the top and bottom on
the right I'm not going to have well on
the right I'll have 10 pixels of padding
28 on the bottom and then let's do I
think it's whatever going to be the
width of this image I have it at 50
right now but I'm going to increase it
you can see this pushes this all the way
over I have 80 pixels of padding on the
left so as you can see here this is what
this is a anchor is looking like now you
can hover over anywhere here and it's
going to be the anchor itself so I'm
going to actually take this padding code
that I wrote in the inspect element here
and I copy it and I'm going to put it in
my actual CSS and now all of them are
going to be looking like that let's go
back to our page refresh great we now
have all of these this looks pretty good
right let's actually give them some
margin too and I'm going to do that on
the LI I'm going to give them a margin
of just 20 pixels top and bottom nothing
on the left and right cool there also
based out now so this is good we have
all these left images whatever they look
good only one problem is so the problem
is it's only showing this first image
and if you're wondering why that is it's
because we're only having this B display
block and because of our the way our
padding works out our anchor here is
only 400 pixels wide and it's 74 pixels
tall well if we were to keep making this
taller let's say for instance we gave
this some crazy padding we gave it like
a hundred pixels padding on the top
you're going to see us and weird stuff
happen you're going to see the start of
this next image to start coming in this
because what we're really doing is just
not showing all of the image well if
you're wondering how we show the rest of
the image or show the correct one well
that goes back to why we gave each of
these its own class and for this I'm
going to use a tool called sprite cow
okay
and sprite cow is a site that really
helps you just sort of get the the image
background position correct and that's
how we do this with sprites is by using
background position okay I'm going to
find my image which is this logo sprite
it's going to open it up in sprite cow
it's going to show me all these and if
you select something it's going to say
you know to have this it's going to give
you some code down here and this will
say to have this Drupal image show up
your background positions needs to be
zero zero and that's what it is right
now so that's why we're getting the
Drupal image to show up but let's say we
want the expression engine image to show
up it says we need our background
position to be 0 negative 1 34 pixels
and the first value is the x value
second value is the Y value so what
we're doing is we're moving this image
up negatively to have this energy be
displayed correctly so let's go to our
CSS here I'm going to say a tuck nav I
want the anchor that has the class of a
II to have a background position
which is shown oh my god a position gap
job
okay and so then the background position
of zero negative one thirty four pixels
save this let's check out our page get
rid of sprite cow refresh and here is
our expression engine image just like we
did that lets check out these other ones
really quick it's 270 for compass and
negative 484 sass so just like we did
that is background position and we're
going to do 0 negative 270 pixels and
then for I'm just going to copy this and
for assess I think I believe we have 480
own egative 408 408 pixels and this is
going to be for the anchor with the
class of sass and if you'll notice we
don't have to do Drupal because Drupal
is already showing up as the one that's
in the zero zero position that we
defined to have all of them with it's
only getting changed for these ones so
there's no need to define Drupal here
let's go to here let's go to our page
refresh and as you can see we have all
of our logos here showing up and this is
all in one image but we're controlling
which part is being shown and that's CSS
sprites it's a really great technique
it's something I would suggest I'm doing
every one of your sites until there's a
better technique but right now CSS
sprites is it go ahead and do it
practice it learn it you sprite how it
helps you out you might as well and then
after you learn compass there's even
cooler tools in compass and sass that
help you make CSS sprites okay as always
this is Scott with level of Tut's if you
have any questions please leave a come
in the video below his about total level
of Tut's and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
