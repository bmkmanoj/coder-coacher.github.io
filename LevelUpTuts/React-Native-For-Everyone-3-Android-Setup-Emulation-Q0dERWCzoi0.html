iOS and we had this running in an iOS
simulator we're going to be doing the
same for Android it's great to be
because it's really nice to be able to
develop on a simulator I'm in a sense to
be able to develop on a real device but
everyone has every device so the
simulator is a great way to get up and
going now to do this we need several
things intact first well we need is the
Android studio application here which is
basically xcode for Android if you've
ever used Xcode in addition it also
gives us the ability to download things
like the SDK which we'll need and the
Android virtual devices manager after we
have those we're going to have to grab
an older version of the Android SDK
to get things going we're going to need
to create a virtual device and then from
there it should be good to go
so let's go ahead first things first
let's click download Android studio at
the time of recording this version this
video looks like the current version is
two point three point two and this is
going to download a large disk image for
us it's like 430 megabytes so once more
we're going to be hanging out while
something downloads the funny thing
about react native is this is the fast
way to get going with everything and
most the time is just sort of sitting
and waiting for things to install so I'm
going to pause this recording and get
back into it after this is finished
downloading and we'll pick up there okay
and just like that our download is done
and we're going to click on this disk
image to open it up so that we can
install Android studio so remember this
is step one here we're simply going to
drag Android studio into our
applications and then I'm going to open
up my applications waiting for this to
transfer over alright and now we can
head over and look for Android studio
and open this up let's click open and if
you have a previous version installed
you can use the previous version I'm
going to click this I do not have a
previous version or I do not want to
import my settings
and Android studio is going to fire
itself up and now we're at the welcome
to Android studio menu where we can
click Next
close out of this and now we're going to
select custom when it asks us to what
type of installation settings now to
keep things a little bit easier to read
I'm going to use the IntelliJ theme
we're going to click Next
now we're going to want to make sure
that everything here is installed for
some reason that looks like the
performance Intel x-h axm is already
installed so this is not letting me
check this but if it isn't installed
you're going to want to check this we'll
also want to make sure we install the
Android SDK the SDK platform and an
Android virtual device now we're going
to click Next and let's click finish
as this installs all the stuff we need
so once more we're going to have to do a
little bit of waiting while this
installs after this gets fired up we're
then going to need to install some more
SDK stuff that way we get the right
build tools to function with react
native then after that we're going to
create our device for our virtual device
manager and then we're going to get
fired up and get our hello world up and
running ok so it looks like everything
is finished here we can click finish and
now we want to be doing a little bit
more here so we're going to click this
configure and we're going to click SDK
manager once again now the reason why we
need to do this is because we need to
get a specific version of the Android
SDK build tools ok so from the screen we
want to click show package details we
want to be looking at Android 6.0
marshmallow so there's a bunch of new
ones but we want to be looking for 6.0
and we want to select Google API s we
want to select platform 23 sources for
Android 23 we want to select the x86
Atom 64 system image and we want to
select the Google API
system image atom 64 system image the
one at the bottom right here next we
want to select SDK tools up top and
again we want to make sure show package
details has been checked
and we want to be looking for SDK build
tools which is right here the version
we're looking for is two three zero one
so 2301 which is 2301 now we could go
ahead and click apply now let's click OK
let's click accept next finish and let's
just wait for this to download ok and
let's click finish ok so after that is
all installed you need to make sure that
you have your stuff under Android 6.0
checked as well as the two 23:01 version
here checked and we're going to click OK
now second to last we need to add in our
Android home to our bash profile now I'm
not using bash or I haven't been but
this will be easier to just use bash if
you aren't using fish or zsh then this
should be totally familiar and what we
want to do is we want to go ahead and
find our profile file so if we head into
our user directory we're going to look
for bash profile which is that bash
profile if you do not have invisible
files turned on then you're going to
want to make sure there's a billion
tutorials on that so you can always just
google invisible files OSX now what we
want to look for is a dot bash profile
now if you do not have this file you can
create it it's a dot Bash underscore
profile I'm going to open with just a
simple text editor I'm going to bump up
the font size a whole lot so we can see
this nice and big and really what we
need to do here is add some lines if you
head to the react native page which is
Facebook YouTube is react - native we
can head to this get started and then
there's a configure for Android scroll
down and what we're going to be looking
for is this line right here so this is
what we want to add to
bash profile now here we want to make
sure some things are correct first thing
I'm going to do is paste this in here we
need to make sure that the SDK is
actually available at this path so what
we want to do is look for it at our home
library then we want to look at Android
SDK which it's here now I can save this
and we can close this file okay so this
is a little bit more involved than just
opening up Xcode but it's quite all
right
what we want to do now is we want to
start the Android virtual device which
is you can see is right here so how do
we get into this let's say that to
Android studio and let's click a
configure once more now the next thing
that wants us to do is start a new AVD
which is a new Android device now
unfortunately we can't really get to
that too many ways right we can check
for updates we can look at preferences
and stuff like that but let's see if we
can get there just by typing in a VD and
as you can see here we're getting to
things like our key maps but this isn't
going to allow us to actually open up
the AVD
which is unfortunate so we're gonna have
to click start a new project we can just
hit next through everything next next
finish okay well you don't have to even
pay attention to any of that stuff we're
just trying to get to the actual
interface here for Android studio again
it's unfortunate that we can't get to it
without that but that's just the way it
is okay let's close out this tip here
like I said we're just trying to get to
this device manager which we can YouTube
by this little purple icon that looks
like a phone with an Android head poking
out on it we can click this it's going
to open up our virtual devices and we
can make a whole bunch of different
Android devices that's one of the
benefits of Android and their-their
developer ecosystem right we're not just
working on an iPhone or several
different iPhones there's a whole ton of
different types of Android phones so we
can really have a lot of ability to
customize our device here and
unfortunately don't want to customize
one right
we just want to edit so we're going to
select our virtual device and click Edit
this AVD and then here all we need to do
is click show advanced settings we want
to make sure that the target for the
operating system let's go ahead and
click change is going to be our
marshmallow here so let's just scroll
down we want to look for level 23 and
we're going to be using the x86 64 then
we can click OK
let's click finish and then we can click
yes to the dialogue it is just going to
wipe it and now we can do is hit the
play button which is going to fire up an
emulator so the simulator is going to
pop up right now ok we can click got it
and now we have our emulator up and
running ok so now let's go ahead and
let's head back to our command line and
we're going to make sure that inside of
our tip calculator we can click got it
and now we have our emulator up and
running ok so now let's go ahead and
let's head back to our command line
we're going to want to make sure we're
inside of our tip calculator and we can
type NPM run Android and that's going to
start up the package err and hopefully
get this going on our emulator now after
we run this command you can see that
we're getting the same sort of stuff we
were getting before and if we head to
our emulator it's going to say please
enable prevent drawing over their apps
and click OK and just like that I'm
going to tell Expo to permit drawing
over other apps and we can close this
out I believe and just actually open up
the expo app let's scroll down and
select expo and let's select our tip
calc you can see it's building our Java
Script bundle and we should be able to
see our hello world here in just a
second ok and it says you can pull down
to show the expo menu I'm going to say
no thanks you can see I can pull down if
I want to get to the expo menu other
than that I have a hello world right
here just like in our iOS app so this is
going to be really super
helpful because now what we have here is
an Android device we have this emulator
up and running and we can start
programming a react native app on
Android now I should note that there are
a hundred things that could go wrong in
this process so maybe you're using a
different shell right maybe you're using
something like fish or zsh and where
you're storing your profile information
is incorrect you know like I had to even
use bash here because that just made it
easier in addition you can also be
getting a handful of errors that are
resolved simply just by running the
command again believe it or not but what
you want to do is if you're having an
issue if you're having one of these
errors
first things first google it react
native your you'll get an answer 99% of
the time other than that you can always
post your issues and solutions in the
comment for this video I think it will
really help because like I said there's
just too many things that could go wrong
in this process of getting set up for me
to be able to cover every single little
thing but just like that we have our
hello world up and running so now that
we have this up on an Android emulator
we're going to be able to start actually
developing some real react native native
code it's going to be really super fun
and we're going to build a real-life
project the Android version is going to
be using material design the iOS version
is going to be using the human design
guidelines and we're going to have this
thing looking really super nice so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials thanks so much for watching
and I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
