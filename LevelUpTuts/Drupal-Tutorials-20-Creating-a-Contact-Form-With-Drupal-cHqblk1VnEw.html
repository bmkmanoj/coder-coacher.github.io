up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to install and use a contact form
using the built-in contact module in
Drupal 7 so to get this started we're
just going to go to modules and enable
enable that module because it is a core
module we do not have to install it it
is already in your core section of your
modules page so if we go down here and
we click on contact and we're just going
to scroll the bottom and save the
configuration okay now to the right of
con the contact you'll see that there's
help permissions configure we're going
to click the configure and here it's
going to say that it has created a
contact form for us already and the link
to it is disabled by default in the menu
and so we're just going to categories
website feedback and recipients are is
my email of course you can edit this if
you want to send it to a specific email
but by default it's going to grab the
email that you used to register the site
with when you first installed it as you
can see there's a different weights or
anything like that so this is this
category and if we add another category
we'll just say
projects you know let's say this person
wants to contact us about projects and
this is also going to go to me
although you know you would maybe want
this to go to somebody else or something
okay so we just have to just so you can
see what this does
selected yes selected no okay so like
this says it has already created this
page for us and we're going to go to the
menus like it has the link there and
under navigation is the menu it puts it
in and here is our contact page we're
just going to enable this so we can see
it on our page okay and here is the
contact form so by default you have your
name your email address your subject and
whether you're contacting about projects
or just website feedback of course both
of these are going to me right now
however if you
wanted to select them to go to different
people that's very well possible in the
configuration edit screen that we saw
before
so after we type all the stuff in and
click send message it's going to send an
email to the person that the contact
form has as a recipient now since this
site is locally it's not going to send
an email so I'm not going to bother
clicking the send a message because it's
not going to work
the upside is is that installing the
Drupal default contact form is very easy
and very simple the downsides are is
that it's very simple and not
configurable in the next lesson I'm
going to show you a module called
webform that is a very robust commenting
system that I use on my projects instead
of Drupal score contact module once
again this is Scott with level up tuts
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
