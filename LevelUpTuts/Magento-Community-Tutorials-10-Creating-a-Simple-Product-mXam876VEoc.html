up Tut's today I'm going to show you how
to add products to your Magento site and
we're going to do this with the new
product type we created and it's going
to be added to our new category
tutorials like we did in the last video
so first off I don't know if you
remember but if we go into tutorials
here here are the products that we added
to tutorials before but these were the
pre-made products that are already in
here so let's go through the process of
what it's like to create your own
product so if you remember we actually
created our own we created our own
attribute set
so using this attribute set we are going
to create our product so under catalog
we'll click manage products and once
we're in here all we have to do is click
this add product in the top right it's
going to take us to the screen of what
kind of product you want to create using
which attribute set we'll click this and
we're going to go down here and select
tutorials and now let's go to product
type we want this to be a simple product
in the next couple lessons we'll show
you what a group product a configurable
product or all a virtual bundle
downloadable all this stuff is but for
right now we're just going to start with
simple simple product okay we're going
to click continue here okay so every if
you notice every single thing that is
required has a red asterisk next to it
so we're going to go ahead and start
filling this out so my product and then
SKU it's whatever your SKU number is
this doesn't really have one of course
so I'll just use a series of zeros and
format let's just say this is a MOV it
doesn't weigh anything so I'm going to
put zero status is enabled if you want
to make sure the status is enabled if
it's disabled the products not going to
show up on your front end tax class is
none if you did set up your tax classes
you could set this taxable goods or
default we're going to go over the text
and everything like that once we've
created some products and once we're
getting into the configuration for your
checkout process so URL key you can set
up what you want the URL to be otherwise
it's just going to grab it from the name
so I'll just leave it here don't need
anything special we want it to be
visible within catalog and search you
can have products that are only visible
by search only usable by catalog or not
visible individual if you'd like this
product you can set a as new from a date
to a date so let's say if you're running
a sale on new products or let's say you
got a feature on new products that was
like these are the the latest products
you could have it automatically pull in
what products that you were using and
what ones were set is new when they have
them be displayed there we don't have
them set up right now so I'm not going
to worry about setting this as new don't
worry about it
and then a country of manufacturer this
thing's actually unimportant but if you
have the products that were manufactured
in different countries of course you
would want to be setting this correctly
this is just a tutorial send the United
States it could be you know whatever
okay so let's go to the next one prices
in price we're just going to set this at
five dollars and so the format is you
know your number dot in your sense so if
you put five I'm not sure if it would
accept that I would just usually go
ahead and just try to type out exactly
what it is group price this is if you
you want to set up a group price or tier
pricing we'll get into that later as you
can see they're not required so we're
just going to ignore that we're just
going to go over serve the bare bones
basic so you can get a product up and
going and then later in future tutorials
we'll go over more specifics so a
special price note and then you could
set a special price date just like I
said about the new product date okay all
this other stuff we're just going to
leave blank meta information well you
know I would typically take the time to
you know create meta information however
this doesn't you know this products fake
so I'm not really going to spend too
much time so I'm just going to have
something here it's actually not even
required but somethings better than
nothing alright now I'm going to grab a
product I'm actually I'm just going to
grab a screenshot real quick there we go
and let's browse
see our desktop is where I save this
image so once this loads okay screenshot
and upload this so to do this images as
you can see I click browse then I
clicked upload and now here's my image
if you hover over it I'll show your
image actually is so label we're just
going to call this my Tut whatever your
product is you know the label you can
usually just use this as your the
product title and then if now if we were
to just save this or whatever it
actually wouldn't set your image as
being anything so this is something you
want to make sure you do if you notice
there's these three columns here this
thumbnails small image and base image
make sure that these are all set if you
only have one image make sure these are
all set to that image if you have
multiple images you can set them
individually to the thumbnail the small
image and the base image okay also if
you want to exclude it you let's say you
want to keep an image uploaded but you
don't want it maybe you want it to be
like the small image but you don't want
to show up under that products images
you can exclude it if you want to remove
it you check remove when you click Save
it will be gone okay so description same
thing I would normally take the time to
write up some description but this I'm
just going to put some you know blank
text here okay and you can also have
this a WYSIWYG if that's what your
clients are interested in okay now
design this is if you want this product
page to have a custom design so as you
can see I have these custom designs that
are sort of installed with the sample
data but I'm going to ignore these and
we're not going to do any sort of custom
design so reoccurring profile Note gift
options note okay so for inventory if
you have a manage stock checked in your
configuration settings which we do
you're going to have to have a quantity
set here if you leave this at zero it's
not going to show up so let's have one
that let's say 10,000 of these we're
actually not going to run out and then
we want the stock availability also set
to in stock both of these need to be set
or else your products are not
to show up okay now in websites we want
this to show up in the main store
perfect you have multiple stores you
would be able to determine or have
products to show up in different stores
so categories we want this to be under
tutorials and then we'll just listen to
magenta tutorial so we have one there
related products we don't have any
related products right now so in the
future when we do we can just give a
check here and it will add those as
related products actually let's select a
couple of them just so you can see how
that works
same with upsells and cross-sells
whatever we'll just select a bunch here
okay and custom options we don't have
anything so we don't need to anything
like I said this is just really a
bare-bones product to get us up and
running so let's click Save and if you
click Save it takes you back to your
product screen and your new product with
its ID is incremented by one here's my
product it'll say okay it's available in
catalog search it's enabled on the main
website and here's the SKU number here's
the price everything you want to know
about it immediately accessible if you
actually click this it takes you right
to the Edit screen so you don't have to
go over here and click at it you can
just click right here so let's go ahead
and refresh this page here and we should
new see our new product okay so if you
did this correctly you will see my
product is right here we click on this
and here's your product it's in here
your view your your zoom is working you
can add it to your cart wishlist all
this other stuff and you can add tags to
it it's all all working if we add it to
our cart you can see working perfectly
great so we now have a new product like
I said if you're having issues make sure
that it's just status is enabled make
sure you have stock if you're monitoring
stock make sure it's visible in catalog
and search and make sure you have it set
to being in stock if you have any
questions or comments please leave a
comment on the video or let us know what
you're thinking you can hit us up at
Twitter LevelUp tuts and
