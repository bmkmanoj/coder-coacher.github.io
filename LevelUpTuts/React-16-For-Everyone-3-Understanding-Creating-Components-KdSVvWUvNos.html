up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be writing our first component
as well as looking at components and
sort of understanding and dissecting
them we're going to talking a little bit
about what they do and why so let's get
into that right now okay so in this
video we're going to get started by
actually getting into some react
component stuff so let's head to our
source folder and then open up a pas and
here we're going to be greeted with our
very first react component if you aren't
used to seeing this kind of thing right
and it may seem scary and confusing if
you're not big into JavaScript or if
you're not big into react because
granted this is looks like HTML it's not
HTML and it looks kind of different so
at first react components can be a bit
disorienting but as far as components go
this one's pretty easy so what we're
going to do in this video is break down
sort of the basics of this component
then we're going to write our own and
then we're going to use it okay
so first let's get out of the way some
of the stuff that is not react specific
in fact we're doing some basic
JavaScript imports here so we're
importing some stuff up top and we're
exporting the app at the bottom okay so
if you don't know the syntax obviously
we're going to go over it as we make our
own files imports exports that sort of
thing but just know that this sort of
stuff is is JavaScript right so what we
want to know here is that we're bringing
in react anytime you're working with a
react component whether it's a normal
component or a functional stateless
component or a pure component or
whatever we have to bring and react so
we have import react comma and then in
brackets were bringing in component now
component is just a part of the react
object this area where it's this extends
component down here could also be
written like react dot component now
this is a long fun way that you probably
don't do in more standard practice to
import component itself from react and
use it itself okay next we're importing
our
which is simply just an SVG icon and
it's located within our same folder so
we're saying import logo from and then
simply just our SVG now compared to
other JavaScript exports this logo
doesn't have an export or anything
because it's simply a file so we're able
to import a file simply like logo like
this and then we can use it as the
source of an image now you could have
eat just as easily put logo down SVG in
your public folder and referenced it as
a normal source string path however this
works really well as a way to sort of
bundle up your assets now next we are
importing our app dot CSS this is just
going to cause our CSS to get loaded
instead of having to go into an HTML
file and use our style tag or import our
CSS that way so that's all this is doing
it's simply just allowing us to have
sort of a module of CSS that we're
importing directly here okay so this is
all of our JavaScript stuff now the next
part is going to be getting into some
react stuff now there are several
different ways to define components and
react of which we're going to be going
over as we go because they range from a
little bit more confusing or maybe
winner or how you would use them but for
the most part the standard component is
going to be your friend right because
the standard basic react component is
pretty much as standard as it gets right
there's a reason why it's the default
and it includes all the basic stuff you
need to manage state and the lifecycle
of this component and although in the
end it might not be the one you end up
using most often it is the one you end
up using quite a bit so you can see how
we define our component with this class
syntax no in the past there's a
different syntax to defining a react app
which you'd use a react that create
class now that syntax is totally
deprecated and if you see that in other
tutorials you're gonna want to go ahead
and use this class syntax instead so all
we're doing is simply defining a class
named app and that class is going to
extend component
component like I mentioned before has
brought in firm react so all we're doing
is basically we're taking the standard
blank component from react and we're
extending it under the name of app so
far so good well the class syntax next
basically just has a set of curly
brackets to open and close you'll see
this at the top and bottom next we have
our render method now this is going to
be something that is required of every
single react component now not all of
the methods inside of a react component
are going to be required but a render is
one that is always going to be needed
and if you don't have it your component
will not work and it will give you
errors so the render method is simply
just what's output in your react
component this thing is triggered
anytime the component is rendered or
re-rendered now those times when it does
that we're obviously going to be going
over a sort of what makes a component
render or rerender but right now all we
need to know is that we load up this
component it's going to fire off the
render and this is a method so the
method just like any other method is
looking to return something if we were
to have all this code within our render
and nothing returned nothing would get
output so that's why we have this return
statement here which is simply just has
an open and closed parenthesis now
inside of this is going to be our actual
JSX code JSX is one of those things that
initially scared some people away from
react because it looked like you were
writing HTML inside of your JavaScript
and you kind of are but what this does
is it's basically a wrapper around a
different syntax that you could write a
straight-up JavaScript without having to
write JSX now I personally don't like
that at all it sort of is a little too
abstract for me I prefer the HTML like
interface especially because I've come
from a HTML and PHP background so this
is the nice sort of JSX syntax where you
can see everything sort of looks just
like HTML we have our divs and they have
open and close tags and we have our
header our image our h1 all that sort of
stuff the only thing that's sort of
weird here at all is that
we have class name instead of class and
you might be confused by that because
why the heck would you use something
entirely different for class well class
is a reserved word in JavaScript you'll
see it up top here class app extends
component and so because of that you
cannot use the word class in JSX without
this thing getting really angry so we
use a class name instead of class and
that way react can sort of keep track of
all your class names and stuff like that
and I have to worry about any sort of
collisions with actual JavaScript
so other than then there's nothing crazy
here except for one line here where we
mentioned before our source file now in
JSX
anytime you'd like to use JavaScript
variables in to some extent actual
real-life JavaScript you can use these
brackets and these can go sort of
anywhere and I mean sort of anywhere
because it's not anywhere anywhere but
sort of anywhere in this case we're
simply just grabbing our local that
we're defining up top and setting the
source to be the value of the logo
however that's not the only way you can
use these brackets and inside of a tag
you can also use them in place of
something like text so let's say up top
here we were to find we were to define a
new constant varial with Const and this
is going to be equal to welcome okay and
this welcome is equal to simply just a
string that says welcome to react you
can cut this out of here and I can paste
this in and we know the new constant
variable named welcome now all over the
course this video you'll see me using
Const and let a lot instead of var for
variables we're going to be using a
constant variable every single time that
we can unless the variable gets updated
at some point then we'll be using let
there's a lot of reasons for that of
which are a little bit outside of the
scope of this series but really it
basically cuts down on the amount of
bugs we're going to be seeing if we're
always using constant variables okay so
I'm gonna select welcome here and I'm
going to use this as a variable inside
of my brackets so I'm going to add two
curly brackets in here and have it say
welcome with inside of those brackets
now because it's inside of those
brackets it's going to be referencing
the jaws
script variable and not a string of text
remove these brackets and we would
simply just have the text welcome and
we'd have an h1 effect let's see this in
action if I save this head back to our
app it's just going to say welcome the
moment we put these brackets back in
save this head to our app you can now
see it says welcome to react this is
because inside of these brackets we get
to use JavaScript okay so with all of
that knowledge in hand let's go ahead
and create our own component you can see
there's nothing crazy about this in fact
this looks like standard JavaScript one
of the things I like so much about react
as to how it gets makes you better at
add JavaScript just by learning react
right you get to experience all this
class syntax and that sort of stuff and
the only thing that's react specific is
sort of the stuff inside of here and
some lifecycle methods which we'll get
into so now let's go ahead just below
where we had our class app extents
component and let's go ahead and add a
class okay and the class is just going
to be welcome okay we're gonna change
this whole welcome variable to a welcome
component this is gonna be the least
exciting at least useful component you
ever write but it's a good one to start
with okay so we could say class welcome
extends component okay each time we
create a new component like I mentioned
before we want to extend sort of the
basic route component now I'm going to
have some brackets open this up have a
render function and we have our render
because remember we need our render and
it needs to return something okay now we
wanted to just simply just return this
h1 so I can cut this h1 out of here and
I can paste it in to our return function
so check it out just like this you just
wrote your first react component this
thing is dead simple and it only took
let's see seven lines of code here so
it's doesn't they don't have to be these
giant monolithic things in fact a lot of
times you'll be writing really small
components and once we get into
functional stateless components they're
gonna get even smaller however at the
point in which you need to make a
component will obviously get into a
little bit as well so now that we have
this component let's go ahead and use it
it's defined within this file
so we don't have to import or export or
anything like that in the future we're
going to be doing quite a bit of that
right now
we go on to and since it's already
defined in this file we can come in here
and have a standard HTML sort of tag
right and then inside of here the
welcome notice how it's capitalized
welcome because it's the same exact as
it is down here but you'll notice
there's some weird stuff going on with
my text editor is telling me there's
things wrong I'm getting some weird
syntax highlighting and that's because
in react components always need to be
closed now this is a good practice in
HTML anyways but it's not sort of
required and react it's required so if
you have a component it always needs a
closing tag now ways you could do that
would simply just be having a second tag
like this and close it out however if
there's nothing inside of your tag
there's no reason to do that and it's
just extra text we want to have a
forward slash at the end of our tag just
like you've seen on things like a page
break or an image tag okay so check it
out if we save our welcome tag and we
head to our chrome you can still see us
as welcome to react and that's great
because it's now using this component
welcome which is referencing this class
down here which is returning simply just
an h1 with the variable welcome so like
I said this thing is just just totally
useless this component is super useless
and we're going to be deleting it as we
go anyways but it's a nice exercise to
sort of see just how easy it is to
create a rect component in fact the main
components of this are simply just
extending the react component that
already exists now obviously this is
leafing out a considerable amount of
what makes react special or excellent in
fact we're going to be getting into
those stuff in the next few videos so
we're going to be talking about
something called props in the next video
which are essentially properties on your
element that you can pass through and a
sort of a parent-child relationship and
it's gonna be one of those things that
once you sort of get as well be an aha
moment for you and pops are something
that you use constantly and react and
pretty much not Hannah
component but on many many many
components do you use props and then
we're going to be getting into some of
the basic building blocks that make
react components react components we're
going to be talking about like I
mentioned before props we're also going
to be talking about components state
we're gonna be talking about component
lifecycle methods and what those are and
why you use them and we're gonna be
talking about Refs
and then we're gonna be getting to some
really cool stuff about how we can
actually start building out real dynamic
applications building some nice little
input data binding sort of stuff and get
into some really practical stuff hitting
api's and using routers and all sorts of
stuff that you want to do with and react
so this is just the absolute basic most
building blocks of where we are and if
you want to learn everything you can
head to store dot level up tutorials
comm and become a level up pro or
purchase this series outright if you do
not like subscriptions and you'll get
access to all this code and all these
videos and learn how to build a modern
react application so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials thanks so
much for watching and I'll see you in
