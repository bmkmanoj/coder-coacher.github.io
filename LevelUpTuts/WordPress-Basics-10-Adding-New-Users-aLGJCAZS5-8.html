up tuts and today we are going to
continue our wordpress basics series by
moving on to another part here so in the
first part we showed you how to install
them who showed you how to create and
manage your content right we were adding
and editing pages and posts now we're
going to talk about some more management
type things so right now up until this
point we've had one user and it's been
the admin what happens if you want to
have somebody else join you in adding
posts on this page well if your site is
local obviously that won't you know work
out too well but if your site's up on
your server somewhere and you want to
make an account for somebody else to
come in and either edit or write or have
all of the same access level as you or
even different access levels you can
certainly do that so to get into this
we're just gonna need to go back into
the backend so by clicking on your page
title up here takes you back there now
we're just going to go down to the users
tab now we have myself here and it has
my role as an administrator I have two
posts and that's pretty much all the
information I need and what's important
here is that my role is administrator
now in the next video we're going to
talk a little bit about roles but for
instance for right now we're just going
to create another new user and so let's
click this add new button right now okay
and now this is just going to be an
account for somebody else named Scott
and this can be for my gmail account and
no website sure it's just gonna be level
up tuts although that doesn't really
display it anywhere now I'm just gonna
make a very weak quick password that I
can make sure I remember and I you can
choose if you want to send this password
to your new user by email this is really
nice if you're creating accounts for
people and maybe you know they're not
setting them up themselves that way they
get their email sometimes I'll have a
password that's changed me or something
just so that when the user gets that
their password has changed me they're
unlikely to leave the password has
changed me because of course that's not
secure whereas if maybe you had it as
something for them they might you know
maybe just leave it now notice we have
the role drop-down we can have
subscriber contributor author editor and
administrator we're gonna go over the
the exact details of all of those roles
as soon however I'm gonna just select
editor for now then we can at least see
editor in action so let's click add new
user okay we now have Scott and sure
enough it has my other Gravatar which is
a little bit older picture of me but
it's still me and now let's actually log
into this site with the Scott account so
I'm just opening up an incognito window
here just so that I can have a session
that's not already been cooking here so
we have Scott and then my password and
now I'm logged in notice how things look
a little bit different the menu not only
is it a different color but you'll
notice that this one has considerably
more options and that has to do with the
role here so like I said we're gonna go
over roles in great detail in the next
video but for now just know that this is
how you can create new users that can go
ahead and log in and do things to your
site that aren't you now also if you
wanted to just delete this user you
could go ahead and click this delete
button it's gonna ask you if you want to
delete the user and all of their do you
want to delete all of their posts or
users one of them attribute all of their
posts to admin that way you know if you
don't you know you don't want to delete
the content that they actually produce
in your site you can certainly do that
or if it was some sort of harsh
departure and their content was terrible
you can delete everything so as always
this is Scott with love-love Tut's if
you have any questions or comments
please leave a comment the video reach
out to us on our forum Facebook or
anything like that we'd love to hear
from you so thanks for watching in the
next video we're gonna go over the rules
in detail
Thanks right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
