up Tut's and today we're going to take
our gob series a little bit further now
in the last video we created a couple of
tasks if you'll notice that we ran our
command gulp once and it ran through the
tasks once well that's not necessarily
ideal if you're compiling sass or
writing JavaScript in general and wanted
to build all of the time so what we have
is a watch command and now the watch
function is going to allow us to watch
certain files and then we can run
specific tasks based on what happens
when those files are changed so you can
set up a watch on JavaScript itself so
that JavaScript runs the JavaScript task
every single time you save your file or
perhaps you compile your sass into CSS
every single time you save your CSS file
so we're going to get into that right
now
so to get started we're going to make a
do task now like with any other task we
have we just have to create that by
calling gulp dot task and now we can
give it a name now an appropriate name
seems like it would be watch because
we're going to be watching our files and
we're going to have a call back here
like we've been doing ok so now instead
of our watch task let's give this some
space here we can say watch task and it
watches Jas so in this particular
example we're going to be watching
JavaScript and we're going to be running
our scripts tasks every single time a
Jas file has been saved so how we can do
that is by using the built-in watch
method so inside of our gulp task here
we can type gulp dot watch and now we're
going to pass it the string of what type
of files we're going to be watching or
the directory of those files so what we
can say here is this
same exact path that we are watching in
our scripts to build that we can say
watch those same exact files see
so we're saying watch any file with the
extension of Jas within our Jas folder
now you could likewise just say
asterisks we could do it like this and
it's going to look for any file with Jas
however we want this to be just the
specific JavaScript files okay so now
we're running our watch command now we
need to tell it
watch what to do after it sees a change
so we're going to put a comma and then
after the comma we're going to be
passing in an array of what tasks we
want to now run so in quotes we're going
to say scripts ok like that and now
let's finish it all off at the semicolon
so in this scope watch command to
reiterate we're watching all of our
JavaScript files within this Jas folder
and then once we're done we're going to
be running this scripts task so notice
how the watch task all it does is it
looks for a change and then it just
pushes on to something else it's like oh
you changed ok let me do something and
that something is running the scripts
cool so let's go ahead and run gulp dot
watch now so in our command line we can
type gulp watch and that's going to run
our watch task ok so you'll notice that
it's a starting watch and it finished it
however we still it hasn't taken us back
to our command
so gulp is still running so let's go
ahead and save and modify a our main J's
file I'm just going to remove a line
here and hit save now let's come check
out our terminal and you can see what's
happened is that it says it's starting
our scripts and then finishing our
scripts and likewise if I make another
change
let's do this at a comment just like
that
this is just an example here we can come
back and you see it's changed again so
this is like what you'd be used to if
you're using the Sasquatch command or
something like that where watch us for a
change and then does something on that
change cool so how can we make this
better
oh we don't want to always just run
watch let's actually make watch part of
our default so let's come to our gulp
file and now what we want to do is we
want to run gulp dot watch at the end of
our initial gulp default task so to do
that all we have to do is in this array
down here add a comma and then watch
so now what's going to happen is any
time we run gulp the first thing it's
going to do is compile our scripts then
compile our styles and then it's going
to watch JavaScript to make sure that we
haven't changed anything and if it does
it's going to rebuild that JavaScript
every single time we make a save that
way we don't have to worry about running
this command ever if you make an
adjustment you'll know that the minified
version is always going to be the latest
version also this is going to be the
strategy we're going to use to run sass
within gulp cool so now we can stop this
and to illustrate this we can just type
gulp and now you can see it's run our
scripts it's run our styles and now it's
run our watch and likewise if we make
any changes to our JavaScript our mange
is come back you can see it's once again
run our scripts task okay so now we've
started to build out this nice robust
gulp file but we still have lots more to
do so in the next video we're going to
show you how to compile sass within gulp
and then from there we're going to keep
on building upon this to keep adding
more and more useful things until you
can't believe how you ever lived without
something like
so check it out we're going to keep that
going in the next video so as always
this is Scott with level of Tut's if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment in the video or hit us up at
Twitter or Facebook or anywhere we love
to hear from you so thanks for watching
and I'll see you the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
