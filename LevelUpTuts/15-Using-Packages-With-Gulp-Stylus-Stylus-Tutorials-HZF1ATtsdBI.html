up tutorials in this video we're gonna
pick up where we left off by getting a
gulp up and running using the packages
that we had using our stylus watch
command that we were using before so now
you're going to learn how you can have
packages within stylus and gulp and have
it all working just how we had it before
in a way that you don't have to run some
sort of non configurable long stylus
watch command so let's get going on that
right now okay so now that we have this
officially watching now let's get our
gulp file setup so that we can go ahead
and use some packages here
so in this stylus function right here
that we're piping in what we need to do
is pass in a bracket here just like so
and inside of our brackets is going to
be the value of this object which is
going to be used and then we're gonna
have colon now use accepts an array now
the array it's going to accept is going
to be of functions of various plugins so
if we save this right now it's not going
to necessarily do anything different
what we need to do is we need to bring
in our plugins so let's bring in our
first plugin which we'll want to use and
let's actually use
let's do typographic first so let's head
over to our terminal once more now we
can type NPM install - - save - dev and
let's install typographic so it's T Y
tio gr a pH IC type of graphic okay
let's head back to our project and you
can now see in our package file we have
typographic two point nine point three
so instead of our use statement here
inside of this array we can simply use
the typographic
function after we import it by using
this require up here so let's go ahead
and copy one of these we can just say a
typo graphic just like that
and the require is going to be a simply
typographic this is just the name of the
package D NPM package and now we have
access to this type of graphic function
that we can use in here with parentheses
just like so now in our CSS file in our
stylus let's come up at the top here and
let's use import and then import
typographic here now once more let's run
an article watch Styles command and you
can see it's watching our Styles for any
sort of changes now let's go ahead and
save one of those we can save and you
can see it's compiling just fine it's
not throwing any errors let's go ahead
and actually use this and make sure that
it is in fact coming in now to make sure
this is in fact working we go ahead and
simply use the type of graphic mixin
which is just typographic with
parentheses here now if you save this
you can check out your command line
you'll notice that there's not throwing
any errors or anything now if we head
over to our CSS we're getting a whole
bunch of code here that wasn't there
basically everything we needed to set up
our type of graphic so it's clearly
found typographic in our gulp file here
and it's compiling with it now we want
to use nib same thing let's go ahead and
you add a nib to this project I'm gonna
stop I'm gonna do stop our stylus watch
by doing ctrl C and now let's go ahead
and add nib so we simply have to do NPM
install - - save - dev nib and I beat
just like that okay nib is in our
project now once more just like we do
the type of graphic we can just copy
this line directly and then change the
things that say typographic - nib and
we're going to require nib just like so
now let's go ahead and just add this to
the array here simply by saying comma
nib just like that now in our CSS our
stylus we can just say import
and then inside of quotes nib just like
so now let's go ahead and try one of
these mix-ins
we can just say fixed it :
we can just say fixed : and we can say
something like bottom right check out
our CSS and below all this stuff and I
actually remember we never started our
watch command so we can say go watch :
styles enter okay it's now watching our
styles we'll save this
head over to our CSS and you'll notice
that this new mixin is officially
working because we're getting position
fixed bottom 0 right 0 so adding any
additional stylist package is going to
be the exact same we're essentially
installing with NPM install and we're
using safe dev to add it to our package
file here and then we're going to be
adding it in our gulp file as with it
require and then adding it right here in
our use what's great about stuff like
this is once you build up your own sort
of workflow of all these packages you
like to use you can just keep your gulp
file from project to project simply just
dragging the file over or whatever and
reusing it for anytime you need to and
then you have all these utilities baked
right into whatever project you are
working on ready to get going cool so
this is how you use cope to control
stylus watch your code and just
generally build your project if you want
to learn more about gulp
check out the gulp series on level up
tutorials it's really super good at
getting you a good handle on things like
live reload autoprefixer it shows you
how to write various tasks default tests
all sorts of stuff so check that out so
check that out and augment what you
learned it with this video with the
stuff you learned with that one with
that series and you're going to be
flying with gulp so as always this is
Scott with level of tutorials and family
questions or comments if you come in the
video
SEPA Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
