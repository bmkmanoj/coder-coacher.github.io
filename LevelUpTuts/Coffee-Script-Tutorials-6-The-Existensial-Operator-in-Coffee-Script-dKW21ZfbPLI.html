of Tut's and today I'll be doing a quick
overview of the existential operator so
what this is is it basically checks to
make sure a variable isn't null or
undefined which can come in super handy
and the best part is it's one character
it's just a question mark okay okay so
let's first let's check to see if
something exists so we want to say let's
try name if name has been said you know
exists right so we can just say if name
and then question mark then we can say
yell name so or just yell in general
whatever okay so if name question mark
yell okay let's say this and see what it
compiles to okay will click over to our
Jas and you now can see it's saying if
the name is not know then yell cool well
it knows that name is already defined so
it's going to say if name Danielle okay
but let's say we want to say something
like let's say if gender ok gender has
not been defined then we can say you
know if gender hasn't been defined then
let's do something let's define gender
as male okay so let's save this and
let's click back here
and you can see it's compiled - if
typeof gender is not equal to undefined
and gender is not equal to null then
gender is equal to male so what if
genders already been defined and let's
say we want to just check to make sure
it's not null well there's a quick way
of doing that let's exit out of this and
we can just say gender and we can just
have this be equal to nothing okay and
we can say gender question mark equals
and then male so now that genders
already been defined this is going to
check to see if gender is null or not so
you can see the code that is generated
if gender is equal to null then set
gender is equal to male okay so that's a
little quick way of writing this
statement here just to check to see if
something small or not you can always
put this question mark here the question
mark is the existential operator okay
so using the existential operator you
can check the existence of a variable in
JavaScript with one character this is
pretty fantastic and get really excited
it's a pretty cool so that's it for this
lesson
in the next tutorials we're gonna be
yelling anything even more cool stuff in
CoffeeScript lots more to learn lots
more to come but the best part is is
it's not hard okay and the cool part is
you can get start using it today just
save a dog coffee file compile it and
you're on your way okay as always if you
have any questions or comments hit us up
in the comments / at LevelUp tuts on
twitter and unless know what you're
thinking
thanks all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
