up huts and today we're going to talk
about something that I think is really
great in html5 and that's the custom
data attributes I'm sure many other
people would agree that it's great as
well and so an HTML you're used to
attributes right so let's look at some
HTML and we have some attributes here
like controls is an attribute date/time
is an attribute update these are all
element attributes and we've been using
these in HTML as long as we've been
writing HTML and now we can specify our
own data attributes which we can use in
all sorts of ways so what these are
doing is it's basically storing custom
data into our website that's attaching
data to a particular particular element
and it's pretty cool because this allows
us to bring in this information using
all sorts of useful ways and we don't
have to do so with Ajax or anything like
that and it actually is ignored by the
user agent entirely so so let's keep
going and let's just check this out in
action
so let's I'm gonna go ahead and delete
this audio for example so we don't have
this puppet up here but for example we
have these figure with images and
perhaps these were like a portfolio
piece or something like that and these
were three separate images two maybe
three different portfolio pieces and we
wanted them to link to that particular
portfolio piece so I'm gonna go ahead
and add some anchors in here let's just
do this and they are going to be linking
to nothing right now just like this and
what we're going to do on these anchors
is we're going to add a custom data
attribute first we're gonna add a class
to them so these are all gonna have a
class of let's just say
portfolio item and we can give these a
data - and then after the - we can call
this whatever we want however we want it
to be something that's unique to the
application we don't want it to be
something that it potentially can
afflict we don't want to use something
stupid like data height or something
like that if we don't want to use really
anything that you know could possibly
have another name you know we don't want
to have this like data time or something
like that I mean I suppose you could but
you might want to have it more specific
than that like data event time or
something like that so we can call this
data port folio item and it started just
by coincidence right now that's the same
as the class however they both described
the item so it's okay and we can have it
equals and really what these are doing
is the attribute is going to be a string
essentially but we don't have to wrap it
in quotes it just has to be wrapped in
these quotes right here so if I say this
is attribute number or portfolio number
one portfolio number two and portfolio
item number three we can then use this
data and we can use it in the JavaScript
very nicely
so let's write some JavaScript down at
the bottom and just a quick example on
how we could use this and this isn't
going to necessarily do anything
important but it will show you that you
can access this data attribute and then
maybe I'll plant some ideas about how
you might be using that so let's check
it out let's use some jQuery here and
I'm just going to go to my main J's file
and I'm just gonna wrap everything of
course in a function that it's gonna
fire once you know the page is finished
loading here keep in mind if you're
interested learning jQuery I'm going to
be having a JavaScript and jQuery video
series coming in the future I don't know
when that's gonna be there probably
gonna be the next video series on the
line
so it's whenever I get time to start
those series and what we're gonna do is
we're going to look in the document for
portfolio items class of the item with a
class of portfolio item actually I'm
just gonna copy and paste this just to
make sure I didn't have any typos so in
my least favorite situations and we're
gonna say on quick and in this click
function we are going to have it just
shoot out the attribute we're just gonna
have it alert the attribute whenever we
click on it so that's going to be nice
and easy basically just how we can
access this attribute with JavaScript
here and we can say this and then dot
and then oh we can go attr together this
attribute and then in here we're gonna
be looking for we're gonna be looking
for data portfolio item right here and
we can set this equal to var item num is
equal to this the data portfolio item
and we can go ahead and alert this item
num
like this so now when we click on a
particular item it should yell out which
data attribute it has so we click on
number one number one cool number two
number two number three and number three
so let's say we had some particular
content that was associated with these
let's say we had divs that head of class
names like portfolio item 1 you could
then trigger something like showing
portfolio item number 1 so let's try
that let's just have a div here
I'm I throw it anywhere in our page just
right here for fun and we can have this
be a div and it's going to have a class
of
folio item one just like this and it's
going to have test blah blah
just like that cool and we're also going
to have portfolio item number one hidden
by default so in our CSS let's come to
our CSS here and in the appropriate
place here where we have all of our
other user created CSS portfolio item
numb number one display:none
perfect refresh our page of course we
don't see any blah blah blah pretty cool
okay now we're going to say we want to
find something and we want to find the
div with the class of portfolio item and
then - and then now we can concatenate
our item numb on the end of here just
like this and we wanted to say we want
to show this so we want to have it fade
in just like that
beautiful now let's refresh the page and
let's click on this first one and we
should see that div fade in test blah
blah blah okay so now what this gets a
little bit more interesting is if we
have all of these portfolio items let's
say portfolio item sure this is more
suitable for an ID we could say this is
portfolio item rep and in our CSS all
portfolio item reps are display:none
just like that and in here we can give
it an ID of portfolio item one just like
that we have test blah blah blah now
let's paste this down here two more
times and let's say we have portfolio
item number two portfolio item number
three and we say test
um Tok whatever numb to to to to to to
to to and this one's number 3 3 3 3 2 2
3 3 so just so we can distinguish them
so you see that none of those are
showing up on the page of course and now
let's adjust our JavaScript to be
looking for the ID the class refresh now
when we click this number 3 shows up I'm
going to click to number 2 shows up and
we click one number one shows up so as
you can see this is a really powerful
way of adding data to a particular
element and then you can then use that
data with JavaScript to do all sorts of
fun stuff in fact we're working on the
cool site that I'll have to post once
it's ready that it uses this data
attribute in a really cool way so check
it out try it out make your own data
attributes and use that data in your
JavaScript as always this is scott with
level up tuts if you have any questions
or comments please leave a comment the
video below hit us up at Twitter level
up tuts around Facebook pretty much
anywhere and a check out our website
it's coming along it's not quite there
yet I'm hoping to keep on plugging on
that and just keep moving but as always
we're doing this in our spare time so I
like to say every once in a while we do
accept donations because we do these
videos in our spare time I'm also
considering doing a Kickstarter to add
some really cool premium features to the
website like downloadable source
downloadable videos so if that is a cool
idea and you're into it let me know I
added a survey to our Facebook page you
can take that and just tell us a little
bit more about what you want to see at a
level up tuts
so as always thanks for watching and
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
