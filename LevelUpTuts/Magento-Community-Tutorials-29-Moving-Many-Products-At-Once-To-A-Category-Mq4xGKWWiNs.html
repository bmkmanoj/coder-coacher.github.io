up tuts and today we're gonna be going
over more backend stuff now I'm gonna
get into some more development tutorials
in a few lessons here but I did want to
get back to some of the using Magento
lessons because there's still plenty of
stuff in the back end here we haven't
gone over so I'm gonna be going back and
forth I'll do a few of each you know
sort of back and forth to the rest of
this series so what we're gonna do here
is we're going to add a whole bunch of
products to one category at once so in
the past you've gone into your manage
products you've edited a product this
imported product whatever and we said
our categories we're going to be just
the ones that we check they're gonna be
tutorials and then we checked Magento
well I guess now we can check magenta of
tutorials but either way this is how we
changed the category and you think if
you have a ton of products that might be
sort of tedious to move a whole bunch at
once well let's go to catalog and manage
categories and I'll show you how to you
can add or remove lots of products at
once
let's say for some reason all these
men's shoes you know we wanted them this
one category to be men's and women's
shoes we don't want any particular men's
category anymore
so let's click this women's shoes
because already has 34 and we could say
will change this category to men and
women's and let's say this category so
as you can see it's just MZ 30 for
women's shoes and it's still now if we
wanted to take away all of these men's
products we could just simply deactivate
this catalog or category so we can say
no it's not active and we'll save this
one but now we still have these 22 men's
shoes that we don't know what to do with
in fact if we were to in this men's
category if we were to click category
products you can see all of the products
right here and so this is really cool
but
it has all this stuff here we want these
products all within men's and women's if
you notice that most of these have the
word men's in it so we can come to here
so the first thing we want to do is take
a look at this check box area let's say
there's options starts at yes and the SS
showing you all of the products in this
category NOAA showing you products that
aren't in this category in any is any
product at all let's go to no because
the products we're looking for aren't
already in this category and we're gonna
type in men's just like that looks like
I hit enter first but it doesn't matter
it got all these and it looks like these
are all of the shoes we were looking for
and if we want to select all of these we
can just click this select all and then
click Save category and if you'll notice
we now have a whole bunch of new shoes
within this new category now we have our
men's and women's shoes all together we
move the whole bunch of products at once
and now let's say you decided you want
the shoes it's not it's no longer gonna
be men's anymore you're sort of done
with this category as men's but you want
this to be children's shoes and let's
save this and now we we still have 22
products associated with it I'm gonna
change it to active by the way and I
don't want any these products associated
with it anymore well I can come into
category products again I can filter
this by yes and then I can uncheck this
one at the top save this and that's
wiping out all of the products from this
category it looks like we had two more
left over here oops let's uncheck this
again and save category once more and
now we have our children's category and
has zero it's ready to go and we have
our men's and women's with all of our
men's shoes in it and everything is nice
and good you can also search by ID let's
say if you wanted to if you knew the ID
range or let's say they all had a
specific SKU pattern like if you wanted
to get all the Steve Madden shoes they
all started with Steve here you can even
search from price if you know that but
either way you can control a lot of
products within a category at once
through this category
and then category products as always if
you have any questions please leave a
comment the video and hit us up at
Twitter and level up tuts let's know
what you're thinking this is Scott with
level up tuts and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
