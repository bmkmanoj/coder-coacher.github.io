of tutorials and today we're going to
show you how you can install meteor on
your Windows computer using the meteor
windows preview so let's get going on
that right now so to get started all we
really need is to come to github.com and
this URL is essentially too long for me
to just read out so I'm going to put it
in the description of the video and you
can just grab it from there but it's
essentially preview of media or on
Windows from the official meteor repo so
if you google preview of meteor on
Windows chances are this will be the
first thing that comes up or you can
just click click the link in the
description of the video now from here
all we really need to do is come to
downloading the preview the time of
making this video which is a in March
here we have February 9th version 0.1
point 7 is the latest version so let's
go ahead and click this install windows
preview it's going to download an exe
that we can then select and run this is
going to open a command prompt that's
going to install meteor for us
okay now that meteor is completely
installed we can then go ahead and click
any key to exit because it says we want
to close this command prompt of course
before we can use the command so to get
a new command prompt I'm just going to
come here to the search bar I'm just
going to search for command
ok command prompt so I have a new window
here now from our user directory here
I'm actually going to run a meteor
create command so just like we did in
the other videos I'm a tech meteor
create and then we can go ahead and type
resolutions because that's the name of
the application that we're making so
meteor create resolutions inside the
text size is so small I'm not sure how
you can bump up the text size on the
command prompt on Windows here if you
know please let me know and I can make
those improvements in later videos so
let's go ahead and click enter and this
is going to go ahead and
set up our media application now we can
change directories into resolutions by
typing CD space resolutions now let's go
ahead and run the meteor command so we
can type meteor just like that and it's
going to access firewalls sort of
complaining you can allow access it but
it's now telling us that our app is
running at localhost colon 3000 so let's
go ahead and type localhost colon 3000
and as you can see we now have meteor up
and running on Windows and it's totally
working and we're not having to use
vagrant or anything like that so this is
a great working example however it's
still a preview so there might be some
things a little funky if you're running
you're some problems it's best to check
the meteor repo to see if these issues
have been determined by other people so
that way you can see if what you're
running into is something that's a
common issue that they're already
knowing working on once the full release
is released I'm going to make a new
video updating this however in the
meantime you can check out the preview
or we'll do another video on vagrant in
the future showing you how to get meteor
up and running on a Linux server using
vagrant and Windows so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments like to
come in the video hit us up at Twitter
or Facebook and level up tutorials
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
