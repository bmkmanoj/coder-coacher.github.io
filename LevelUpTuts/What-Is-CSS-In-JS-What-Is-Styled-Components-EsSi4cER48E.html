up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be doing another what is Wednesday
and then this what is Wednesday we're
going to be talking about CSS in jas and
what is CSS and Jas and we're also going
to be talking about what is stab
components because that's a library I
personally love to use for CSS in j/s
okay so first off what is CSS nsj and
this one is really easy because it has
what it is directly in the name I mean
it's basically describing it and the the
basic way to understand this is instead
of writing your CSS in sass or CSS or or
stylus or any of these other CSS
languages right you are writing your CSS
in your JavaScript files and that right
there is enough to make some people very
angry I don't know why for some reason
this topic attracts a lot of strong
strong strong opinion so I'm going to
ask that you keep an open mind for the
remainder of this next video so that I
can talk to you a little bit about CSS
and j/s why it matters why it's cool why
it's not cool and just a little bit
about styled components as well so to
kick things off I think I'm going to do
a what are the pros of CSS in JavaScript
why the heck would you want to ever
write your CSS in JavaScript I mean
after all we have CSS we have post
processors we have all these great
things post CSS or any of that stuff
right why the heck would you want to
take those skills out of CSS and move to
JavaScript well there's a lot of great
features and a lot of them have to do
with sort of little things that add up
and to big things and a lot of these
things might not even be features that
you feel like you need until you try
them and all of a sudden realize how
nice they are
for instance one of the main features
about CSS and JavaScript is the
interactivity with JavaScript now it's
not like you can't interact with your
CSS and JavaScript without CSS and jet
and j/s but most of these libraries make
ways of working in that very very easy
instead of just overriding some CSS
properties that are set somewhere else
based on a class this is actually
typically affecting properties that come
in
two things like a styled component and
update the component CSS in real-time it
can be really really really super easy
in the first time you ever have to have
something that JavaScript effects your
CSS
you're gonna immediately see the benefit
or just how nice it is now I get that
you can do all sorts of CSS manipulation
with JavaScript and we've been doing it
that way for a long time but let me tell
you this is better in my opinion this is
just flat-out better it's a lot easier
it's it's much more explicit because
you're modifying or updating properties
right there instead of overriding
something that's written in another file
or perhaps overriding something that is
just in and totally another scoped CSS
okay so it makes working with JavaScript
very easy and then it even opens the
door to something like element queries
right where you're actually manipulating
the CSS based on the width of the
element rather than the width of the
viewport like myself and others have
talked quite a bit about element queries
in the past saying that I believe
strongly that they are something that
we're gonna be using all the time in the
near future so maybe what element
queries deserve their own what is
Wednesday video but it certainly makes
working with things like element queries
really super nice and easy
next it just allows you to work in
JavaScript easily if we check out some
of my code here and it's not really
anything crazy going on but I wrote a
tint function okay and you might be
thinking hey there's tint functions in
sass or stylus or whatever in your right
there are but we can actually write our
own functions in JavaScript with
JavaScript code and use them directly in
our CSS allowing us to have total
flexibility as terms of what the
framework is actually offering verse
what you can write yourself and
therefore it opens up a huge possibility
for writing functions and JavaScript
stuff that are going to modify your code
now you can do a lot of this stuff in
sass or stylus sure but this is much of
greater because you have all of
JavaScript to handle this stuff and you
can use all of your JavaScript skills to
do that another thing that people really
like is how scoped it is now again this
is the the argument to this point is
that well if you're good enough at CSS
the scoping shouldn't matter because you
should be able to have a system like BEM
or something like that
to handle the Cascade are handled
different scoping things but anyone
who's written CSS knows it's frustrating
when you write something and it modifies
something you didn't expect it to so get
good at CSS is obviously a response to
this but let me tell you by having the
scoped language stuff as on by default
like it is with CSS and jss and when you
write your CSS in JavaScript it's scoped
to whatever you're using it for
it makes keeping track of that way
easier because it's scoped by default
and if you want to embrace the Cascade
and do all of that stuff with in CSS
those skills and abilities are still
open to you with CSS and j/s it's not
like someone's removing those things and
getting good at CSS is not necessarily a
great argument against this I think this
system even if you know people who are
very talented at CSS enjoy this enjoy
writing CSS code I still think this
system is easier to write scoped CSS now
I say this as someone who's been a
serial defender of CSS and someone who
loves CSS CSS has always been one of my
favorite things I've never been the guy
who's been saying that CSS is bad or
anything like that I'm always been the
person defending CSS on Twitter or
reddit or whatever and let me tell you I
still think this system is better ok so
other than that ok we have these two
scope things you can work with
JavaScript easier another thing I really
like is in a system like styled
components it can make your code way
more readable because instead of working
with a layout that's a div with a class
name of layout you're working with a
layout component named layout
it makes your code way more readable it
makes your components take up less space
it's less characters everything is way
more succinct it's easier to parse and
then overall it just makes more sense
when you're looking at it you can build
up your own styled component libraries
and have those as an easily on boorda
before anyone using your application or
coding in your codebase I'll talk a
little bit about Mura when I talk about
solid components specifically now in
addition to some of those pros a lot of
the stuff too is you can use a lot of
you are built in JavaScript tooling for
things like dead code elimination and
server-side rendering is now going to
render your CSS into your
HTML on a style tag along with a unique
class this way you take care of all of
the benefits of things like inline
styles without actually having to have
inline styles it's really quite a
magnificent system I really really
really enjoy this okay so this is what
is CSS and j/s and why you might use it
now let's talk a little bit about the
pros and cons I already talked about the
pros so cons time we if you just google
I did this for fun why use CSS nsj it's
funny
the very first three things listed oh
one is positive one is I swore to use I
swear never to use CSS nsj and here are
my six reasons why I was wrong this
one's kind of in between all you need to
know about CSS and J's and this third
one stop using CSS and J s and this is
the perfect encapsulation of this entire
argument here everyone has very strong
opinions now I can't necessarily
recommend this table using CSS and J's
article I found all of their arguments
to not be so good I'm not picking on
this author in particular one of their
arguments let me find it here was that
for using styled components makes for
more succinct code I actually made this
argument in this video just a minute ago
and this one really bugs me because the
example is totally biased and totally
skewed they say hey ticket name yeah
sure ticket name is shorter than Stiles
ticket name for the class name but then
they go on for their second example and
say tiny bit longer style name is longer
than Stiles dot longer style name not
longer dot tiny bit longer style name so
they didn't even keep the same naming
scheme and if they would have the second
one would have been longer totally
invalidating their point so this one
this argument against this is totally
wrong even their example doesn't work
here but that doesn't mean there aren't
valid arguments against CSS in
JavaScript because there's tons of valid
arguments against the SS and JavaScript
but personally the one that I feel like
is the biggest most important red flag
about CSS and JavaScript is the Locken
now sure you have lock in with sass or
stylus you have a reasonable assurance
that those platforms aren't going away
because they have a big audience but
with CSS and J's you are locked in to
one JavaScript okay and that's fine too
you're locked in to react okay yeah
maybe if I want to move to view maybe
there's a library that does something
and then three you're locked into that
third library which is an even smaller
group of people using it called either
style component style JSX or any of
these other libraries right so if you
bet wrong and the other ones become
really popular those libraries go away
you're gonna have to do some refactoring
down the line to either move to another
one or rewrite all your stuff in CSS so
to me the biggest argument against style
CSS in
j/s is the Locken now other arguments
include things like the tooling not
being good the tooling is great I write
CSS it's basically inside of a string
here like this and I get all my auto
completion on my syntax howling the
tooling is absolutely fine Auto
prefixing is on by default you don't
have to turn on anything so I don't
really see that necessarily as being
super valid either however setup
configuration learning the stuff is all
brand new right if you've already been a
huge fan of CSS and you used to globally
styled CSS and stuff like that you'll
have to spend some time learning a new
system how to do things what are the
best practices you'll spend a little bit
of time on growing pains and stuff like
that and certainly those are valid
arguments right you're going to have to
spend time to learn this stuff and I
mean there's plenty of other you know
criticisms as well but I really think
the biggest one you have to think about
is the lock and do you want to be locked
into this platform now for me the
lock-in was not a big enough deal and I
decided to go ahead and use styled
components specifically so let's talk a
little bit about what our styled
components right now so styled
components like their name suggests our
components that you write with this
library called styled components and
typically writing a react component you
could do so as a stateless functional
component this is just a function
opening some like JSX code or you could
do it without JSX or you could do it in
components there's a whole bunch of ways
you can make a react component what's
fun about styled components is that
these are really basic the easy to make
components you can see from this example
we just have a constant button is equal
to styled dot and then the element name
we have some back ticks and then you
write your CSS as if it was CSS I mean
this is copy and paste CSS nothing fancy
here some of the other CSS and j/s
libraries have this be an object inside
instead of a string and then therefore
you end up having to do things like
camel casing your property values and
wrapping your values and strings I like
this way better because it feels like
CSS it's the least resistance for me
coming from CSS right now in addition to
this kind of stuff you not you now have
these components that you can reuse like
normal react components I use this stuff
all over my site for instance follow me
I have a BTN which is a button styled
link right to be a an href with a class
of button or something like that if this
was normal CSS but it's basically a
button anchor and I am able to pass in
any sort of property and that gets
passed right through into the anchor tag
so my href here gets passed right
through into the anchor tag also I have
things like a sheet card and a card a
heading and these things are components
that I can use anywhere one of the
things I really liked about my system
here is that I basically threw all of my
elements into their own files and I have
an index file that imports them all so
that way I can import any of these
things just as import sheet card and
header from UI elements this makes using
this stuff really easy and onboarding
could be as simple as somebody having a
list of all of the different components
in your site and having to memorize
class names and variations and modifiers
your all of a sudden saying hey here are
the different components that you're
using or available to you this is what
they look like they're super easy just
drop them in here like this right so I
found the organizational instructional
things about styled components to be one
of their biggest strengths again I
really like this library there's a lot
of people using it and there's a lot of
additional library tools so I might
consider to do a mini-series on styled
components and all of the excellent
excellent features in here that I'm
glossing over right now if you're
interested in that let me know in the
comments okay so this is what is CSS and
j/s I hope I gave you a good totally
non-biased I mean I am using styled
components but I am a big fan of CSS it
did seem like I spent a lot more time on
the prose I'm not unaware of that but
honestly I don't necessarily buy a ton
of the arguments against it other than
hey I don't want to write my CSS in
JavaScript that's a totally valid
argument ya get it right and and I
myself as that same way all I request is
that you keep an open mind and
if you're working in this stuff give it
a try you can hate it after you try it
but don't declare that you hate it
before you've even tried it because then
you won't ever learn anything okay so I
want to hear your thoughts about this
stuff I want to hear your tools tips
techniques on style components I want to
hear your favorite libraries of CSS and
Jas I want to hear why you do or don't
use CSS and J's I want to hear your pros
and cons but but with the caveat is I
want real points made here I want I want
actual this is why I use it not I don't
use it because they're dumb if you leave
a comment like that I'm going to delete
it because that's not an argument that's
not helping the conversation here what I
want to do is have a real conversation
about the pros and cons of styled
components and CSS and JavaScript
overall as a whole based on any library
that you're using so as always this is
Scott what level of tutorials if you
