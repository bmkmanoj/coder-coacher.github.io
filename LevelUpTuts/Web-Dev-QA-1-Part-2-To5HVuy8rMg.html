tutorials and and dr. Courtney Delinsky
answering your web development questions
here so this is part two of two of the
first level of tutorials questions and
answers session now this is part two of
two of hopefully a longer running series
so if you have any questions you know
leave a question in the video and let us
know what you want to when I have
answered so ready to get started on
these next batch I'm ready cool good
okay so let's move on to super cop 104
you know I still haven't seen that movie
unz Super Cup no is it good yeah there's
an it kind of violent no there's like
five supercar you we thinking of Robocop
haha i am thinking of rover yeah you see
too much super cop is Jackie Chan you've
seen super cub oh I have I love Jackie
Chan yeah you seen you've probably seen
all of the super cups that's the one
with maggie cheung and oh yeah I
remember okay I out sort of blend
together all these kung fu movies you
make me wet yeah she watches a lot of
all right anyways super crap 104 says
I'm curious about the differences
between freelance agency and large
company work do you have experience with
these is there a stark difference
currently at a larger company but i was
thinking of moving to an agency for more
challenging and diversified work but on
the other hand i really enjoy a steady
job and the good work-life balance where
I'm at what are your thoughts on this
and I think you actually are really
perfect to answer this question because
yeah they have a diverse background and
experience and you're kind of at a new
stage in your career yeah this is a good
question and it's one that I feel like a
lot of people deal with it's one that
I've dealt with its when I've actually
even been asked about an interview like
will you be able to work in this
environment because your previous
experiences like this so I started out
in an agency well actually I started out
freelance but it wasn't full-time
freelance so it's a little bit different
so I started essentially at an agency
and I really loved working
an agency especially because of the
frequency in which projects turn over um
it is a small agent there's a small
agency like 12 people so you get a lot
of a lot of new work right so i really
liked having really just sometimes going
into work and having a project be over
in two months and then you move on to
the next one and the beauty of that is
if you don't have somebody saying you
have to use this technology in this
technology in this technology and you
get to make those decisions yourself
then you actually get a lot of freedom
to learn a lot so I took that time it
was like okay this this website i'm
taking this entire clients work to learn
SAS on this project and so then I did
SAS and then oh maybe I'll take this
entire project to learn a different
maybe like Jade or one of these HTML
processors or something but either way
or new content management system or new
just new coding languages in general so
the frequency of which projects turnover
and the more freedom you get to choose
your technologies on each project
because at the end of the day as long as
the project works the clients happy
they're able to modify what they're able
to modify as long as that all works then
it I mean who cares what technology
you're working with as long as the
website is performative SEO compliant
and all those things so personally I
really like that about an agency what I
didn't like about the agency is sort of
what you did say about the stability so
I mean I remember because it was a small
agency yeah there was a good eight
months or something may I don't know
maybe six months where we are everybody
at the agency took a pay cut because the
work just wasn't coming in and uh and
that's not anything you can really help
I mean you can look for work for the
agency and you can help out but if the
the clients aren't there then then
you're not hey you know you're
responsible for that and you have to to
work hard to get that so in a larger
agency you won't have to worry about
those you probably just collect a salary
and you can
run your projects and whatever and then
that's great too but you know it in down
times when when work is low you could
find yourself boarded if you're not the
type of person who can strive to learn
new things or go and even explore new
topics on your own then you might find
yourself playing games on your phone at
work like I've had a couple of
co-workers do at some point yeah yeah so
uh so those are the good stuff plus and
minuses of an agency I think with
anything you have ups and downs large
companies are great large projects are
great because you do feel more of a
sense of ownership in the code you get
to see this code through and evolve and
you get to grow and learn with the code
but then you also pay for your past
mistakes a lot more let's say you chose
to use bootstrap at the very beginning
of a project and months down the line
you're like I'm not using any of
bootstrap but I'm depending on it still
because it's here and I created the
project with it you can't just rip it
out so there's a lot that goes into a
big project that is going to change
really how you how you work with it for
better for worse and and in really
working with a large company in a large
project it could be a very good thing
for the right person personally I'm a
little too um yeah she's laughing a word
cuz she knows ah I don't know spastic
with my choices and things you're not
spastic but you like you like variety i
think i'm writing get bored easily
that's right yeah so personally the
agency work a little bit more my pace
where i could where i could get that
change up all the time but it really
comes down to personalities if you're
the type of person that really likes
take ownership over a large amount of
code and really make that stuff then a
large project could really be for you in
the end of the day I think as long as
you're growing your skills I don't think
you should worry about stability because
the job market is hot enough right now
that if you know it's not working out
where you're right you'd go somewhere
else right yeah I mean really you get
you get lots of recruiter calls and yeah
there's lots of available
lady I wish I had that same yeah
opportunity for myself but yeah it's a
great career you would say yeah I think
so yeah okay all right let's move on so
Christian Christian wants to know what
is your best practice to debug in meteor
air so maybe he means errors in meteor
yeah yeah okay so what is your process
and what tools do you yeah so for a
meteor specific uh you know what even
just JavaScript in general my my
philosophy is like the more visibility
you have the better now javaScript isn't
out of the box you know you don't it's
not the easiest to the bug the chrome
tools are getting a lot better where you
can step inside of functions and stuff
like that but really I prefer to do the
old Council log everything so give me as
much information as possible like if I'm
having a bug I'll just throw Council
logs all over the place so I can really
understand what's what at what point in
and where something's going wrong so
what's it council log council log is a
council dot log it's log as a method of
counsel and it allows you to essentially
print the error in your JavaScript
council in in your developer tools or if
it's a server side in your server side
error logs or something like that so a
council log essentially is just logging
the the particular whatever you tell it
to lock I mean they could log you know
hi Courtney if you wanted to say that or
it could log the value of a variable or
a function or anything like that or are
you just pointing your error in there or
is it like your whole printout of your
code you're putting in like so if I was
having like a a plus B uh-huh and I was
expecting the answer to be three but
it's not I would counsel vlog a I would
count a lot be I would counsel log a
plus B and then I could see the value of
a I could see the value of B and I could
see the value of them being added
together and find out where the
discrepancy is okay so it's like it
essentially just printing the value of
things you might not
see essentially and your hang on screen
or something okay I think I'm just gonna
have to pretend like I understand yeah
sure you all do all right anything else
you want to say yeah because that's not
me your specific so meteor specifically
meteor toys is a package there's a paid
version which I would recommend because
even though it's a paid extension to
meteor which is I mean net center goes
against the grain of a lot of these paid
packages it's worth it it's totally
worth it it's a paid tool that allows
you to really see everything see your
session see your your database at a
glance to your users I mean um media
that's a good question so I mean it's a
hundred bucks and if you have a if you
have like a sole proprietorship you're a
freelance or anything like that or
you're working for a company they can
they can buy it for you write it off
it's definitely something you pay for
once you use it on every project I would
highly recommend there's a lot of a lot
of great tools in there specifically and
that's really all I do for meteor meteor
um I use webstorm as an ID and for that
it it helps me more with javascript
errors than does with meteor specific
things but yeah between using webstorm
meteor toys and just throwing council
logs everywhere I think that's pretty
sufficient for myself yeah okay so
you're saying it's worth the investment
yeah yeah yeah absolutely not some all
right Aaron wants to know well so he
says he's from the US but currently he's
living abroad for this reason he's
thinking of applying to more remote
positions he wants to know are these
positions generally harder or easier to
obtain and do they require a higher
skill level what are your thoughts on
this yeah so uh as somebody who has
worked remotely it is going to be harder
to get a job that starts out remote now
what you want to do is look for websites
that are specifically geared towards
remote jobs i think one's called
remotely or something like that if you
look if you just google for remote job
board there's a lot of them
looking for these jobs they exist and
that they exist and there's more and
more and more and more of them there's a
lot of companies that are becoming more
comfortable working remote and in fact
if I get a recruiter email like one of
the first things I do is I respond with
do they allow remote work um so I mean
put your resume on job boards put your
resume on monster keep your Linkedin
up-to-date and just ask don't be afraid
to ask is there an opportunity for
remote because even if they hadn't
thought about that originally chances
are other people have asked or maybe
they're they're growing more comfortable
will the work require a higher skill
level I would say most likely yes but I
think it more so than a higher skill
level it's going to just involve being
more professional and more communicative
with the employer making them at ease
with the idea that you're not going to
be in office so making yourself
available via email chat phone whatever
having office hours where you're
actually working and have a plan really
like look into how other people work
remotely like I said with office hours
and a plan and things like that and come
to them and say I'd be in the office
these dis hours these days I'll be
available through these channels and
typically I think even a junior position
or something like that you you should be
able to find work remote regardless so
yeah they might require a higher skill
level but I don't think it's like an a
hard requirement I think you you will
find work that that doesn't that doesn't
require like the highest level or
something you'll find all up and down
the spectrum it's you know but people
want to work remotely so I think the
competition might be be higher so
serious thing you just have to be more
vocal and responsible about you know
what your time frame is and just be able
to talk to others yeah yeah yeah I think
that's a big part of it and you know
company culture is different at every
place you know some places are totally
against it in some places or need some
warming up and some places are all for
it so
remote job boards are your best place to
look second best places to simply just
ask who's ever you know applied for a
job and ask if it's remote possible
chances are if they have multiple people
interested they'll take somebody who's
going to be in the office nine times out
of ten over somebody who's not going to
be in the office but a lot of times
companies are looking for the right
person and the right person might not be
in the particular city state whatever it
is yeah okay all right Nathan says mmm I
want to be I want so badly to be a
master developer but it's been a
struggle I'm a developer and a graphic
designer on my development knowledge was
self-taught using Linda calm and a few
other resources level up totes being one
of them i'm also the only developer in
my office so there's no one to bounce
ideas off of um so he he struggles
because he um would it says he would be
developing code that loads fast that's
his biggest struggle sure um I've
learned my way around jQuery I'm pretty
good at working with PHP and is it my
sequel yep databases but my pages are
not very fast so he wants to know what
are the best practices for creating
efficient and fast web sites that and
are there any tips on speeding up
sluggish code with a larger server load
so sure did you get some of the
questions out of there yeah yeah I think
for me the thing i like to do was always
leverage other people's work at every
given chance I can I so very rarely am I
writing anything from scratch um and so
for if you're working with PHP my sequel
I mean I would build things on a CMS
where you do have those tools to to add
whatever performative options or plugins
or whatever I've already been created
for that particular CMS if you're not
interested in that laravel there's a big
community there's probably a lot there
for performance as well personally I
don't develop sites in laravel
unfamiliar with it but I'm sure there's
a lot of little tips and tricks here for
building performative websites for any
of those particular things but really I
don't know I mean I would trust myself
to to be able to troubleshoot these
things but I'm going to leverage a lot
of outside knowledge and see what other
people are really doing now in terms of
building a website that that scores
highly on page speed or something like
that it that functions quickly I would
recommend getting the Google PageSpeed
extension or using Google PageSpeed
there's also Yahoo's why slow they tell
you pretty flat out what you're doing
wrong so whether these are images that
are too large or maybe you're not
caching orgy zipping or anything like
that so there's a lot of little server
side tweaks that you could make if
you're hosting your website's yourself
you can install things like there's
actually an engine X or an Apache
depending on what you're using there's
an Apache module for Google PageSpeed
that essentially throws in all of google
page speeds recommended apache extension
so that's going to gzip correctly that's
going to do all your stuff to give you a
really nice score and I remember I threw
that on a server and my site went from
like a sea to an a in terms of page
speed and I made no modifications to my
code one so ever so there's a lot of
stuff there to building a performative
website I would recommend utilizing the
tools that exist online to do so why
slow PageSpeed and really just
understanding where exactly the slowdown
is is it happening a server if as a
server side slow down is the hardware
you're running the site on not good
enough there I mean there's a lot there
so really it's just about knowing where
the problem is and then leveraging the
tools that already exist and then you
know if if it comes down to it that
you're writing bad PHP where it's maybe
looping over something or really taking
too much time to pull in data and then I
that's why we look into really
leveraging other people's work again
with using maybe other systems that
already exist like laravel or a content
management system and that should really
go a long ways I think all right awesome
cool well this is really
yeah we're gonna do ask me to do this
I'm gonna do more of these so ask more
questions in the comments let us know
what you want us to answer more of maybe
what topics you want to talk about shoot
me an email anytime really just leave a
comment video ask us anything you want
and uh we're gonna answer your questions
in more of these Q&amp;amp;A videos yeah cool
all right well as always this is scott
with level up to Torrez and this is in
courtenay yes from Courtney dr. Courtney
to Linsky here and thanks for watching
and I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
