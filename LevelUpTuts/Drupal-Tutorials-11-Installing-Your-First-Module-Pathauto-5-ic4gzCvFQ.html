level up Tut's and today we're going to
pick up where we left off the last
lesson with URL aliases and what we're
going to want to accomplish is setting
up patterns so that when we create new
content our URLs are going to be nice
and clean
to accomplish this we're going to have
to install our first module and maybe a
couple others so to install our first
module what we're going to do is we're
going to go to drupal.org and under here
we're going to search for this
particular module that we're looking for
is called path auto typically though if
you want some sort of functionality and
you're trying to accomplish it in in
some sort of way yeah you know you just
want to go to the search bar search for
modules and see what you can find extra
thing pathauto spelled with one word
okay here it is okay so this is your
basic module page here you'll find all
sorts of things notice this says
requirements it's going to require this
token module as well so I'm just going
to open this in a new tab for after we
do this so here you can find all sorts
information about the version the the
known issues recommended modules over
here you have issue reports and bug
reports if you're having problems
typically you can come in here and see
if other people are having those
problems as well and there's usually
their bug fixes or patches or look
basically hopefully somebody is also
having that problem so that you can
troubleshoot and get to the bottom of
what the problem is so if we go down
here you'll see downloads this is just
like where you download a Drupal core
here there's recommended versions of
their releases and development releases
what we're going to download is the most
recent recommended for Drupal 7 and so
this is 7 X 1.0 and just grab the zip of
this it's going to download
so as we can see this path Auto file is
in my downloads if we go to our site
it's in htdocs' st we're going to go to
sites and then inside of here you'll
have all in default inside of all
there's a modules folder this is where
you're going to be putting this entire
path Auto folder so you're just going to
drag and drop this into your modules we
now have it there as you can see
prior to this tutorial I've also dropped
in a couple C tools and jQuery update
and views these are all ones we're going
to be using you know when we go over
those lessons I'll just have you install
them then but for now you know don't
worry about it okay so under
requirements it's also said that we need
token which I've opened here and token
is another module so some modules are
required by other modules and some
modules have requirements and basically
sometimes to achieve one bit of
functionality you have to install a
couple of different modules that work
together to achieve what you're looking
for so we're going to grab this
recommended this one right here and same
thing we're going to unzip it and we're
going to throw out right in our modules
folder if you notice in your site's main
folder not your site's folder itself but
in here there's also a modules folder
this is not where you're going to be
wanting to add contributed modules this
is where modules like the core modules
live so don't worry about this modules
folder don't put them in here put them
in sites all modules okay so now that
our modules are in their module folder
we're going to go back to our site and
in our site we're going to click this
modules link that's in your admin bar
okay this is just saying there's updates
for some for some modules will not worry
about that right now
so we'll scroll all the way down these
are all the modules we have installed
right now and we're going to find path
auto and token which are the two that we
just put in here and we're going to
check both of these boxes and we're
going to click Save and configure
save configuration' okay
options have been saved will cook out of
this now we're going to go back to
configuration search and metadata to URL
aliases and you feel notice now at the
top here there's pattern settings book
update delete aliases so these are a lot
more options than we had before
let's click patterns and here you'll see
that you can set up patterns so right
now the default pattern for all content
types is it's going to say content slash
node title well we just want this to say
no title okay I'm going to copy this and
for all article paths we're also going
to just leave it at the default so we
don't have to put anything there and
then basic pages we're going to leave it
at the default however for projects I
want my projects to live in a in a path
that says projects for spell that
correctly project and then slash node
title so now when we save these it's
going to always say projects and then
whatever the node title is I've done
most these replacement patterns these
will get a little bit complicated to
show you all sorts of things you can use
like node title you can also use node ID
content type all this stuff is available
for use if you click through these you
can see what's all here but right now
we're just going to use node title and
keep it simple in taxonomy it's going to
be term vocabulary we don't need to
change any of these because we're just
worrying about our pages right now so
save and continue okay
so now if you would expect to go to our
projects page you would expect to see
the new URL well that's not the case
that doesn't update any of your old
nodes just the ones from here on out so
to update all of your old nodes let's go
to find content and then we're going to
select all of our files and under update
options if you select this drop-down
you'll notice there's an update URL
aliases so this is going to essentially
take all
then and then put them through the
patterns that we have made before and
get them to what we need them to be okay
it's updated four of them now if we go
back to our page let's go to our home
page click projects
so now st slash projects about is now
slash about as is perfect is exactly
what we wanted and if we create any new
pages from here on out it's going to
follow this same pattern ok well now you
just learned how to install your first
module so feel free to paw through
drupal.org and see what kind of cool
little bits of functionality you can
throw into your site and what sort of
great things you can accomplish it
should really open your mind up to the
power that Drupal has also you now
learned how to have clean URLs and have
those all looking nice to set them up
from here on out
ok once again it's the Scott with level
up tuts thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
