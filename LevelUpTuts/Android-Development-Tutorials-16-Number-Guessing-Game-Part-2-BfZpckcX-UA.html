up Tut's and today we're going to take
our number guessing application a little
bit further and like I said last time I
entered the number four and you could
keep guessing it and every single time
you know you'll eventually get it right
but you don't have any indication that
you get it right and this you know you
don't have to enter a new number every
time so you could just keep hitting
enter until you get it right there's all
sorts of problems with this app but it's
a good foundation for what we want to do
so we have our text area we have our
number just like we had done before with
our text view we're going to have our
new text so he did we have done this
before I'm just gonna type final this
time so it doesn't have to tell me to do
it later and text view and then this is
going to be guess text and it's going to
equal text view and if you can guess
it's going to mimic this one so as you
probably seen find view by ID and if you
remember we're finding a view on our
page by its ID and we're gonna do period
dot ID dot and this is a text view - we
could have given a different name in our
interface so it'd have been a little bit
more easy to find here but in this
particular instance this is no it
totally complex app so we're not going
to worry about it so I'm going to pick
text view - and that's now equal to this
guess text variable oops okay finish
this off with a semicolon and we now
have that we also need our edit text so
for this edit text just like we have a
text view we have edit edit text just
like we have a text view before so now
we're going to name this and we're just
going to name this user guess and use
your guess is going to be equal to
inside of parentheses edit text so an
edit text is just similar to text view
it's just a textbox that they can
it and we're gonna enter our space find
view by ID and then here our dot ID dot
and we should find our edit text number
one which is the only one we created
like I said we will want to be creating
better IDs for these in the future but
we just have one headed text so it's
obvious which one it is and we're gonna
finish this off with a semicolon and you
may be seeing this red underline it's
because we have an imported edit text
yet as a data type so let's import it
and that red line goes away so we now
have user guests and gas text in our
code here and they're now accessible so
as you can imagine when we click this
button we want to get the value that is
user guests and we want to check it to
see if it's the same as a random number
so when this is clicked on the click
we're gonna set our string random text
to equal a blank string we're going to
run a random generator we're going to
get our next random number and this is
where we're going to want to do
something funny and before we assign
that to a random text we need to compare
it to the user's guess so let's hit
enter here and we're going to be using a
conditional statement and this is going
to be an if statement so this is going
to be a really basic if statement so
we're going to say if and then inside of
parentheses we're going to say user yes
is equal to R and O so we're checking
here to see if user guessed is equal to
R and O so you may be seeing this
underlined and you may be wondering why
it's not allowing us to compare these
two we did enter a number
well this user guess is of the type edit
text so it's out of the type integer so
we can't actually compare it to R + O so
one thing that we can do is create a new
integer we can call this int user number
is equal to and if you remember we have
done this before
where
we tried that we turned our random
number into a string we're also going to
be using the integer object integer dot
instead of two string we're going to
type parse int and so this is going to
get an integer from and then inside of
here we need to do a couple of things
we'll take user guess we'll cut this out
of here we'll paste it in here we want
user guest but more importantly we want
to get text from user from user guests
and then after we get the text we want
to go to string so this is under lending
this and telling me - it needs to be
final I knew we would get that error but
no big deal like I said we'll go over
how to fix that later and so we now have
and we need to finish this off with a
semicolon okay that makes all the read
go away so we now have an integer new
user number that we got out of user
guess that we got the text from turned
into a string and then parsed it as an
integer so we can now compare user
number and to see if it's equal to Rando
and then we're going to go ahead here
and put some brackets so these squiggly
brackets in here if the user number is
equal to R and O what we want to do on
our main activity is we want to say this
enter number we want to change this text
so let's come back here to our Java and
we remember that this is called the
guest text so just like we set the text
on a random number before we're gonna
say guess text and guest text going to
be a dot set text and we can set the
text to something well if your number is
equal to R and oh we want this to say
you got it right and we're gonna be
really excited about that and then we're
gonna put a semicolon here and after
this squiggly bracket we want to let
them know if they didn't get it right
that they didn't get it right so we'll
do Alice
then a set of squiggly brackets and
we're going to set guess text set text
and we're gonna say this not quite
guess again and we're also really
excited about that we're gonna finish it
off with a semicolon
so now it's going to say if user number
is equal to Brando set the guessed text
- you better write otherwise it's going
to say not quite
guess again cool so let's we're still
going to set this stuff here because we
still want to see the number right now
we just want to make sure to see if it
was right but later we can take this out
that way you won't be privy to that
guess but let's run the app and see
exactly what happens now okay so let's
go ahead here and let's enter 3 and done
and now let's click press me first time
I got it right if we press me again not
quite
guess again guess again guess again did
I write quests again I I did not quite
quests again I'll have to fix that but
pretty cool it looks like we got this
working now if I keep getting you'll see
whenever they're the same you've got it
right we now have a guest this number
game that's your first game it's your
first crazy interactive Android app
you're entering user input and you're
checking against something pretty cool
and there's still a little bit more to
do in this though like when we press
press me you don't want to be able to
get keep guessing the same number over
and over again you want your user to
guess a different you know number every
single time also we have that bug with
the quite quests quests again so in the
next lesson we're going to show you how
to fix that and we're going to spruce
this up a little bit so as always this
is Scott with level up Tut's if you have
any questions please you know let us
know in the video or hit us up on
Twitter and let us know what you're
thinking thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
