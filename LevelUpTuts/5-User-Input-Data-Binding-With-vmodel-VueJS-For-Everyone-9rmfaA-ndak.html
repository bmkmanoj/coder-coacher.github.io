up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be talking about user input and
data binding we're going to be having
sort of the classic angular 1 example
where you can have a text box type in it
and have that same text being saved to a
variable somewhere that's being bound
and auto updating so let's go ahead and
check that out now okay so in this video
we are going to be handling user input
and we're going to be just displaying
that text back as if it were a data
variable in our application here so this
is going to be super easy it's going to
make you very very excited for review
but it also is going to be very
reminiscent of how you do things in
angular or angular one when I do mention
angular in this series I am a mentioning
angular 1 because I think that's the the
framework at which of you most resembles
so if we want to bind information to a
variable from an input we're going to be
using another directive and this
directive is called model okay so what
we want to do is actually clear out some
of the stuff we have going on here we're
gonna get rid of our methods cuz we're
not going to be using them for this
video we're gonna leave our data all the
stuff that true is fine we can come in
and delete a bunch of this stuff the
Scott says the button and we can delete
all of this stuff inside of our app and
we're just simply going to have an input
now the input type is going to be of
text and we don't need any sort of extra
information but I mentioned we are going
to be using a directive and this
directive is going to be named the model
okay V - model and inside of the string
is essentially what our variable name is
going to be it's like sort of saying hey
we're defining a new variable the
variable is going to be the value of
this input field and what is this the
model going to be named we can just call
this hello for now because Y as well and
just like anything else here you can see
that Hello has already been Auto
populated because of our data value of
the same name if we were to change this
V model to literally anything else like
hi our input that we have here would be
entirely
now what's interesting here is if we do
say hello can we edit this what we do
have a hello world here you can see
unlike react where we were to have a
controlled input we actually can modify
this input value without the initial
value of our data getting in the way
here because just because the initial
value of Hello was hello world and were
saying hey attach this input to V model
of hello doesn't mean that we can't
change this and in fact if we were to
output this hello down here just as text
we could do hello you'll see hello world
here and as we change this just like
magic
the hello over here is updating as well
now if we didn't want this to have to
correlate to any sort of data in our
application again we can have this be hi
now you'll notice here that our input is
no longer rendering at all so what's up
well if we do want to use this V model
right if we want to use this we do have
to define it in our data but if we don't
want it to be the same as anything that
exists already we could have this be an
empty string and this is just going to
be it's sort of initial value here it's
just a flat-out empty string and now you
can see that our input is being shown
and if you were to look in your console
you would have seen an error saying that
hey the model doesn't exist right this
data just doesn't exist and now when we
type in here we can get our own text
typing in here and it updates this
variable so you can think of the data in
here that we're attaching to our V model
is sort of an initial state of this
input if this was a check box this could
be a true or false that sort of thing
here in fact let's do an input type of
check box
we'll see this thing render here we got
our little check box we can check it ok
but now we want to attach it to the is
true we could do V - model is equal to
is true now at this point our check box
is going to start checked but again this
is just the
initial state of our data so when we
uncheck it this is true is equal to true
is no longer affected just like when we
change the value with the method or the
button so the v-model is essentially
saying hey input the value of you is
going to be attached to which data
property right and these are all of our
data properties and what's interesting
about this is we get automatic two-way
data-binding we don't have to tell
anything to update view just knows that
the value of the input is going to be
assigned to this variable and it knows
to update wherever we've said this thing
to be outputting so again if you are
used to the more decorative more
explicit version of stuff like in react
this might seem very confusing if you
are used to other types of programming
where everything is very explicit this
also might seem very confusing however
you can see that they have these
attachments right to our data and our
template and things tend to stay in sync
ok so this is a very basic user input
handling now I mentioned a lot of these
directives so far and we're gonna
continue our learning of these
directives because after all a large
part of you is using this sort of stuff
but in the next few videos we're gonna
be diving into the view CLI we're going
to output an actual real project that
we're gonna get going on and then we're
gonna start learning some of the actual
ways that you might be using view in the
real world so we've gone over directives
we've gone over some of the basic
template extent X we've gone over some
of the basic stuff that can go inside of
our our view instance here but all of
this is going to make a lot more sense
in an application structure once we get
into it so fire up the next videos we
dive into the view CLI and build out a
real world view project where we do some
really fancy stuff from hitting api's to
page transitions and you learn all of
the foundational skills in view j/s so
as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you would like to purchase
this entire series head on over to the
level of tutorials com4 slash store and
purchase it view for everyone or you can
become a level up pro and get access to
not only view for everyone but a ton of
other premium tutorial series
such as
crow Gatsby or modern CSS layouts as
always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
