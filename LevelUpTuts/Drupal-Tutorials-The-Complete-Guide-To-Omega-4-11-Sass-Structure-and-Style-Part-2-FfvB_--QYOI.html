level of Tut's and we're gonna continue
to talk about the sass files structure
and sort of how you're supposed to make
sense of all of these different folders
if this isn't something you've seen
before this can be pretty darn
intimidating right so in the last video
we talked about what exactly these
import statements are doing and how we
have this variables folder to actually
have our variables so now let's talk
about this abstractions folder because
it's next on the list here so now why
would you want your variables first in
your abstraction so your variables are
going to be variables that are used
throughout your code abstractions are
also going to be things used throughout
your code however they're going to be
more likely that they're going to be
using your variables in fact it's likely
that your variables are not going to be
using abstractions because that wouldn't
make any sense but your obstructions are
going to be using variables and what are
abstractions and what's the sort of deal
with this stuff well this is where your
mix-ins and that sort of stuff are going
to go basically the things that are
reusable these reusable chunks of code
but they're not your styles so let's say
for example we have nothing in our
abstractions but let's say we wanted to
have text-based mix-ins we would create
a new file here and we could call this
underscore typography and dot scss keep
in mind I'm starting this with an
underscore because we want it to we want
it to be imported into our Styles
document even though none of the stuffs
going to be printed out exactly there
mix-ins if you don't know what a sass
mixin is watch our quick video on what
sass mix-ins are for level up tuts
explains it really well basically it's a
chunk of code it's a function that you
can run that outputs something I
actually took this mixin directly from
the typography des CSS file in the own
theme and basically it's using REMS with
a fallback for pixel sizing so
this is a typography themed mixin right
so this font size you would call in your
CSS by saying my font size is going to
be this and then my font size divided by
my base font size which is what you're
going to set somewhere in your variables
let's say in typography let's check this
out right here so let's actually set our
base font size right now if we set our
base sorry let me paste this in here our
base font size is gonna be 16 pixels
we'll save this now in our typography
this is going to get filled in 216
pixels in this way it's going to
calculate our rims for us so how is this
used in action well in your styles that
CSS we could say this link is going to
be at include font size font - size and
then inside of here we're gonna say it's
12 pixels every single anchor on the
site is going to be 12 pixels right now
and if we come to our CSS we can see
what is actually compiled you can see
that we have 12 pixels as their font
size as a fallback but then we also have
this calculated 0.75 from Renz size and
that's what the base font size of 16
pixels so if you come to this or not
this one if you come to our abstractions
typography it's exactly what we're
telling it to do with this mixin so this
allows you abstractions it's a place
where you can put things like your
mix-ins but even further than that break
them up into themed files right so
typography based or maybe buttons or
something like that or if you don't need
that level of separation in your code I
mean you really could just say new file
save underscore mix-ins dot s CSS and
store all of your mix-ins directly into
here in fact I have a set of mix-ins
that
I use all the time on every single
project I call them Scots dope mix-ins I
have them on github and check them out
if you want there's only like four or
five mixes right now but I use them on
literally every project so I'm just so
used to having those and I could import
that directly in here just just toss it
in the abstractions folder and it's
going to be just it used in my project
okay so that's abstractions think of it
as variables variables abstractions or
your mix-ins next we have base and base
are the base components to your styling
now what exactly does that mean well
it's the things that are are set for not
like one-off things but you see we have
forms data CSS so in here you would
style all of your inputs to look a
certain way if you have a universal
theme perhaps all of your mix ins have a
gray border that's 1 pixels we could say
input border:solid 1px actually let's do
two pixels and we can have this just be
666 and if we were to save this
basically nothing crazy is going on here
we're not using any mix-ins whatever
this is our normal styles so things that
go into base and things that go into
components where you're writing your
site's styles and base styles just
happens to be the stuff that is base you
know your base fonts your base
typography stuff so your h1 your header
styles your table Styles your media
styles you can see in media they
automatically have a max width of 100
percent that's what you have responsive
images all of your lists perhaps maybe
unless otherwise specified you want all
of your lists to be the style none I
mean maybe just by you know you don't
want that list style to be be there by
default so this is base and keep in mind
like with any of these other ones you
can add on to here right you don't just
have to use formulas
tables typography you could have pretty
much anything like maybe you had a lot
of video on your site and you wanted a
base style for those video containers
and stuff like that so that's base and
you can see by the order of things
variables are not outputting anything
abstractions are now putting anything
but base basis most likely to use
variables and abstractions and is going
to be output general just general styles
and in addition you could create folders
in here if you wanted an additional
level of separation or you could just
have one file that's base dot s CSS and
contains all of your base styles if you
don't want it to be that separated out
the best thing is is that really this
globbing and everything it really allows
for a ton of flexibility without a ton
of configuration I don't have to change
this statement and I could change
anything in this folder and it's still
going to work so lastly we have
components and components is where most
of your styles are going to go well
maybe not most because you have base but
basic components are where most of your
Styles are going to go and in components
is Drupal sort of specific stuff or just
the components of your site you can see
in this example they have navigation and
search so you want to style the search
search box in the search section of your
site and here your navigation you'd want
to style in here but if you want it to
break that down even more you could
create a new folder and you could call
this and then use an inside of menus you
could put new file and save as main main
- or just let's do main nav CSS and in
here you could style your main
navigation and then you can have
secondary nav whatever and that way
instead of breaking up your CSS into
commented sections like you've seen a
long CSS file with comments separating
every single section well we're
physically doing here separating those
sections into files that way it's super
easy to find anything you're looking for
now if you're using
sublime text 2 let's say we're over here
editing the colors I could do command T
and just type main nav enter and it's
going to take me directly to this main
now file which is only going to contain
the styles to my main navigation and
again like everything in this is so
excellent because this all gets compiled
down to one CSS file so the browser
doesn't care you're not having to import
a ton of stuff but it keeps everything
separated now there's also in components
you could have a folder of blocks and
every single block could have a partial
with the name of that block describing
it just some examples you can have notes
specific partials so that's what we have
in these folders now we also have this
hacks which is where you put basically
your hacks in fact you know these are
sort of like happy things that you don't
want to be included with this you know
the rest of your styles and that's sort
of something that you could choose to do
or not to do we have no query which is a
really excellent cess library that comes
with break point that allows you to say
hey just render my Styles without mix or
without media queries at all and what
that does is basically it allows for
older browsers like ie that don't see
media queries to just get whatever the
latest or the last styles on your
project are so if you are doing things
mobile first and you have your mobile
styles your normal styles and then your
your wide styles the site is actually
going to only see the the whilst the
wide styles that are overriding the
normals which are overriding the mobile
so you're going to get the normal
experience without having it to be
responsive and then you don't have to
use things like respond J s which is
like a JavaScript solution to make that
sort of thing work now we're going to go
over exactly how to get this working but
you don't have to add anything
additional to this file to have your or
your no query CSS file being compiled
it just does it automatically now
normalize is importing the normalized
library and you can see it's importing
it directly from the normalized gem
along with our variables and a toolkit
for border box so this is our our CSS
files and of course we have our our
Styles dot s CSS which is our main file
and if we look at home in a second
you'll see exactly how they have their
setup so let's pull that up I have the
own theme that comes with the sass here
or that comes with Omega 4 and as you
can see this is where I copied that
typography mixin from and so let's go
through their folders okay so we have
first is the variable folders they have
their colors and variable they've
labeled them light blue mid blue dark
blue that sort of thing and you can do
that too it also helps if you label them
by like what the component actually is
link header that kind of thing if that's
how you're using the colors however this
is totally valid to grid is we're gonna
be defining your grid variables notice
how they have things like vertical and
horizontal spacing unit they're there
tab tablet that's their tablet site with
their desktop site with and their grid
variables and here we have in legacy or
saying you know whether one whether you
want legacy support for i7 or not or
needy II's and typography base font size
baseline height size fonts and stuff
like that these are all super helpful
when you're building out your Styles now
the next we have abstractions you can
see where we got the typography one from
they also have some other you know
mix-ins and stuff you want to check
these out these are all great you know
you can make an arrow really easily and
stuff like that now in base they have
their split up exactly how we're talking
about and and here they're styling their
inputs and things like that they're
media they're tables they're setting up
their font face declarations and
typography and now in components this is
where they have there's really broken
out they have blocks so navbar has a
block user menu has a blah
comments has a block fields various
fields have a block or a partial here
forms so different types of forms
collapsible field side search forms
menus we have the looked breadcrumb menu
action links and all sorts of great
stuff in here so you can use this as a
model for exactly how you want to do
yours or you can even break it out
further than that and change it and like
we said before only have like one file
less files have more files whatever you
want whatever is comfortable for you or
you could even go a hundred percent
outside of how they have it set up here
and just start typing all your styles in
this Styles des CSS if that's what
you're comfortable with you could put
all your variables at the top here and
just get rid of all this stuff here get
rid of these import statements so it's
totally up to you and it's one of the
best things about it is it makes it
flexible without enforcing anything you
can do whatever you want so that's the
SAS style and structure in the next
video we're going to start talking about
the grid system and we're gonna set up
our grid and we're going to assign some
things to our grid and show you how
singularity works and start to explain
that so as always this is Scott what
