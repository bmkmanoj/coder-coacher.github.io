with level up tutorials joined by Travis
Nelson of dev tips yeah we are here in a
hotel in Anaheim at VidCon so I thought
I would stop and get to talk to traps a
little bit about some of these developer
life questions that we have in the last
video we talked yeah Devlin Devlin in
the last video we talked a little bit
about jealousy or seeing other people's
work and feeling overwhelmed in this
video I wanted to talk about sort of
something that could go along with that
and a little bit of a way where how do
you stay motivated to continue to grow
and to advance as a developer designer
in this sort of digital this world so I
guess then the main question is is when
you have you know code to work on
whether you're at a job and you don't
get to pick your projects or you're
doing your own thing how do you stay
motivated to not only learn the new
stuff but to even complete the work that
you already have to do like you you have
a mountain of stuff yeah yeah yeah man I
think that was interesting Lee said
whether you're at a job or doing your
own projects because I always all of my
coding stuff is always my own yeah and
so and I always think like oh yeah
talking about your own project so how
like the perspective of somebody who has
to go to work yeah in code and doesn't
we have coding I'm unfamiliar with that
wellzyn re maybe not like coding but
they what they're doing yeah yeah yeah
yeah cuz like normally I would answer
that by saying like like being motivated
comes from a few different things and
there's like a few different kind of
elements in the pot one of them is just
cadence right so if you if you are
working on something and you got a good
momentum going that momentum can carry
you pretty far yeah
the second one is is how much you
believe in the project right if it's
doing something
lines really well with your personal
values for example one of my personal
values and something I really am
passionate about it is is doing like
Social Work and like in like like
helping disaster relief and things like
that and when I'm able to take the the
money that my community provides through
patreon and donate it or or do something
good with it or or do a project that
does benefit other people in in terms of
making my videos helping people to
increase their technical skills so they
can become more employable mm-hmm that
that really that really aligns very well
with my personal values are yeah and
it's very motivating to me to to do that
and also to see the results right so
like when I get an email of somebody
saying Travis because of the work that
you've done
XYZ happened and therefore now I'm you
know a happier person or my life is a
little bit better like that that's
really gratifying yeah and it serves to
motivate me to do more and to be better
at it right yeah and I totally get that
when whenever the stuff that you're
working on is so closely aligned with
the things that are deeply ingrained
with you it's not like working it's like
you're you're just doing it because
you'd like to do it and that's how it is
right but let's say you know let's say
here's the situation you've been
employed by Comcast right uh-huh I don't
know how well your feelings are uncommon
I'm not gonna trans you're not like
that's the devil then yeah yeah yeah
right so you're employed by somebody you
might not you know you're working there
it's a job it's your job it's it's it's
a good opportunity but how do you how
would you stay motivated when the coding
that you're doing or the work that
you're doing doesn't align you don't and
you're not allowed yeah to make it a lot
sure sure yeah got to put food on the
table
right absolutely yeah - two kind of
insights I don't mean to imply that I've
never had a job that I didn't like yes I
was just thinking of coding and
professionally I'm a designer so I have
never coded for write it Sharon like but
I have had like creative jobs I have
design
jobs that I was unhappy at you know for
a long period of time and I was stressed
out overworked not happy I've been there
what are kind of two insights that maybe
I could share that help help to preserve
motivation throughout there is number
one is take delight in the things that
you do do that you enjoy and that you
can accomplish whether it's as simple as
learning a new skill or even making a
close friend you know there or something
like that yeah I mean you may not like
everything or maybe even the majority of
the things about your position but you
do have a job and that's good yeah right
yeah right exactly and there there are
you know there there are bright points
in there somewhere that you can say like
look at look at you know despite all
this darkness something as good as
coming out of that the second thing is
that I noticed that when I was employed
by somebody that I did not feel in
control of my own creative destiny I did
side projects like you would not believe
Yeah right I had the only way I could
remain creatively sane is to invest my
emotions that was not being fulfilled
into other work that was fulfilling to
me at the time and so I've never not had
side projects never never not had side
projects and in fact every job that I've
had every new employment offer that I've
received has been a direct result of my
side projects I'm not my employers work
yeah and that never resonates with me a
lot right when I was doing work I didn't
like or I wasn't totally dedicated to
the motivation to advance in coding came
from the side projects right
I built a tool to help me record my my
dance schedule my dance practices and
stuff like that I built that tool for
myself and that allowed me to learn new
things and get excited and do all of
these things and be motivated to be a
better programmer without being with
that my job specifically and one thing I
can add to any of that is is find the
aspects of the project that you're
working on that you do have control over
and take delight and control and
experiment in those areas for instance I
feel like I was doing I was at a job
before and it wasn't super rapid we were
working on like a new site maybe every
month the sites weren't anything special
I did not love them I did not love the
designs I didn't have control over that
right I was just the the the monkey type
are you know tired yes yes so just
making these things just build him out
yeah and I took every single one of
those sites as an opportunity to do
something new the first time I used gulp
was as a build tool for a site that
probably did not need a build sure I
used it because I wanted to learn
something new in this project that
otherwise I wouldn't feel great about
sass the first time I use cest the first
time I used stylus any of these things
they were all they were all the result
of a project I wasn't psyched about
working on and tried to turn it into
something that I wanted to be right
about wow that's great and every single
time you feel better about that project
when you're done I couldn't tell you
which individual project I learned sass
or gulp on but I can tell you at some
point in this job of projects I didn't
like I learned all this stuff you know
absolutely there's a few great things in
there number one is that you you have
control over your own happiness right
and if you're not satisfied with what
you're being given by like the overlords
right yeah by the manager I just give
yourself things you know like like
exactly how Scott was describing and
secondly when you take those side
projects or when you take those like you
know you're you're like magnifying the
the benefits like the opportunities
there when you do that it gets cycles
back to your employer and creates value
for them and and that comes back to you
in terms of respect opportunities money
like different ways your employer shows
appreciation for you because they
realize they're like hey you know what
you're going the extra mile you're going
beyond what I hired you did yeah yeah
and it could even be something as small
like I know some people are in a
situation where they're in a legacy code
base they're working on boring stuff
within this code base that exists
and just go and add some new technology
to it sure so I think something for
those people would be to find
exploration where you can if your
company doesn't have like a code style
guide let's say they don't have a
JavaScript style guide you could work on
on researching and exploring different
JavaScript style guides and and applying
that you could go over and refactor your
code or try new things or figure out new
ways to do this stuff but like in the
same regard you need to find ways to
make what you're doing exciting for you
because if it's exciting you're and want
to do it if you want to do it you're
gonna get better you're gonna be
motivated so you need to bring
excitement in and you need to genuinely
be excited about it yeah yeah just in
short like it's never ever is it in your
contract that your employer is
responsible for your own creative health
that entirely falls upon you you cannot
blame anybody else for your own creative
health right so you have to take care of
yourself you have to challenge yourself
a new way it's just similar to like your
own your you know your physical health
right you have to exercise you have to
challenge your body you have to provide
it with good fuel so you have to be keep
on reading if to keep on putting good
input into your creative health and you
are completely responsible for it nobody
else in the world is responsible for
your own creativity yeah and your own
creative fulfillment yeah definitely
yeah challenge yourself push yourself
motivate yourself take responsibility
take accountability gonna do all that
stuff and and you will be motivated and
you're gonna like the output better your
employees are gonna like the output
better you're gonna get better jobs and
it's all going to come back mmm awesome
so I think that that that's as good as
it gets I think yeah yeah I think that's
a really great really great points on
motivation yeah so as always this is
