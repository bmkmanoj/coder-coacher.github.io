up Tut's and today I'm gonna show you
how to change your follow permissions
using the chmod command so we are still
inside of our working directory that was
the test folder inside of here if I do
LS - L you can see I have this hello txt
file and this public folder the hello
dot txt file has a permissions of 644
and the public has a seven five five and
these are fairly common permissions to
see for files and directories so in fact
you're gonna get used to seeing this the
same pattern sort of over and over but
let's say that you have this text file
this hello dot txt and you didn't want
anyone other than Scott the user Scott
to be able to read this file you know
sure enough Scott can read and write
this file but we don't want anybody else
to be able to read it now we can modify
those permissions to be six zero zero
instead of six four four now to do that
all we have to type is chmod and then
six zero zero and now keep in mind we we
went over seven four six that sort of
thing in the last video but zero is no
permissions at all it's going to give it
just a - straight across so we can say
chmod 611 tur now when we type LS - L we
can now see that the file permissions
over here is just our W and hyphens for
the rest now that's pretty great because
it's exactly what we wanted to happen
and you know perfect however it turns
out we didn't want that to happen we
wanted everybody to have full access to
this file we wanted anybody to have full
access to this file so we can type chmod
777 and then hello dot txt and let's do
LS -
and you can see now everybody can read
write and execute this file without any
issues so that's pretty cool I'm gonna
hit ctrl or command K just to clear this
but we're still in the same directory
okay so let's say we want everything in
this folder to have the permissions of
777 what we can do is just step back and
you don't really even have to step back
but this might make it seem a little bit
easier to understand and what we can say
here is chmod we want everything to be
777 we can type tests forward slash and
then asterisks now the asterisks is
going to make everything it's a wild
card right so it means every single
thing in this folder is going to get 777
permissions I hit enter we check it out
we go into test we can say LS - L and we
can see everything's got the 777
permissions okay this is one way of
doing it but let's say we want
everything in here to have 666
permissions including the test folder
well we can use a flag that just says
recursively basically this and
everything inside of it apply this to so
we can say chmod now we can do for word
 or a - capital R and the capital R
stands for recursively like I said goes
inside of everything finds our files for
us and we want to say sevenths R I'm
sorry we're doing these 666 and we're
just going to say the test folder
because I stepped out of it now I don't
have to specify a wild-card because I
don't want to say the files inside of
tests I want to say tests and everything
inside of it so chmod recursively 666 in
the test we hit enter now as you can see
it's giving me some permissions errors
now I might not have permission to do
this so what we need to do is run the
sudo command so we can type sudo
then chmod - R 666 test enter you'll
notice that it didn't ask me for my
password that's because I have ran a
sudo command already once it usually in
it will for you ask you for your
password when running sudo command only
the first time in any session and after
that it won't so now let's go inside a
test and you see we are locked out now
why are we locked out
well let's type LS - tell and you can
see that in our test folder we have
access to read and write to this folder
so we can see it exists but we can't
execute in it so let's so let's go ahead
and fix that we want the test folder to
be 7 6 6 we can do chmod and then 7 7 6
6 actually just do 7 5 5 test ok now
let's go inside the test folder and LS -
hell everything should be 6 6 6 we see
it here our W is 6 6 6 cool so as you
just witnessed there what happened is we
removed a crucial permission from a
folder and we got locked out of that
folder luckily we had our trusty chmod
command to once again allow us to
execute that folder and get inside there
so these are file permissions are very
important it's it's important to know
how to modify them but it's also
important to know that modifying file
permissions in a way that could make
your files possibly and secure is not a
good thing so please before modifying
your file permissions like crazy or
something like that be cognizant of what
you're doing and don't just go giving
everything 7 7 7 you publishin relieved
me giving anything 7 7 7
so just yeah be
careful with what you're doing your file
permissions on but if you're losing
access and somebody says you this file
needs to be this certain permission you
now know how to modify it so check it
out try out your new skills do it on
some test files you don't care about so
if you mess them up and you can't get
them back to where they were you don't
have to worry about it so as always this
is Scott with LevelUp Hutts

level up tuts we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and I'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
