up Tut's and today we're going to be
talking about the global settings for
your Suzy site now the global settings
can really set up a whole bunch of stuff
that you know you may want to define
basically just your settings right it
can set up your gutter styles your
output styles the the way that the math
is calculated how many columns you have
that sort of stuff so to do this we need
to use a sass concept called maps and
maps are new and a latest version of
sass I believe depending on when you're
watching this video make sure you just
have the latest version of sass updated
if you have to just to make sure you
have this functionality and what we can
do is we can define a variable and this
variable is named Suzy we're going to do
: and then parentheses and just like an
object in JavaScript or hash like a key
value pair we're able to define several
other variables within this now what's
great about this is that we could have
variable names like math or gutters or
columns or any of that stuff and not
have to worry about those variable names
colliding with a variable name somewhere
else in our application because they're
all going to be wrapped up inside of
this map so what we can do is we can say
columns and then colon twelve now we
want to end each line with a comma and
what's great about this is that we can
already see some effect of this by
coming down here deleting the of twelve
and we don't need to tell it of twelve
anymore because it's going to know that
we have twelve columns so spanning eight
and then spanning four at nine should do
the exact same thing as our site was
doing before now if we come here and
refresh you'll notice there's no change
right that's because the site knows
right
the Suzy knows what to do because we're
telling it it's 12 now we can define a
lot of other things within these global
settings as well we can have our gutters
so we can say gutters and if we wanted
to give these any sort of value here we
could so we could say that they were 1/4
the size and then call a comma refresh
and what it's actually looking for here
is like a ratio so you could say maybe
it's like um you know one twentieth or
something like that and now let's come
to our page and see it should be should
be a little bit different now you can
see that they're actually much much
smaller so I like the 1/4 because
obviously one twentieth is pretty tight
but it's checking for a ratio here
that's something good to know now
another thing we can say is the math
style by default it's set to fluid so
that all of our widths are set in
percentages right and we like
percentages and widths because when the
containers fluid that means the contents
fluid well however if you want things to
not be fluid and defined and actual
widths you could have the output or the
math style as static and now static is
going to make everything set to be m/s
so we're going to keep this as fluid and
I can just put a comma here now next we
have our output style and output is
going to be float and this is by the
default the same way it should normally
be so technically we don't really even
have to define this I'm just sort of
showing you what you can put in here
there's also isolate which might be a
little bit overkill you can read a
little bit more about that I personally
just use float now we have also gutter
position and gutter position is
something that you might have been
wondering before because in the last
video you saw when we defined our our
columns right we had a margin on only
one of them instead of both of them and
you might have been wondering well I've
seen it where the margins on the left of
the first one I mean on the left of the
last one or there's a little bit of
margin on both of them well luckily we
have the option of setting that up
however we'd like we could have this bb4
so that our margin would be on the left
hand side of the divs or we could have
the
set to split and now with split you can
see that each of our columns gets a
little bit margin and this might be more
similar to how you've seen grids work in
the past and we have margin on the left
and right of both of these even though
uh even though you know the container
goes out to an extended width so we also
have inside which puts the padding
instead of margin so we could say inside
now let's refresh now check it out we
have this as padding instead of margin
that could be totally useful if you want
to look the background color to extend
but you know sort of padding under your
inner content and we also have something
called inside static which basically
makes it so they're not percentages for
your left and right so it makes it so
your padding is rigid on the edges okay
so what else can we define into these
global settings well I think it's going
to be useful to post the link to the
docs
of Susy so you can check it out yourself
we had there's all sorts of stuff from
column width to box-sizing stuff some
debugging stuff and we're going to get
into a little bit more of it but for now
I would just go to the docs and just
test it out and see what you can do and
see if you could try to emulate some
sort of grid settings that you are used
to or would like using so this is an
introduction to the global settings I
hope it has empowered you to change your
grid to be whatever you want it to be in
the next few videos we're going to be
going over some more complex stuff and
we're going to be doing some more
awesome Suzi magic so as always if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment in the video or hit us up at
Twitter or Facebook I love a lot of tuts
we also have a forum on our website you
could post ask questions on we love to
hear from you so as always this is Scott
and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
