of Tut's and today we're gonna beginning
to some basic conditional stuff which is
really cool because the compass makes
this stuff nice and easy and really
interesting to be honest I really like
sort of the way that they approach it
and all sorts of great stuff that you
can do so in the last tutorial we showed
you all the different operators and how
nice those are well now we're going to
get to put them to use so let's say we
want to say let's turn this back to true
which is because it makes a little bit
more sense in this context so let's say
that we want to yell only if the person
is true we want to yell their name if
the person is true okay so we're going
to say we're going to say yell 25 if
person is true okay and while this is
really cool it's like reading a sentence
you're saying you're gonna yell if the
person is true if the person is there or
it may be if the person is yes whatever
you want but let's click over here to
see what it did in our JavaScript
it says if person equals true then run
this function cool well what if we would
say if the person is true and name isn't
Scott say this it's gonna compile and
now it's gonna write this for us if
person isn't true and name is Scott yell
25 so right now would not be yelling cuz
my name of course is Scott okay but what
if we wanted to do this a little bit
more of like a normal JavaScript way
that you're sort of used to you can also
write this in a way if person is true
error let's just try it isn't if person
isn't false yo Scott okay so now if the
person isn't false it's gonna yell Scott
and this is more like what you're used
to seeing it looks a little bit more
like if if person is isn't false which
is sort of a weird thing to say but if
the person isn't false then yell Scott
okay so this is going to compile to the
same exact thing as if you were to say
yell if the
isn't false you'll see no change here
okay well that's really cool because t
gives you a couple options but more
importantly I think this is very this
reads more like a sentence which is
something that I've mentioned that I do
like about CoffeeScript and just sort of
what it has to offer here you could also
do this another way you could say if
person isn't false just like we had it
before and then you could say then yell
scott and now if we say this you'll see
the same thing twice here if person
isn't fault yell scott but this is just
another way of writing it again it's a
little bit more conversational it's a
little bit more like a sentence that you
would read again you can also use some
other things you could say so actually
this is actually supposed to be a or
even supposed to be my age anyways so
let's put my age in here and then let's
do something you could say let's set my
age here and we want to let's pull this
out of here we can say
let's say hey just equal to 25 and then
he I was just going to alert my name and
age and we're just gonna remove the
argument here entirely okay so this is
our new function no it's changed but now
we want to say if age and you just do
the greater sign greater than sign is
let's say it's greater than if the age
is greater than 24 then yo we say this
we check it out it's going to yell if
your age is greater than 24 which it
will yell so that's great is so easy
it's really lot of 'some and you could
also say let's say you could let's try
this we could say yo oops
let's not pass anything unless age is
greater than 24 so we're going to say yo
unless the age is greater than 24 so
this is going to actually negate this
right here we're gonna say if the age
essentially is not greater than 24 then
yo so if this unless is sort of an
inverse of if so yell if age is 24 it's
gonna do the normal and then unless is
going to be the inverse of that okay so
these are some really basic conditionals
right so if you wanted to just check
anything you know you have your is isn't
not and or true YES on false no off and
then so that's that's pretty much it
conditionals are really nice and easy
it's almost common sense if you're going
to say your sentence out as what you
want your conditional to check it's
almost what you're going to be typing in
CoffeeScript and as always make sure you
know if you're unsure about what you're
typing you know get a code coloring I'm
using sublime text
it's CoffeeScript I think it's just
downloaded with the package and that's
the package manager of the package
control that sublime text to has and
that really makes it nice and easy you
can tell us some things supposed to be
or if it's a keyword or not okay so
that's conditionals in CoffeeScript
there is more cool stuff with
conditionals and CoffeeScript we're
going to be going over in the next
lesson we're going to talk about what
the existential operator is it's a
pretty cool thing it's really sort of a
different it's nice and interesting and
it doesn't take that long to explain
okay if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment in the video or
let us know what you're thinking
as always you know we do these in our
spare time we want to make these as best
as we can but of course we don't have
unlimited resources to do that so we
rely on anybody who's watching this to
say what they want to see and what we
could be doing better okay once again
this is Scott and thanks for watching
