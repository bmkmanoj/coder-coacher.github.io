tutorials and in this video we're going
to create our project and I'm going to
show you a really nice way to modify and
add packages to your project including a
package list that you'll find in the
description of this video that you can
use to get started so let's get going on
that right now
okay so we're actually ready to get
started now so let's head to our
terminal and the directory that you want
to install your project you should be
familiar already with the meteor create
and then the project name we can name
this I'm going to name mine intermediate
but you can certainly name it whatever
you would like for instance we're
building a recipe book so perhaps you're
going to want to name it something along
the lines of that I'm going to name it
just intermediate because it's going to
be easier for me to find it later on so
now it's going to go ahead and create
our project now we can just change
directory into our new project so I can
do CD and be an intermediate now we can
get this running just by typing meteor
now it's going to go ahead and make sure
that all of our packages are downloaded
correctly and it's going to get it set
up okay so now we have this going here
localhost 3000 let's head to our browser
and you can see we have these sort of
standard click me starting that you're
used to having here now in this video
we're going to be showing you basically
how we can start to add a whole bunch of
packages now it's sort of a pain to come
into your terminal and type meteor add
and then the package name every single
time so there's actually a much easier
way of managing your packages let's go
ahead and open up this project in our
text editor you can use any text editor
if you like I'm going to be using
sublime text 3 for these videos I'm
going to be using the material design
theme I get questions a lot on the theme
so in case you're wondering this is the
material design theme and it's using the
material dark variation okay so now that
we have this in sublime Texas is your
basic sort of meteor setup and one place
you've never maybe ventured into is this
period meteor folder this dot meteor
folder here if we open this up you can
see we have some files we have a good
ignore file telling you essentially to
ignore this local file when you are
committing things to github that's
because everything that's sort of stored
in here as files relating to the build
process essentially things that you
don't need stored into your repo and
things that quite frankly you don't want
to you would want to have to pull
everything down when you pull down the
new project and how does the project
know what to pull down well it has some
files here one of which is packages now
packages is a great file because what
you can actually do in here is modify
this file and actually see things in
actions though because this is the
intermediate series we're going to be
removing the auto publish and insecure
packages immediately we can just go
ahead and get rid of them so after I
delete these I'm going to save this
packages file and then tab quickly over
to my terminal so I'm going to save this
file now what you can see is without
doing anything your application already
knows these packages have been removed
and it's removed the actual package
files from your project so it's saying
its noticed some changes to package
versions and notice that you removed
auto publish and insecure and it's
restarted the server for you now this is
just one of the many reasons why I find
meteor to be the most seamless easy to
use framework out there because that was
instantaneous I didn't have to do a
whole lot I didn't have to modify any
sort of versions or anything like that I
just said hey get out of here and it
didn't you know restarted the
application for me so now likewise if we
want to add a package we can just go
ahead and drop in a package for instance
we want to be using a flow router and
blaze layout now I'm going to go ahead
and make these packages available for
you in fact I'm going to make this whole
package list available for you and what
you can do is simply come to your
packages file paste a couple of packages
in here or all of them click Save and
like I said if we tab over to our
terminal you'll notice that it's
grabbing the latest versions of
everything and if you want to know
exactly what versions you ever have
installed of anything you can actually
go to versions this file right here now
keep in mind this file is automatically
generated so deleting it's not going to
really do anything but you can see that
we have the actual versions of all of
our files here so you don't have to type
in meteor list in your terminal just to
see the versions you can come in here
and see them directly and one thing you
may have noticed in the difference
between the intermediate series in the
basic series well since then a version
one point
two of meteor came out and it's actually
separated a bunch of the core components
in a two new packages so we now can
remove things like blaze HTML templates
if we don't want to use them for
instance I've been using meteor with
react a lot so if you're not planning on
using these blaze HTML templates then
you should probably get rid of that
package just so it's not a part of your
codebase in addition we also have this
echo script package allows us to use
es2015 plus syntax in your code in in
your app so those are all new things
with meteor 1.2 and we'll be taking
advantage of that so in the previous
tutorials we did not use es2015 however
in these videos we will be using some
es2015
things and I won't necessarily be
dwelling on it too much so you know here
and there you might see one of the arrow
functions or or let or something like
that but other than that nothing too
crazy so if you don't have es2015
experience no worries there I'm not
going to be making it too confusing for
you so like I said I'm going to be
providing you with a complete list of
packages that we're going to be using so
you can go ahead and just copy that
straight from the video description and
here's the list here if you want to take
a look at some of the things we're
looking at we have things like handlebar
helpers which are a really nice way to
use things like session variables and
your templates we have collection too
which allows us to attach a schema to
things includes the simple schema
package we're going to be using auto
form to generate forms we're going to be
using accounts and accounts you.why
still we're going to be using some font
awesome we're gonna be using this a
stylus multi package that I use just
because I prefer to work in stylus and
CSS isn't really the focus of this we
also going to be using meteor lodash be
using blaze layout like I mentioned
before active route auth client
callbacks we are going to be using a
meteor toys package as well however was
giving me some errors at the time of
recording this so just because I'm using
a jet setter which is part of that
package that wasn't giving me any errors
at this time but this package may is
what may very well change so as you can
see there's a lot of stuff here and
we're going to
get diving into that in the next video
so for now get these packages in your
project head over your terminal make
sure everything is working fine head
back to your application refresh or
don't even refresh because this is
meteor either way you should see
everything working totally fine and
ready to go in the next video we're
going to break out our project in to a
bit better of a structure than we have
before we're going to have a
client/server folder we're going to have
a collections folder we're going to just
make things setting up our project in
the right way so that we can get going
as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments havecome in the video or hit me
up at Twitter or Facebook I level up
tutorials thanks for watching and I'll
see in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
