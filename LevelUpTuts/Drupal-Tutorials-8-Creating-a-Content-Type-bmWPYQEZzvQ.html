level up tuts and today we're going to
be doing your own custom content type in
Drupal so last time we showed you how to
create an article and the time before
that we showed you how to create a page
and this time we're going to show you
how to create a content type so that you
can make up your own types of content
and this can be extremely useful since
this is going to be my portfolio site
I'm going to have different projects I'm
an important here and these projects are
going to have all sorts of stuff from
images to video links and it's going to
have to take some different types of
media we're not going to get into adding
those types of media or those those
custom fields yet because those are
going to require some modules that will
show you a little bit later but for now
we're going to get in by just in
creating at your own content type and
we'll show you how flexible that is so
that you can get working building your
own custom content types to build out
your site's content with if it doesn't
fit the mold of their defaults so we're
going to go to structure and then
structure there's a item called content
types
actually I'm going to click this plus
here to add this to my shortcuts bar
because I'm going to be using this a lot
in the initial development of this site
so it's up here now and as you'll see
here's your article and basic page we
can actually modify article our basic
page by adding some fields or editing
them however for now it's just going to
be easier to show you how to start from
the beginning so to get started we'll
click add content type we're going to
call this project my projects so this
description doesn't really show up
anywhere other than in the
administrative section it's nice if
you're building the site for clients and
you have a bunch of different content
types let's say they have a news posting
and you know there's news or or events
or something like that and you want to
give them even more clarification
besides just what the name is
what its function is on the site so here
you know that's where you add your
description so the title field by
default is title I'm going to leave this
is title because it's the page title I
don't change it very often but if you
need to you can I'm going to leave
preview before submitting is optional
because you know if I want it I'll know
it's there and if I don't I don't have
to use it okay next we're going to go to
publishing options the default will be
published and I'm going to turn off
promote a different page so the default
is going to be published but I don't
want every single post to automatically
promote it be promoted to the front page
when you're creating your individual
pieces of content you can then select
this promote it to the front page to
whichever one specifically you want to
be promoted to be promoted
okay so publish is the only one I want
by default if you were having a site
where many people were sort of reviewing
content and creating content and not
always the person who creates it submits
it and it goes live then you might want
to deselect published so that when you
create a piece of content it's not
automatically up on the site but I'm
going to be the only person making
content here so I'm going to leave this
as published ok display settings you
know I don't I don't really need to
display my the author or date
information this will show up on the
note itself and you know usually just
gets in the way it's ended up turning it
off so you know if you were making a
blog post and you had a couple people
making blog posts you know you could use
that to distinguish who's making the
posts but for this particular content
type I'm not going to bother and comment
settings I'm going to turn comments off
I will eventually want to have comments
on some of my project pages however I'm
going to do that through discuss which
is a web service that is very popular
for adding comments and I'll be adding
discuss with the module a little bit
later but as far as Drupal's comment
system goes I'm not going to use it for
this so I'm just going to say closed and
actually I'm going to turn it to hidden
it's not even going to show up
so menu settings this is when you create
your content it asks you if you want to
put it in a menu these things are not
going to go into any menu in particular
so I'm just not going to have any
available menus for now eventually maybe
you want to do like a site map or
something I can put in that actually we
will select the main menu because
they're going to go under projects and
I'm just not going to display them in
the projects menu anywhere necessarily
but as far as page structure goes
they're going to live under the main
menu projects so we'll leave that I
guess and now we're going to save and
add fields because without adding fields
it's pretty much the same as a page so
if you next stop is this manage fields
okay so here as you can see it's just
like your page you add a title and a
body this body has the a field Awards a
long text in summary and the widget is
using a text area with a summary you can
just delete this if you feel so inclined
if you don't need this if you need to
add a new field it's right here you can
also add an existing field eventually
when you keep creating fields it adds
them to the existing fields since we
haven't really created any fields our
options are only field image and field
tags which were available in the article
so let's just add a new one and we're
going to call this will have this be a
type of project so I want this to be a
term reference so I'm going to have
different types of projects whether it's
video project or web project and so I'm
going to use taxonomy for that and so
I'm going to use a term reference going
to be referencing a taxonomy term or a
category so I'm going to call this field
and we're going to call this a type so
field type and this will be project type
so your field names are going to need to
be machine readable readable as in no
spaces lowercase letters and underscores
only as far as this name the field name
it can be anything you want
because this is only pretty much
displayed in the back end so we're going
to say term reference and we want this
to be an autocomplete term widget
because these things are probably going
to be one thing and if I have a whole
bunch of different terms I don't
necessarily want them to be check
buttons because or checkboxes because
that list could get really long okay so
to add a new field you just have to fill
out these forms if I wanted to appear
above the body which I do because you
know usually I want to select what type
of project it is before I start writing
the body text I'll drag it above here
and now we're going to click Save and
it's going to say widget okay I believe
you want to use since we haven't created
any vocabularies yet yeah we'll use tags
so I'm going to click this Save Settings
okay this is your field settings so this
is asking me all sorts of stuff in here
you know label where da had that you can
give it some help text you can give it a
default value you can say how many
values you wanted to have we just want
this to have one values we're going to
select one is et can be unlimited
and this is where you can also select
what vocabulary it's using so we're
selecting tags and we're going to save
this okay so now we have our content
type if we back out of here and we go to
add content you'll now see that project
shows up as an hop as a content type
we'll type in title just do my first
project just to try it out and this is
going to be a video okay in the body
body text
and we're going to put this under the
and main menu but oh actually we'll just
skip this for now because we don't have
a projects page yet we're not going to
create every vision we're not going to
worry about URL aliases right now and
it's going to comments going to be
closed as they are by default and it
will be published we'll click Save and
here we are as you can see it
automatically lists your body text your
project type in your video in the next
lesson we're going to be going over how
to use manage display to work with these
labels or work with this layout here
