tutorials and in this video we're going
to be talking about what makes react
special why you should be using it and
then we're going to download the starter
kit and just get a basic HTML file going
so let's get going on that right now
okay with this series the first thing
we're going to do is head to Facebook
dot it hub dot io / react and then it's
the index page there I'll make that link
available in the description of the
video so you can just click on it
however if you just google react j/s or
just react
it will probably show up near the top
here and your page you look a little bit
something like this depending on when
you're watching this video now to get
started we are going to be eventually
creating a larger unified project and
I'll be providing CSS and everything
like that so no need to worry there
however for these first few videos for
just really understanding reactant
just sort of its core concepts we're
going to be using this react starter kit
that you can get off of their website
now the react starter kit isn't
necessarily how you would probably ever
use reactant at a production environment
or anything like that but it's really
easy way to get started so that you can
quickly learn the conventions of using
react in general so that way when we
start to build out a larger more
dedicated workflow using a build process
and things like that then you don't have
to worry about struggling with all of
these new concepts at once okay so like
we've mentioned before the virtual DOM
is a tremendous selling point of react
basically it's only rendering what's
changed based on a comparison with
something called the virtual Dom now
this may sound abstract but it's only
rendering what it needs to render when
something changes therefore it's
extremely fast so in addition to the
virtual DOM another thing that is good
about react is it's just the UI
component right there's no data
component we're not hitting api's with
react or anything like that so you can
use react in a lot of different contexts
and personally I use react very heavily
with meteor and I find that the two were
really well together now another strong
point of react is basically just how
it's all components this component based
workflow is really something that we've
seen growing and growing as the future
of the web we have things like polymer
where you're building web components
angular 2 is going to be using
components and react is based off of
components now what does that
essentially mean well it means that your
user interface is essentially just a
collection of components these
individual components contain the
JavaScript logic and the view HTML for
themselves and so there's sort of really
nice little self-contained little chunks
and they can work that you can use them
within other components and build at
your user interface out in a way that is
really truly modular and it's also
really great if you're working on a team
then individuals can have their hands
and different components and still be
working towards a unified product so
reactives really super good for staying
organized and building large user
interfaces it's really super fast I mean
you're not going to believe how fast it
is and it does just what it needs to do
so that you can use other tools that
you're familiar with and that you like
in addition to react so let's get
started by downloading react and let's
create a basic HTML file here so without
worrying about too much more let's get
started just by clicking this download
react 14 a point to 0 14 2 is the
version at the time of this video and
then we can click this download starter
now after you have your starter kit
downloaded and unzipped you can drag it
to wherever you keep your sites and
you'll notice is that we have a readme
inside of here we have some basic
examples and we have this build folder
now we could go through these basic
examples and look at these and just sort
of see what's going on however I think
it's important to just get going and get
started off with the quick sort of hello
world example so what we're going to do
is we're not actually going to write a
react code in this video I'm going to
drop this into my text editor here I'm
using sublime text for these videos the
color scheme and the theme are both
material design dark I have a video on
that in the sublime text tutorials on
this channel if you want to check it out
further it's a really cool color scheme
I get a lot of questions about it so I
wanted to make sure that that's up front
okay so we have the starter kit here
right and we've downloaded I've thrown
into my text editor we have the build
and examples folders let's go ahead and
just create a really basic HTML file and
from this folder we can just click new
file and we can just name this
index.html now we need a doctype okay
now so inside of our head we're going to
add a couple of scripts so we can say
script and the first script we're going
to add is going to be the react jf
that's inside of build so inside of
build you see we have react dot j s so
we can just add build forward slash
react J s now let's copy this and now
the next file we're going to need is
react - Dom jeaious you can see both of
those here now we can save this now
let's go ahead and add our body and the
last thing we need to add is going to be
babel now if you aren't familiar with
babel it's essentially a library that
allows you to loot use the latest
features of javascript es2015 and so on
it allows you to use those latest
features essentially by converting that
javascript and is something that your
browser can understand now we're going
to be using from this CloudFlare it's
basically just the version five point
eight point two three I will make this
link also available in the description
of the video so you can just paste that
in there and we use Babel here so that
we can use JSX and some of the fancier
new features in javascript now you might
be wondering what JSX is JSX is
basically XML syntax inside of
JavaScript now what that really means is
that you will be
writing HTML inside of your JavaScript
and does that feel weird at first
absolutely and I think it scares a lot
of people away from react they see HTML
and JavaScript and they think I just
don't want to do that it feels wrong so
do not worry about the JSX piece we're
going to be breaking it down bit by bit
and I'll actually even show you a way
that you can use some of your favorite
tools like Emmet inside of JSX so you
don't have to worry about that okay so
we now have a really basic HTML file
that we're going to be using as the
structure to get started in our very
most Basics in learning react it's
nothing out of the ordinary here we're
loading a couple of scripts and we
basically have your standard HTML
document structure in the next video
we're going to be writing our very first
react component it's going to be sort of
the basic hello world example but it's
going to be showing you just exactly
what things are going to be looking like
where as we get going here and then if
that we're going to be taking this into
more for real-world examples where we're
going to be showing you the features of
react and an actual type of application
that you'd be building so as always the
