of Tut's and today we're gonna be
showing you how to install bolt which is
a slight weight content management
system and we nice and easy nothing too
crazy here if you'd like you can if you
just want to check out the code and sort
of let's see what's going on with bolt
before you make any sort of commitment
you can go to the download and you can
just download their latest or if we want
to get into installing this let's go
ahead and click documentation here on
their page and we're going to follow the
installation instructions right here and
it gives you several ways to do it you
can do it with FTP you can do it using
git or we're just going to take the
option one then easy way using command
line because why not so what you first
need to do is open up your terminal so
here's our terminal and I'm going to
change directories into my sites folder
and I'm gonna make a new directory and
I'm just gonna have this be called bolt
so to make a new directory were just
gonna type mkdir and then bolt now let's
change directories into bolts
okay here we are well what we have to do
first first we have to grab bolt from
their server so you could just copy this
line here or you can copy all of these
at once and just paste it in I'm gonna
do these individually just so you can
see exactly what each lines doing so
what this line is doing is it's going to
grab this bolt underscore latest tgz
from their distribution and we're just
gonna enter and you'll see this is going
to be downloading gives you some nice
little statistics here some percentages
about you know how long it's taking to
download so that's all downloaded the
next thing we need to do is untie our
compressed file so that's what this line
is going to be doing and there you go
that's done and let's grab the last one
the last one is if you're not familiar
with terminal this is changing
permissions on these certain folders and
files to 777 so they can be writable by
anyone ok so there we go
so we now have
downloaded and what both uses out of the
box is sequel light and sequel light
doesn't really require you to set it up
with PHP myadmin or any of that stuff
that we did before when creating a
database so because we're just gonna be
giving an introduction to bolt right
here I'm gonna continue to use sequel
Lite and later videos I'm going to show
you how to use my sequel so what do we
need to do next
well next need to open up map or MAMP
Pro I have map Pro here so go ahead and
open up whatever you have I'm just gonna
add a new server name to mine however if
you're just using MAMP you won't have
these options so I've now gone to my
location where my site should be running
in and I'm getting a server error so
there's a couple things that could be
wrong here noted on the installing bolt
page it's saying if you're having issues
then to tweak the htaccess file and just
go to doc stat bolt that cm / setup and
try exactly what they're saying to do
here it's just one line it's not a big
deal however I happen to know what the
problem is this time so I'm getting a
server error and if you come to your
server and PHP version you'll notice
that my versions at 5.2.1 7 well this
needs to be 5 3 6 so I'm going to change
that PHP version and then click apply
restart my servers and let's see what
happens
okay so servers back up let's refresh
here and Wow so we're greeted by bolts
admin and we have this ability to create
a first user there's no users in the
database please create a user I'm going
to create a new username admin super
secret password and that is wrong both
alright and and level up tuts comm and
this is gonna be a Scott is my display
name no click admin and you'll see this
friendly you know Twitter bootstrap if
you're familiar with Twitter bootstrap
it's all over this thing and that's cool
you know I don't mind the Twitter
bootstrap that's nice and clean and for
an admin section I certainly am NOT
going to you know faulted for that I
happen to enjoy it in this particular
situation
so I'm gonna log in here and wow we are
now in bolt ready to go cool well in the
next lesson we're going to give you a
tour of the bolt back end and show you
where things are and then in later
videos we're gonna dive in a bit more
heavily and we're gonna show you how to
build a simple blog and all the great
stuff you can do in bolt so as always if
you have any questions or comments leave
a comment the video hits up at Twitter
our level up Hut's let us know what
you're thinking
once again this is Scott and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
