love-love Tut's and today we're going to
be learning some CoffeeScript so what
we're gonna get started with is we're
going to learn some of the basic
CoffeeScript syntax okay so this is
really great coffee script it's awesome
it makes writing things really easy so
let's get started if you remember in the
last lesson we created some variables we
had a our name and a person and the
output of our name for our person and
then assigned them for us nice and easy
and we didn't have to do anything crazy
okay so if you used to writing
JavaScript you know that writing
functions involves you know the
parentheses your brackets and you have
to assign it to a variable but in
CoffeeScript
writing a function is really really easy
you don't even have to type the word
function okay so if we want to have a
function and we're going to call this
just let's let's call this yell and this
is just going to be the yell function
all I need to do is yell is equal to and
then we're going to have a space and
then a hyphen and then a greater than
sign so it's just an arrow like this
right so yell equals space and then -
greater than or while just referring to
this as the arrow so so now that we have
that we'll hit enter and as you can see
when I hit enter it tapped me over one
space this indentation really drives
CoffeeScript forward
so now that I'm indented one one tab
below this function this is where I'm
going to have my function so if you want
to alert something let's just type alert
and then you can even just alert name
okay and notice how I did not use the
parenthesis you could use the
parenthesis if you want but you don't
have to okay so let's save this and
let's click over here you can see this
refreshed you can see what it created is
yell is well first to added this
variable yell and then says yell is
equal to a function with no arguments
and all it's going to do is return
alert name so let's actually so if we
actually just call down here make sure
you unpack space so you're not within
your function here if you just call yell
save and we're going to click here it's
going to call the yell function and this
is actually just going to alert the name
Scott so to illustrate this at distance
I don't have this script running
anywhere let's actually go to coffee
scripts website what they have on their
site here is they have this try coffee
script you can come in here and see and
you can run your code and see how it
works so if we click run now if I want
to call the L function click run and you
can see it alerts the name Scott so this
is really great if you want to test out
any code here and you want to see it
compiling live or you can sort of do it
the way I'm doing that sublime if you
want to make sure what you're writing
you know often when you're learning
CoffeeScript I think it's really cool to
type something and then just go analyze
what it output so that way you know
exactly what you're getting okay
and that way nothing surprises you so as
you can see this code alerts my name
when we run it it's awesome and look at
how clean this code is I mean this is
just unbelievable so it's created this
function
you also notice this return right here
CoffeeScript by default automatically
returns the last line in your function
for you so if we just had something like
it let's say let's have another variable
here let's just say age equals 25 okay
and then let's put something below here
we can say let's just do let's just type
it another alert and this can just be
age and we can say this let's go
over here and as you can see it's
returning this alert age so it's always
going to return the last line in your
function awesome okay so now this is how
you write a function in CoffeeScript
well so you notice here that there's no
arguments passed in here you say what if
you what if you want to add arguments
well right here before your arrow you're
going to do parentheses space and then
in your parentheses you can pass your
arguments so if we want to pass let's
say just a for age no okay and then we
want to assign age to a and then we want
to pass it here that's great
okay cool so as you can see here all
your arguments just go a space after
your equals into space before your arrow
and this has a function with an argument
of a and your variable age okay it's all
getting passed in and everything's
working awesomely so that's the basics
of functions in CoffeeScript as you can
see I'm passing an argument and
returning an alert all cool stuff and
we've hardly written any code it took us
no time at all so this is just the very
beginning of what CoffeeScript has to
offer in the next couple of tutorials
we're gonna be going over all of the
intricacies and all sorts of cool stuff
that CoffeeScript can do and you're
going to be writing some great code in
no time as always and this is Scott with
level up Tut's if you have any questions
or comments you could come on the video
hit us up at level of Tut's at Twitter
and just let us know what you think all
right thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
