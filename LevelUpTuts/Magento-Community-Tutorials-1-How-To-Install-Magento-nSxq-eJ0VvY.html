level of Tut's and today I'm going to
give you the first official Magento
lesson and this is how to install
Magento if you caught the 0.5 lesson
that was how to install the sample data
and how to get that ready if you want to
install the sample data please watch the
point 5 video the one that comes
directly before this if you do not need
the sample data then starting here is no
problem so just give you a little recap
Magento is a large e-commerce platform
the Community Edition is free to use it
has a lot of great features there's all
sorts of modules that you can connect to
the application to do all sorts of great
features and the whole the whole thing
is just really uh really exciting to use
so to get started I've already created a
database I'm using map pro if you need
any help with the map pro you know let
us know we might be able to do a
tutorial lesson on man per man Pro
because you can see I have a database
it's called level underscore match the
tables that are in it currently are the
ones from the sample data that we
installed in the previous lesson if you
do not install the sample data just
create your database and it will be
empty upon installing Magento that's no
big deal so you can go to Magento
commerce com slash download slash get
started and get the latest version of
community as the time of making these
tutorials we are on version 1.7 which
was added April 24 2012 so it's a new
version of The Gentle here we're all
pretty good to go it's already
downloaded here in my downloads
I have MAMP actually looking for a
folder called Magento into My Documents
so I'm just going to go ahead and throw
this Magento folder which is the one I
downloaded you can see how your files
are here into My Documents and it's
going to overwrite the folder I already
have in there which has nothing in it so
this is where it's going to be looking
of course if you don't plan on install
the sample data just sort of ignore this
next part but installing a sample data
at this point we thought we were pretty
much
we put the stuff in our database but
inside of the files they also gave us
you'll see this media catalog folder
you'll see that there's also inside of
our magenta folder a media folder you
don't want to overwrite this media
folder however you do want to add this
catalog folder to your media if you're
installing the sample data okay so next
thing is we have to make sure our
permissions are correct before
installing if you were to go to your
site right now let's browse to where a
map is looking for our site it's going
to take you to the install wizard and if
you you know select go to continue
whatever and you type in everything it's
going to tell you that some of your
files are not they don't have the
correct permissions so this is what it
looks like when you're going to install
but we need to verify that our
permissions are correct first so to do
that I'm going to use something like
transmitted if you're familiar with um
any sort of you know terminal commands
sage mod or anything you can do it that
way just any way that you know how to
change permissions this is just a good
sort of visual way to show it so we're
going to need to ensure that certain
directories have seven seven seven
permissions those being var so you can
see right now at 7:55 we'll apply this
and password okay so now it's seven
seven seven and also media needs to be
seven seven seven as well okay and then
we also need the the et Cie folder
that's within the app folder to be set
to seven seven seven you do that okay
okay so uh there might be some more
permissions things coming up I sort of
like to feel it out but it depending on
how your server is configured that's
pretty much usually it so let's see
where am I and then Eastern Standard
Time
okay we're using the US dollar this is
where you want to set up your uh you
know your currency for where your
location for the your know your main
location for your site is okay it will
click continue okay so this is your
configuration screen our host is just
localhost our database name is whatever
you named your database you could have
named it anything by default they just
fill in Magento for you
ours was level underscore match or
whatever you had it this is your
username and password if you're using
MAMP or mad Pro it's just going to be
root and root I actually have a custom
password for mine I don't you know you
don't have to do that but uh so you can
have this be whatever your password is
by default root and root base URL is
just your normal URL you shouldn't have
to change that the admin path is where
you're going to be going to go to your
admin section typically I just leave it
as admin I'm used to it it's nice and
easy although you know they suggest
maybe back-end or control or whatever I
just leave it as admin we're going to
leave this enable charts click because I
like the charts they're nice no reason
to uncheck this the other ones will just
leave unchecked we're not using an SSL
because we're on a local host here so
filesystems fine okay click continue
okay so here's your account admin
account information I'm just putting my
full name in here because it's what I do
it's a tol and it's ok and my email
username I'm going to leave this as
advant because I like saying is admin
it's always easy to remember and
password it can be whatever you like
okay and then an encryption key if this
field was left empty it's going to
create one for you so I'm going to leave
it empty click continue ok so it looks
like my password did not fit their
requirements needs to contain a new
numbers and
okay so let's just click that whatever
okay so now it's giving me a looks like
this is a encryption key right so I'm
just it says store this in someplace
safe I'll just copy this I'm going to
paste this somewhere safer even better
yet I'm just going to take a screenshot
of this page just so I can have that
later just in case you need this number
for anything okay so you now have
Magento installed if we go to our
front-end here our site will be loading
up all nice and fine as you can see all
of those default products that we wanted
to be in there the all of that sample
data has been installed it looks like we
have a full working store already so
this is what's so great about Magento in
almost no time we installed the sample
data and we have you know a great well
we have a nice-looking store that we can
then skin and theme and move around we
can do anything we want with it but it's
a great starting point this is much
further along than many other content
management systems or even ecommerce
platforms will get you right in the
beginning okay so hopefully you now have
Magento installed if you have any
troubles let me know hit me up in the
comments I'll do my best to try to help
you out obviously I won't be able to
solve all the problems because I don't
know your specific setups but um you
know just let me know what you're what
you're thinking or if you have any
questions and I'll do my best
so once again this is Scott with LevelUp
Tut's and thanks for watching in the
next couple of tutorials will be giving
you just a brief overview of Magento as
a whole thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
