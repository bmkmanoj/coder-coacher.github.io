explained I'm going to explain a basic
code pen I made here to create this
Wayne's World styled text now if you
aren't familiar with the movie or the
SNL skit Wayne's World they have this
whole Wayne's World intro in which the
text does this sort of well exactly
what's going on in this code pen right
here and although it's their logo it's
something I always really liked so I
wanted to take a stab at making this in
CSS and it's super easy so let's go
ahead and take a look at exactly how I
did it maybe what some of the challenges
are now check out one thing that's
really nice about this is that the
effect still works whether it's one line
or two lines or whatever we were to
change the text it's always going to
work and this thing is not a super
difficult but it's deceptive because
there are some unique challenges so
let's take a look at the code that's
going on in a party time so first and
foremost I am using CSS variables on
this if you aren't initialized to CSS
variables the basics here are that I'm
basically creating a variable named
shadow and I'm doing so on the root so I
can use it throughout this entire
document now the shadow is simply just
an RGB a value that's giving us this
transparent blue both the shadows here
are the same blue when they overlay it
makes one of them look a little bit
deeper just because they're both add to
0.4 transparency so next we have our
animation now this is where the bulk of
everything is but I'm going to leave
this for the end while we talk about the
rest body is exactly what you would
expect a text-align:center at color and
a background the h1 here is simply just
getting a font size on the class of
partytime which is the name of this
animation I'm translating it by default
up negative 20 pixels in both directions
now this is where it's kind of
interesting here addition I also have a
shadow here and I actually
have two shadows I have one that's 10
pixels back and 10 pixels down so 10
pixels to the right 10 pixels from the
top and 0 blur so it's a another
mirrored image let me just turn off this
animation right now so we can see this
the default state so you can see it's 10
down ten to the right and with zero blur
and then another one that's 20 down 20
to the right now when I originally
created this I did these all as stylus
functions and so it was very easy to
change the dimensions of this all and
have it be responsive to those changes
you could have it be way bigger way mark
stream for this particular example I
just wanted to focus on the animation
itself so these things can be more
flexible if you're using a CSS
preprocessor and they could probably be
even more flexible regardless but you
would see I'm using our variable for our
shadow for the color that's the syntax
for actually using a variable and then I
simply just have a transition on this
thing now I actually don't need this
transition I think I can probably remove
it that might be left over from
something else but the main bulk here is
going to take place in this animation
and this animation does basically it's
saying hey run the partytime animation
make it take 3 seconds and have it be
infinite because this is a looping
animation it's going to look like it's
never starting over it's always kind of
going if you if you were to want this to
be faster you would change it this
animation time down to one second slower
five seconds you get the picture nothing
crazy here yet so let's talk a little
bit about why I had to do this transform
so let's turn off our animation and
let's turn off our transform and you'll
see the entire thing moved but in the
animation itself the top layer is moving
where the shadow layer is not moving the
shadow layer is always staying in the
same spot so this is kind of tricky
because well how do you move the top
layer and not move the shadow the answer
lies in that you do move the shed
and you do move the top layer you just
do them backwards so when I add this a
transform and translate 3d of negative
20 pixels and negative 20 pixels
well the shadow itself is staying in the
center where the white text technically
should be but that's the base of the
animation right this thing that's where
this thing should be based off of
because we're rotating around that point
so because of that we're translating it
up into the left negative 20 pixels to
offset the shadow that's going down to
the right 20 pixels and this takes place
on every step of the animation as well
now this animation is kind of tricky
because of that because in every single
keyframe the text is moving in the
opposite direction that the shadow is
placed in causing this illusion that
nothing is moving
so let's actually take a look at our
animation and see the reality of things
so I have four different points of this
animation which you can imagine are the
four corners at 0% it starts negative 20
negative 20 which is up top left here
right there then on the 25% it
translates the text well it keeps it at
the negative 20 so that's still up top
while moving it over 20 pixels and then
again at the bottom that goes 20 20 and
then negative 20 20 now let's see what
this thing would look like if we removed
these transforms from every step of the
animation and see what we're seeing now
is this is the sort of route of the
animation is actually the shadow moving
so on each step again the shadow
originally starts at the 10 10 and 20 20
I'll just use the 20 values okay so it
starts at the 20 20 down here then the
next step of the animation it goes to
negative 20 20 then negative 20 negative
20 and then 20 negative 20 up top here
so this whole thing is really an
illusion where the TEC shadow
is moving like this and the transform is
doing the exact opposite thing and then
therefore we get this offsetting look
see this is what the text is doing like
this and because the shadow is also
moving at the same time we get this
offset where the bottom text there the
shadow itself looks like it's not moving
at all despite the values for the
animation of it changing every single
time so I can't necessarily say that
this thing is going to be performant or
that it's not gonna make your CPU go up
it's fine on my computer I haven't done
any performance testing so I have no
idea just how graphically intense this
this kind of thing is we're doing
animating a text shadow and doing a
transform I can't imagine it's anything
crazy but probably not something you
want to throw everywhere but for you
know a fun at party time this kind of
effect is pretty neat but it just goes
to show you that there are some creative
solutions for this kind of thing and now
obviously you can tweak this effect to
make it as crazy as you want you could
have the Tet shadows be way more deep
than just two shadows you could change
the colors on the shadows as they go
like they do actually in Wayne's World
so this is a nice little code pen that I
made myself that I wanted to share with
you because it has a creative solution
to solving an issue that's not entirely
possible without some creative solution
so hope you enjoyed party time and check
it out I'll link this code pen you can
fork it you can do whatever you want
with it
it is totally open to the world if you
want to make some Wayne's world a style
text alright so as always thank you so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this nice little CSS trick here I'm
gonna be doing a lot more CSS content
talking about CSS grid and variables and
sort of fancy new CSS features as well
as just sort of excellent modern CSS so
