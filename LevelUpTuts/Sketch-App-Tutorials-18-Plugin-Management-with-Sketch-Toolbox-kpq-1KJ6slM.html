Tut's and today we're to show you a
brand new tool for sketch three in fact
it's so new that it's still in beta so
they have all sorts of warnings about
the interface not being final but you
can start using this tool today what I'm
talking about is the sketch tool box and
the tool box allows you a nice visual
way of managing your sketch plug-ins so
check it out we're going to get into
that right now
now what we need to do is come to sketch
tool box come here and click this
download the beta that way you can get
access to the beta so now it says what
this does for you it lets you browse the
most popular plugins it lets you
download and install new plugins with a
single click it automatically keeps
those plugins up to date and soon it's
going to give you organization it's
going to allow you to sort and custom
shortcuts basically it's going to get
way better but it's also already super
awesome so go ahead and download the
beta and keep in mind that they do have
warnings all over you know this is what
it looks like currently and stuff like
that so it is very fresh but it works
great so let's check it out so I've
dragged it into my applications and now
into my dock here I've clicked open and
let's see sketch tool box so here we
have a listing of all of these great
plugins now in a previous video we had
to drag a plug-in folder into our
plugins directory to get it working now
this is just so much more simple and
just way nicer so I'm really glad that
the team behind this put forth the
effort to make this what it is because
it's a really nice companion to sketch 3
so like I said this is a work in
progress so you might run into some
hiccups but things are nice so let's go
ahead and install this first one color
mine all I have to do is click install
you can see it's already downloaded and
installed now let's come to sketch which
we have open under plugins you'll see
that color mine already exists I mean
it's really that easy it's that fast and
we can basically this is pulling color
from a color lovers palette and we can
grab just a URL of one of these
color palettes this is the first one I
pick so don't judge me if you hate it
and let's come in here and paste in the
URL there we go we know once we zoom out
you can see we've brought in this color
palette here it is with nice big blocks
now it's fantastic about sketch three is
that without having to do anything it
adds these colors to our color palette
so if we select let's say this square
right here and we decide to change its
fill you'll notice that our colors which
is the same yellow and this red the it's
the most common colors in our document
so if we select this yellow it's going
to be the same yellow that's right here
so this color lovers plugin is great
especially if you use that site to
manage color palettes and test out new
combinations so check it out the sketch
tool box is a tool that you should start
using right now if you're using sketch
and it's only going to get better as
