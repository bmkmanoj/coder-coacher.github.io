up tux and today we're going to install
WordPress on a Mac using MAMP and we're
going to be using MAMP
Pro but you can just install it with any
software that you're using to run your
server on your Mac legs amp or NAMP
just normal map so it's nice and easy ah
really what you have to do is come to
wordpress.org then you can go to a
download WordPress the latest version as
of recording this video is 3.8 and it
takes to this screen where you can just
click this download WordPress button
right here or you can also download the
torrent GZ which is our only 5.6
megabytes so it might down a little bit
faster but generally downloads pretty
quick anyway so to say some time I
already have it downloaded and I have it
uncompressed here and it's on my desktop
so I have this folder WordPress and let
me get out of this view here just like
that cool
so inside of this folder we have some
stuff there's also a hidden htaccess
file in here that you can't see because
obviously you can't see hidden files
without running a command on your Mac so
we have this these files here and what
we're going to do is grab this entire
WordPress folder and I'm going to just
move it in to where I keep my sites so I
keep my sites in a folder called sites
and then the level of Todd sites are in
level up I'm just going to drop it in
here now I could name this anything I
wanted to but I'm just going to leave it
as WordPress now let's come to our make
up software and I'm just going to set up
a new a new host here keep in mind that
if you don't know how to do this we can
certainly have other videos to show you
how to set up this stuff but this series
is more about WordPress and less about
man Pro so you can see so I need to go
inside of this folder we have our new
location is that just at WordPress it's
pointing to this folder and I'm just
going to click apply it's going to
restart our servers and that's cool so
really what we have to do before we can
install WordPress you'll notice if we go
to our WordPress localhost which would
just be weird
in Port 8888 it's going to give us this
there doesn't seem to be a wp-config we
need this so it's going to ask you to
create a WP config file and and it's
also going to ask us to have a database
ready so let's go ahead and create this
WP config and it's going to say let's go
let's you need a database name a
database username data's password host
and table prefix if you want to it says
if you want to want run more than one
WordPress on a single database which we
don't here because we're going to be
keeping it basic so let's go click this
let's go and right away it asks us for
this database information and we haven't
created a database yet so let's go ahead
and do that in my PHP admin we can just
go ahead and create a new database and
I'm just going to prefix this with WP
and then level up so the name of this
database is going to be WP underscore
and then level up just like that
so we have our database its WP
underscore level up so let's come here
and our database name is going to be WP
underscore level up username is root
with math username is always root and
the passwords typically root although
I've changed my password to RTC
I don't know why exactly it's not really
for security reasons just for
customization so don't bother trying to
steal this password for anything this
isn't a legitimate password that I use
for anything database host we have
localhost and table prefixes WP
underscore now I know in zamp it's the
password is just blank and then also for
WAMP the passwords just blank so root
link so if you're using either of those
you can go ahead and try that if it
doesn't work with just root so let's go
to click Submit now it says all right
basically you've made it through this
part of installation it's communicating
with the database it's ready to install
I mean if we were to come to our
database here there's still nothing here
so let's go ahead and click run the
install and now this is going to do is
its
going to grab some information and
create our site into the database so the
site is going to be level up tuts
and the user name we can just make this
be admin for now and I'm just going to
type in a weak password because this is
not going live however you are going to
be wanting to make your password not
very weak and this is really good about
letting you know if it's weak or not by
giving you this this color coded signal
here if your password is strong and
we're going to go ahead and say my email
is just Scott at level up
tuts calm okay and allow search engines
to index the site now this site is never
going online but if it were we would
want search engines to index the site
because otherwise they're not going to
get that information to correctly list
the site and rank it correctly so you're
going to want to go ahead and have
search engines be able to index and look
through your site so let's click install
WordPress and we get a success and it's
asking if I want to save the password
sure I'll say by password that's just a
browser thing and if I come into our
database now if we refresh let's come to
my PHP myadmin and then our WordPress
level up you'll see it's now populated
with information about our site and so
that only is our site completely done we
can log in to the backend of the site we
can go to the front of the site simply
by just deleting this end of the URL
here so just as WordPress and our port
number now you can see here that this is
the base default theme we have going on
it's got a sample page basically hello
world this is what the latest version of
WordPress looks like out of the box now
if we come to our login page we can add
in our information which is just admin
and my non strong password of course
your password should be strong again now
let's click login and you can see we are
now in the WordPress admin site now
WordPress has changed a lot
in the past a couple years it changes
all the time and it's usually for the
best
well usually always for the best so this
might look a little bit different for
you if you're logging on a year from now
or two years from now or whatever but
the process is most likely very similar
you're downloading WordPress you're
making your database you're connecting
them and then you click install so we
have our site it's just another
WordPress site according to the tagline
here and we have our hello world text
which means we're ready to go so
WordPress is now installed and we're
ready for the next video so the next
video I'm going to talk about what has
happened now that we've installed the
site and what this exactly means so as
always this is Scott with LevelUp Tut's
if you have any questions or comments
please don't comment the video or hit us
