tuts and today i want to show you how to
use no query which is a part of break
points which allows you to output a
version of your style sheets without
media queries at all and it's incredibly
easy to set up in fact with the way
omega is already let me get rid of this
okay with the way that omega is already
we don't have to really do anything
because they've already included a no
queries scss which compiles to a no
queries dot CSS that you can see up here
and you can see what it does is it sets
two variables breakpoint no queries true
and break point no query fallbacks true
and then it also imports our styles so
what it does is it sets these two
variables to true imports all the styles
and then runs right so how it does that
is based off of what these two variables
are doing so this breakpoint no queries
true is what's telling SAS to hey in
this file don't render your media
queries just just don't render them but
render everything that's in the media
queries so if we were to remove this
line it would effectively not it would
it would cause this to not work right
the way that we intended it to now
what's the second line this breakpoint
no query fallbacks so what does a break
points no query fallbacks variable will
do will actually give you the option of
adding fallbacks to your media query so
instead of just rendering it without a
media query it could render it with an
additional class so if you're using
something like moderniser or something
then you could render it with a
additional class that didn't exist there
so uh the easiest way to illustrate that
will be to use an example straight out
of the breakpoint wiki right so they
have basically a variable touch
that's saying it's going to be equal to
pointer course and then comma we have no
hyphen query and then space dot touch so
basically once we use this touch
variable in our our media query it's
going to say okay one that when the when
you're using touch not only have the
media query exists but when media
queries shouldn't exist exactly when we
have a no query assignment the ver are
the class of touch ahead of it so now if
we save this right let's check out some
stuff with our CSS if you look at our
note we read add CSS besides these add
media which is these are just uh just to
have why these are just debugging things
so ignore them you'll notice it it's not
outputting our media queries right but
what it is outputting is just our CSS
that doesn't belong in media queries so
for example if we look at this page
right it's not getting the desktop
Styles right it's just getting the
margin zero what we want to see happen
is we want to see inside of el page we
want to see a width of whatever this is
supposed to be and a width of whatever
this is supposed to be when I guess it's
44 m's and then a width of the 70 ms
that the desktop is going to be and it
should be just straight up removing
these so we'd be seeing two widths
define there but it's not doing that so
what we need to do is we need to say
that no query is true to do that all we
need to say is comma true and then
likewise here we can say comma true and
then down here come on true and comma
true
okay now that's good if we come to our
no query CSS the bit of code that we're
looking for last time is actually there
now so it says L page not only do we
have this but you can see its margin 44
m and then it gets overwritten the
margin 70 m so when you have a browser
like Internet Explorer or something it's
going to see that this width is
overriding this width and the page will
be the correct width for a desktop
layout now that's if you're building it
mobile first which I assume a lot of you
are and so that is the no query what
happens if we want to use our our
fallback right so let's take one of
these and we're just going to say that
that this page only gets the desktop
with actually let's say on touch devices
only we're going to say include break
point and then now we can just pass the
variable touch actually I'm going to
move this variable that I put in our no
queried add CSS or SCSS where is that I
have I'm going to move this right here
this touch variable I'm going to throw
this into our grid otherwise this vixen
won't see this ok we're going to say
breakpoint touch background is going to
be blue ok so check this out and what
it's going to do in our CSS no queried
add CSS what we're going to get is we're
not only going to get n L page with
these widths but we're also going to get
one that says if the document has a
class of that touch then L page will
have a background of blue and therefore
whatever system we're using to give our
body of the site a class of touch with
touchscreen phones or whatever basically
we'll make it so we can set a class here
to define specific things like that when
we need to now this is just a fallback
so it's
cool so not only do have a responsive
grid but we also have a NOAA no query
CSS stylesheet that's going to get shown
to older versions of ie that cannot
handle media queries great so hopefully
by now you're starting to see the
awesome things that these sass
extensions could do for your workflow
and the total value they add to building
websites like this I mean really we have
hardly any lines of code here and we're
doing so much it's just really amazing
now keep in mind that this is not
exactly how I would structure my code
normally we've been talking about you
know there's all sorts of different ways
you can do stuff so here we just said
you know breakpoint to have true with
this tab you could also move these
statements outside of a el page and then
have a help page wrap this you could
have all your media queries in one spot
you could keep your media queries with
your layouts you can keep your media
queries with your with your components
basically whatever makes sense to you
works and as long as it is structured in
a way that is going to make sense for
others that works too great so that
should be everything you need to know to
get started really working on your grid
and in the next couple of videos we're
going to talk about some cool stuff
we're going to get into more advanced
things you can do with breakpoint and
singularity we're going to talk about
what happens if you want to use a
different grid framework like a
different SAS based grid framework like
Susie and then we're going to talk about
layouts after that building layouts
creating layouts modifying them whatever
you want extending them so keep watching
we have a lot more videos planned it's
going to get really awesome so as always
this is scott level of Tut's if you have
any questions or comments will become in
the video hit us up at Twitter at level
of tests thanks for watching right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
