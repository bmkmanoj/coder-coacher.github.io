tutorials and in this video we're going
to install meteor and create our project
so to get started with meteor we can
went ahead to meteor dot-com now you can
always just click this Install Now
button here and this will take you to
basically the installation instructions
if you're on a Windows machine you're
gonna want to click here download the
Installer if you're on OSX or Linux you
can head over to your terminal and just
paste in this curl command that this is
basically just going to go ahead and
install the one point for the latest
version of meteor on your computer so we
can head to I use I term here and fish
shell so if you want your shell to look
and function like mine use I term 2 this
is actually like I term 2 beta and the
basic shell where we have these colors
and stuff like that this comes from fish
shell so head over to the level up tips
playlist and check out the fish shell
videos if you're interested in that I
highly recommend it fish shell is a
super cool shell replacement for your
computer ok so basically I'm gonna paste
in this curl command hit enter and this
is going to install meteor on our
computer with the latest version you'll
notice it says it's removing my existing
meteor installation this is just because
I currently have it installed if you
don't have it installed that you won't
see that message now give this some time
to do its thing and we'll come back
after this is finished and now it's
going to ask you for your password I can
just hit my password enter and as you
can see I now have meteor installed on
my computer so what I want to go before
ahead and create our first meteor
application is I want to just go ahead
and change directory into my sites
folder I keep all of my sites into a
sites folder for the level up tutorials
videos I keep them in a level up
tutorials folder so we can just type
level up tutorials ok and this will just
be create
voting app okay go ahead and hit enter
and this is going to go ahead and
basically download and create all of the
different folders and folder structures
that we need so that when we run the
meteor command that our application just
sort of comes up and running okay now
let's change directories into our new
application with CD and then voting app
there we go and now let's just run the
meteor command you'll notice this is
going to start up MongoDB which is
actually itself contained within meteor
here that's going to be our database and
it's going to build our application now
the great thing about meteor is that
it's not only the front-end framework
using a framework called blaze it's not
only the database with MongoDB but you
have things like WebSockets a whole
server-side node framework you have an
account system you have a whole ton of
stuff to make building applications easy
and the cool thing about meteor is it's
by default all in real time so you're
gonna see some of those benefits right
off the bat so let's go ahead and head
over to Chrome and run to our localhost
3000 so I'm gonna close at my meteor tab
here and in a blank tab I'm going to
just paste in this localhost 3000 and as
you can see I have a welcome to meteor
where I have dude the tutorial follow
the guide read the docs these are all
great ideas by the way so you'll want to
go ahead and spend some time reading
Docs
however Doc's are not always the most
fun thing in the world and I totally
understand I'm gonna plus to make this a
little bit bigger but as you can see
here we have this basic click Me button
and every time I click it 2 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 it keeps going up and up and up so
for the remainder of this series what
we're gonna be doing is essentially
going through the basic features of
meteor so that you not only understand
what you're doing but why you're doing
it in a way
you can build a nice structure or
foundational knowledge for meteor 1.4
and above so because this is meteor 1.4
and above we will be using some es6 or
ES 2015-2016 stuff inside of here if you
aren't familiar with things like arrow
functions and spread operators stuff
like that
do not worry about it every time I use
something like that I'm going to sort of
explain what it means in plain old
regular JavaScript but because meteor
has a built-in build system we don't
have anything to worry about there
because meteor is going to take care of
all of that and we don't have to do any
configuration we don't have to write any
web pack files we don't have to write
any gulp files we don't have to do any
of that and that's really part of the
benefit of meteor is just how easy it is
to get up and running to get going and
to create something amazing so as always
this is Scott with LevelUp tutorials in
the next video we're going to explore
the code that comes when we ran this
create meteor and then we're going to
dive into what exactly is going on in
that code how its structured how its
laid out and then we're going to nuke it
we're gonna delete it all and we're
going to start over with something cool
so check it out as always this is Scott
