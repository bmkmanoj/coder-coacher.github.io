tuts and today I want to be talking
about CSS animation and if you notice
before we use something called
transition in transition is something
that's going to take place on like a
status change when you're hovering or
something this is something that you can
have animating just any old time and
it's pretty cool however it only works
on ie 10 it only works on Firefox 5 and
up with the Mozilla prefix chrome 4 and
up with the WebKit prefix Safari 4 and
up with these WebKit prefix opera 12
with the O prefix and pretty much any
version of Android or Safari with the
WebKit prefix and we're going to first
create a div and I'm just going to
create a random mold if I'm going to put
it just right up top here in our HTML
and I'm going to animate this so that
it's rotating 360 degrees constantly
forever so let's check this out inside
of our header here I'm just going to
make a div and I'm going to give it a
class and it's just going to be it's
going to be spin and I'm going to say
this div is just going to spin it's not
even going to contain anything it's just
going to be a div okay so let's go to
our CSS and I'm going to say for the
class of spin you're going to be it's a
width it'll be we'll say 100 pixels
width it's going to be a perfect square
height it's also going to be 100 pixels
and the background color is going to be
white just because the background is
purple and we want to stand out okay so
here is our div let's go to our page to
make sure it's showing up okay here's
our white div same size as our logo
right here it's just going to be
spending underneath it okay so how do we
approach this well with CSS transition
what you had to do is you had to put the
transition on the item and then when you
had a hover State that's where you had
the
property change so then it transitioned
into that property well for animation
you actually have to build out your
animation separately it's using a
completely different syntax than we
might be used to okay so I'm going to
write out the first one and then I'll
copy and paste and fill in the second
one so we're going to start out with a
WebKit and you're going to use an at and
they act and then WebKit and then -
keyframes and then you're going to name
your animation it's whatever you want so
we're just going to call this spin and
then we have brackets okay so now comes
the time where you need to decide what
happens at what point in your animation
so we're going to say at zero percent of
the way through the animation then
brackets we're going to say it's going
to rotate and since this is only WebKit
we only need the WebKit rotation so I'm
going to grab this WebKit rotation I'm
going to put it in here and I'm going to
say zero degrees because at the start of
our animation we only want it to be
rotate we want it to be at zero okay and
by the end of our animation which is 100
percent of the way through our animation
we want it to be 360 degrees we want to
be all the way back to the start so here
is our animation now to build this out
I'm just going to paste this a couple of
times what we need here is several
different animations just like we have
with our vendor prefixes before this is
going to be mo Z and this is going to be
O and not 0 it's going to be oh okay and
this last one is just going to be key
frames at key frames just like this and
of course I still have this WebKit
transition in here so I need to change
these as well
Kayne's just get rid of these okay so
here's our animation it's going to work
on all of these different browsers we
have our browser prefixes everything if
we save this you'll notice there's
nothing telling what is going to be
using this animation what's going to be
spinning here so we want to put
something in here with our spin and this
is maybe a little bit more like you'd
expect to see and we need to have again
all of these vendor prefixes and you
know if you'll notice here it's getting
a little bit I mean we have a lot of
code to just do this rotate but you know
this is the way that css3 is working
right now so we just have to deal with
it and that's why there's things like
css3 please to help us out you can copy
and paste code from there really quickly
and or if you are into sass encompass
it's also great for css3 okay so for
here this is the name of our animation
like we had called it before you can
call it anything spin and we're going to
say it's going to take five seconds to
spin 360 degrees and it's going to do
that infinitely now keep in mind that
this property can be set to a specific
number if you say to it's going to go
through twice and then stop infinite it
so it's either a number or it's infinite
so other things you can have as the up
for properties of your animation you can
also have a delay if you're if you put a
number in front of here it's going to be
a delay you can have a timing function
so you can do easing just sort of like
he did with transition and you can even
give it a direction whether it's you
know normal or alternate so if this were
to go
alternating you'd see a rotate one way
and then rotate back the other way let's
actually just check this out and see our
object rotating and then refresh this
and just like that over the course of
five seconds this thing rotates although
one okay rotates 360 so you'll notice
that it's spinning 360 degrees slowing
down stopping and then going
again what happens if we want this to be
sort of evenly spinning the entire time
well the default for animation for the
timing function of animation is actually
easy so what we want to be able to do is
we want to set this to be linear so
let's come back up here and and then
after our duration we would just want to
write linear okay I'm going to copy and
paste this down below and they'll have
it kit now let's refresh this and as you
can see we have a constantly rotating
cube cool even better
okay well let's actually try one more
thing I'm going to show you this
animation on hover so we're going to
take this same code I'm going to pull it
out of here and then I'm going to do
spin hover animation okay
so let's refresh this our cubes not
spinning we rotate it hovers off however
off okay well this is how you control
rotation and animation you can get some
really cool things going you can animate
anything just like you could with a
transition you could have things flying
around whatever you want keep it
tasteful keep it cool but keep it
limitless try to figure out interesting
combinations of things to use and try to
do something that no one else has done
before as always this is Scott with
