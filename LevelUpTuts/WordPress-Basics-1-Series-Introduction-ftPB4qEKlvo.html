of Tut's and today we're going to start
a wordpress basics series in this
WordPress basics series is just a
lead-in to a wordpress advanced series
and so we're really going to cover
everything from getting started with
WordPress to being completely in tune
with how to customize and master not
only the administrative and plugins and
things like that but building your own
plugins and really building your own
content types and getting into the code
and just getting really familiar with
how to do things in WordPress and how to
find out how to do things in WordPress
so we're going to start off with the
absolute basics we're going to take it
in - all the way from installing it on
both Mac and PC we're going to show you
a tour of the back end a tour of the
front end what you get when you install
WordPress then we're going to show you
how to start using it and this can be
for content editors and people or people
who are just wanting to learn WordPress
in general so you're going to learn how
to publish and take control of your
content with WordPress whether you're
hosting a blog or website that is built
on WordPress for other purposes and
we'll also dive into some of the
features that you may not know about the
stock built in WordPress install that
comes with it and we'll show you how to
install plugins to extend your WordPress
install and to do more things now we're
also going to get into theming but how
not only to build your own themes but to
use base themes to build a more complex
and more rich themes as well as
installing themes that you may have
purchased from somewhere else so there's
going to be a lot of videos here there's
going to be a lot of content but the
best part is is that we're going to
break it up into short videos on
individual topics so you don't have to
spend a long time listening to a bunch
of videos just to find out the one
answer you want to find out we're going
to be covering small chunks so you can
find exactly what you need to know so as
always this is Scott with LevelUp tuts
