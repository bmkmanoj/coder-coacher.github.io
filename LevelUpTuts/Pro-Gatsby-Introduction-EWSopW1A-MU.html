tutorials and welcome to pro gatzby in
this course we're gonna be covering
everything you need to know to get
started with the most exciting static
site generator around called Gatsby now
this is a static site generator that
takes graph QL react and spits out a
blazingly fast static site so check out
Pro Gatsby in this video I'm going to be
showing you a little bit about what
we're going to be doing in this series
and what you'll learn and what the
takeaways are so let's get started right
now hey what's up this is Scott with
level up tutorials and in this video
series we are going to be covering
Gatsby jas now Gatsby is the blazingly
fast static site generator for react now
what does that mean it means you can
build sites that in production load this
quickly watch this this is hosted on a
free tier of net low fee this is a free
host watch this reload here do you see
anything changed the background blurred
that's it these the post the title no
the text even changed the only thing
that changed was this giant image had to
temporarily progressively load and all
of this stuff comes for free with Gatsby
there's a lot here what we're gonna be
doing is building a blog now we're gonna
be building this blog several ways it's
going to have a really cool page
transition animation when you load a new
post did you see how fast that post
changed this is a fully new page change
right here and we're using the web
animations API to make this animation
happen so even some fun stuff there but
this platform what we do in several
different ways over the course of this
series is build a platform that one
works with markdown files first and
foremost that you can edit exactly in
your application - we're actually going
to show you how to get this up and
running with something called net low
fee CMS which is actually a really
interesting CMS that modifies your code
for you it's like a CMS without a back
end when you have a CMS or WordPress
style interface but when you make
modifications it's just updating
markdown files and on top of that we're
going to be showing you another platform
called content fall which is a full-on
back-end that is way more like something
like wordpress then that you
ever seen before the cool thing about
this is that that this can connect with
the host metla fight to trigger rebuilds
on the gatsby site because Gatsby's
aesthetic sight generator now a whole
lot more on that concept as we go in
these videos but the whole at the end of
the day you're going to be having a site
that is insanely fast its sanely
performant and really really easy to
cheaply host all over the place you can
host this thing on github pages you
could host it on Go Daddy's cheapest
tier of hosting and you can host it on
something like metla Phi and let me tell
you we're gonna be diving into net Liffe
I'd quite a bit it's my new favorite
platform for hosting things especially
sites like this it is absolutely amazing
so as we go in the series you're going
to learn the ins and outs of gatsby from
building anything inside of here to
working with the node API to working
with several plugins registering pages
and all of what this kind of stuff is
even going on here we're even gonna dive
into graph QL queries talk a lot about
the graphical editor and talk about how
you can fully understand what exactly
you're doing at every step of the way
and I mentioned before we are doing
things with the web animation API and
this progressive image loading comes in
through a plugin as well and gatsby
allowing you to do some really awesome
static site generating image
manipulation stuff so that's what we're
gonna be doing in this series if this
sounds like something you are interested
in learning fire up the next video as we
get started learning Gatsby and we start
to build this blog out and you're gonna
see immediately just how powerful
