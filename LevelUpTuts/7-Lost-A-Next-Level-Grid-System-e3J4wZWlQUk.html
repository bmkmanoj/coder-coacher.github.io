up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you my favorite grid system
now this is Corey Simmonds lost grid now
lost is based on a calc and it uses some
really really cool techniques to make a
next-generation grid system in addition
it also offers some really cool flexbox
grid features as well so that's it going
on installing and checking out lot so my
personal project there's a couple of
post CSS packages I'm using on almost
every project so like we've covered
autoprefixer before the other one is
lost by Corey Simmonds now you may have
heard his name before he's the creator
of the jeat grid along with some other
really interesting grids he has put a
lot of care into making this lost grid
system and honestly it is my favorite
grid it is my go-to grid is the one I
want to use in a minks life easy so
let's go ahead and use this lost grid
with our post CSS now you may be
wondering why lost grid is in post CSS
rather than sass or stylus or less or
anything like that now I even talked to
Cory exactly about this but from what I
understand it really just makes lost
grid that much more flexible because
it's not tied to sass or stylus or less
he doesn't have to update it in three
different places when he makes a change
she just has to update it once with post
CSS and like I've mentioned in a lot of
these videos you can use post CSS with
sass or stylus or less so he's not
making any assumptions about the
preprocessor that you use and you can
still take advantage of this awesome
grid system so let's go ahead and
install it with NPM install - - save -
dev and now the package is just lost so
we can type lost
this is gonna go ahead and grab the lost
grid for us now we can actually throw
this into our gulp file just by heading
over to sublime text and let's head to
our gulp file I'm actually going to get
rid of this pre CSX and I'm going to get
rid of this next CSS and I'm going to
get over to this CSS ring the only one
I'm gonna keep is autoprefixer I don't
want any of these other ones sort of
getting in the way here we go like so
and let's go ahead and add loss now so
we can save our lost is equal to require
parentheses and then we can just say
lost now we can just wrap that off with
the semicolon there now we can just add
lost to the list of processors now if we
come here we can just simply add this
here and put a comma there and now we
should be able to start using lost so
now I'm gonna come back to our CSS that
we're editing I'm gonna get rid of some
of this next CSS syntax here let's get
rid of this color and section this
mix-ins and stuff like that and let's
get rid of some more of this stuff here
just so we can declutter this a bit now
let's go ahead and run our gulp so we
can say gulp watch : styles and it's
gonna be watching our styles and as you
can see once we save this you can see
it's all good so we just have the
autoprefixer stuff in here let's just
show you what comes out when you just
use a real basic lost grid property so
we can just have a div tag here and we
can say lost - column and then we can
give this a fraction so let's say we
want each of these columns to be one
half of the width of its parent so now
when we save this let's take a look at
what's getting generated before we
actually get into some HTML and building
any practical graphs you can see that
this is using calc so it's calculating
the width here of our divs so it's gonna
be one half essentially of 99.99 percent
and then it's actually subtracting some
gutter with stuff here and as you can
see the
and child.and is getting a margin-right
of 30 pixels and it's getting floated
left and the last child is it getting a
margin rate of zero as well as the nth
child to n now this has to do with the
cycle which is an important part of loss
grid and by default lost uses the
denominator of your function to grab the
enth chilled here basically saying every
other div give it a margin right of zero
now if we were to have this as something
as you can imagine like 1/3 you would
want each item to take up of 1/3 so
therefore there's going to be three
items per row therefore you'd want the
third item to have a margin right of
zero okay so now just looking at this
sort of basic lost column 1/3 it's kind
of abstract just seeing all this calc
stuff so what we're gonna be doing in
the next video is building some
real-life grids we're gonna be showing
you the cycle property we're gonna be
showing you how you can make some really
interesting stuff and then in a couple
of other videos we're gonna be just
talking about general features that come
with the loss grid that don't come with
any other grid system so as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any question or comments leave a
come in the video areas up at Twitter or
Facebook at level up tutorials we'd love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
