up tuts and today I'm going to be
talking about wordpress templates now
although the next most important thing
after the style that CSS file in terms
of overriding your theme is going to be
the function step PHP file however we're
not going to get into that until after
we take a look at some of the template
files in what they do so the functions
that PHP is going to be coming very soon
and that's going to be a very important
concept however we first want to take a
look exactly what's outputting this code
so as you may or may not know the way
this works is that we have PHP files
that are grabbing information from our
database and our rendering HTML so that
we can then display the page in the
browser and see it as it is here now the
sites made up of many many many PHP
files however the ones that are really
controlling what shows up on the page
are the template files and the template
files live within your theme and in this
case the reason why our theme shows
anything is because it's using the
template files in the parent theme now
what we want to do is we want to
override those templates now we overrode
the CSS simply by copying and moving it
over and so we're going to do something
very similar that here but first I want
you to right-click and inspect if you're
using Chrome and if you're using a
safari like we said before you'll have
to download the developers tools and
Firefox of course has something very
similar but it's just a little bit
different if you want to follow along
please use Chrome or I guess so far
you'll be probably similar as well but
for here if we've inspected this you can
see our HTML here and this is actually
what you're seeing in the code when you
hover over things as remember they get
highlighted on the screen what I want to
point out is that we have different
sections of the site here right we have
the top of the page here where the head
is getting generated where we have all
of our meta information it's linking up
our style sheets then we have the body
with our page tag wrapping pretty much
the entire page then we have our header
and this is all of the information like
our page name and logo stuff like that
our main navigation is found in the
masthead here and then we have the main
content area where we have a div with
our main content which includes this
loop of posts here and if we collapse
that we see this secondary and the
secondary is when you can see it's
highlighted here is the sidebar then
next we have the footer and then we have
all of the stuff that's loading our
JavaScript files at the bottom of the
page and closing out our body and HTML
tags now if you're not totally familiar
with HTML I would recommend having an
understanding about how to at least you
know get your way around an HTML site
and know exactly sort of what these tags
are doing what these elements are if you
don't know if the elements are I would
just recommend checking out I know
code Academy has some really great basic
HTML videos that can help you totally
understand what's going on so ok here we
have this this page right and let's say
we want to modify something in here um
and we want to modify this header
something about this header just isn't
totally the way we want it so what we
can do is we can override that with a
template now I've opened up my themes
folder for the site in a finder here and
you'll see we have our 2014 child which
is the theme that we're currently using
and then we have the parent theme which
is just 2014 if I open this you can see
all of the different templates that this
comes with and now it's going to take
you a little while to you know always
know what's in what template however
things like the header are pretty
self-explanatory
now what we can do is simply copy this
make sure that you make a copy of it and
not just move it because we want to have
the fallback in the theme because we're
just going to be overwriting it now of
course we have our header that PHP is
within our child
theme and we can come to sublime text
where I have it open I'm going to open
up this header dot PHP file and you can
see inside of the header file we have
not only the all of the opening text we
have our doctype declaration we have our
HTML we have our head tags we have our
opening body our page and then our
site's header with its masthead right
here okay so how can we prove that this
template is in fact being in use here
and that we're now using this header dot
PHP instead of the one that's in 2014 as
long as your site isn't live and people
aren't looking at it you could go ahead
and throw some sort of a header tag in
here just right like test or something
and this is just a visual confirmation
that when you save this page come back
to your site refresh here we now know
that this is in fact using this template
cool so we can get rid of them that head
right there that h3 and now we have a
working template here and we're all good
right so we can go to town and modifying
this if we want like what say we don't
want the search form to be there at all
this just doesn't work for us right I
don't like it I mean I actually don't
really I don't have really have any
thoughts either way about it but let's
say I didn't like this search and I just
didn't want it to be there and not to
mention we already have a search over
here so I could literally come in here
and select this entire div that starts
with search container encapsulate this
search box and then the PHP gets search
form which is actually what's bringing
in the search form but if of course if
we get rid of this then we don't need
the div surrounding it so we can go
ahead and simply delete all of those
things click Save come back to our page
and now when we refresh and go to click
on the search thing nothing happens the
only thing weird is that we now have
this search toggle up here up top here
and it looks like it's directly under
the site title so
this is pretty much the process of
modifying a parent theme right you would
come in here and you'd say okay why is
this search link still here inspect it
okay here it is search toggle okay so
I'm going to come in here and now I can
just select the search toggle this whole
div get rid of it save once more come
back refresh and now it's completely
gone from our theme entirely what's
really great about this is let's say
that now doesn't work for you right in
fact you want to use the 20 a 14 header
again and you or didn't like the
modifications you made to it and you
wanted to start fresh well because we
just made a copy of it we could do a
couple things we could simply grab the
header PHP from the parent theme and
just copy it right on over replace it
now we refresh and it's using all of
those modifications and I mean all of
those modifications are now gone another
thing we could do is just simply
right-click on our child theme header
tab PHP and delete it after deleting it
again they're gone so this gives you a
little bit idea about how this child and
parent template thing works and why it's
important to do a child template or a
child theme of a parent theme because if
you didn't then you wouldn't have these
options right and not to mention if you
ever wanted to update the the parent
theme then things would go wrong so you
now have the ability to overwrite some
of your templates and you can modify
them in ways right now if you're not
super strong with PHP that's okay
because we're going to go over some of
the more complex and more interesting
things in these templates in later
videos so that you can not only copy and
modify templates but that you could even
write them from scratch because once you
understand what's going on it seems like
it's scary and whatever but it's really
not that bad so just keep watching and
we're going to be talking about a little
bit more about templates and then we're
gonna get into functions dot PHP with a
basic example of things you can do there
so as always this is Scott with level up
Hut's if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment the
video or hit us up at Twitter or
Facebook at level up Tut's we love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
