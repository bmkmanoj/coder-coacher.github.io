tuts I'm going to show you something
that I use in sublime text to all the
time and it's going to be Jay s linting
and hinting and if you're not familiar
with these concepts what this is it sort
of goes through your JavaScript and
finds things that you could be doing
better things that you know maybe just
spacing issues or you left off a
semicolon and can save your life
sometimes you have an issue with your
JavaScript and you just have no idea
what's wrong and maybe it's something
really stupid that you're just glossing
over so we're going to do command shift
P we're going to do a package install
packages and we're going to look for a
package called sublime lint or okay so
this is probably the best one because it
has all sorts of different linters in it
and here we go we have this output here
and it's just going to tell you a little
bit about this particular package so
what linting does it's going to go
through and find your code and highlight
some bad stuff or whatever things that
need adjusting so let's try to use a
JavaScript linter so lint via built-in
J's hint or mint and we'll go over the
differences between those two as well
so I'm gonna have this javascript file
open that I have right here so I'm going
to do command shift P and I'm going to
type in lint and we see the sublime lint
or lint current file we don't have to
say what we're going to be using we're
just a lint current file hit enter and
it found 17 errors okay they're all
highlighted so we can go through and we
can adjust these errors so we can see
exactly what the problem is you notice
that there's all the space after here so
that leads me to believe that that's
most likely the problem here and maybe
this stuff seems to be just formatting
okay and there's also some funkiness
here delete this and let's tab back over
okay it will say that and you can see as
I say this the things that are clearly
wrong are going away and if you know
JavaScript and you see
like something like this where it's
highlighting all the space here you know
that the problem probably lies somewhere
in here so this really doesn't tell you
exactly what the problems are but it's
going to show you where the problems are
and that's maybe even for the best
because in fact it won't take care of
all these right now because you know
really hunting and finding out these
bugs is really probably a good thing for
getting better at your code and and
seeing exactly where you've made your
mistakes so after saving it now you can
see there's no more highlighted things
there's really nothing wrong with this
code I mean it well I mean there's
there's things that are wrong with it in
the sense that maybe I'm using a click
function here or whatever but there's
nothing syntactically syntactically
wrong with this so when I save it I am
pretty sure that this code is going to
work as it was written maybe not a maybe
it's not going to work as it was
intended to be written but it's written
to a way that is going to work in in
some fashion there's no syntactical
errors here ok so this is a way that you
can make sure you're writing good code
and if you'll notice that the package
control message that popped up here says
this isn't just going to let JavaScript
but it can also lid all these other
languages which is awesome so use check
out a sublime linter and make you a
better coder you'll find out you know
what you're doing wrong or just things
you can do better and as always this is
