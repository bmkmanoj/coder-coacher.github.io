tuts and today we're going to level up
our expression engine skills this is
tutorial number six today we're going to
be covering channel fields or custom
fields depending on sort what you want
to call it where you where you come from
in wordpress drupal land you know these
are custom fields but in expression
engine they comb channel field so let's
go ahead and dive right in so let's go
to admin channel administration and
channel fields we haven't saturday up
yet to do so we go ahead and create
click create new channel field group i'm
going to go ahead and call this news
that makes sense because we also have a
channel called news the 0 means we
haven't assigned anything to this
channel field group yet so let's go
ahead and create our first channel field
not exist this is where they're going to
be listed click create new channel field
and there are a variety of types for
channel fields we see this is what we're
looking at here is the selection for
just default expression engine core we
there are a plethora of third-party
add-ons that give you more options here
for example pixel and tonic has quite a
few options that really expand upon this
selection with their matrix add-on and
also their wig wam add-on and anymore
actually it's a great third party
developers i'm sure if you're getting
into expression development you're going
to hear about them soon anyway we're
going to just stick with in the defaults
here relationship it was maybe one that
sort of sixth out as maybe something
that needs explanation and that's the
relationship between two pieces of
content but we're going to just do for
right now text input and text area so
for texting input that means just one
line like this line we have here and
then text area is a multi row thing like
this down here
so this would be what we're doing a news
ah entry so let's create them so we're
doing is ruin creates a fields for that
piece of content so if you think about
news what type of fields are we going to
require for our user a headline field a
subhead a sub-headline field maybe a
body maybe there's author and a date and
then we want them to assign categories
well categories is taken care of through
the category group we don't worry about
that headline we don't have to worry
about because when you create a channel
expressionengine automatically gives you
the title field that's a freebie same
with URL title which we'll look at in in
a minute you also as a freebie get an
author field which is assigned depending
on who if you know so the i'm logged in
as myself so it's going when i create an
entry it's an assign it to me so that's
cool convenient i'm in date also
expression engine gives you a date field
so that leaves just two feels that we're
going to create for this right now and
that's sub-headline again just like in
the last video it replaced spaces with
underscores and again this is what we're
going to use in templating to output the
content of this field in the in the
field instructions this is where you can
put instructions for the individual
that's creating an entry if it's you
maybe you don't need to fill this out
but one cool thing to point out is you
can put some notes in here for your user
so you help them use the site and that
that could include like h1 tags or break
tags or whatever so you can style to
some extent as well is this field
required yes or no for us the sub
headline won't be required but the body
will definitely be required is filled
searchable this if this is a text field
that contains content that you want
users to find
then this should be yes all right there
are times when you would answer no to
that and that's why I guess by default
it's no but if it's text it's probably
yes show this field by default what that
means is on the published screen this
this field will be still present on the
screen but they have to just click to
like expand it it's sort of just like
toggle door slid up field display order
this is where you go to a sign you know
what orders it's going to show up on the
screen now there's some other field
options here like how many characters
can go in this field what type of
formatting can it have this one is it
converts you know your break tags where
you put a break to two paragraphs like
automatically this is a text field so
we're just gonna leave it as none and
there's some other items here too i'ma
still leave malas no for this and hits
the mint okay so we've created our first
channel field let's go ahead and create
our next the next one here and this is
for body we're going to say text area
let's get this type of thing a multi
road block and we're just in call body
yeah we're not going to give it an
instruction here it seems like pretty
self-explanatory at the body of the news
content is this field required in this
case it's going to be is this field
searchable yes default text formatting
we're going to say auto in a couple
videos from now we're going to end up
replacing the text formatting with with
the WYSIWYG editor but for now we're
just going to put this on auto we could
say show formatting buttons for this one
we could say put a spell check one could
say glossary the WYSIWYG editor that we
installed wig lamb by pixel atomic will
sort of replace all this stuff but you
can at least just see what it's like so
I'm go ahead and hit submit now one
thing that I want to point out is be too
these curly braces we have the short
name in expression engine anything that
has a curly brace is like expression
engine tags so expressionengine I think
in version 2.4 which we're running right
now is when I started making this a
little bit more convenient for so we
actually click in here it's going to
highlight that whole piece of content
and we can just copy and then paste it
in our template tags when we're ready to
do that so it's a nice little convenient
thing that they that they added in here
so what we've done so far is we've
created this group but we we haven't
assigned it to our channel yet so if we
were to go to content hit publish and
select news we're only getting those
freebies that I was talking about the
title the date and the author we haven't
yet tied that channel group to this
channel so let's go ahead and do that
and then we'll come back to the screen
so admin channel channels adit group
assignment a channel field group set to
none let's change it to news update
let's go back to publish a new piece of
content publish news and there we go we
have the title field news story remember
that preference that we set that says
replace spaces with hyphens or dashes
there it is a sub-headline no asterisks
next to it because it's not required
body asterix therefore it's required and
we're seeing some of those formatting
buttons very limited expression engine
2.5 so depending on when you watch that
video maybe that exists yet doesn't
exist yet for me but they are actually
finally putting together a decent
WYSIWYG editor so we'll see how that
turns out but here's the other so here's
a spell check and here's the glossary so
you know pretty decent this thing can be
grab their own thing their expanded if
you need more room we could have
additionally set it to just have more
room by default so there you go we've
created some custom fields we've created
some channels and we're getting real
close to start the next phase of our
site so thanks a lot for watching
everyone and again please subscribe to
our YouTube channel we really appreciate
it thanks a lot for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
