tutorials and in this fear going to be
adding easy and really beautiful user
notifications so let's say when they go
to add a new resolution and they're not
logged in they get notified say hey you
gotta lock in before you can do this so
let's get going on it now
cool so this sites actually really
coming along there's a lot of great
stuff in the next few videos I'm going
to be showing you some really great
techniques some of which will maybe make
this application better and some of
which may be won't but we'll show you
some nice techniques and and things that
you're going to need moving forward with
media and react so here we have this box
here and you'll notice when we were on
our let's open this up in an incognito
window so you can see that I'm not
logged in here and let's actually have
these side by side here you'll see that
when we so i don't have to tab back and
forth you'll see that when i go to make
a new resolution like just hello it
doesn't obviously save it it doesn't add
it it doesn't show us anything there's
no feedback to the user in all honesty
they probably shouldn't even have access
to this forum at all but let's say you
want to entice them just by seeing this
form and they can add something right
well obviously you don't want it to
disappear and you don't want nothing so
let's go ahead and we're going to add a
cool package made by the meteor chef
who's a good friend of mine and we can
come to just our packages and we can add
this package by the meteor chef and the
package is Burt now this package allows
you to have some really stylish quick
and easy notifications so let's come to
our site and what we want to do is have
this on our client side and you'll
remember we built our methods and all of
our methods if something goes wrong
let's say you're not authorized you're
not signed in let's say the ad
resolution you're not signed in it
throws this not authorized error but
you'll notice we never ever saw that
errors and show up on the council log it
didn't show up on the server log it
didn't show up on the site anywhere so
we can use Burt to actually display this
error or any kind of error and let our
users know what's going on here so let's
actually head to our resolution form and
we want to check out this call statement
you'll notice we have this call back
here that's being run through this arrow
function and what it's doing is
it's setting this duress 202 absolutely
nothing to clear the form but we're not
doing much with it other than that
what's cool about this is we actually
get to value here we actually had two
values here we get the error value and
the data value now it's cool here is we
can say if the error exists right if
there's an error then using this new
package Burt we can save Burt dot alert
ok Bert alert and we can pass this in
and say please login before submitting
now we pass this a comma and then we
pass this what kind of alert this is we
can say this is a danger alert and let's
head to the bird documentation we can
just actually let's do it in this other
tab over here cool so let's scroll down
here and we can just check out what kind
of notifications exist you'll see that
we can pass this danger and you can say
what type so you have access to like a
growl type error if you have ever used
growl where it slides in from the right
and you'll see we have some other cool
things like there's different ones based
on what type of alert is like if it's
just an info you might get this blue now
I actually want this big one that just
like let somebody know and you'll notice
we can pass it an icon which uses font
awesome so f a frown Oh fixed top is
going to make it come down like this so
let's copy these things and we can taste
them and after our danger so we want
danger fixed hyphen top and FA frown
hyphen oh cool so now that we have this
it's really just saying if there's an
error hey let us know and please login
before submitting now what it's also
going to do unfortunately is it's also
going to clear this text value so we can
obviously fix that by throwing it and
else here so we only want the value to
clear if this was successful now this is
going to be a nice user experience
because obviously their resolution that
they just thought of isn't
to just completely disappear if they're
not logged in so okay let's just do a
successful one just by saying dance in
office enter okay dancing office exists
on this one now let's come to our non
locked in and say I'm gonna dance in my
office and we get this really great
error message that just slides in from
the top and regardless of how many times
I do it it's still there you'll notice
if the user clicks on it check that out
goes away I mean this it's it's easy
it's seamless right and I didn't have to
do anything i just added this great
package i dropped it in here and we all
instantly have this really nice user
experience so it's cool didn't didn't
get rid of my dance in the office so now
when i sign in and dance in the office
again now you also notice we have
another problem here we have the ability
to add blank resolutions and that's
obviously not good so let's go ahead and
also prevent that while we're at it
let's come back to our site here and we
can say at this address elution event we
can say if text by wrapping this whole
thing in an if statement let's grab this
whole meteor call paste it in here and
at by wrapping this whole thing saying
like if text is actually something then
we can add it so if text the native
resolution if you're not logged in then
get this error okay beautiful let's go
ahead and from here we can say dance in
office still gives me that error we can
come here to this one where I'm not
logged in you waking up this one I'm
logged in hit enter and you'll notice
there's absolutely no resolutions being
added cool so these are some nice little
user experience things that we added at
absolutely very little cost to our time
and that's just a great way to work
right to be able to just add things to
your site that just make things a little
bit better here and there cool so in the
next video we're going to get into
detailed routes where we get to use
parameters now right now we have no need
for parameter based routing on this site
for instance there's no detailed
information on each of these but let's
say there was let's say we had some more
detailed information and we wanted to be
able to go to a page that all it was was
this individual at hand stand right now
we can't do that so in the next video
you how you can have parameterize dat
based routing using flow router so as
always this is scott with level up
tutorials if you want the rest of these
videos before they're available on
youtube along with some extra content
head to store down level up tutorials
