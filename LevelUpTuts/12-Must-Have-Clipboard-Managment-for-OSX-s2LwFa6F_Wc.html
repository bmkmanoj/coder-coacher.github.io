and in this video I'm gonna be showing
you one of my absolute most favorite
tools that I used for OSX called clip
menu it's something that you've seen
over and over again in my videos and I
use it all the time it basically allows
you to store a whole bunch of stuff in
your clipboard so every single time you
copy something essentially adds it to a
history that you can go back into and
easily use anytime you want
so lets check it out right now so now
clip menu is probably something that you
seen me using a lot and maybe wondering
what it is well it's an application for
OSX that is a clipboard manager and it's
a great great application it's something
that I it's one of the very first things
I install on any sort of computer I'm
working on because I really just can't
live without it it's freeware it's easy
to get you just come to clip menu comm
and you can download it from here now
what it does is it allows you to have
command shift v as a shortcut for
pasting so instead of doing it just
command v you can do command shift v
which is something that you train
yourself to do really quickly and it
brings up this menu now from here you
have a whole lot of options here
basically by default it has the last 20
things you copied to your clipboard so
it just keeps a history of your
clipboard and you would not believe how
much I use this I mean on my actual
development machine I have up to 50
items saved and my clipboard at all
times along with things like snippets
and all sorts of other stuff so if you
come in here to preferences you can see
that you have a lot of preferences so
you can boost your clipboard size to
something like 50 you can have the
history sorted by last used or date
created auto saving the clipboard
history I mean there's just a lot of
stuff here and for free I mean this
application is really as good as it gets
so by default it launches on login which
of course you'd want it to do if you're
using this you could have it show images
when you copy an image for instance if
we click copy image now when I do
command shift V just like
in the example you can see that we have
the actual image here in the clip menu
okay so what else we have things like
type what things you can actually copy
here we have actions and we have
snippets now snippets are really great
because you can make folders let's say
if we had something like emoji and then
you could then make a snippet just by
pasting in that actual snippet in here
because I don't have one ready and I'm
not used to typing one out I can just
simply have the this sort of face here
but now anytime I want to go ahead and
use this it's just in my emojis folder
and I can just throw that in there so I
actually save a whole bunch of stuff in
my snippets from terminal commands that
I use sometimes but not all the time
emoji and anything I just don't want to
type right so we also have things like
you can change the shortcut where it's
by default command shift V and I really
like it that way so I do leave it that
and then you can have a check for
updates so nothing's super crazy but I
would highly recommend checking out clip
menu if you're on OSX it's something
that I just really can't see myself
using a computer without at this point
so check it out as always this is Scott
with level of tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment of
the video or hit me up at Twitter or
Facebook at level up tuts
I love to hear from you thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
