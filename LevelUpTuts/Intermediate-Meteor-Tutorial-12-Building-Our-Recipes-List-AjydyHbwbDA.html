up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be breaking out our recipe into a
recipes list where we have a separate
template for individual recipes so once
we have all those templates in you're
gonna have a listing of all of your
individual recipes in your recipe book
page so let's like going on that right
now okay so we have our recipe book
looking pretty good we have a new form
and that's adding things to our
collection now let's go ahead and get
this collection this recipes to actually
display in a list here to do this we're
essentially going to create a loop in
here and just output the content of
another template so let's go ahead and
head to our code here so that we can get
going okay so we have our main layout we
have our home layout let's go ahead and
head to this recipes folder and you'll
see we have a new recipe we have recipes
HTML and right now all recipes HTML
hasn't it is this new recipe so let's go
ahead and make a new section here so we
can just have a section with a class of
recipes like so now inside of here we're
going to iterate over a list of recipes
right a courser of recipes so let's go
ahead and head to our JavaScript where
we had those recipes we were just
throwing in this generic meteor
subscribe here along with this council
logging of this meteor settings and
before we do anything else I actually
just want to get these recipes out put
so we're gonna leave the SUBSCRIBE as is
before implementing our template level
subscription and we're simply going to
create a helper where we could say and
then the template name so recipes dot
helpers and brackets like so now we can
define some helpers here inside of this
object we can simply just say recipes
and to grab all of our recipes we can
actually use this es6 style arrow
function so we can just say parenthesis
equals and then a greater than sign like
so and we can return recipes and we're
gonna be returning recipes dot find and
then we can just have this look so now
what's going to happen here is recipes
now this is sort of basic what we've
done before recipes will now be the
curser full of all of these recipes so
let's head to our recipes HTML and add
the loop and in here we can say each
recipes wrap up that each to finish that
off here now I like sort of self-test as
a go just to make sure things are
working so we can just simply say name
here because we want to grab the recipes
name if you remember from our collection
we gave each recipe a name so the way
this should be working is we should be
getting a few names here so as you can
see we now have all of the names of each
of our recipes output so that's great
that means our subscriptions working
that means our find is working all that
good stuff let's go ahead and make a new
template here we're gonna say new file
and this is just going to be a single
recipe so recipe dot HTML now we can
give this a name we can say template
name equals recipe now let's go ahead
and have an article we give this a class
of recipe okay and let's give this a
three where we're outputting the name
let's give this a paragraph tag where
we're outputting the description
and let's go ahead and output each of
the ingredients so if you remember the
ingredients is simply just an array of
ingredients so we can say hash each
ingredients because that is the name of
the array here and so each ingredients
and now we can simply just out put
inside of let's do a span here so we can
say span dot ingredient we can output
the ingredients name you have like a
hyphen here and then amount so this is
just simply the amount of the ingredient
and now we just need to reference this
template instead of name here so we can
do that simply just by coming in and say
greater than recipe if I can spell a
recipe okay there we go
actually this is a capital R let me make
sure that's correct here okay so now we
are using each recipes recipe and now
that's going to call this template which
is going to have name description and
then listing all of the ingredients so
let's head back to our page and you'll
see with the HTML and CSS that we have
already we now have a pretty nice list
of our recipes we have some ingredients
down here you can see bread two slices
cheese lots of cheese tuna one pound
mango one fruit we have the name these
are some nice little cards here of
recipes cool so we've now broken out our
recipe we're subscribing to them and we
have each of our ingredients being
listed so our recipe list is now built
out however what we want to do now is
set up template level subscription so in
the next video we are going to quickly
and easily set up template level
subscriptions so that we can subscribe
to this data specifically on the recipes
template that way that template owns
that data we'll go into that more in the
next video so as always this is Scott
