up tutorials and today I'm going to be
showing you how to create SVG animations
using CSS now these are using an inline
SVG which we've shown you before that
you can affect with CSS however this
time we're going to be animating the
stroke and the fill to look like the SVG
is drawing onto the screen it's a really
cool effect and it's super easy to do so
check it out let's get started right now
so to give you a brief introduction the
effect that we're going to be creating
you'll see when I click this toggle box
is this check mark which is an SVG check
mark is going to draw on and then fill
in itself so if we click toggle you can
see it draws in fully and then then the
background fades in and the reverse
happens where the background goes
transparent and then undraw z-- itself
whenever we click toggle now this
animation is happening simply because of
a CSS class change so if you come and
look at our CSS I'm really just adding
this class of checked to the SVG itself
and that's triggering the second state
and that's using transitions to draw
this on now let's take a look at our
HTML so we can recreate this so you can
understand what's going on
so in our HTML I'm just using angular in
here to just do a quick toggle no reason
in particular so you can ignore any this
ng init stuff the button is just
changing the state from check to
unchecked I'm using ng class to just
drop in a checked class if that value is
true the real important part is that we
have an inline SVG here the size is just
200 by 200 and we have a single path
which is this check mark so we have a
single path here and here are the
dimensions and that path creates this
this check line here now in terms of CSS
properties in the check
state now that we don't need to see this
HTML anymore and the check state we have
a fill of white and we have this stroke
- offset so this is actually where the
magic is happening the reason we have an
animation at all is is because we're
animating the stroke itself and we have
a stroke width of 1 pixel so if we can
say red and now let's toggle this back
you can see what's actually animating is
this red line and this red line is the
stroke itself so let's go ahead and get
rid of some of this stuff here I'm going
to go ahead and just delete this stroke
- array stroke - offset and transition
I'm going to delete it from here as well
and I'm going to delete this offset so
now we just have a two states we have a
state with a stroke red a width of 1
pixel for the stroke and a transparent
center and the check state is the same
just with a white center so as you can
see it's just changing the background or
the fill of this SVG shape now the way
this works is essentially we're making a
dashed line and what we're doing is then
we're offsetting the dashed line by a
certain value and that's what's causing
it to draw in so to make this have some
you know make a little bit more sense
here if we come here we can type type
stroke - - all right and now let's just
give this some pixel value we can say 10
pixels and save this okay
so now what you get here is you can see
that we have a dashed line and it's
consisting of 10 pixel increments so we
do 10 pixels on 10 pixels off so how
else could we do this if we have stroke
- array we could say stroke - or a 10 -
5 now we have 10 on 5 off ten on 5 off
five of ten on five off until of course
they a combine here at the start and end
we only don't necessarily want that we
really just want an on/off situation now
another fella that we had was the stroke
- offset now the stroke - offset is
really just changing where this stroke
on and off starts so if we come here and
type stroke
- offset like so and have this set to
ten pixels we save this you can see
nothing's changed
and you might wonder why nothing's
changes because we have ten on ten often
on and off so of course if we move it by
10 pixels it's it's not going to really
modify that much so if we say five
you'll get a little bit of a difference
here where we have things shifted over a
little bit in fact let's go ahead and
add a range slider here so I'm just
going to add an input and the type is
going to be range and the min is going
to be equal to zero the max is going to
be equal to say 40 and we're going to
have an NG model is equal to range now
let's go ahead on this path let's go
ahead and add a style equals and in the
style equals we can use our stroke -
offset here to animate this so we can
see exactly what's going on so if we say
stroke
- offset colon and then we can go ahead
and use the property in here which was
just range and finish it off with pix
right here let's go ahead and just
delete this stroke - offset now this is
going to be where we understand a little
bit of what's going on
let's animate this or let's actually
paste out this range value here too so
we can see this what's going on here I'm
just going to throw this in as like an
h2 or something so you can see it and
we'll put this in pixels okay so now
when we're moving this you can see as
we're bumping this along at zero pixels
it's at its initial State and as we're
changing this offset it's essentially
just pushing the dash along here and
let's come to our stroke - all right
let's bump this up to something like 40
so now that's at 40 as we push it along
you'll see we have less and less of
lines and gaps because as this is
getting greater and greater the gaps and
lines are no longer able to completely
happen because of the distance that it
needs to travel so how do we get this to
the state where it needs to animate on
we need it so that the gaps and the
lengths are the same length as the SVG's
entire stroke path so how do we figure
that out well we can actually figure
that out pretty easily with JavaScript
I'm going to open this up in the Dib bug
so I can access the inspect element of
this and I'm leaving this toggled so I
can identify this by the class name
checked so in here we can use the
JavaScript console to type var path is
equal to document and then dot query
selector and then we're going to have
parenthesis quotes period and then now
we're going to look for checked now
inside of this pad now inside of checked
we're going to look for path which is
this path here we're actually trying to
find the length of so we can do space
path then single quote and print the Cu
semicolon enter now we have path stored
in here we can use a method and we
can say path period and then get total
length parentheses and then we can go
ahead and hit enter now what this has
given us is the total length in pixels
of this stroke path so let's come back
out of the debug view to the normal view
and I've copied and pasted that value in
here so now in our stroke - array we can
paste this in here and just throw pics
at the end of it and what you'll notice
here is that we have this line and as we
change the offset it's drawing and
undrawn this object here now here's
where it's really cool if we want to
show this to draw off we're going from
this full on state to zero right we're
going from what's most likely 99 pixels
actually let's see that in action just
by having to set to 100 pixels
they range max and min and as you can
see it's drawing on this way so let's
actually stop using this range and let's
start using our normal CSS and we can
type stroke
- offset is going to be equal to
negative 99 point 4 7 pixels save okay
so now this is the default on state is
going to be having the dash offset set
to a negative version of all this stuff
and I just need to refresh because it
was using the range of value still here
so I refresh and you can see that extra
little bit of red is gone now when I
click toggle we just get the white so to
get it to toggle on under checked
checked on the checked class path we can
say stroke
- offset and we can set this to zero
zero pixels and have the semicolon there
now when we toggle you can see it's
toggling completely now it's great about
this as you pin transition this with CSS
so let's go ahead and do this transition
so we can say transition and we're going
to want to transition the fill and the
stroke differently because we want the
stroke to complete before the fill comes
in so it looks like the stroke goes and
then the fill so we can say first we
want to animate the stroke - - off set
I'm going to paste this in here because
I'm going to type this all up we can say
this is going to take place in 0.3
seconds and this is going to be linear
and now we want to then have the fill
transition in / 0.2 seconds and we want
this to ease and we want this to
actually be delayed by 0.3 seconds okay
so now we save this and you can see we
drawn it fades in some of those fades
are a little too fast for me that
drawing is a little fast I'm bumping
everything - we got 5 seconds for the
offset now and 4 seconds for the fill
delete that save this and let's see it
in action draws on great now the only
difference is is we want this to happen
in Reverse on the way out so we want the
fill to go first and then the stroke to
be delayed now what we can do is copy
this transition we'll throw this on the
check state because this is going to
stay the same and now the uncheck state
is just simply going to get a swapping
of these delays here we're going to
take the delay off of the fill
throughout the delay on to the stroke -
offset and set a two point zero four
seconds to accommodate for the time of
the film
now we toggle on draws on fills in we
toggle off fills out draws off and we
can go back to setting our stroke to
white here and we're going to have a
really nice looking checkbox and I mean
how much more appealing is that to see
on a website if you have the animation
going quickly and not too distracting
that's way more appealing to view than
let's say just a check mark just
randomly appearing or even fading in
this sort of transition looks way more
interesting and a little bit more
inviting to the user cool so this is how
you animate SVG strokes using stroke -
offset and the stroke - array as always
the Scott with a love tutorial so you
have any questions or comments to become
in the video head except at order of
face book head level up tutorials we
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
