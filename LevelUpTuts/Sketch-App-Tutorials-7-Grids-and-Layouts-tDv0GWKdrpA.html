up toads and today we're going to be
talking about grids now Sketch has some
interesting options compared to some
other applications for what types of
grids you'll be using now we can go
ahead and click view up top right here
and we can see we have the option to
high pixels hide rulers and then right
down here we have show grid or show
layout and then we have grid settings so
let's click show grid first and you'll
see this fairly standard looking grid
and you'll notice that in this instance
it's lining up with every other slash in
the rulers if we zoom in it's every 4th
and likewise continues to go so this is
our grid here and this maybe is what
you're used to we have some thicker
lines every 200 pixels and that's great
things work really well for that we even
have some nice little snapping going on
it's sort of locking this in to that
line of the grid and that's that's great
but what else do we have let's click
grid settings and you'll see that we
have a grid block size of 20 pixels
thick lines every 10 blocks so we can go
ahead and modify this to say we want
double the the frequency of those lines
and now you can see that the grid
instantly updates and we now have this
grid that shows every 10 pixels so again
this is really great for this type of
grid but let's say you're working on a
website and a lot of websites these days
are built and grid frameworks where they
have columns and gutters and things like
that so they have the option to use a
show layout so when we click show layout
what we have instead of our normal grid
is we actually have a web style grid
where we have columns and gutters and
things that you'd be used to for maybe
whatever grid framework that you're
working in and so you might be thinking
great but this is the grid I need well
you can actually modify these grid
within the grid settings again
and you're going to have a ton of
options notice how this is its default
is the 960 grid width with 12 columns
however you can change the amount of
columns to be whatever you need and we
have the grid width and are the gutter
width and the column width now these are
going to be in sync with one another so
you'll notice as I'm making the columns
wider the the gutters are becoming more
narrow now we can also even add in rows
just like that and we now have a gutter
and row height as well and we can choose
to draw all of the horizontal lines that
way if you want to have like your
paragraph spacing or something like that
you can set that all up here and we can
change those Heights really easily now
if there's a grid that you're using all
the time let's say you have like a 1440
let's say 16 column grid and let me get
back into settings here I have these
column widths I'm gonna go with 20 pixel
gutters just like that this is a grid
that may be used all the time so let's
go ahead and make this our default next
time you create a new document it's
going to start with this grid so that's
fantastic we now have this web style
grid you can imagine how this would work
on a website especially if you used any
of these grid frameworks as a front-end
developer or if you are a developer
yourself you know you've probably
familiar with coming across the style of
grid that's great but let's say you're
working on a document that had multiple
grids or maybe the grid framework is
changing per layout if you have a mall
like a mobile layout that uses a two
column grid or something and or four
column grid or whatever but basically
you want to make sure that you have both
of those grids well we can always come
in here and make an artboard like we did
before and you'll notice what's
happening is that our grid settings are
applied to this particular artboard and
that's fantastic but let's go ahead and
make
second hardboard what we see here is
that now our our grid is being shown on
the second artboard and it's really
whichever artboard we have in focus but
what happens if we change this grid so
let's say grid settings and let's say we
want this now to be only 400 pixels wide
and we come back here and we only want
this to be four columns okay
actually let's go bigger because it
looks like we're maybe closer to 600
pixels wide for our artboard and again I
want to have 20 pixel gutters and it's
going to adjust the column size for me
so let's go ahead and click OK now
you'll notice our second art board over
here perhaps this is our mobile or our
tablet layout I guess that's 600 pixels
it's more of a tablet layout we have
this second artboard over here now when
we click back to our first artboard we
do that by selecting you can do that by
selecting the title up here or by the
title in the menu bar the layer bar
you'll notice that our board 1 retains
its grid settings so our board 2 has
these grid settings where we have 4
columns with 20 pixels gutters over the
course of 600 and then here we have a 16
column grid that's 1440 wide so the grid
settings here are based on the artboard
itself and that's awesome because now
you can have every single our board with
the exact grid that your developers are
using so perhaps you know you can have
your your mobile your tablet your your
total responsive design in one document
with the correct grid framework for each
artboard and then it combined with
textiles I mean that's that's a great
workflow for designing for web
cool so you know should have the ability
to adjust your grids and change them per
our board and set up a layout style
column web grid or the standard grid and
you should be able to get working
building some awesome cool stuff so let
us know what kind of grid settings
you're using in your projects what are
the standard grids that you go to when
you're starting a new project whether
it's for web print whatever so as always
