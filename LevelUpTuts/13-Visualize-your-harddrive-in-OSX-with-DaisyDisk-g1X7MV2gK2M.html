love tutorials and in this video I'm
going to be showing you one of my
favorite applications for OS X called
Daisy disc now Daisy disc is a great way
to help you visualize what exists on
your drives or even in your folders so
that you know what's taking up what kind
of space it's something that I use all
the time so check it out let's get going
right now and you're going to want to
head to Daisy disc app com or it's in
the Apple App Store as well and what you
can do is actually click by here or you
can get it through the app store I
typically don't I typically stay away
from the app store but you can certainly
buy it in the app store if you'd like or
you can download a free trial that
really just allows you to use the
application with a bit of short delay
from what I found that the free trial
really contains most to all of the
features you're going to want so go
ahead and download the free trial if you
want to try it i've been using that for
a little while before i decided to buy
it it's certainly an application though
that I use often enough to justify a
purchase so after you get that
downloaded let's go ahead and open it up
easy disc allows you a really super easy
way to visualize space on your hard
drives as you can see I have a lot of
hard drives here these couple of discs
aren't going to be easily recognized
here because they're actually windows
formatted this so I'm just going to sort
of ignore them you can see they have
this little locks on them however I do
have a system back up a time machine
backup I have the 36th chamber which is
where I keep a lot of my video data
because it's a terabyte drive and then i
have my system drive which is running on
a solid state so it's a little bit
smaller now this gives you a nice easy
way to sort of see how many gigabytes
easily are used and how close you are to
filling something up now for instance I
was a little shocked to see that this
36th chamber only had 43 gigs left
especially when I don't have that many
gigabytes of of level up tutorials
videos currently safe down here so in
this process the first thing I do
whenever I feel like
a disc doesn't have as much space as it
needs as I open up Daisy disc I've been
using this application for a long time
and it just recently hit version 4 so I
thought this was a good time to show it
off now in addition to being able to
scan drives you can actually click this
and scan a folder but let's actually
show you what happens when you scan
something since I've recently scanned
this this button says view instead of
scan however we click this arrow you can
see quick scan as administrator forget
scan results show and find or get info
I'm going to forget the scan results and
then I'm going to click scan so you can
see it scans it really quickly now this
is something that's sort of new to this
version of Daisy disc the last couple of
versions the scanning may have taken
quite a bit of time you'd leave and come
back but now as you can see that's
candid like no time at all that was real
time so this is a nice sort of super
visual indicator of space on your drive
you can see this is how much is being
used there's 999 gigabytes on this Drive
available as you can see I have far as I
hover over these sections Hitler tells
you over in the right-hand column what
exactly that data is so for instance I
have 246 gigabytes of music on this
Drive which I was aware of uh and then
if I go over here you can see I have 151
gigabytes of Final Cut Pro backups now I
don't really feel like these need to be
on this drive so i can now go ahead and
browse to those in the root of my thing
because i know it's taking up 51 gigs
and do something with it since they're
just backups i can move them on
somewhere else in addition you could say
i also have two hundred seventy eight
gigabytes of level up tutorials video
recordings with the majority of those
actually being in the video folder which
is my raw and outputted video so that's
to be expected to be pretty large so
let's say we want to get some more
information obviously we hover over this
we can see that the video folder
contains two hundred gigabytes of
information if we click this little
slice here you can now see ya ok we get
that however this slice seems like the
most interesting one to me so if we
click this
you can now see that I have 400 or I
have 45 gigabytes of intro video 31
gigabytes of polymer 1.1 tutorials and
19 gigabytes of adaptive theme sketch
plugins so as you can see this is giving
me quite a bit of breakdown for instance
I might want to check out these intros
specifically because these are all old I
might not need a lot of this information
anymore so I can go ahead and do
something about those old files that are
not necessarily using and start to
archive that stuff cool so this is Daisy
disk it's absolutely one of my favorite
applications it makes everything really
nice and easy to visualize the space on
your drives so as always this has got
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video artists up at Twitter or
Facebook at level up tutorials I love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
