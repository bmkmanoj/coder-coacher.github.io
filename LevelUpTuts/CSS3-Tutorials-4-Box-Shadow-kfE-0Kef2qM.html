up tuts and today we're going to be
doing our fourth css3 tutorial and it's
going to be on box shadow in the last
lesson we went over text shadow which is
similar to box shadow except for words
for text box shadow is for any item any
block level item so like a a div or
anything like that I mean you can put a
box shadow on anything so let's add some
box shadows to all sorts of stuff and
see what the results are and before we
get started it is worth pointing out
that box shadow is going to work on IE 9
and up I Firefox 4 and up or it will
work on older versions with the Moz
vendor prefix Chrome it's going to work
on versions 10 and up or four and up
with the WebKit prefix Safari versions
three and up with the WebKit prefix or
5.1 and up without it and then it's
pretty much if you use the WebKit
prefixes it's going to work on iOS and
Android so you don't have to worry too
much about there so let's actually get
going and write some box shadow and
we're going to add it first on this
white div this main content that we have
here this main wrapper so if we look at
our CSS let's check this out here we're
going to want to modify our main div
which you know I should have named it
something a little bit better I think
it's just wrapper here it is don't use
this as a way to have your CSS looking
on actual product our project when I
when I do an actual project my CSS is
all commented it's a little bit more
organized than this you know it'd be
nice maybe to clean this up just for
these lessons but let's make this a
little bit bigger so we have our wrapper
here it has a background of white it's
80% with we want to add a box yet with
this whole thing
so let's actually do that with one line
of code
nice and easy box - shadow and then as
well with a text shadow we had it we had
the distance the X distance in the Y
distance so we're going to add one pixel
one pixel for both of those the third
value is the
border-radius so if this is set to zero
the shadow will be sharp I actually have
a really sharp shadow on my side I can
show you in a second my blur radius is
set to zero the higher number the more
blurred it will be so we'll put just
four pixels now so we have something and
uh the spread radius so the spread
radius will increase the size of the
shadow overall this prints of this
property as well as the blur radius are
optional I'm going to go ahead and not
use this for now and next I'm going to
put in the color so it's going to be
black okay so let's check out our page
now I'm going to give it a refresh and
you can see we have this a box shadow on
here it might be hard to see in this
because it's a little small in fact
let's bump it up nice and huge so you
can see it I'm going to put 15 pixels
box shadow and now we have a nice heavy
box shadow in fact I might not
necessarily recommend using such a heavy
shadow like this unless it fits the
total feel of the site but for this
example it looks pretty good
another thing you can do with css3 is
use RGB a values in here and we'll go
over that in another tutorial when we
talk about RGB a but you can make this a
little bit transparent if you want so
that it's not so heavy or if you want to
have the same effect without using RGB a
you just have to find a color that's a
little bit darker than this purple and
it's not going to look so heavy black so
let's actually bump up that size value
that we had did not put in the first
time let's make this be 15 pixels and
see exactly what this is this is the
border size or the spread radius so look
at that now it's super heavy but you get
the picture what it's doing is its
pushing it out 15 pixels and then it's
blurring the shadow and if we come back
here let's take this down to zero as
well we'll have this be zero we'll have
this be not there so basically we have
our blur radius is going to be zero it's
not going to be blurred at all and we
have our
our spread radius set to zero so it's
not going to be spread too far it's just
going to be offset by ten pixels and ten
pixels it's going to be a nice sharp
shadow so you can see what this does
it's a this sort of look right here
where we have this non blurred shadow at
all so what else is really cool about
box shadows that you can use an inner
shadow sort of like if you were to do in
Photoshop you are doing a an inset inner
shadow so they don't the real way to do
that is to just put the word inset in
front of here if we put this in here
just like this I'm actually going to
adjust these values so they're not so
sharp and then I'm going to do let's say
10 pixels keep it black this is going to
put a shadow on the inside and we'll see
exactly how that works so you can see
it's coming in five top five from the
left and an inset shadow right here
let's say if we put these at zero and
zero and left our ten pixel value the
same it's going to be inset around the
entire site right here you could see it
it's all it's coming in it looks like
this content is actually inset into the
page itself so using that for box shadow
is really cool it works really well so
another thing you can do is add it to
just one side right let's say we want to
add just to the bottom to do this all
you have to do is add a negative spread
radius so let's go to our code here and
we're going to have it be let's do 20
pixels from the top we're going to have
our blur still be 10 pixels and then our
spread radius is going to be a negative
keep the wrong button had negative 10
pixels I'm going to keep it black and I
got to get rid of this inset here save
this check back to our page and you can
see we just have the shadow poking out
of the bottom here it's like nowhere
else except for there so this
is box-shadow and I should mention that
with box-shadow
if you want it to be supporting the
older Firefox the older Safari and
Chrome browsers you're going to be
wanting to use the vendor prefixes and
those are just like we showed in the
past tutorial where you would have a box
shadow and just like this and then you
would have - WebKit - and save this it's
going to be you're not going to notice
on here because I'm actually using
Chrome Canary which is the latest it's
unlike the latest version of Chrome but
you'll see it if you have an older
version of Chrome if you're running 9
and below if you still are if anybody is
but you'll also see it on Safari older
versions of Safari as well and then to
get Firefox it's the same you just add a
mo zhee so - mo z - box shadow and then
the rest of your stuff ok so I'm going
to get rid of this stuff because I don't
I mean I approve of supporting older
browsers but you know just for this
example I'm going to give this let's say
2 pixels 2 pixels and I'm going to keep
this in maybe 5 pixels and I'm going to
take this from being black to make it a
little bit grey and just three three
three I'm going to refresh my page
you'll get a nice pretty subtle shadow
going here it looks it looks pretty nice
cool so that's box shadow you can start
using it today and it's going to work
all over the place it's heck of a ton
better than using images to do the same
thing okay as always this is Scott with
level up Tut's if you have any questions
leave a comment the video hit me up on
Twitter level up Tut's error a test
