of Tut's and in this lesson we're going
to finish installing our CSS framework
we're going to have a mobile-friendly
responsive site so let's get back to it
so the first thing I want to do is I
want to turn off this configuration here
I'm going to turn off this developer
tools that we had going before and got a
log in here and I'm going to just
because right now these red boxes are
going to get in the way so I'm going to
just go ahead and turn those off let's
go down here to developer and change the
store back to main website and now I'm
going to set this to no and those will
be gone things will be looking a little
bit better but not a ton better okay
refresh okay so we have our CSS in here
now if we look at skeletons examples
you'll see like we went over they had a
container so any div with the class of
container is going to be a width of 960
and it's going to be centered so let's
go to our two columns pay two columns
right P dot HTML that we grabbed before
and we have this we have this div that's
actually called a wrapper so that extra
might be a good one to just change we
can even just add a class of container
we save this and now let's come back to
our page refresh okay
cool you'll see this has moved over a
little bit if we inspect this we look at
this container which is reacting
everything by the way it's been given
these styles and we didn't write these
styles but they're located in skeleton
dot CSS you line number 24 you can go
look at them to yourself if you'd like
but it's giving this a position of
relative width of 960 margin of 0 and
auto padding of 0 so let's get our
columns in the right spot and we can
move on from there okay so let's go back
to our document here and we'll see we
have a column main and we have a column
right so we have to decide what
divisions of 16 we want each of these to
be
okay and before I get started here I'm
going to actually look at our CSR HTML
here we have this column right sidebar
I'm actually going to make this
background white really quick just so
that when we do make this switch so that
they're having separate columns you're
going to be able to actually see it in
action
so we're going to set this background to
white and now in our two columns P HTML
if you look at skeleton you can see that
way they've done it is they're saying
here that it to take up something to
take up certain amount of space and like
I said there's 16 columns total with
this they're using the classes of 3 and
columns and sidebar and then for the
main they're having 12 columns offset by
1 content okay so we're going to be
using this 3 columns and we're going to
be using 13 columns for our main just so
we don't have to do the offset by one so
let's come back here and we're going to
add these classes directly to our HTML
so for column main we're just going to
have 13 oh boy 13 columns okay and then
right for column right we're going to
have three columns and if everything is
right I'm going to refresh our page we
should see them pull up right next to
each other so here we have our right
sidebar here we have our main column and
I inspect these you can see a little bit
more clearly with our main column it's
been given a width of 760 and we have
our sidebar here our right column that's
been given a width of 160 they're both
floating left display:inline both have
margins and now let's see what happens
when I actually resize the page here you
can see it still shoots it directly
under here and they're all in one big
column now so already this site is
responsive why do I get it the more the
page adjusts so this is a great start to
our site we have a skeleton framework in
we have a responsive site and we have a
grid
framework alright so this was a lot to
go over with as always if you have any
questions please leave a comment in the
video hit us up at Twitter or level up
Tut's
let us know what you're thinking we
always want to hear from you we're going
to get our site going even further in
the next couple of lessons and we're
going to be doing all sorts of cool
stuff with drop-down menus whatever
we're just going to CSS a lot of the
site and get it looking nice as always
