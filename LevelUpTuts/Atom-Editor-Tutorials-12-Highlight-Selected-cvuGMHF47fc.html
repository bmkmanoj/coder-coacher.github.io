of tutorials and this is gonna be a
quick video on a feature that you might
expect to already be within Adam it's
called highlight selected and we're
gonna get into that right now so now
that we've shown basically arrow added
some packages than some of the core
features of Adam these next few videos
are essentially gonna be covering some
of the more important and surge the
packages that you want to have installed
so let's go ahead and load up our
settings by doing Adam preferences then
we can head to install and let's search
for highlight selected highlight
selected you'll notice mines already up
there because I had recently searched
for it but what's nice about highlight
the selection is it's something that you
would see in most any IDE or text editor
and it's a feature that is installed a
hundred thousand times for a reason if
we click install we'll be able to head
to a javascript file and check it out
let's come to this file right here now
you'll notice that in normal text
editors when you double click a word
you'll see that the whole word gets
selected and highlighted a lot of the
times in addition other instances of
that same word also get an outline
around them now this is very common
you'll see it in things like webstorm
other IDs and stuff like that what's
nice about this is is that you can
instantly see if there's necessarily
like a spelling error or something like
that
let's say we knew that we were supposed
to be typing resolutions and obviously
you could see that there's no you in
this one but if we double select this
and you can see this is surrounded by
resolutions everywhere you can instantly
tell that there's a spelling error in
this word because it's not the same as
the ones that are being used this also
makes it really easy to see anytime a
particular variable or object or
anything is being used throughout your
code
so let's undo that I don't want to make
this Network we can look for all sorts
of things that can easily quick out you
can easily see things in any particular
function or word that you're looking for
so highlights selected is one of those
packages that should be a day one
install it's something that you would
sort of expect to be here and I just
can't imagine coding without it cool so
this is just one of the level of
tutorials recommended packages that
we're going to be covering in the next
few videos as always this is Scott with

questions or comments have becoming the
video help me up at Twitter or Facebook
