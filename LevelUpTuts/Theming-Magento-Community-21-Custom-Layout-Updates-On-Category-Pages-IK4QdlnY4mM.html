of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how we're going to create a static block
and we're going to add it to a place on
the page using a layout update for a
particular category page so if that
doesn't make any sense
just to see what happens when we get
into it basically we're going to create
a static block and then we're going to
have it show up on this children's page
at a certain section that we wanted to
show up in and it's going to be nice and
easy okay okay let's get into it first
we just need to create the block so I'm
going to go to CMS static blocks and
this can be uh this will be children's
block I'm just going to call this child
block and here we can put anything we
want here
but I'm just going to put hello this
this is working and this content like
you said it can be any HTML you can show
how to write it there to actually just
write your own HTML if you'd like and
we're going to save this block what you
have this black doesn't really matter
but just too late this is just to show
you that you can have a layout update
specific to this category so we're going
to go to catalog manage categories and
we're going to go to children's and here
what we want to do is we're going to go
to custom design and here it's going to
allow us to just click no use parent
category settings and we don't need to
change any of this stuff we don't want
to change the layout of the page because
it's already using I think it's a right
column layout let's check this out to be
sure oh this is just a a column 1 layout
so actually let's change this I'm just
going to go through and I'm going to say
this is going to be a 2 column with the
left bar specific to the children's page
and in your custom layout updates you
might just be wondering what goes here
this is just a blank box well this is
where you would put your XML similarly
if you are writing in the lay
outfile so we're going to want to
reference the left bar and we want to
put our block and the left bar so if you
recall we did that by having reference
and then name name equals left so we're
referencing the left structural block of
the site and inside of here I forgive
this it won't do indenting in here but
you can just imagine that this is this
line is indented we want to say block
type and this is equals a CMS slash
block in quotes and then the name is
going to be this can be whatever you
want your name to be it's just going to
be a child block and that's all we
really have to have here and then now
I'm going to say action and the method
is going to be set the lock ID and
notice how this is in camel case so the
B and the eye are capitalized and next
we're going to say block underscore ID
and here we're going to put our block ID
if you remember we had that as child
underscore block was our ID from the
previous page and then we want to close
out this these tags here
okay and then now we need to close out
the block tag and we need to close up
the reference okay now I'm just going to
say this category and unready fresh will
notice a couple of things here oh it's
in my XML is invalid for some reason
let's check it out oh I closed this off
with set block ID for some reason
instead of action so as you can see it's
going to not let you uh go through with
this if you've messed something up here
so okay this is all good now save
category all right category has been
saved let's refresh our children's page
okay so it's done a couple of things
keep in mind at I don't know what's
going off a theme here I think I changed
the theme oh it's actually this custom
design we need to set this to level up
safe this I didn't realize that had
gotten unset no it's refresh okay so we
still have our children's section here
and this newsletter stuff showing up
because we are telling this to be a
two-column page now but the most
important aspect of this the thing you
need to worry about here is this hello
this is working is showing up here
because we have references block here if
we get rid of this code and save this
it's still going to be a two-column it's
still going to have that subscribe stuff
but it's not going to have our hello
this block is working cool so now we
have this you can also so basically you
can add any block to any page you can
change the column around you have so
much flexibility now over what you're
doing with these category pages okay
