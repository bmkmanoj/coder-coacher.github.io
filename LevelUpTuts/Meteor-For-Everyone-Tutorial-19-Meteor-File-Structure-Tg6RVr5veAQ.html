up tutorials and today we're gonna cover
a little bit about file structure in
meteor now this is mostly going to cover
what's possible now there's all sorts of
different ways that people like to
organize their code but that's something
that really is based on project size and
intention right if this is going to be a
small one-off demo project you don't
really have to go through a bunch of
organization unless you really want to
if this is gonna be something a project
that you can see becoming a huge massive
project with multiple people working on
it you can do all the separation of
concerns and you could keep things in a
nice organized file structure both of
which those approaches we'll talk about
a little bit so let's get going on that
right now
what's cool about meteors it really
allows for total freedom in doing this
now the best project structure is really
whatever works best for you and your
team for the project size what people
are used to it's something that you want
if you're working on a team something
you want to talk about and make either a
group decision or or see what other
projects of similar size are sort of
going for but for this type of project
we'll let's see what it's like and how
easily it is to break things out okay so
let's go ahead and what we're gonna do
is we're gonna move our resolution
stuffs our template resolution events
our template resolution helpers and our
HTML a resolution template into a folder
so whatever you would convention you
like oh when defining these folders you
can come up with it yourself or you can
see what other people are doing I'm just
going to make a new folder at the root
of my project and it's just going to be
components so these are gonna be the
components of my project components and
you'll see in a minute it really doesn't
matter what you name this stuff as long
as it works for your project now I'm
gonna make another folder in here and
that folder is going to be resolutions
so
now I know that we already have
everything named resolutions so this
might be a little bit confusing but
let's say you had an application that
had several different types of
collections or just overall components
inside of here you might have a
resolutions folder if this was tracking
events as well you could also have an
events folder things like that where
you're probably going to have
functionality just a way that makes
sense for you to group your code so now
that we have components resolutions I'm
gonna make a new file and it's just
going to be resolution jas and this is
going to be where our JavaScript goes so
basically what we need is this
if meteor is client so I'm going to copy
that
close off the bracket and now we can put
our resolution our template body our
template resolution dot helpers and
events I can just simply copy this stuff
right here template dot resolution out
how first template dot resolution dot
events copy it there paste it directly
into this resolution j/s and save this
file and you'll notice that I didn't
have to do anything other than check to
make sure it's our client before we're
using our client-side code I didn't have
to export anything from here meteor just
sort of combines everything in the
correct way so we have resolutions and
then resolution yes I didn't have to
tell it it was in this folder it just
knows that the JavaScript file it sees
the is client it puts it with our
client-side code come back to our
application quick test everything's
working just fine in fact nothing
changed at all now I'm going to make a
new file in resolutions in the
resolutions folder and it's just going
to be again resolution
resolution to get a spell correctly that
HTML now keep in mind I like I said the
name of these files doesn't doesn't have
anything to do with how it knows where
to compile things this is just simply
whatever convention you're using since
I'm building components it sort of makes
sense for the template to be the name of
that component
so resolution and once again I don't
have to have anything in this HTML file
other than this code so let's cut this
directly out of here we're gonna save
this we're going to paste this in here
and now we have a heart template name
resolution so it's important that
anytime you have an external file here
like this where we're using inside of
another HTML file it needs these
template tags so if you're doing just
simply partials or anything worth that
you need these template tags and it
needs to have a name and that way
everything gets compiled in the right
way and the application knows what it's
looking for okay so now our resolutions
hTML is looking a little bit cleaner the
body ends the document ends where the
closing body tag is so there's no not a
lot of weird non HTML below it and then
we have this resolutions that HTML that
completely encapsulates this one little
instance and all of the code like the
helpers like is owner as well as the as
well as the click events for anything
that's encapsulated within this template
exists within its own JavaScript file
this sort of separation allows things to
be way easier to be found and once you
have a lot of components all that things
going on your site you'll know exactly
where things are simply by going to that
component you open up that component you
then have access to the template and
then the JavaScript that powers that so
again this is just something that can
make your code more navigable it allows
you to just put things where they are it
allows you to put things in certain
places so you know where to find them
always and you can do things like this
with your stylus too right so we just
have this resolutions
style sometimes I make a folder and it's
just st yl and inside of this folder
might be a file where i can save as
underscore bars dot st yl so now i can
have blue equals blue okay sure
i have this this variable and i can
reference that within my imports just
like that
although there's nothing useful in this
it just adds a nice additional structure
to your style sheet so i'll year
additional stylesheet mix-ins maybe you
can have some components and stuff in
here i can all be in here and referenced
by your style file that's on your main
level and it's another thing that's
important to realize is that these file
names they don't necessarily matter
either right let's say this resolutions
died HTML makes less sense as
resolutions HTML and makes more sense as
our layout right it's our general layout
we could rename this to layout HTML
resolutions dot style can be renamed to
anything so maybe if you're a fan of
just having your CSS as like styles dot
st yl whatever we now come back to our
page and you can see absolutely nothing
has changed meteor does not care what
you choose to call these and that's
awesome for people who like complete
control over their file structure and
just how things look that way you can
adapt whatever particular style you're
used to working with this is file
structure in meteor it's really super
flexible and it can pretty much do
anything you want it to do as always
this is scott with level up tutorials if
you have any questions or comments leave
a comment the video edits up at twitter
or facebook at level up tuts we'd love
to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
