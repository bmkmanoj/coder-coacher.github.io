up HUD's and today we're gonna be going
over more Omega in the last lesson we
got our CSS finally working and we had
JavaScript in here so now let's go
through some of I'm a gus'
in your drupal toolbar up here you're
gonna click appearance and it's gonna
take you to your themes page we're gonna
click settings on our sub-theme so ours
is level up theme I'm going to click
settings alright and now you'll see here
that this are the settings for your
Omega and you can see at the right off
the start here we have grid system which
grid we want default or fluid we're
going to leave this at the 960 so it's
not totally fluid although you could
play around with what the fluid does and
we'll see enable responsive grid if we
turn this off the site won't be
responsive at all in fact let's go to
our site and see what sort of
responsiveness is built in to Omega
itself so if I just resized this page
here well if I get to okay if I resize
this page here you're gonna see some of
our our zones and everything adjusting
and moving around
these are the default responsive media
queries this is the default for Omega
where all these regions and zones are
and where they're going to be once you
adjust the page if we were to turn this
off save it
none of that would happen you just be
left with your standard 960 display okay
and you're gonna want to probably leave
this allow customizing viewport meta
properties on Android devices checked no
we didn't have to deal with it
initial-scale is one point oh yeah I
don't get why you would want it set to
something else you want it to be set to
1.0 pretty much I don't really need this
to be scalable by the user and so for
our default lighting option layout
options we have several different
layouts set up and this is for our
responsive site we're going to go over
all these in a bit more detail in the
lesson that's specifically dedicated to
the media queries with Omega so we'll
come back to these like I said let's see
what else is in here now we have our
zones and region configuration again I'm
going to talk about these in ice
zones and region configuration tutorial
because there's enough stuff here that
you're gonna want to have a dedicated
video for those our debugging options if
we go back to our page here you can see
that we have these two check marks here
it's our blocks and our grid right now
they're on and they're on by default one
thing that I like to do when working in
in this Omega when you're developing is
turn off the show grid by default and
just enable them so that they're allowed
to be there so if you enable the grid
and enable the debugging placeholder if
we save our configuration now when we
visit our site it's not going to be
crowded with all the the grid and the
blocks here what we're gonna see is more
what the site's going to look like and
then you can turn them on optionally if
you'd like so this is what I would
recommend doing however it's your own
workflow so whatever works for you works
okay so that was in debugging also if
you wanted to have the site wallets live
if you wanted to check the debugging the
grid or the blocks for some reason you
didn't want your anonymous users or
often take authenticated users to see it
you can just uncheck these two and
administrators will be the only ones
that can see those options again
something I would probably do right off
the bat just in case you you know I
don't know why you wouldn't forget to
turn that off but say in the case that
it happens I would turn that off right
when you start and here you have some
optional libraries formalized which
you're not familiar eyes check out
formalized Emme get familiar with it
media queries will leave those checked
will leave formalise checked I'm gonna
leave equal hides unchecked toggle
styles if you'll notice when you when
you have a omega site there is a ton of
CSS that comes already with your site
and some of it may be good for you and
some of it may not let's say I typically
don't like to use omegas form styles or
their menu styles or their and you know
I actually go through and turn a ton of
these off because I'm going to be
writing my own I don't need to be
constantly over writing their Styles
like Omega
the sort of puts like a custom visual
style for Omega pagers and menus some of
that stuff I wish they would have left
off of the base theme and just let you
do it because it really doesn't I don't
think it looks very good if you leave
this on and you're gonna have to you
know redo it anyways so you can come in
here turn as many of these offer on as
you want them CSS reset any of this
stuff as of this disable module of theme
style sheets but this is a custom module
I have installed the site so you won't
be seeing this and let's toggle advanced
elements okay so here we can display the
stay that disable the display of certain
page elements messages tabs breadcrumbs
page title feed icons and this is going
to be turning it off for your whole site
so I mean I would really probably use
something like context to turn off the
page title on the pages you don't want
to have it turned on too but keep in
mind you're turning this stuff off it's
turning it off for the whole site and
now at the very bottom of all of these
you'll see this toggle display this is
local logo site name site slogan users
and pictures posts user pictures and
comments and I check both a user
verification status in comments I'm
gonna have users on this site so it
doesn't really matter but a shortcut
icon
yeah that's your favicon and by default
there's a main menu in a secondary menu
now the main menu is good to have on
because it wraps it at a nav tag whereas
for html5 right you're gonna probably
want that wrapped in the neck nav tag
and if you're doing a menu block you
won't be getting that sort of same
wrapping it's just gonna be a ul so for
your main menu I might say leave this on
secondary menu if you need it turn it on
if not you can just make a menu block
it's no big deal and these last two
things logo image settings and shortcut
icon settings alright let's see our site
we have our logo image is right here by
default it's the Drupal drop with the
Omega logo and then for our favicon
that's the Drupal drop if you want to
use your own which I can't imagine why
you wouldn't
you can enter a path to a custom logo in
fact I'll just grab this level of tes
logo and I don't
a favicon on hand so I'm just gonna
leave it as the Drupal in for now but
click Save
okay now let's refresh our page and
you'll see here's this giant image it's
way too big I thought it has actually
small but you can see our things are
turned off by default some of the
stylings went away because I turned off
some of those default Omega stylings but
this is how you get in to edit the basic
omega stylings in the next lesson we're
going to talk about the regions and
zones and how you can move everything
around and really control your content
as always if you have any questions
please you know leave a comment the
video a hit us up on Twitter you know we
do get a lot of comments and I'd do my
best to try to get to them and I can't
always get to them all like I said this
is really just a spare time project for
me so I'm getting to it as fast as I can
but please keep on leaving comments
maybe somebody else will see an answer
if I don't get to it first okay as
always this is Scott talansky and thanks
