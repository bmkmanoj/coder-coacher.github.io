of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to add jQuery to your Magento site
and now this is something that is always
a cause for problems in fact it's never
just super easy if it's the first time
adding a jQuery to a Magento site you're
probably going to have some sort of
issue because it's really just not like
it is in some other CMS's or just if you
are making your own website you can't
just simply add a script tag and while
you could there are some pitfalls that
we were going to be looking out for so
we're going to be doing this the Magento
way one of the ways we could approach
this is you could go to your app design
front-end and then pick your theme find
your layout file or your your template
file and then in your HTML template and
see in our header actually would be the
head we don't even have that template
loaded but in the head you just add a
script tag like you normally would
however there's a way that Magento likes
you to do things and we're going to be
doing it that way so what we're going to
be doing is through the local XML file
that we created in our layout files and
this will give you a little bit more
experience working with those layout
files as well so let's come in here
we're going to go to our own theme and
then layout and we did create a local
XML if you remember the file looks like
this we just hold it to remove these
particular blocks from our site so the
first thing we're going to do is instead
of our local XML file we're going to
inside of the default tag here but below
these removes we're going to add a tag
of our own and space down here we're
going to add this reference if you
recall from before we used reference
when we wanted to reference another
block so this time we're going to be
wanting to reference the head so we'll
do a head and then here okay perfect and
we're going to do the next one will be
action and so this action is going to be
a
method of add item okay and don't worry
too much about this tag right now we're
going to go over a little bit a little
more but for right now just know that
this is what we're going to be using for
this instance and we can investigate
these a little bit further but for now
just no action method add item and it's
going to add this file so we're going to
say type and the type is going to be a
skin underscore j/s file and then we're
going to close that type and I should
mention that this is for having jQuery
be added as if you have jQuery itself as
you see I have jQuery minified already
saved in my Jas folder under my theme so
you're going to want to get jQuery you
can get it from Google's API you can get
it from jQuery site itself you should
probably know where you can get that by
now but either way I add it to your site
here and the name is going to be the
path to the file instance this is
starting at the skin level we're just
going to do j/s slash and then the name
of the file which is jQuery Minjae s and
we're going to close this name out we're
going to close action
I can type okay and we're going to close
out this reference okay so now well may
have noticed another type over here okay
so now it should be able to find this
jQuery then J s file let's say this
let's go back to our page I'm going to
give it a refresh and I'm going to check
the source code I got here by just doing
command option you or right clicking on
the page and clicking view source you
can see at the bottom of our scripts
right here you can see a path to skin
front-end level of default Jas let's
click this and you can see here's our
jQuery using one-seven-one you can use
whatever version you would like to use
so here's a here's jQuery great well
what's the next step we want to be
adding some code to try this out so I'm
going to come back to sublime text I'm
going to right click on my J's folder
I'm going to add a new file and this new
file is going to be named let's save
this script Jas and this is going to be
where my gym JavaScript lives so we're
going to have just a comment to make
sure this is loading the right file when
we do add it and then how our local XML
file I'm just going to copy this stuff
because we're going to reuse the same
thing inside of the reference we're
going to have another action add item
it's going to be another skin degeus
except for it's just going to be a
different file
it's script up jeaious we can now come
back to our page brief write will
refresh the source here's our script
let's look at the file and there's our
test comment cool so we've added some
jQuery to our site let's do something
that when I click on the logo it's going
to send an alert so this logo I believe
it's image let's see this class of logo
will does key off of this and and our
script at j/s I'm going to start this
with the document ready if you're
familiar with jQuery this is basically
saying that the document is loaded it's
not going
try to run any of these scripts until
the whole page is loaded and here I'm
going to say our logo click
okay so now when this logo gets clicked
it should alert yo yo yo yo okay it
looks like I'm missing up for rent to
see their and we should be all good so
let's check this out it looks like
pretty standard Jake where to be refresh
the page and click and we get that the
yo yo yo yo and however there's one
thing that should be mentioned if you
get into using jQuery you're going to be
seeing a lot of issues within Magento so
what you're going to want to do is take
jQuery into this no conflict mode so
let's go back to our script file and
although this did work you you're going
to run into some frustrations of things
not working so let's go to this and
we're going to say var and we're going
to use a dollar sign J instead of just
dollar sign is equal to jQuery dot no
conflict so this is something that
people run into frequently though
because jQuery is not working on my set
I can't figure it out well you have to
have jQuery and no conflict mode so now
anytime that we use the dollar sign
instead of using the dollar sign we're
going to use this dollar sign j-just
like this we're going to save this and
now we're going to refresh and our Lert
works the reason why Magento has issues
with jQuery is because it uses a
different library by default it uses the
prototype library which uses the dollar
sign in a different way so you're going
to want to have something different in
jQuery so because jQuery is PI as the
most users and is really in my opinion
the best library for doing this kind of
thing you're going to want to use no
conflict and you're going to want to use
jQuery like this as always if you have
any questions please leave a comment the
video or hit us up at Twitter at level
up lots
you know so those know what you're
thinking thanks for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
