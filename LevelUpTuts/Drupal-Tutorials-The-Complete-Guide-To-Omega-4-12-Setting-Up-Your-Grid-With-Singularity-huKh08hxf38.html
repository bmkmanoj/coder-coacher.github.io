of Tut's and today we're gonna be
talking about how to set up your grid
using singularity and omega4 and now the
grid framework is singularity in omega 3
we had all that being accomplished
through a visual interface where we're
signing regions to different columns
bands and stuff like that and it was
sort of taking care of not only the grid
part but also the responsive part for us
in omega 4 this is broken up we now have
two separate things controlling both of
those we now have break points which is
a SAS extension for media queries
controlling your responsiveness and we
have singularity controlling the grid
now these extensions are created by team
SAS and they're both awesome they're
both really great in fact I've gotten so
used to using singularity it's pretty
much the only grid framework I'm
touching right now I'm having a hard
time even thinking about using websites
where you're defining things like cost
band 1 in the HTML because the way you
work this grid framework is with mix-ins
in your CSS you're basically throwing a
mixin into your style declaration and
that's assigning that element apart on
your grid you're also configuring your
grid through variables in sass so let's
get started we have our variables folder
here and there is no grid partial and
that's really just because they don't
want to lock you into using it however
pretty much one of the first things I do
is create a grid partial in this so I'm
going to say in here variables new file
I notice how I right-click on the
variables folder and say new file and
we're gonna say underscore grid dot a
CSS just like that now the things that
you wanted to fine for your grid to get
going you really just have to say how
many columns there are really and you
say okay we can say dollar sign and you
say grids and we're setting this
variable and this is how many columns we
want to have so if you're used to a 12
column grid here you just say 12 and
semicolon and this is going to set your
gribbit at 12 columns likewise if you
had 16 it would be 16 what it doesn't
set is your total width or your pertain
or anything like that this is an
assuming a 960 container it's unassuming
any container and that's why singularity
is so excellent because this 12 grids
this is going to adapt to whatever
container size you have use 12 columns
and likewise gutters you define as by
saying your gutters and then : and then
what your gutters with there you could
say I want my gutters to be 15 pixels
right but that's not gonna be great
because let's say your container is
really small right your container gets
really small your gutters are still 15
pixels I mean it perhaps the design
calls for that in that case go go to
town you can define a fixed gutter with
here but another way you could do it is
saying a fraction here and this is
saying that the gutters are one third of
the size of a column so now if we save
this this is our grid our grid is set up
so now let's come to our Styles right
here and let's actually start adding
things to the grid so I'm going to say
that we have the sidebar the first
sidebar is going to be three columns and
the second sidebar is going to be nine
columns actually where's the content in
this site let's actually add a add some
content here and let's go to a page
let's go to basic page and we're gonna
say test page 1 this way we can have it
be more of like a main content sort of
thing and now I'm just gonna drop some
hipster ipsum in here let's just save
this page okay so we have our main
content area right here and we have our
first sidebar so let's inspect this to
get some classes here so our content is
going to be in this L content
and so we can say this class of elk
content we want this to be nine columns
and we want to start at the fourth
column right well let's actually do the
sidebar first we can say let's close
this let's grab the the class is over
agent sidebar first okay and so we want
to say that this is going to include a
grid span so we're going to say include
notice how we're doing this through
mix-ins and the mixin is grid
- span and now these are mixes that
singularity provides for you and we
could say that this is going to start in
the first column and it's going to span
three columns so it's going to span
three comma start in the first one so
the first variable it takes is how many
columns it spans and the second variable
it takes is where it starts now we want
to use the same mixin for our content
and let's paste this in here and we want
to start this at the fourth column and
we want this to go nine columns keep in
mind we have a twelve column grid so 9
plus 3 is 12 and let's save this now
let's check out our CSS really quick and
you can see not only is it defining
percentages for everything it's having
really precise percentages so it's doing
all this crazy math for us stuff that
you would probably not want to do by
hand right so of course my page crashed
here you might see that if you're using
inspect element in live reload so okay
so let's refresh our page and you'll now
see that we have these two very distinct
columns in fact if we you know shrink
the page here everything's changing from
the the gutter to the column widths it's
all remaining in percentages and that
was really
with just two lines of code here so
let's come back to our Styles we gave it
a grid span here and a grid span here
the reason why this is excellent is
because we didn't have to go into HTML
and say hey this is you know 9 columns
and this is three columns and whatever
it doesn't even matter if we wanted to
change it really quickly we could say
that this starts on the first column and
this one starts on the tenth column and
let's refresh our page and now it just
totally swapped the grid now it looks
like there are some other stuff going on
here it's probably because this region
debug is stephane and there's no content
here we're also probably needing a clear
fix somewhere here because these things
are being taken out of the flow of the
document here that's probably why this
powered by Drupal and the footer is
pushed way up here but that's all things
that we're going to solve by having
access to the layout files right because
we're gonna have access to the actual
HTML when we start creating the layouts
so again this is like totally fluid and
that's that's absolutely excellent I
mean what if you didn't want it to be
completely fluid I mean you could say
that our let's inspect this and let's
grab one of the larger containers here
let's say not the body let's say that
the page container let's say that this
has a max width of let's say that this
has a width of 960 pixels right and now
our grid is going to actually let's
center then margin zero okay cool I've
come back here and our page is
automatically going to be 960 it doesn't
look 960 excited blown up really huge
but here's it smaller so our page is now
at 960 it's fixed this isn't going to
change or even though our grids still
done in percentages it's not you know
adjusting or anything like that because
this grid is adjusting to the size of
its container so the excellent part
about all of this is once we get into
breakpoints which we're going to do in
the next
video you can change your grid at
different base breakpoints you can
change the container size you can change
the grid spans you can change the
gutters you can change how many columns
all at different breakpoints so it's an
extremely flexible grid framework along
with breakpoints and it allows you to
use some insane
quick content laying out like you've
never seen before I mean this is four
lines of code here and it's doing
extremely complex math to have this
layout perfect so this is a introduction
to singularity and by no means is this
the definitive course on singularity
there is a lot out there in fact I'm
going to do an entire series on
singularity and breakpoints and SAS
extensions the moment I finish this
Omega series so if you want to dive
further into the cool stuff we can do
with this we'll go into it in depth but
for right now this should get you
accomplishing everything you need to
create your basic grids so remember to
find your grid columns to find your
gutters and then just start using these
mixes check out singularities wiki for
more information there's tons of
information there in the next video
we're going to start talking about bird
points to get you on your way to making
a fully responsive website so as always
this is Scott with level up tuts if you

hear from you so thanks for watching
