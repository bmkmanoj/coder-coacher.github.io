up Tut's and today we're going to be
going over the admin bar in Drupal 7 so
now that we've installed that dribble 7
this is what the basically this is what
the screen takes you to this is your
site if you are logged in and you have
access to the admin bar this admin bar
will show up here
these are the main links and these are
your shortcuts right here if you want to
hide your shortcuts if you don't use
them you can just click this arrow and
they're hidden so first off I want to
show you this button always takes you
home next up is your dashboard and this
is good for site administrators or
content administrators people who are
going to be using the site and need some
sort of user friendly interface to sort
of see what's going on and this
dashboard can be configured as you can
see it's pretty blank it gives you a
couple of blocks here to begin with this
who's new search form and recent content
however if you click this customize
dashboard you can see you can add other
blocks and then even further add more
blocks and later lessons we'll get into
blocks and then I'll show you exactly
customizing your dashboard but just know
that that's what it is here next step is
the content so content will take you to
the same place that this find content
button will take you right now we have
to what are called content types and
that's what Drupal installs with there's
article and basic page articles sort of
like a blog post and basic page is just
a page so right now if we were to click
add content it would then ask us if we
wanted to create an article or basic
page and again in later tutorials we're
going to be going over content types in
greater detail and how you can create
your own content types for greater
control over your site also in content
you can see you have access to published
and unpublished comments if you are
using Drupal
commenting system this is where you'd be
going for that here is structure
structure is where you can get at things
like blocks your content types like I
mentioned before this is where you would
change or create new content types your
menus and your text out of me and so
some of these things might seem a little
weird right now because Drupal likes to
use its own language so taxonomy think
of it as sort of like tags your tagging
a post or you have some sort of
classification you know some sort of tag
for your your content menus you know
it's pretty much navigation or anything
like that then you can get really really
robust you can you know do any sort of
nesting and creating all sorts of
multiple navigations that you can then
use as blocks which are right here to
show up on your site somewhere else and
blocks can be all sorts of other content
again we're going to get into this more
but think of a block as just sort of a
chunk of content that you're going to
set somewhere on your site alright and
next is appearance and it appearances
where you're going to deal with what
themes you have installed in the next
tutorial we're going to be going over
how to install a theme but for right now
you can see by default
Bartek is the theme that's enabled and
then seven is the is another thing
that's enabled but it's not set as your
default so you don't see it if you go
down here this is your administration
theme this is the theme that these menus
are using and this is using that seven
as you can see there's also Garland
which is an older theme that Drupal set
for a little while and then Stark is you
know as as you can see it's pretty blank
here if some things have different
settings you click here for settings and
then you know here you can toggle logo
sign name pretty much any of this stuff
as you'll see in the next lesson more
advanced in different themes are going
to have different settings as you can
see this is the global
we also have this is the settings for
Bartek so if we wanted to get in here
and just change the header color for
whatever reason in here you could do
that without having to touch the CSS and
then seven these are 7s okay next up is
people these are the users of your site
this is a pretty powerful place because
not only being able to add users and
delete them or whatever you also have
access to all of their permissions and
permissions play a big role when you're
dealing with all sorts of content in
Drupal you can pretty much decide who
sees what and who can access and change
what
like I said permissions are a very
powerful thing in Drupal and also in
most these menus they come with this
filtering so you could filter by only on
the show-me administrators it's pretty
basic works nicely if you have lots of
users or lots of content so let's just
reset this okay well that's the first
half of the admin admin bar in the next
tutorial we're going to go for the last
half and we're going to go over adding
shortcuts
once again this is Scott with level up
tuts and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
