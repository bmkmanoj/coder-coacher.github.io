love tutorials and in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how we can create a
basic two column layout in our first
website so let's get going on that right
now so in the last video we had this
section and we have this aside which is
our signup area right here and we want
this aside to actually show up in a
single column on the right-hand side of
our page so we want this to be a basic
two column layout where you have one
main column which is going to be this
section here and one less important sort
of sidebar column where we can throw a
bunch of stuff in here now making a
layout like this is pretty easy so if
you remember at the top here we had our
header when we wanted somebody to go far
to the left and far to the right we just
floated them far to the left and far to
the right well we can go ahead and do
that with these sections and asides here
as well so let's go ahead and name this
class for our section here and we can
call this main - call and now let's go
ahead and copy this class into our aside
and we'll say this is a sidebar - called
okay the call just means column and
naming conventions could certainly be
changed since this is our first website
we don't need to worry about too much
about class naming conventions at this
point so let's head to our CSS and let's
write some CSS here we can first use our
main column and the main column we're
going to say float and we're gonna float
this left so now we want this to
actually be width of 70% so instead of a
pixel value this is going to be taking
up 70% of its parent all right now let's
do the period at sidebar column and
since we want this to be on the right
side we can say float
right now it's important to know you
could also say float:left for this
because a float:left is still gonna pull
this out of the document flow and since
we're gonna be taking up 100% of the
width here once this is all done it
really shouldn't matter however just
because this is it left and right thing
we'll leave this as float right so here
we can say 30 pixels okay like so so the
set bar is gonna take up 30% the main
column is going to take up 70% and let's
just go ahead and add a background of
something like I'm gonna do a dark 3 3 3
and then from here I'm gonna say color
ffffff is white 3 3 3 is a dark gray so
let's go ahead and refresh our page and
as you can see we now have the Bell
board we have our left column and we
have our right column upon inspecting
this let's go ahead and inspect you can
see that this takes up 70% and this
takes up 30% I'm actually gonna change
those color values we can actually make
this something more along the lines of
what the Billboard is doing we can leave
the color as black but just change the
background to a light gray and just like
that I'm gonna do the opposite for the
billboard itself I'm gonna make the
background 3 3 3 and I'm gonna make the
color in it FFF this way the Billboard
now sticks out a little bit more the
sidebar sticks out less and it's just a
little bit more even feeling right but
we have some issues here one of our big
issues here is that the sign up right
here it goes directly to the edge of our
our sidebar here and that doesn't look
great we don't want this to be directly
pushed up against this line here so one
of the ways we can do this by adding
some padding to this aside now padding
is going to just sort of push everything
inwards so let's go ahead and add 5%
padding on this sidebar however I'm
going to add 20 pixels of padding on the
top 5 percent on the left and right and
20 on the bottom
now you'll refresh you can see this is
quite a bit more space here but there's
some really funky stuff going on our
footer content is now pushed up here our
things don't line up and if you hover
over this you'll see that this is now
quite a bit wider than it was in fact if
you look at these two highlighted areas
you can see very clearly that these
puzzle pieces don't fit together
so one of the reasons that is is because
by default padding adds to the width so
here we have 30% we're using five and
five on the left and right however that
makes it actually 40 percent because the
padding is being added to the width now
there's a way around that which we can
cover in later videos using a new
technique however for right now this is
the standard way the box model works so
we want to make sure we have a good
understanding of that so by changing
this width from 30% to 20 we can now add
it up correctly by saying 5 plus 5 plus
20 equals 30 plus 70 equals 100 refresh
and we now have some good-looking
padding in here and we now have some
padding in here but it maybe looks like
it's a little too heavy so let's come
back to our sublime text and let's
actually change this to 2.5% and now we
can change this width to 25% refresh it
and that looks a bit better and that
looks quite a bit better so we now have
our main content area we now have our
sidebar we've added some padding and
we've learned a little bit about the box
model now in the next video we want to
show you how you can put a wrapper
around all of this content and then
Center that content so that wrapper will
be a given width so that way when the
page is this wide our content doesn't
shoot out so far apart it will only be
maybe like 90% of the width of the
window itself but that width but that
div will be centered so we're gonna be
centering a div in the next video as
always this is Scott without lope
tutorials if you have any questions
leave a comment a video hit me up at
twitter or facebook at level of
tutorials I love to hear from you thanks
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
