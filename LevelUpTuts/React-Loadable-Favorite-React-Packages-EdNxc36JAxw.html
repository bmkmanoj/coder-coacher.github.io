essential react plugins or packages I'm
going to be talking about react loadable
but before we get into that I want to
take a quick moment to talk about this
video sponsor which is Devon mountain so
what deaf mountain is is well it's a
coding bootcamp where you can go and you
totally immerse yourself and what I mean
by that is well it's full time so you
show up to one of their locations and
you stay and live there and you
obviously get free housing while you do
this and there's in several different
locations from Provo Salt Lake Dallas
and Phoenix and you show up and
basically you have access to full time
mentors tons of courses and the ability
to just grow as a web developer designer
app developer in a place that really
encourages personal growth so dev
Mountain is super cool because you show
up and get absolutely real-world
training you can see it's very
career-focused
they have a huge network companies like
Nike and reddit eBay LinkedIn Apple HP
the list goes on and on and on so if
you're looking to really step up your
career head to dev Mountain dot-com
check out some other locations check out
their courses request to syllabus take a
tour of the campus and just contact them
and step up your game by taking the leap
into becoming a full time programmer
designer any of that stuff with dev
Mountain all right now back to the
tutorial ok Thank You dev Mountain for
sponsoring and what we want to do now is
talk about react loadable where let's
dive into the description of this
Warner's a a higher-order component for
loading components with promises now
this one is super awesome for several
reasons what this this package does is
it basically prevents your components
from being loaded until they need to be
loaded C even has a nice logo route
centric code splitting is component
centric splitting is cool as and I
don't know if that's a real quote it
says probably by the way this is
packages by the James Kyle
you aren't following Jim the the James
Kyle on Twitter and github and all this
stuff then go ahead and take that moment
to do so he is one of those people just
one of those people you've got to follow
so let's talk a little bit about react
loadable and why people love it
I love it because well it loads
components only when you need them
making code splitting super-easy you can
see this quote I'm obsessed with this
right now
create react app with react router for
react loadable free code splitting this
is so easy and I personally use this all
over level up tutorials I have a
component that handles all of this for
me using react loadable and using
meteors code splitting
I can automatic bundle reduction like
for instance the store for level up
tutorials is a huge amount of components
and I don't need to use all of those
components on every single time like if
you're coming to level up tutorials and
if you're a pro subscriber like why the
heck would you need all of the
components that are associated with the
store all of those libraries and all of
that stuff and the answer is you don't
so you can use something like react
loadable simply by importing react
loadable and then having what you have
is a constant react loadable component I
call mine load Ming loadable component
is a probably cooler name than that but
what you can see here is we simply just
use the loadable function and we pass in
an object now this object takes in a
couple of things it takes in the loader
which is a function which does your
import but you can just write your
import right in here and then what we
can do is give this a loading component
now this loading component is just a
well component so for instance on level
up tutorials if we go there and then I
had to let's say the store
well my site's being too fast right now
but typically you may have seen it
briefly there there is a swirling level
up tutorials logo yeah my said it's too
fast I don't know
I need to slow this thing down so you
can see it but what it is is a loading
component that pops up whenever this
component has yet to be loaded now in
addition to that it's not really shown
in this example but you can up the delay
for instance do you want to show your
loading component if there is a 200
millisecond delay and probably not right
if that if that delay is getting you
know half a second or something like
that then you want to show your loading
component so there's also a delay
property here and this package is great
if you need to learn more about why you
would use this to code split your app
and stuff like that there is just an
excellent excellent blog post here so
like I said we can use this to only load
our components when we need to and then
I just did about how good this
documentation is - in this particular
example this loadable component only
loads if this is actually loading when
let's say this loadable component was
within an if statement or even based on
a route then it would not even bother
importing the component at all and the
moment that if statement was true and
this component needed to be used it
would start using react loadable to
import the component potentially show
your loading component if needed and
well like I said it just reduces your
bundle size like crazy if your setup is
correct look at this I shaved 50
kilobytes off from our main bundle and
some people like to ask me how did I get
level up tutorials so fast like how how
does this load so fast and the answer is
honestly bundle splitting right like I
am only showing the user what components
they need at any given time using react
loadable you can see right here in my
packages love love love this let's go to
my routes here I'm gonna go to my main
layout and you can see here I have all
these routes that are just having in a
component and then I'm using my own
react loadable component called load
Meng and I'm saying hey load Meng import
this particular component if you arrive
on the sync page other than that
load it and like I said this is super
handy especially if you're trying to
prevent people from loading up the
entire ecommerce packages if they are a
pro subscriber right that's going to
make the experience better for every
single person that visits your site so
react loadable all of the Doc's are here
to learn how to use it I also have a
video on this channel where I talk more
in depth about how I'm using this to
absolutely crush my bundle size so check
that out as well react loadable one of
my absolute all-time favorite components
of the James Kyle someone you want to
follow click his name here check out all
of his packages super super cool guy who
does a lot of excellent work so thank
you so much for watching and as always I
will see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
