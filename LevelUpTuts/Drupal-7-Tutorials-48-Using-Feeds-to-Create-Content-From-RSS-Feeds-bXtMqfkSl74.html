up tubs and today I'm going to show you
how to import content from an RSS feed
on the internet and have it in your site
using feeds okay so the last lesson we
imported a CSV now we're going to create
a new feed importer and we're going to
have it in putting in RSS feed so like
you did last time go to structure feed
importers and this time we're going to
add an importer and it's just going to
be RSS okay and you can name this
whatever you want of course so now we're
going to just go through the settings
again like we did last time we're going
to use this as a standalone form again
periodic input
let's check every week so every week
this is going to check and see if this
RSS feed has changed I know the iris
feed that I'm using is from a friend of
mine Devin Kerr his website so I know he
doesn't update it that often so it might
as well check it every week and that way
I don't have to worry about it running
all the time
however if you're taking from content
that runs or updates much more
frequently you can have an update as
often as possible if you'd like okay and
we'll click Save here you can also
import on submission so that you can
click import and it's going to create
those nodes which will leave checked and
we're going to have this be an HTTP
fetcher download content from URL okay
we'll leave that beam Settings auto
detect feeds now we have the RSS feed
right here so we don't need it to auto
detect and okay
however you know if you don't you can
give it a website I probably recommend
that you have the feed handy okay so now
we're going to use a common syndication
partner or a parser because this is an
RSS feed okay and we'll click settings
for that looks like there's nothing to
nothing to do here so we're going to go
to processor and we're going to create
nodes out of this just like we did
before and let's go to our settings so
we're going to want to update existing
nodes we're going to import this as
plain text and we'll just have this be
feeds again just so we can say
okay and x-pyr nodes no we don't want
them to expire so click Save here and
then mapping so I'm going to use this
mapping here and I'm going to say the
title is going to be maps to our title
click Add and we want these to be unique
but we'll get to that in a second and
then description I'm going to set that
to the body and we'll click Add ok and
now I'll click unique target because we
have to save here save ok so now we have
our feed setup now it's the fun part
again we need to import our feed ok so
let's go to your your domain / import ok
and now you see our new feed here we can
click RSS and I'm just going to put in
the path to our feed so you can copy
that put the URL in here and we can
click import and see what happens okay
here's the progress bar and as you can
see it created 10 nodes let's check
those out so find content ok here is his
posts this is really great so this is
all of this is post right here and then
let's say we go to edit ok so some of
this stuff because we're importing is
plain text if we change this to full
HTML as you can see so we would have
wanted to maybe import this as full HTML
plain text whatever doesn't matter for
now because really all that matters is
that we were able to get this
information in here ok
and once you let's say find out you did
something wrong you can always tweak
your feet importer and re-import you can
even delete all the pieces of content
like I showed you last time and
re-import or just update them and
re-import okay so that is how you import
content from an RSS feed into Drupal
using feeds once again this is Scott
with level of Tut's and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
