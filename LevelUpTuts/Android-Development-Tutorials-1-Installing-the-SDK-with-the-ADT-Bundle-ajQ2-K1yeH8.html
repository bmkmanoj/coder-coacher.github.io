Tut's and today I'm going to be talking
about Android development on OS X and
now I'll do a separate video for Windows
once I figure out how to get my
microphone working with Windows I'm
using an Apogee one they only have
drivers for Mac for some reason so if I
can get a microphone working for Windows
I'll do a Windows video as well but for
right now I'm just going to have this
Mac video and when I get a microphone
working I will in fact have a Windows
video for this but so what we're going
to do in this first lesson is I'm really
just going to show you how to install
the SDK using androids ADT bundle and
it's really easy it's possibly the
easiest way to install the SDK ever
before new step to download eclipse
separate and then install the SDK
yourself and you can still do it that
way if you like they definitely have the
availability to do that however they now
bundle them all together for you which
is a really really really useful so if
you want to browse to
developer.android.com slash well it
doesn't have to do slash index just am
developer.android.com and it'll take you
to this page here and you want to click
this get sdk down here in the footer
navigation and and this big blue button
is download the SDK ADT bundle for Mac
so click on that and you're going to
want to agree to these terms you can
read them if you'd like
do that in your own time and it's going
to download so so it's going to take
seven or let's go take a little bit to
download so I'm going to come back when
this is done and then we're going to go
from there however one thing I want to
touch on is this won't be a course on
Java itself obviously because that you
are building these apps in Java you're
going to have to you know learning Java
separately is something that you're
going to want to do however really I'm
going to be going over building Android
apps using the Android SDK and mostly
the specifics of Android development
itself and not the java language so you
know brush up on your java or you know
go Google some videos to learn Java
there's plenty of resources available
for that and just check it out learn
as much about the language as you can
you can do a while learning Android in
fact if you don't know any Java you can
get by building some really basic apps
and then uh in you know just build it
from there so let this uh you know spark
your fire to learning Android it's a
really a lot of fun to build with you
could to play with things and then you
know play with them on your phone after
you've built them it's a really exciting
so just a comeback once this is done
downloading and then we'll finish
setting up with the ADT bundle so the
ADT bundle has finished downloading I
just have the folder here on my desktop
you can see inside of it as an eclipse
folder eclipse is going to be the IDE
the editor that you're going to be using
to be writing your code and the SDK is
also here in its own folder with all
sorts of stuff like the platform tools
which includes some cool stuff AB
basically there's n tools as well but
don't worry about and the stuff that's
in these folders quite yet because what
we're going to be doing is we're going
to be moving this whole ADT bundle
folder to a directory I've made in my
documents called Android dev you can put
these in any folder you want just as
long as it's sort of your development
environment in fact they even recommend
to say just put it in some folder even
labeled development on their site
however you can put it wherever you want
next we're going to go in here and we're
going to go navigate to the Eclipse
folder and here's the Eclipse
application
but I'm going to click this and it's
going to open it says uh yes I need Java
Runtime I don't have it installed so I'm
going to install it and in fact if you
know you don't have it installed you're
probably get a similar message okay that
was installed it's to let me know that
I've never opened this before and now
you can see this fancy new Android
developer tools logo and everything like
that it's asked me where I want my work
space to be you know ah I'm going to
actually choose my Android development
folder that I created under documents
yeah and then Android dev I'm just going
to have this be my workspace here you
could have it be any folder you would
like because this is really just where
your projects are going to get stored so
let's click OK to this I'm just going to
use this as a default do not ask again
I'm sure I'll send some statistics to
Google I don't care out I don't mind if
I do that and here they have you set up
with this nice little welcome screen
this is the Android developers tools see
this has really changed over the past
couple of years because really it used
to be just sort of had their SDK take
clips and get going from there but I
feel like androids done a great job of
really trying to make it a better
experience for new developers to come
into their SDK and I think it's going to
have a positive effect on the Android
development community overall so we have
the SDK installed setup and we're ready
to get started on our first Android
project in the next lesson I'm going to
show you how to create a new Android
project from the start and we're going
to do a hell a world and but it's not
going to be really difficult because it
sort of does it for you but we'll be
going over sort of the intro screen and
how you can create a new project as
always we're going to keep these videos
kind of short so short digestible chunks
that's how we like to do it here and
we're going to have each minute vieira
each video around six minutes or so that
way you don't have to get too involved
in a topic to learn what you need to
learn so as always if you have any
questions or comments please hit us up
at twitter at LevelUp tuts
or you can hit me up at s2 Lenski on
twitter or you can leave a comment of
the video or on Facebook
level of Tut's so just look for us and
thanks for watching
