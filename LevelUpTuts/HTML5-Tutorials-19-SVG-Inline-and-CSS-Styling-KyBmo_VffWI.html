up tuts and today we're going to take
our SVG lesson that we were working on
in the previous video and we're going to
expand on it and show you some really
cool techniques that you can use to
control and manipulate your SVG directly
with CSS so check it out we're going to
get going right now so in the last video
we went as far as actually changing the
fill to this SVG path using this XML
file here however what are some more
interesting things we can do well
actually we can get rid of some of the
stuff in this file we have a title we
have this description we have this depth
we don't need this it also has this
thing that says it's generated with
sketch 3 we don't need that either in
fact we don't need this XML version at
all either and what we can do is we can
copy just this SVG part and we can paste
this directly into our HTML now this
doesn't need to be wrapped in any sort
of tag or anything this is just going to
be it's just going to go right in here
so instead of having it declared as an
image we can paste our SVG directly in
our document now I'm going to fix the
tabbing on this to make sure that we're
looking nice here so we can see what's
going on okay so now we have the same
data that was just in that other file
now it's directly on our site I'm
actually remove it from the background
image too to get rid of that okay and
now let's come to our page and let's
refresh now here we have our SVG the
same as it was so we didn't have to do
anything extra it just showed up using
that XML directly in our HTML now what
are some cool things we can do with that
here well you can actually treat this
HTML just like other HTML we could give
this CSS based on
classes and things like that so let's go
ahead and do that so let's look for some
important information we know that this
background color is three three three
because we see that as this fill so we
can add a class to this GTECH which is
just a grouping and since we made this
shape out of the combination of other
shapes that's why it's a group instead
of like a path or something like that
now let's give this a class and let's
say this is going to be our new shape
now this new shape we can now style with
CSS however it's important to know that
SVG shapes have different CSS properties
than normal so let's go ahead into our
CSS and if we were to say new shape BG
blue for instance now we refresh this
you get nothing and it's because that
this SVG this group has no background
there's no such thing as a background in
an SVG shape what you have is fill so
now if we set this fill property to be
blue and we refresh you'll see that our
SVG has now been styled with CSS now
even more importantly we can do things
right like we can add a hover stick so
let's go ahead and say that on hover
we're going to make this color red the
classic blue red okay so we refresh this
now on hover we get red so we're
actually modifying a vectors fill
property with CSS and HTML it's just so
awesome and let's go ahead and see when
you hover into this transparent center
though the hover State falls off well if
this is a logo and your logo is complex
and transparency you're not going to
want that so let's go ahead and add a
class to the SVG itself and we can just
call this
class equals logo now instead of having
the hover on the new shape we can put
the hover on logo and then animate new
well not animate but change the color of
new shape just like this okay so now
when we hover over the logo at all it's
red so even in this transparent Center
it's going to stay red now there are too
many properties that you can modify with
cs2 to go over this directly I can link
to the w3.org page that has all of the
the ways you can style SVG but you can
do all sorts of things like fill opacity
you can add a stroke you can change the
stroke width obviously you can use
gradients you can have interactivity you
can have filter effects you can do
masking basically there is a ton of
stuff that you can do with SVG and it's
totally worth exploring so there's no
reason why you can't use SVG in your
projects today in fact it's pretty
highly supported that you're pretty much
going to run into trouble on some older
Oh mobile OS versions and some ie8 but
you know honestly nowadays what doesn't
have problems with the high e8
I know I've long moved on from iea and I
know Google is going to stop supporting
ie8 soon but even then a fallback isn't
difficult if you're using something like
moderniser it actually adds a class for
browsers that are supporting SVG and
then you can simply trigger on an image
version now SVG's are also excellent for
high resolution screens they're going to
look crisp no matter what so instead of
having to have several versions of your
image to support Retina displays or high
resolution displays you now can just
have one SVG and it's going to take care
of all of those so get using SVG if
you're not already and it's going to
change your life if it hasn't already so
