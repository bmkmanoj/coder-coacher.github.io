of cuts and today we're gonna be talking
about audio and html5 so for this
particular example I'm gonna go ahead
and remove the video code that we had
from the last couple of videos because
we don't need it anymore
and what we're gonna be doing is really
just showing you how similar audio is to
video now keep in mind there's lots of
cool things you can do with html5 video
and audio and these are really just the
basics I would recommend checking out
you actually have access to all sorts of
stuff with JavaScript that you can use
to control your videos and your audio
clips you don't just have to rely on you
know just a basic interface you can have
a trigger events and stuff like that
it's pretty darn cool and some of that
stuff we're gonna be going over and it's
just gonna be in the future because
there's lots of other basic html5 stuff
I want to touch on before we get into
some of the more crazy stuff but let's
talk about audio so in the last example
we used video and we had a video tag and
inside of it we had source tags so let's
try something similar with audio we have
audio got spelled correctly and wants to
put a source tag already or just a
source attribute I'm gonna go ahead and
mix that and then inside of here I have
a source and I'm gonna add an SRC and
this is going to be an mp3 file that I
have in a folder called audio so we'll
just have it say audio slash and son I
have it's actually a song I wrote a few
years ago so I'm just gonna throw this
mp3 in here so I have to worry about
licensing you have anything like that
and I can just save this like this so
let's see what happens when we come to
our browser and we refresh not a whole
lot in fact nothing
so let's come back here and let's change
something around here let's just add
controls save this let's come back and
refresh so we could also say controls
equals controls as you saw in the last
video it's gonna be the same thing
and it's pretty cool so you'll notice
that these controls are really similar
to that of what we had in the video it
just looks like an audio instead and
let's come to Firefox here let's try to
see what this page looks like in Firefox
and you'll notice we don't have anything
as always Firefox is going to be you
know an interesting candidate here
because Firefox does not support mp3 in
fact the browser's are not support mp3
are the same ones that support mp4 and
you might be wondering if they're for
similar reasons well it has to do with
codecs and it has to do with who owns
those codecs so you can look into that
more in your spare time however we're
going to be able to create a new version
of this video file to work in Firefox
similar only how we had to do for fire
for for Chrome but let's just check this
out on Chrome and see what this happens
when we use these controls and now I'm
going to turn the volume next could be
loud I'm not quite sure and let's just
press play here notice how we can
control here we can use the volume
controls just like we'd expect we can
jump to the middle of the song yeah
that's enough of me singing for now and
so this is an a an html5 audio player
it's funny because the audio was so hard
to get working on the browsers before
you had to have a Flash Player you had
to go download something from somewhere
this is just really simple now we just
have to get it working with the Firefox
so since Internet Explorer supports mp3
chrome supports mp3 and Safari supports
mp3 we're left with opera and Firefox is
the two other major players that sort of
need need a special video for a special
audio file type and the common thread
between Firefox and opera could be
either wave or an OGG audio file so
ah this is sort of where it comes down
to your personal preference a little bit
the only thing I'm going to say about
this is that the OGG format is probably
going to be better for audio streaming
wave is a uncompressed audio file what
and I think they're typically
uncompressed I don't know if that's true
for every case or something but WAV
files are typically larger and larger
files gonna take a longer time to
download it's gonna cost more bandwidth
pretty much all sorts of stuff and it's
probably gonna sound a lot better but um
let's convert this using the same Miro
Video Converter if you didn't see in the
past couple videos go check out the
second video html5 video video and
you'll see that how to download this
Miro Video Converter we can also use it
for audio I've dropped my mp3 in here
I'm gonna select format audio OGG Vorbis
I'm gonna click go
convert to OGG and now it's going to
give me a song which I can put into my
audio folder
so it's gone ahead and converted this
and threw it into a mirror Video
Converter folder my movies directory in
case you don't know where it output it
but so I just drag that in here and we
have our song Oh Gigi copy and paste
this and let's throw this into our audio
tag just like we did before so type
source and then the SRC we can do equals
audio and then paste it in here just
like this now let's check this out in
Firefox we now have a Firefox audio
player jump to a part of the song let's
maybe know so we don't have this
necessarily as nice of controls here
it's just either volume on or off put
your press play and that's that's the
song right here check it out cool so
that works
we have html5 audio it's working on
Firefox it's working on Chrome and let's
check out Safari while we can it's gonna
work on newer versions of Internet
Explorer versions 9 and above you can
actually use something very similar to
video for everyone
it's just Safari by the way you can use
something very similar for video for
everyone I think there's an audio for
everybody let's check this out audio for
everybody and here it is audio for
everybody a flash fallback for older
versions of Internet Explorer it looks
like it uses windows media player for IE
seven and eight flash for ie6 all sorts
of different fallbacks going on here
flash for older versions of Safari and
PC but yeah check out audio for
everybody here I'll post a link in the
video and that's how you did it working
on older browsers just like we did with
the video for everybody this is html5
audio and it's very most basic and in
later videos we'll go about creating can
your own custom controls and stuff like
that but just not quite yet so as always
this is sky with level up tuts
if you have any questions are kind
- please leave a comment in the video or
hit us up at Twitter or level up Tut's
he knows every Facebook or via our
website pretty much anywhere so thanks
