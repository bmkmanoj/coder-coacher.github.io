up tents and today I'm going to show you
how to use the log to learn how to start
this to really get a head on how your
program is working and you can use the
log to debug you can use the log to set
warning messages all sorts of stuff but
for this very first example we're gonna
keep it really simple I'm going to show
you the log in action and then we'll
take it on to a little bit more in just
a little bit so the first thing we want
to do is we want this log we want there
to be some sort of message when we click
the button and before we have this toast
message it says you know button click
works but we don't want to use that
because that's going to output to the
user on the screen what we want is we
want this message to only show up in
logcat here which is down here and this
message we can set all sorts of
different types of log messages from
error messages to you know warning
messages there's even a WTF category so
you know you can use these love messages
to really you know have a good grasp on
how everything's working so we're gonna
do a really basic log here we're just
going to use the debug type first and to
do that all you have to do is type log
and then dot d and you'll notice in our
code hinting the second option here this
is what we're going to want to use this
is sends a debug log message and you'll
notice there's two parameters it's a tag
and a message the tag sort of tags it
which is customary to use your activity
so of course we're gonna have this be
the main activity and for the message
this is whatever the message you would
like in the lock so if I hit enter I'm
gonna type in quotes here main activity
because that's the name of our our
current activity that we're on if we're
on let's say a different page or a
different activity you'd probably want
to just use it like that in fact in the
next video I'm gonna show you a way to
just automatically grab the current
activity to have in here but not right
now so I'm gonna delete this message
here and I'm gonna say button clicked so
every time we press this button it's
going to fire off a button
log message finished off with a
semicolon and if we come up here you'll
notice it's saying that we can a little
exclamation point because we're not
using this toast anymore so we can go
ahead and delete that actually I take
that back
I'm gonna leave it in here just in case
we ever do decide to use it again and
you'll notice it actually did add this
import log for me however if you don't
have that there and you're getting that
red squiggly line here it's gonna maybe
give you an option to import two
different types of logs one is not
androids Locke and one is androids like
so select the one that says Android and
it you should have no problems with that
cool so let's save this and let's run
our app now I already have my emulator
running if you need to start your
emulator please do that and I'll just
start move the app up here okay so
here's our app if you'll notice this log
is sort of going crazy down here it has
you know eight thousand and Counting
there's a new log message every second
or something and that isn't normal in
fact from the research that I've done
this is just a bug in the current
version I'm running and so I'm gonna
have to update very soon and get that
taken care of because it's really
obnoxious but watch when I click this
button you'll see that flash of blue
that is our our log message and so okay
the button all these times and this log
message is already really crowded down
here I mean it would be to maybe even
crowded without this error message
popping up over and over again but
you'll notice ready to here there's a
drop down and what we can do is we can
go down and select debug because debug
is the type of error message we or the
type of log message we had if we had
info or warned or whatever we could also
filter by those but let's click debug
and so because of this stupid log
message it's coming up all the time we
can't really see the ones that I want to
see but you can also search for them by
the message itself since our message was
button clicked if I type B you're going
to see it's already starting to search
or filter these and some of these must
have the word button in them however our
message here but
clicked is showing up every single time
we clicked it fact if we come to our app
and we cleat clicking it you'll see the
log start to fill up so that's really
great and this is a nice ways that we
can check to make sure this button is
working so let's say we started this
application we push the button and it's
not doing anything well we don't know
where the problem lies is the problem in
the code that made the button click or
is the problem in the code that is what
happens after the button is clicked by
having this message say that the button
is clicked in here every time we click
it we know that it's at least getting
this far and then the problem must be
somewhere below that so that is just a
quick guide to the log in the next video
I'm going to show you some more cool
stuff with the log and we're gonna try
out different types of log messages as
always if you have any questions please
leave a comment the video or hit us up
at Twitter or level of tuts this is
scott and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
