level up Tut's today were gonna expand
on our expression engine knowledge in
the last video we started the expression
engine channel entries tag and in this
video is gonna be a quick one we're just
gonna cover the disable parameter that's
one that I did not cover in the last
video that I really should and what the
disable parameter looks like is like
just like this actually so you type
disable equals and then the function
that you want to turn off and so the way
that this works is expression engine
whenever you decide that you want to
output entries it will run through each
one of these aspects of this expression
core functionality so if you are able in
your output to exclude some of these
functions what will end up happening is
expressions you can just skip these
aspects of the site and the bonus to
doing this or the reason why you'd want
to do this is it has to do less work and
therefore your site loads faster so what
I'm going to do is I'm gonna turn off
just both these I'm gonna just turn off
everything even though in reality we we
actually do want these custom fields but
I'm just gonna leave it as is right now
though again if you want to keep
something you just can keep it that way
and also notice that again this is a
multi value parameter to Haag so you
know we can just pipe delimit them so
anyway we're disabling this and hit
update and now what we need to do is
actually I were to go refresh the page
that's that's fine and you just have to
but you have to just take my word for it
but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
enable template debugging so I'm gonna
go into the admin and go under system
administration output in debugging and
actually I think I may have
still from earlier I do so display
template debugging is set to yes so if
we go back to this homepage I'll go
ahead and refresh and we now have four
super administrative users only if I was
logged out I wouldn't see this but for
super administrator users only we see
this block on the bottom of the on the
bottom footer of our template and what
it does is it basically tells you what's
going on here and on the very bottom it
tells you sort of what memory was used
to draw this page so so here we're
seeing you know ten million bytes but if
I go back to that template to the
template manager
and just remove this parameter all
together and then rerun that or refresh
that page we see 11 million bytes so I
mean this is bytes but also I mean look
at this page is there there's hardly
anything here and we're already seeing a
pretty nice savings so that is a
parameter that you're going to want to
use pretty much any time you run channel
and trees tag and again over what I
typically do you know is if I'm not
using categories I'm almost always using
custom fields so typically an output
might look like this so I'll just put
that down here and what update and
that's where we're gonna leave it off
