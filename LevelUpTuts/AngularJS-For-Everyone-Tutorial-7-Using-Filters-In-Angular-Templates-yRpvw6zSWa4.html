up tutorials and today we're gonna talk
a lot about filters in angular now if
you remember we used the filter before
when we use this pipe filter search on
our ng-repeat so if there's gonna be
more than just filtering a list of
objects or anything like that we can
actually use filters to modify the way
that a data is output right so we have
item name here well one thing we can do
here is we can say pipe just like we had
with a pipe filter search we can
actually say something like lower case
and if you come back to our page and
refresh notice that all of the text is
output in lower case and likewise we can
also say upper case if you can spell
correctly okay
and we refresh everything's getting
output in upper case right so what kind
of filters are available here obviously
we don't we can change this text to
upper case or lower case with CSS but
maybe there's an instance where you
wouldn't want that for instance maybe
you were having a class if we just had
class over here and you wanted this
class to be the output of a specific
value in this instance I'll just have it
be the name because it's all the data
we're working with but perhaps you have
some text here in that text isn't
necessarily let me put this in a
separate line so you can see it and the
text here isn't necessarily what you'd
want to have as a class name for
instance if we refresh this and inspect
this list item you can see the class has
an upper name of an upper case been
upper case B and been uppercase C
whatever the first letter is upper case
because that's how we want it to be
displayed normally but as a class you
might not want it to be displayed like
that in fact you might even want it to
be something like person - save refresh
and and of course you want your class to
be an all lowercase so in that instance
we
say pipe lowercase refresh and now you
can see that we have up here and our
ng-repeat it's class person - Ben
all in lowercase just like how we would
want it as a class name so this is just
a small example just to get your brain
working but we we can add these pipe and
then filters to do more than just a
filtering like I said there's even
something called currency so if we let's
just do this on edge because it's a
number we can say pipe currency like so
come back to our page refresh and now
everything is output in dollar values
now what kind of things can you do to
modify this well this is in the angular
documentation I'll post a link to the
filters documentation on their site but
as you can see we can modify this
currency so it's not just currency we
can actually determine what type of
currency it is by saying : and then the
next thing we're going to have here is
quotes now this is going to be the
actual symbol that we're going to be
using if we want to use the Japanese
symbol for yen or and depending on which
pronunciation you'd like to use and then
we can go ahead and say something like
we don't want any decimals after this so
to do that you have another colon and
that will give you the ability to
specify how many decimals are listed
afterwards so if we say zero that's
going to be the zero decimals are listed
afterwards and it's using the n sign or
the yen sign and as you can see we're
getting the yen sign the yen symbol
correctly however it's coming this this
weird character here I think I probably
use the HTML entity instead of the
character here so maybe put that in here
it's just ampersand ye-in and then
semicolon a free refresh you'll see that
weird symbol sort of gone so we now are
able to have a different currency here
using this currency filter but we didn't
have to type this symbol every single
time and it gets added to our data as we
need it so other filters available our
number which formats a number is text
date which formats a date to a string
based on the requested format you can
read about that in the documentation
that I posted in the comments
JSON which converts a JSON object
to a JSON string lowercase like we had
uppercase limit to basically allows a
limit right so if we put that on to our
filter search here and this will show
you how to add multiple filters we do
that simply just by adding another pipe
we can say limit to and then we can pass
the same number by simply saying colon
and then a number so while we have a
four names in our list if we say limit
to three and then come back here it's
not going to give us the first three now
first three you might be wondering based
on what well if you look at the names we
have Scott Rosson been come back to our
HTML Scott Rosson been in that order but
let's say we want to have them ordered
by a certain way well we can do that
with filters as well so we had it in our
HTML limit to three but we want to have
the three youngest so if we have another
pipe we can say order by and now order
by is expecting a string so we're gonna
say colon and then a single quotes and
then inside of our single quotes now
inside of our single quotes we can
simply just put age we don't really need
anything out of that we can say order
this by the age and so now if we come
back to our now if we come back to our
page and refresh you'll notice that we
have Scott then Ross then then and if we
add a minus sign in front of age like so
you'll see that we're gonna get the
reverse order of that saying 32 31 and
29 but what you're noticing here is that
the forth name on the list
Courtney is still missing but we want to
keep this list at 3 but we want it to
sort by age first so one thing we can do
is change the order of these right so we
had order by let me actually put this on
it's on line here and then limit 3 like
that what we can actually do is just
swap these two leave that quote sign
there okay I'm gonna get rid of that now
let's go ahead and put this order by age
and the spot that we want it so now it's
going to sort
by age and then it's gonna limit them to
three and as you'll see and we want to
remove this negative sign here so we can
say age now when we refresh because it's
applying the sort first then it's
applying the filter of the limit we now
get Scott Courtney and Ross just because
we changed that order so these are all
of the filters that are available but if
that doesn't seem like enough for you
you can write your own filters in fact
we're gonna go over how to write our own
filters not in the next video but soon
because writing your own folders is
extremely powerful to accomplish all
sorts of things and it's not hard once
you know the basics so no you should be
pretty experienced at what you can
accomplish with the built-in filters and
if you're not you can head over to the
angular page I'm gonna link in the in
the description of this video and you
can check it out there it's going to
show you all the parameters that you're
able to access for every single one of
these filters awesome so as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video hit us up at twitter
or facebook at level up tutorials we'd
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
