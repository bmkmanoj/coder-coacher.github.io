of tutorials and now that we have our
app working we have our lock-in setup
what we want to do is start making our
site more secure now when meteor ships
and you first install meteor there's a
couple of packages that aren't great for
security but are great for getting
started really quickly one of those
packages is insecure
now insecure allows for some actions
like creating a new resolution to be
done from the front end code however we
want a little bit more control over
these so what we're going to be doing is
removing the package insecure and then
showing you what to do next so that your
code is not only secure but works well
and is reusable so check it out we're
going to get going on that right now
so the first thing we want to do is go
ahead and remove this package that's
insecure now we've added packages before
so removing packages should be just as
easy we just need to type in meteor and
then remove and then the name of the
package and this package comes by
default in meteor so you didn't have to
install it to have it you automatically
have it when you create a project so we
can say insecure like this so meteor
remove insecure and it's going to go
ahead and remove this package for us now
what you'll notice is that our
application if we come back to Chrome
here do that.you refresh our application
works fine however there are some things
that just don't when we click one of our
check boxes you'll notice it's not
persisting it doesn't want to hold that
check again if we add a new resolution
it sort of acts like it does something
but nothing happens and if you open your
developer council you'll see we're
getting update failed access denied
insert failed access denied
what we're doing is preventing users
from accessing methods for our database
that we don't want them to access so by
doing that we're essentially sort of
cutting off that front end back end
connection so how do we bring this back
into our project well it's actually
really really super easy what we need to
do is great methods that have access to
the day
a base that will do our insert and our
update and our delete for us and then we
can call those methods from the
client-side code and that way it sort of
adds a little bit of code but then you
can call those inserts and call those
updates from anywhere in any part of
your client code and it makes it nice
and reusable but it also makes it secure
so that you can't go ahead and just call
this insert function from the council
and it prevents us a user from
essentially opening up their JavaScript
console and then typing in resolutions
dead insert and being able to actually
have that work so let's go ahead and
check out our code now so before we have
this meteor is client and where we had
our events we said resolutions dot
insert so let's go ahead and we're going
to copy this resolutions dot insert I'm
not going to delete it yet I'm just
going to copy it
so let's come down to the very bottom
here and I'm not even actually going to
go below the is server part and just add
some new lines and we want to start
typing is meteor dot methods and this is
basically sub methods that are our
application we'll have access to on the
client side these are some methods that
the application will have access to in
the client side and we'll be able to
block things like based on a user ID
basically want to make sure users logged
in before they can add a new post or
else it's going to get denied so let's
go ahead and add a new method inside of
here and just like any other JavaScript
object we just do add the name of our
key so this is going to be add
resolution make sure I spell that
correctly okay add resolution is the key
values so we have colon and the value is
just going to be a function and inside
of this function is what is going to be
passed into this add resolution
so two for that to make sense let's fill
out the rest of the function really
quick and I'm going to paste in the
resolution insert that we had here
before so let's take a look at this
right here we have resolution dot insert
and the only thing it's asking for is a
title right because created ad is going
to be a new date so the only thing that
needs to get passed into this function
and this method here is going to be the
title so we can just say title now when
we call this EDD resolution method we're
going to ascend the title it's going to
hit this function and it's going to use
that title in our insert here so while
the code for the insert has actually
stayed the same the context has been
different we're calling inside of
another method that we're having to pass
in the values to okay so now that we
have this method here we need to
actually call this method instead of
adding the insert in our client-side
code so let's scroll back up to our
client-side code where it says
resolutions insert so instead of having
this block now so instead of having this
resolution dot insert here we want to
use a method called call so we can say
meteor dot call and this is going to
call one of our our methods right one of
our meteor methods so inside of quotes
we want to pass in the name of the
method since I don't want to mess up any
sort of spelling I'm just going to copy
this address Aleutians title I'm going
to paste that in right here and now
we're going to have a comma and this
comma is going to be the value that
we're passing in to this function so if
you remember we wanted to pass in the
title we have this variable title that's
grabbing the event target to title value
so we can just say add resolution in
quotes comma title now this is going to
do is it's going to hit this add
resolutions it's going to pass in title
so it's going to come essentially down
here it's going to run this function
it's going to insert a new title with
the created add new date and then it's
going to come back here so that the
event
two-nothing and return false okay so
let's save that now if we come to an
application and we want to add a new
resolution we can say new enter and you
can see it's working again now if we try
to do something where we were updating
these by checking these boxes you almost
we still get this update failed so we
now have our resolutions working we can
add a new resolution but our update and
delete no longer works so in the next
video we're going to take care of our
update and delete methods using this
same pattern so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions leave a comment the video or
hit us up at Twitter or Facebook add
level of touch we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
