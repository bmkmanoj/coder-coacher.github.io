what is Wednesday is talk about graph QL
again but this time we're going to be
talking about Apollo so this video is
what is Apollo and at the point of this
video is to not only teach you a little
bit about what Apollo is but how it
relates to graph q well no I definitely
mentioned Apollo in the last what is
Wednesday and I wanted to continue on
that considering all of the new Apollo
content on this channel so I want to
make it very clear you know what Apollo
is and how it relates okay so if you
don't know what graph QL is already go
ahead and watch last week's what is
Wednesday and the what is playlist it'll
tell you all about graph QL because of
that I'm going to assume that you know
what graph QL is okay so with the
understanding that Garth QL is a new
kind of query language and just a
specification then that should reveal to
you that Apollo is the implementation of
that specification as in the graph QL
specification was made and Apollo is the
actual code that you could use to use
graph QL now there's quite a bit more to
it than that because Apollo is pretty
darn awesome and not only that but
there's other graph QL implementations
as well such as relay so if you want to
use graph QL you're not stuck with
Apollo and Apollo is not in any sort of
way associated with Facebook who created
graph QL right so Apollo is a nice way
to use graph QL in your applications
today now how can you use Apollo well if
you would have been watching the full
stack graph QL series on this you can
see that we use Apollo on the full stack
as in we are writing Apollo code on the
back end we're writing Apollo code on
the front end and between the two it
allows us to use graph QL to query our
data now do you have to use the back end
absolutely not and then many times you
might actually be hitting your API from
somewhere else and in that case you're
only going to be using the client for
Apollo and if you hover over a client
you'll notice that there are lots of
different implementations of Apollo
client such as react and react native
angular view there's this thing called
Apollo link that allows you to
essentially a middleware there's a
native iOS and native Android all of
these things work really well with
Apollo allowing you to use graph QL in
any of those situations if the API
exists now there's all sorts of ways
that you can have an API that already
exist such as graph CMS or graph cool or
something like that so if you just need
to pull from an API you can install
Apollo and have graph QL pulling in your
data in absolutely no time whatsoever
now in addition to that there is the
graph QL server which is the Apollo
server here now this Apollo server is if
you want to write your own Apollo server
what we actually do in the false deck
graph QL series using meteor you can see
that there are servers available for
things like Express happy lambda KOA
just all sorts of great ways that you
can get your graph QL server up and
running if you need to do that like I
mentioned if you want to have a full
stack solution you will have to run your
own server and your own client to use
graph QL
however there's all sorts of other
solutions I've mentioned a second ago
graph CMS and graph cool as a way to to
host your data on a graph QL server
without having to write your own server
so why use Apollo over relay or any of
these other options well this isn't an
advertisement for Apollo it's just the
graph QL implementation I prefer to use
and some of the things I really like
about Apollo are such as the Apollo
engine which gives you real-time
performance tracing so you can see
exactly how your app is performing for
instance I had a query that was taking
maybe 200 milliseconds and I noticed
that that query itself should not have
been taking that long at all so I
wouldn't looked at the
kote and i found a line of code that
could be written without hitting the
database the second time allowing me to
completely reduce that query length by a
huge amount and so with Apollo engine it
gives you the visibility to see that
kind of stuff super easily also another
really cool benefit of paolo is these
sick apollo dev tools which are sort of
reminiscent in some ways of the Redux
dev tools and a little bit where it
gives you a nice interface directly in
your site to query your api you can do
things like let me get tutorials and get
there I think I think their title I
think that's it as you can see here just
like that I tested this query out and
it's giving me all of the tutorials with
all of their titles another cool thing
is that you can see which queries are
being watched you can see mutations that
are being done you can see your current
store these dev tools are one of the
coolest things about Apollo and
definitely a reason to check it out
definitely something really super cool
here another reason I like Apollo is
because there's a server client and all
sorts of client implementation as an I
can learn apollo once and then use it on
react and react native or even like a
native iOS or android if I want or let's
say I want to move my app to angular or
view or something down the line you
don't have to relearn this you can keep
Apollo inside there and so between
Apollo Engine which is a nice little
service different platform benefits of
it and Apollo takes care of all sorts of
performance things like caching for you
and I mentioned before there was a
middleware component called Apollo link
now Apollo link is really cool because
well you can have different middlewares
and they speculate that different
middleware might be like Apollo links
entry that will automatically report
your errors two-century which doesn't
exist quite yet but there's things like
Apollo link state which is essentially a
full-on redux replacement this is your
entire application state allowing you to
query the state of your application in
the exact same way that you'd be
querying from an a
P I in addition there's things like
Apollo link error there's Apollo Apollo
link HTTP there's a persistent caching
link all sorts of really cool stuff to
allow you to extend the functionality of
Apollo ok so I hope this has given you a
better idea of what Apollo is Apollo is
a library of code that you use to
actually write graph QL both from the
client side as well as the server side
but it doesn't necessarily have to be
both now quick note apollo is written by
the meteor developer group so it's
behind the same minds that have
developed meteor you know I'm a big fan
and have been a big fan of meteor for a
long time
the sashko and the devs behind apollo
are absolutely incredible so I have
total faith that Apollo is only going to
keep on improving and improving as
things go on so check it out Apollo
graph QL comm it is the fancy new way to
use graph QL which you may or may not be
able to tell by these past few videos
but I am super high on graph QL I
absolutely love it I've been working in
it for a couple months now and have just
been totally totally infatuated with the
benefits so check it out Apollo graph QL
comm and if you want to learn how to
write Apollo on the front end and back
end check out the full stack graph QL
series that I'm doing right now in
addition the next pro series this is
gonna be a little bit of a spoiler but
the next pro series for level up pro is
coming out this month we'll be using
Apollo in graph QL as well in a really
exciting way I can't wait to talk a
little bit more about that as I get
further along so thanks so much for
watching as always if you want to help
support level up tutorials
head on over to the apollo powered level
up tutorials comm where you can either
become a pro or head on over to the
store and purchase some stuff to help
the creation of free tutorials and free
content on this youtube channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
