JavaScript stuff there's a lot has
changed since a series was released and
a lot of people are wondering about you
know is this stuff gonna work with
various versions of these new things so
what I want to do is take this time to
update our project to not only react 15
but sort of the latest versions of
everything that we need including web
pack and really transform this stuff so
if you haven't gotten started with this
series yet and you want to go ahead and
just follow these examples
we're just editing the package.json file
as well as the web pack file and maybe
just the app dot J's file that should be
it but either way we're gonna get this
project up so it's running with the
latest stuff and you don't have to
struggle through any of that now the
first thing I want to do is I want to
update react to version 15 and now 15 is
no longer in a version where it's zero
point it's actually fifteen point zero
and we can just say point zero like this
and we also need react dumb because when
react I think it was version 14 they got
rid of essentially the react render that
was being used and now we need to react
to dumb to do that so we can say react
dumb at version 15 okay so we have both
of these dependencies now web packs
server I'm going to upgrade and we're
gonna change us to version 14 1.14 okay
web pack will leave at version 12 and we
want to have some other stuff before we
get into babel loader we want bevel
preset es2015
and we want babel preset react so i'm
going to just copy this just so I have
something here that starts with babel
and we could say babel preset es2015 and
then this one we can say babel preset -
react cool super super cool okay now we
can change this preset react version we
can change this to six-point
five and we get changed this es2015 26.6
now we can change this babble loader to
6.2 and then we can change babble core
to 6.7 so as you can see a lots changed
since we last started this project here
super super cool let's go ahead and head
to our command line and run npm install
so at this point in recording a lots
already been done in this application
but if you're just starting from scratch
you might not see some of these files
that I have in here so don't worry too
much about these additional files just
modify what I'm showing you here based
on what's in the first video and that
that should be a-okay and if you haven't
done the first video or the first one of
building this application with webpack
and everything feel free to copy this
package.json dependencies as you see
here and run an NPM install after that's
all good we're gonna start modifying our
webpack configuration file itself okay
we have all of our dependencies now
let's go ahead and head over to our web
pack config dad j s now we had basically
just this app dot j s in here before and
that's all fine however we can clean
this up a little bit like we can have
this just be looking at this string we
don't need an array here because all
we're looking at is we're looking in the
source folder in fjs for the entry now
the output we're going to remain as just
der name and then the file name itself
is going to go ahead and just remain
lowercase F dot J s now module is where
we're going to see some larger changes
so we have test under loaders right here
and test looks the exact same
we're not changing this test at all
we're going to now add and exclude so
we're going to exclude and we're going
to exclude node modules so our node
modules are excluded
okay no we can come of that now we're
going to keep our loader as Babel
however this time we're going to add a
query like this and that query is going
to accept an object which is going to
have a property of presets now if you
remember we added presets in our NPM
packages just a bit ago which we want
es2015 and as a second string we're
going to want to add react like this
super super cool let's go ahead and stop
our dev server if you have yours running
and let's go ahead and run dot forward
slash known modules forward slash bin
forward slash web pack dev server so we
can get our dev server up and running
and as you can see our bundle is now
valid let's head to our actual
application now and give it a refresh
and as you can see we're getting some
stuff about render not being a function
okay so this is what I was talking about
with the react dumb let's head to app
dot j s and well yours may not look like
this and you may not have this already
we have a react render here what we need
is react dumb so let's go ahead and
import render from react immuno we can
just import render itself by using the
curly brackets and importing render from
and then we can grab react - dumb now
down here we can just simply remove the
word react and have render okay let's
head back to our application hit refresh
and boom you should see it up and
running now like I said if you're
modifying this based on the first video
you're not going to see all this you can
successfully continue on to the other
videos just note that this render where
we have our render function here where
we write that is going to be render
rather than react dot render other than
that everything else is the exact same
so now that we have our react
application of the latest versions of
every
we're now ready to continue with this
series so hopefully that cleared up some
issues that people were having with the
latest versions of things and just
everything sort of changing I guess this
is the nature of stuff and video content
sort of hard to keep up to date but as
always this is Scott with little of
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments if a comment the video hit me
up at Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials thanks so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
