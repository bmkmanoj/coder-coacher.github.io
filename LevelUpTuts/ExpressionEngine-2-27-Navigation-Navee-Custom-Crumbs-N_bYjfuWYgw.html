up Tut's thanks for coming back in this
tutorial we are going to visit be the
last tutorial with the covering the
na'vi module and we are covering the
custom breadcrumbs function now and this
is a tag pair just like the na'vi nav
custom pair so let's go ahead and dig
into this a little bit so here we go i'm
going to put this in the snippet so this
was the old one I'm not alike how we are
not showing it on the homepage so I'm
going to go ahead and just get rid of
that zoom in a little bit soulfully you
guys can see this a little bit better so
okay this is a tag pair and so we're
going to say nav know expressionengine
na'vi and the tag for this i believe
custom crumbs and I am gonna pass it the
nav title of main ave if you don't
actually this is this is optional if you
don't it's going to like go through all
your NAB's and try to locate the right
one but i only have one nap so i'm just
gonna go ahead and tell them and so
let's go ahead and close this before we
forget
just like anything else and the other
tag bears is just close / and we're
going to what we're going to do here is
this is gonna be a link again this is
just an expression engine or this is an
a/v on tagged and so we're gonna do the
mink link then we're going to have the
text and we're going to close the link
and well let's just start with that and
see what having some money update and
refresh and Here We Go I'm on I'm on my
page right Ben shaft we've been as a web
developer very true and so right where
this is this is the nav right here or
not the nav but I'm sorry the custom
breadcrumb so we're just seeing oh yeah
I'm inside of a ul we're seeing just to
anchor tag just floating around here so
let's clean this up a little bit so
right was it kind of forgetting a rap
rap type is none by default to you well
that's why we saw that there so wrap
type were to say none and then let's
just update that and see how we do
cool so now we just have to anchor tag
just floating out here that's better I
mean they could be a list item if you
want or not and not it sort of depends
like sometimes it's just easier to do
something like this like maybe maybe
it's a paragraph for something that has
an idea of I mean you know do whatever
do whatever you want but I mean it sort
of is a nav in a way so maybe you want
to wrap it in a nav tag I'm not really
sure what the what the best way is so
you know fortunately for us this module
is really customizable and you can
output any way you want so now this is
going to be wrapping a P tag just a
couple of anchors and that's fine but
still this is not really the odd set up
you know this is actually no different
than what it was just a second ago so
let's do this let's take this to the
next level here and what you can do is
I'm going to have a spacer between my
tags so I'm just gonna have to actually
be a right arrow quote which yeah Pete
if you're on a Mac this is just a n
htmlentities widget that you could pick
up you're not you'll feel upset to learn
what what these I always forget ah ok I
had it backwards earlier alright so now
let's check this out oh oops if i
refresh actually we're not going to see
any different because I actually didn't
tell where to put the spacer so we're
gonna what about space for right ok
update
refresh cool so this is starting to look
like a breadcrumb but maybe it should
have a you should have us you know like
a space before and maybe a space after
well you know what it looks like it
might trim the leading space that's ok
so this solar could just be patting on
this right so we're not we're not going
to spend that too much but what is ugly
about this and something that we are
going to fix up is we don't really want
this right arrow quote after the last
one and because the guys that buoyant
are so freakin smart we can they have a
tag that we can pass it so we're just
going to do that and this is called like
no last spacer I think Amber's instead
of true let's try this I'm good good I
don't remember um yeah cool all right
there you go so we have a no you know
right arrow afterwards so this looks
like a nav that is ready for some CSS or
not sorry man breadcrumb that's ready
from cert for some CSS and you know
that's all we're going to do for today
so we have the about it it's the last
one so it doesn't have you know the
arrows if you want you know you could
you could obviously because you can put
anything you want before this you could
have like you are here
yeah you are here about your here there
you go cool so there you have it
breadcrumbs using na'vi using navvies
custom crumbs tag bear thanks a lot for
watching in the next tutorial why i'm
not really sure what we're going to
cover but I'm sure I'll think of
something and it's gonna be great so
