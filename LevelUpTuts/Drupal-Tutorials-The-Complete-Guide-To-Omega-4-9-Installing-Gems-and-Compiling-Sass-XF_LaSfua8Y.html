up Tut's and today we're going to pick
up where we left off and we're going to
finish setting up our environment so
it's ready to use all of the features in
omega 4 and so now we're going to start
off in the theme directory for our
current working theme so if you do a in
terminal on your command mind if you do
LS you should be seeing all this stuff
that's in your base theme so your SAS
folder your CSS folder all of this stuff
right so typically the work processes is
that you would come into this folder and
then you'd run the command drush and
then space omega - guard just like that
and then enter and it's going to ask you
which theme you want to run guard for so
we're going to hit 1 because that's our
theme that we're using the level up
omega and it's going to give you an
error well it's not going to give you an
error usually but this particular time
it's going to give you an error because
we don't have the gems that we need and
if you recall if you look at your
sublime text folder we have this gem
file and this lists a whole bunch of
stuff including sass SS globbing compass
compass validator compass normalize
Suzy's singularity a whole bunch of
these gems and these gems are
essentially little programs that run in
Ruby that help us do things right like
sass is going to compile your sass in
the CSS sass globbing well what that
does is it looks into folders and finds
any single partial file and compiles it
into a sass file which compiles it into
your CSS which might not abstractly make
a lot of sense but when you see it in
action you'll realize how excellent it
is and so we of course need these gems
before we can really do anything and
that's exactly what this command is
telling us here it's a install missing
Jem's with bundled install and keep in
mind you have to you might have to run
these with sudo depending on your access
and so I'm going to run sudo bundle
install and of course ask me for my
password I'm going to enter it and it
should be getting the the gems that we
need okay
and after a couple minutes or depending
on how many of these you already have
it's going to go and install every
single thing that's in our gem file with
whatever version is either specified or
the latest version since there's no
version specified for most of these it's
not going to really be version specific
so we'll grab the latest ones so let's
come back to our command line and it
says bundles complete so now we should
be ready to go it's installed the gems
it since we have Ruby installed we have
our VM installed with our command line
tools installed pretty much everything's
leading up to this point where we can
now once again type and rush Omega guard
pick our theme that we're going to be
using and it's going to tell us that
it's watching our files so compilation
that says took a two point nine five
seconds and it's watching our files live
reload is waiting for your browser to
connect and guard is now watching at
sites all themes level up Omega so to
prove to you that this is doing
something of importance let's go to a
sublime text and let's go to our SAS
folder and then inside of here we're
just going to go to styles dot CSS and
you see all these import statements
we're going to go over exactly what all
of these imports are doing in the next
video but for now let's just type body
and then inside of our CSS statement
here we can say let's do background and
then once again actually let's use
something different than we used before
let's just say background red now if we
come back to our terminal you can see
that Omega haxe has remained unchanged
no query has actually been overwritten
and normalize is identical and level up
Omega that styles that CSS has been
overwritten and so this is because it's
detected that we saved our staffs file
and whenever we save our SAS files any
of our SAS files guard is going to
update so once again let's save this
file without making any changes we save
it let's come back to guard and you'll
see that they're identical now it
doesn't say they've overwritten they're
just identical so it's not going to do
anything and it's going to say it's
going to be reloading the browser I
don't know if we have live reload
checked but we're going to go over how
to do that too as well so what does this
mean
let's come to our CSS folder here and if
you recall before we'd actually hand
typed a background blue and now if we
come here you can see that it's added
some debugging information which of
which you can just ignore it's not going
to affect the output of these styles in
fact we can even turn that off in later
tutorials I'll show you how to put this
into production mode so it's going to
minify this CSS but for now you'll see
that this body background is red as well
as if we come to our actual page and i
refresh the body backgrounds red now
let's come back to our sass file and
let's just change it to green just for
fun come back to our page and we can
actually looks like live reload is on
and you can see that without even
refreshing the page I just turn this to
green and once more for fun we can do
purple save and now I'm just going to
wait a second while this compiles and
then it just automatically turns it to
purple without me doing anything and
it's live reliving because I have that
box checked also I should I should
mention that if you have inspect element
open and Chrome it could crash your
browser or at least crash that tab so if
you're using the live reload
I'm Chrome just make sure your inspect
element isn't open otherwise just use
Safari because their inspect tools are
pretty similar it may have seemed
difficult it may have seemed out there
but now we're in a workflow that is
going to be totally normal and in fact
if you've noticed when I typed this sass
code it's really just CSS in fact this
looks the exact same as if we were to
type the CSS the only thing that's
different is we have these funky import
statements and we have some interesting
things we can do in fact things get
really interesting and really fun two
ways that you're going to be working on
things if you've never used some of
these tools and it's going to feel just
so intuitive and just just really nice
and easy so as always this is Scott with
level of Tut's if you have any questions
or comments leave a comment a video
hit us up at Twitter at level of Tut's
let us know what you're thinking we love
to hear from you in the next video we're
going to talk about the structure of the
SAS code in this project and how you
should be modifying and writing your
styles and then from there we're going
to talk about some of the extensions
that come and then we're going to get
into the grid framework which is
extremely powerful but at the same time
not hard to wrap your brain around so
thanks for watching keep watching we're
going to have lots more videos more this
week lots of stuff so as always this is
Scott Solinsky with level up Tut's
