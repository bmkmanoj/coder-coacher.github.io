up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how you could install Emmet on sublime
text do have lightning fast HTML and CSS
although I do use hayaku for CSS I know
a lot of people really enjoy Emmet I
just found a yaku to have the fuzzy
abbreviations are really nice in that
however I would say there is nothing
better than Emmet for HTML so to get
Emmet
it's nice and simple as always we're
going to do command shift P and then
type in package and let's find a install
package and now we're going to look for
in it now that's e mm ET here we have it
now with Emmet we just have to wait and
it's going to tell you to restart the
editor so I'm going to go ahead and a
quit sublime and then restart it okay
sublime text is back and Emmett is here
you'll see there's a little bit of
documentation here you can read and it
tells you that you can go to na tayo for
documentation and examples since I'm not
going to give a full tutorial here on
Emmet itself I would highly recommend
you go to Emmet I oh and you read it
because there is lots of stuff and the
more that you know the faster you'll be
able to write some code and do some
really great things instead of having to
do all this stuff by hand so let's go to
an HTML document and let's just try it
out here so if we want to have a div all
you have to do is type period and then
hit tab and then that's going to open us
a div with just having a class here if
we didn't want a class we could even
just type div just like that but sublime
text does that normally so we can also
say a period and then a class name such
as a content box then hit tab and it's
going to fill in that that uh that for
us now if we wanted to recreate this
content area lorem ipsum thing we have
going on here let's actually just delete
that
and you'll see that I can do dot content
area and then I have a greater than sign
and then I'll say P and then another
greater than sign and then say lorem so
what this is saying is that I have a div
content area and then this symbol is
used to say inside of that I then have a
paragraph and then inside of that
paragraph I didn't have some lorem ipsum
text
I had tab and here we have it and look
at how much that generated before when
we did this in another video it actually
took up me a little while ID to go copy
and paste the lorem ipsum text from a
website I had to write this div I had to
write these P tags and everything like
that but this was incredibly simple not
to mention if I wanted to make these
three of these for some reason all I
would have to do is asterisk three here
at the content area hit tab once more
and now I have three of them or as many
as I would like so you can see just how
fast Emmet allows you to do things and
like I said please check out Emmet da I
Oh to really get a full grasp on all of
the things that makes your life easier
we can even actually I'm just going to
give a couple more examples here if you
wanted to have like a two paragraphs
next to each other you could say P plus
P and then maybe inside of the second
paragraph you have we could just say
like a span so now if we have it here we
have two paragraphs a span and inside of
the other paragraph and that's pretty
sweet
so the greater than sign is going to say
inside of the plus is going to say next
to and that's pretty much all I feel
like I need to go over basically what
you're seeing here is just Emmet letting
you type things so fast and fill it out
for you I mean how many times if you
wanted to make a list let's say you you
know you have like five items in your
owner unordered list so maybe you're
building a navigation or something and
you could just type UL greater than li
times six
tab there you go or even better yet you
could have another greater than put an
anchor in there and then now you have
five or six list items with anchors
already in them and it took you like one
second so this is awesome I use Emmet
pretty much all the time any time I'm
writing HTML it's unlikely that I'm
typing out all of these elements
individually and so on you know so check
it out Emma died oh I'll paste a link in
the video description if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment on
the video it is up at Twitter level up
Tut's
let us know what you're thinking we love
to hear from you we always try to
respond as much as we can but of course
there's lots of comments and we can't
always get to all of them so if you
wanna if you want to reach out to us you
can do so on Facebook Twitter or on the
level up form which I'll also post into
the description of this video so thanks
for watching and once again this is
Scott with level up Tut's
