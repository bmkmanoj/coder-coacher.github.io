tutorials and in this video we're gonna
get started by creating our app we're
gonna be doing so with meteor create and
we're gonna create a bear application
talk a little bit about lo the this sort
of startup if at all and we're gonna get
going so if you already know a little
bit about the bare bones of meteor and
you don't need to get started go ahead
and skip to the fourth video in this
series you can just grab the code from
the github in the description and that's
already set up with meteor and react and
we start to get into the Apollo and
graph QL stuff so if you're not
interested in this sort of meteor or the
application setup hearts skip ahead to
video number four if not continue
watching as we get our applications
started okay so we are going to get
started building a full stack app with
meteor apollo react and in turn MongoDB
because of that because it's the
database built in here now before we get
started I want to make this very clear
you do not need to know anything about
meteor before getting started here so if
that is your barrier just ignored you
just want to have two meteor calm click
Install Now and we're going to copy this
whole curl install meteor you can head
to your command line paste this in just
hit enter and let it install meteor on
your computer and most everything else
in meteor other than this curl install
script has done through NPM nowadays so
don't feel like meteor is going to be
totally weird for you it's essentially
meteor is going to just take care of a
node server for us and it's going to
take care of the build process and the
account system and getting up and
started with a database you can see it's
removing my existing meteor installation
which is which is fine for me if you do
not have meteor installed already this
will just install without removing but
we're gonna let this hang out and
install like I said this is going to
provide us with a node.js server very
similar to any sort of node server that
you're going to start up on yourself
okay so I have meteor installed now and
what we want to do is just create a bare
meteor app you might be wondering what's
up with that well typically meteor comes
with a bunch of
stuff whether it's things for having its
system with the Auto tracker an auto
publish and stuff like that for
WebSockets that automatically pull from
the database and stuff and you might be
wondering what's up at that well it's
basically meteor with less packages its
packages that you don't need like less
or a router or blaze or publication
collector insecure there's a whole bunch
of packages that come with meteor by
default that you don't really need on a
lot of projects so bear is going to give
you a bear install that's maybe a little
less functional but definitely more
along the lines what we're looking for
today so we're gonna do meteor create
and this will just be Apollo ok and
we're gonna pass this with a parameter
which is - - bear ok and like I said
this is going to give us the bear
version of meteor not going to include a
bunch of stuff we don't need especially
because we're trying to keep our bundle
size down and make something nice fast
performing all that stuff ok so this is
just going to go ahead and create an app
for us again if you haven't used meteor
before all this is doing is installing
some files and getting our project set
up and we'll go over the file structure
in a minute here as we get started and
start adding some packages that we'll
need ok so we can CD and to Apollo and
we could just type the meteor command ok
meteor is just a command that starts up
the server and downloads all their
packages and and basically is our build
tool here the build tool for meteor is
called I believe I so build and you
don't really have to worry about it's
one of my favorite parts about using a
system like meteor ok so as you can see
we got some download stuff working and
let's go ahead and open up this project
in our text editor okay so I'm going to
hope that these sizes are all good here
kind of bumped everything up a little
bit even more so than usual so we can
see if you want to know about my text
editor setup I'm using vs code with a
handful of extensions but nothing really
crazy that we're going to be using here
other than maybe prettier and eeeh Slynt
that sort of stuff but for the most part
basically this theme is called level up
LevelUp official I believe you've just
Google for level up this theme comes up
it's my own personal theme and I like it
a lot so that said let's take a look a
bit of what we got with meteor install
bear because well it's bear there's no
files here and if you didn't know any
better you wouldn't really know where to
even start
and so obviously because of that when we
fire up our build process here and it
says our app is running at localhost
port 3000 if we were to go to localhost
port 3000 here you're gonna get a
totally blank screen if you inspect
we're gonna have totally blank
everything we have a body with sort of
nothing in it well here's a handful of
packages but essentially nothing in it
and let's check this out here how do we
actually get started and what is here we
have a node modules folder which is to
be expected we have a vs code folder
which kind of just made itself because
of vs code and we have a meteor folder
now inside of meteor if you're not
familiar is another file called packages
and packages is going to be all of our
packages if you modify this file then
the meteor system will automatically
remove some of these packages for
instance we don't need this reactive
variable package reactive var we don't
need it we can just delete it save this
and watch as the meteors build tool will
recognize that we have just removed it
and it's going to uninstall the package
for us so again that's some of the
things I like about meteor the build
tool you don't have to worry about it at
all
okay so we've removed reactive var
that's the only thing I'm gonna move or
remove right now so let's actually get
started adding some real information
here if you'll notice we have a basic
HTML file that just has an empty head
and well an empty body with some scripts
we can go ahead and change that by
actually having an index.html file and
that we can just do that simply by
heading to begin vs code and our route
of our project we can just create a new
file
I'm sorry not within the meteor
directory we'll just so at the root of
our file we'll just call this index.html
if we weren't using meteor bear this
would all be done for us but instead of
here we don't really need a whole lot we
can have a basic a head tag which
honestly isn't gonna have anything in it
right now we'd have a body tag and
instead of our body tag I'm just going
to add a div with an ID of app okay
if you're wondering how I'm getting this
auto-completion it's a package called
Emmet if you're not familiar with Emmet
you should teach yourself it's really
excellent package you shouldn't find out
about it it's really good actually
I'll add a title into our head just so
it's not blank level up Apollo okay
basic HTML file and without doing a
whole lot we should see our build tool
refresh we should see our page here
hopefully inside of here we do we have a
div with an ID of app okay so we didn't
have to do anything for meteor to
recognize this index page it just sort
of nose automatically it's sitting at
the root of our project here now the
next thing we want to do is create a new
folder at the root of our project called
imports okay
imports is where all your stuff is going
to live and in the future of meteor this
imports file might be going away but
right now any sort of file that you put
in the root directory of your app gets
automatically compiled client or server
based which is really really cool for
small packages and small projects and
prototyping but when you get into
anything where you need organization and
imports and exports you want to use this
import folder it's essentially just like
an app folder right inside of here is
where our app lives and we can create
several folders inside of our imports
folder like I'm gonna create a folder
called UI I'm gonna create another
folder not a non inside of UI but inside
of imports and this is going to be named
API and I'm gonna create one more folder
again not inside of that folder I don't
know IV s code wants to do that I may
select imports I should keep doing this
okay inside of imports we are gonna have
three folders API UI and we're gonna
have one called startup now it'd be
better to do these folder creation
inside
of finder maybe I'm gonna click reveal
in finder and might be a little bit
faster for creating the whole bunch of
folders so we have our imports folder
API startup UI inside of startup we're
gonna have two new folders client-server
ok all of the stuff in client is going
to be our client side out stuff and
server is going to be our server it's
all the stuff that's gonna run on
startup ok next let's back out of that
and let's back out of that let me head
to the root folder here which is just
where we have all of our stuff we have
imports node modules whatever now inside
of here I'm also gonna create two new
files one of which is client and one of
which is server now the reason we need
to do this is because this is the code
that's going to run be automatically
compiled and since we want meteor system
to sort of ignore everything up the root
except for one file we're just gonna
have one file here that then points to
our import directory and loads up all of
our import stuff ok so let me exit out
of this I'm gonna click refresh inside
of vs code so it has all the latest
stuff but as you can see our project
structure is as follows a client folder
a server folder and imports folder
inside of imports we have API startup UI
inside of startup we have client and
server it's going to serve as the basis
for all of our stuff getting started
here ok so with that I'm actually going
to end this video and in the next video
we're gonna get started with some of our
dependencies which are well to get
started it's going to be react we're
gonna get started with react first we're
going to get a basic view up and running
here and then after react is configured
we are going to get up and running with
Apollo by setting up our Apollo server
connecting it to meteor and then we're
gonna get actually writing some really
basic excellent Apollo code so if you
want to verify this folder structure and
everything we've done so far you can
head to the github repo where this is
and check this out or even just clone
this if you don't feel like creating a
bunch of folders so as always this is
