up Tut's and today we're going to
combine a couple of things that we've
learned in the past few videos so what
we're going to do is we're going to
download and install a plugin that
contains a widget that we can then use
to add some additional functionality to
our site thus proving how exactly
flexible WordPress is through plugins
and widgets so we're gonna go to plugins
and then add new just so we have before
and the plugin we're going to grab is WP
space recent and then views now we
search for this it should be the top one
here and I'm gonna go ahead and click
install now so what this is going to
actually do is display a list of the
pages that you've visited recently now
this time I'm gonna go go ahead and
click activate plug-in from this screen
and our plugins should be there so not
only can we use a like a tag in one of
our posts to display this but it gives
us a new widget that we can find under
appearance widgets so if you remember we
came in here we added our own tag cloud
and stuff like that and now if we scroll
down we should see recent views so this
is our new widget so this was not here
before and we can go ahead and say that
we want this to show up in the primary
sidebar let's click add widget and now
for fun let's just put this at the top
and we can see that if we click on this
it even gives us some options and we're
gonna select this to be Ajax so it
updates I'm not exactly sure I'd have to
look at the documentation to see what
exactly it's doing with Ajax and then
you know we can give it a new title so
recently viewed pages and we can say
yeah leave it at five or you could
extend the number if you wanted to we'll
click Save
okay and this should be safe now that we
come to our page let's give it a refresh
and it says recently view pages there
are we haven't been to any so let's go
ahead and click around the site a little
bit oK we've been to that page now let's
come to the author post - let's come to
about back to home and you can see that
we now have recently viewed pages as our
author post and our test author post now
what you'll notice is that it's not
actually having me about us well we can
solve that by coming into plugins and if
we go to our list of plugins you
remember we have settings so I said
before that you'll notice that a lot of
these have settings right here however
some of them don't some of your plugins
that you're gonna install won't right
and you know that doesn't mean they
don't have additional settings in fact
for this one if we come to our settings
menu over here we not only see our
standard things but we see recent views
in here so that's one thing to a notice
if there's not like a Settings button
there feel free to look around your
admin and it might have added it there
now you'll see that under post types
only posts or check so now if we check
pages and we can save this when we come
to about us it's now added to our
recently viewed pages list so now we've
extended our site further by adding a
plug-in and using the widget that comes
within the plugin to do some things that
WordPress could not do out of the box
and we didn't have to touch code so
that's awesome we now have pretty much
everything we need to create and manage
a a wordpress site and get it theming
and just you know move things around
based on whatever theme you're using so
as always this is Scott with LevelUp
Tut's if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment the
video reach out to us on Facebook or
Twitter or the level up to us forum and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
