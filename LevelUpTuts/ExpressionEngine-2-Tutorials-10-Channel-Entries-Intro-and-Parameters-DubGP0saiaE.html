level up Tut's today we're gonna level
up Aris fresh engine skills this is
tutorial number ten and today we're
going to be covering the expression
engine channels entry stack our website
currently looks like this with the site
name and homepage global variable
defined but that's it the purpose of
this tutorial is to cover outputting
some of our news entries so to do that
what we'll need to do is edit the
templates I already have it open but to
access this you go under the design menu
- templates - template manager on the
left hand side you're gonna see the
template group we only have one option
here so once we select it we will see
its contents which would be all the
templates that belong to that group but
we only have the one called index so
let's go into that one here we're seeing
the site name being outputted - and
homepage the first thing we'll do just
for fun is we will link the site name to
the home page so I'm gonna wrap the
whole thing in an h1 tag so I'm just
doing an h1 tag and href loops linking
to the home page and within this link I
want to put the site name and I'm gonna
close now the link and also close the h1
tag so if I update this as opposed to
hit update and finish update we'll save
it and keep it open update will close
and bring me back to the template
manager so if i refresh this now we're
seeing the site name inside of an h1 and
if I click it it brings me to my home
page okay so that's cool but we're not
really what we want to do is I want to
introduce you to the expression engine
channels entry deck so the expression
channel entry tag is a variable tag so
that means that you need to open and
close it to open it it's expression
engine or exp channel which is the name
of the module entries
and to close it we say XP oops
poor /dx p-channel
entries so what this is telling
expression engine is hey expression
engine I want to use the channel module
and display the entries and this tag can
receive a parameter or many parameters
to influence what is output by the
system so for example if you would like
to limit the entries that are displayed
on your site to just one channel for
example if you would like to only
display your news items what you can do
is you define channel equals and then
the short name of the channel that you
want to display in our case it's news so
this channel field our parameter is
actually it can accept multiple values
so multiple values for parameters are
pipe delimited so if we wanted to output
not just news but maybe news and pages
we could do that what really will all we
want to do is output news because that's
all I have created for this site so far
if you don't remember what your short
name is you go under admin channel
administration channels and you'll right
away be able to see the short name so
I'm just doing it restricted by news
okay so now that we're restricting by
news we can define more parameters so
for example what we can do is we can say
we only want to that's a parameter we
can influence the sort by default the
sort order is descending but if we
wanted to by date entered we want it to
be ascending we would just say sort
equals a
s-see there are actually many parameters
that can be set and this is only just a
few of them to get a full list of the
parameters that can be set I would
direct you to the expression Jin's
documentation for the channel module
this is what we're gonna be using for
right now so the way that this now is
set up is it's going to look at only
news entries grab the first two that
when sorted in the ascending order and
then what is what this really does is
it's going to loop through those two
items and output whatever we have within
the tag pair so if I put the title what
it will do when let's go ahead and hit
so title is one of them is a as a field
that can be outputted so if I hit update
here what we'll see is it's going to run
through that tag twice and the first
time it's going to grab the new story
and the second time it's gonna find the
second story let's make this a little
bit easier to read I'm gonna go ahead
and put this inside of an ordered list
so ordered list wrap this in an L I
close this go ahead and close out that
list and now if I do this again you'll
be able to see a little bit easier so
it's like one two now again it's only
showing two because that's the limit if
I remove the limit
there's actually three in the system
what update go ahead and give this a
refresh and now we're seeing one two and
three so now let's go ahead and I'm
going to remove this sort parameter
alternatively I could just set it back
to the default but if I just remove it
it's it's gonna have the same effect if
I hit update I'm gonna go ahead and
refresh and what we're gonna see is this
being in the opposite order and again by
default the order by
ammeter is set to the one of the item
was entered well I had refresh and now
put it in the opposite order
because again because there are so many
parameters that can be passed is
probably a good idea for you to review
the expression engine documentation well
that said there are a couple that I
wanted to highlight status in an earlier
tutorial we talked about the status of a
entry and by default there's open and
closed and featured so if we were only
interested in something that was marked
as featured what we could say is give me
a status of featured I'm gonna hit
update and refresh and we should see
none because none actually meet that
criteria oops I didn't hit update
and we don't see any here so let's
actually go through and flag one of
those as being featured so I'm gonna say
content that it news got an opening in a
new tab just for convenience sake put
your options status featured submit give
this a read oops go ahead and give this
a refresh and hey there you go
normally seeing that one now say I want
both featured and open items to be
displayed on this list well just like
chant the channel parameter the featured
parameter is can accept multiple values
so we can also pass it say open items
close that one down give it a refresh
and again now all three are back so now
what we're able to do really is
we could have a featured list like that
go ahead and make another one down here
I'm gonna say not featured
and there we go so we're here we're
seeing our featured item and the two
items that are not featured
