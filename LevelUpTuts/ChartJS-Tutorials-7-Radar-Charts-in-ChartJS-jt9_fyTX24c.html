tutorials and in this video we're gonna
be focusing on radar charts in charge a
s let's get started now okay so the next
thing we're gonna talk about is a braid
our chart now oh right our chart is
interesting you probably seen these two
sort of list attributes know these
attributes I don't know if you've ever
played let's say RPGs of any type I mean
even in Pokemon they had these type of
radar graphs so let's go ahead and head
to our code and let's go to just change
this type from bar to radar okay bar to
radar and let's come ahead into our page
and refresh and see what we have and
just like that we have this sort of
interesting looking shape it's a rotated
square so like a diamond here and we
have our values going off in different
directions so where the other graphs are
making more sense to be sort of maybe
chronological how we had two little
labels as dates or something like that
this might make much less sense than
that we have January February April this
might make more sense to be something
like attributes so let's go ahead to our
code and the first thing I want to do is
get rid of this neon green background
color in fact we can change this to RGB
a and we can have this be something like
0 0 comma 2 5 5 comma 0 0 and then come
a 0.1 or something like this and we can
have this transparent green color as our
background color and then neon green is
like filling it up doesn't quite work
for me now let's go ahead and change our
data to also have like a 10 here and
we're going to add another label now
these levels I'm going to make them be
attributes so we can have this be like
strength and this can be skill
this can be health and this can be
speed and this can be something like
luck okay I'm just totally making these
up off the top my head and let's head
back to our page and refresh now what's
cool here is that not only did the shape
change to be a regular pentagon instead
of a square or daimond we now have what
looks really cool because we have this
transparency on the inside our plots are
pointed and this user has let's say 50
in strength 55 and or 55 and health and
speed they have 30 and this is really
cool now if we were to have a second
data set let's go ahead and do that we
can just create a new data set by
copying this inside object inside of
here you can have a comma here and just
go ahead there we go now let's change
just label two points okay and now let's
go ahead and just change some of these
values into that we can do this FF 0 0
let's do 2 5 5 over here okay so we now
have a yellow and a green super cool and
let's go ahead and just change up these
values we can have this be something
like 5 and then let's say 100 and then
I'm going to make these all over the
place
20 and then 70 and then we can do
another one that's 80 so check this out
now we have some new data in here these
are kind of overlay on top of each other
and in second thought yellow was a bad
choice so let's go ahead and turn this
into 2 5 5 this way and then 0 0 FF FF
okay okay I think this is gonna be like
a blue teal refresh way better way
easier to see here and as you see here
not only did our shape adjust to the
points it's like we sort of been doing
this old time but they're overlaid in
the transparency everything makes this
look really super nice not not to
mention the animation than growing out
like
it's one of the reasons why I love this
library it just looks nice all the time
right I mean this chart looks great so
this is the radar chart and as you can
see compared to the bar chart we
literally just changed some of the data
information in fact if we come up here
and just change this radar to bar you'll
be able to see how this looks as a bar
chart and as you can see it's just
adding another column in here the other
bar so again let me just highlight the
flexibility of this library let's say
this data isn't cutting it in this way
like okay this looks great but let's see
what this looks like as a radar okay hey
that illustrates my point way much
better so as you can see we have total
flexibility over our charts this is a
radar chart in chart that j/s again the
code is the exact same we need labels
those labels need to match how many data
we have inside of our data sets rather
than that nothing too crazy here I'll go
ahead and actually get rid of this
Council log while I'm in here but as you
can see radar charts super easy super
cool now in the next video I'm gonna be
talking about a polar area chart which
is a lot like a pie chart but it adds an
entirely new dimension so if you like
this content if you want to see more
chart Jas had to store it our level of
tutorials comm and become a level of pro
or purchase the series you'll get access
to extra content including some default
configuration options that are gonna
make some really beautiful looking
charts for you so as always this is
Scott with a little tutorials if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video hanging up at Twitter
or Facebook and level up tutorials I
love to hear from you thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
