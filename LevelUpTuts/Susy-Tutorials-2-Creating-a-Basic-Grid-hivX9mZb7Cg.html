up tides and today we're going to be
talking about Susy and building a basic
grid now keep in mind this is Susie
version two so if you are not on version
2 make sure you do that so you're
following along we did explain that in
the first but just want to clarify that
for this one as well and what we have
here is basic uh just really a basic
HTML site if you look at it here we just
have our main content right here and we
have an aside with a list item and all I
really did was make this list not look
so terrible like a normal dotted list I
mean it doesn't look good now but I
really just added lines underneath so it
maybe looks more like a normal
navigation and it's also going to the
borders underneath they're also going to
help sort of realize how wide this aside
column is so as you can see in the CSS
it's really just these lines here it's
not a whole lot I just you know display
box
block put some padding border bottom
covered of the the margin and padding on
the UL so what we want to do first is we
need to make a container so with any of
these grid systems or anything really
you you need to have your stuff in a
container right because your containers
defining the base width of everything so
thankfully Susie makes a nice really
easy mixin for us that is what you'd
expect
so it's @include and then just container
now in here we can put something like
sixty ms and now sorry the semicolon
goes after like that and now we come
back to our page refresh and you can see
this is taking up 60 ms or we could even
put something like 800 pixels right or
even better we could put 80% if you want
a fluid layout okay so we have 80% here
and this is going to take up 80% no
matter you know nomad
what cool so that's that's great
container accepts a width right and
that's going to set the width of our
container and if you see here we put it
on our body so uh what it's really
giving our body is just a margin left
margin right Auto as well as a max width
of 80% so really nothing crazy or
nothing out of the ordinary now we need
to put our two areas our main content
which is our main and our side in
columns now to do this we don't actually
have to define a grid right I mean we
could we could have global settings
which we're going to go over however all
we have to do to make this sort of basic
grid is I'm going to get some space down
here so we can add some new code down
here and we're going to say main the
main content area and then using a mixin
that is span we're going to define how
much this spans so we're going to say
I'd include span and then now let's say
we wanted this main content area to be
eight of twelve columns so you type
eight space of space 12 and then
semicolon now what this is going to do
is design at the width of whatever eight
of twelve columns would be let's come
here and refresh and you can see our
main content area has now been given a
width of 66 point one zero one percent
and it's floating left and has a margin
right of one point six nine percent
notice how that math goes pretty deep
right I mean the benefit of using a
framework like this is that you don't
have to do that math yourself and
possibly have an error somewhere
rounding or anything basically you just
don't have to have that that you know on
you you can let the software figure out
exactly what the map is so it's more
precise right so now we have our span
eight of 12 but let's say you wanted a
16 column grid it's really as simple as
saying 8 of 16 and no we come here
and this is going to be taking up half
because eight is half of sixteen right
so just like singularity if you watch
those it's taking the percentage that
your column is taking up of the total
container columns and it's doing that
math for you so it's not like it's
creating 16 columns here it's just sort
of saying alright eight is half of 16
plus the margin is forty nine point
three six plus this one point two six
percentage is going to equal what it
takes
plus another one of these four point
nine to equal 100% cool so let's put
this back to eight of 12 just like that
and you'll notice our side is doing some
weird stuff just because the main
content area is floating and the aside
is not so of course it's being brought
out the document flow and we need to put
this back in and say that the aside is
also taking up a span so just like that
we could say a side and we could say add
include span and then now we want to say
4 of 12 semicolon refresh and what has
happened okay so our side has been
pushed down you would have expected that
this would have filled up in there right
because 8 plus 4 is 12 but what this
doesn't understand is the position right
we're saying sure this is this is 4 of 8
but it thinks it's just 4 of 8 so what
it's doing is not only assigning it the
correct width that it needs to fill in
here it's also giving it this margin
right now if we were to uncheck this
margin right you'll see this slide up in
here so how can we have this with no
margin well you could do a couple of
things but I think the best thing and
the most obvious thing to do is to say
that this is in the 9th position of the
columns right because if you're telling
Suzy that this is in
starting from 9 10 11 and 12 it's going
to know that it goes to the very end and
shouldn't put a margin right because
it's smart like that and this is why you
use systems like this because they they
can do all this stuff for you so now we
can say for at 9 of 12 so this is four
columns starting at the 9th position of
12 columns we save this now on refresh
we have no margin right just a width of
the correct amount and a float of the
correct amount now because we had this
set to 80% you'll notice that not only
is our grid fluid but since everything
said in percentages all of our columns
are fluid and our margin our gutters as
well so cool this is a really basic grid
we have a main content area a side
column and for a lot of stuff I mean
this is this is a pretty good start
right I mean we had really we had three
lines of code we had this include we had
this include and the container two spans
and a container and that's it and we got
this grid going now this is just
scratching the surface of Susy and in
the next video we're going to talk about
some of the new things you can do with
sass maps to set up your global settings
for Susy and have a more configured grid
that's not just so 8 of 12 whatever
right so here we have our basic example
and we're just going to keep on getting
more advanced from here we're going to
do some asymmetric grid stuff we're
going to show you how to make responsive
grids pretty much everything you need to
know about the new version Susy too so
as always this is Scott with level up
tuts
and thanks for watching if you're new to
the channel please subscribe
we have new videos twice a week usually
Tuesdays and Thursday nights and if you
feel like supporting level up Tut's we
now have a level up test com a pro
account version of level of tuts where
you can give back to level up Tots and
get some new features while you're at it
so check that out as always we love
here questions or comments we have a
forum for that on level up huts or you
can leave a comment on the video so
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
