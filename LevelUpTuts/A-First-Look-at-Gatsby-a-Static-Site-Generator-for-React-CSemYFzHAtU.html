up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
give you my first look at Gatsby Jada's
now Gatsby j/s is a static site
generator using graph QL react and a web
pack
so what Gatsby does is it basically
generates static HTML files as well as a
JavaScript bundle so that your site can
be both dynamic as well as static where
you first download the initial HTML file
you get really really fast loads and
then for any additional information such
as pulling in from an API you still have
access to all that react goodness and
the best part about this whole thing is
is this generating static site file so
you're getting HTML files out of this
and JavaScript that you can throw up
anywhere so it makes hosting it really
easy you don't have to worry about a
database obviously because there's no
back end to this it also makes blog post
really easy because you just write
everything in markdown and then save it
to a folder and then you can access that
data using your graph QL query so like I
said this is just a first look not a
full on tutorial this will be the first
time I've downloaded Gatsby it'll be the
first time I've checked out the files
and the first time I've read the docs I
just have a basic understanding of it so
this is me coming at this is totally
someone who's never really seen this
before wanting to check it out so let's
get going right now
okay so in this video what I wanted to
do is talk about this new static site
generator that just hit version one
yesterday in fact if you go to their
blog post their blog section you can see
gets be announcing one July 6th 2017 so
this thing is brand new
well at least it's brand new in terms of
being a version one and so I want to
basically just take a first look at this
thing you know when this started making
the rounds yesterday I checked it out I
read the pages and stuff like that but I
haven't dove into it I haven't installed
it I haven't tried it so I figured a
cool thing to do in this video would be
to maybe give a first look at Gatsby
which is a static site and generator for
react and this thing really flies at
least if you go by this page itself for
instance refresh you can see that was
just super quick right that those
load-times are pretty darn amazing now
this is a cached version of the site
which is why it's loading so quickly but
even the non cached version of this site
loaded super quickly so what's up with
Gatsby well it's a static site generator
using react and what exactly does that
mean well it basically spits out HTML
files HTML files with a JavaScript
bundle so you're getting basically a
flat HTML file down first load that it's
all you're getting and then the app uses
JavaScript basically for the rest of the
time you're using to navigate between
pages load new pages and stuff like that
but that initial first load is going to
be super super fast
not to mention because this is a static
site you can host this on github pages
you can host this pretty much anywhere
you don't got to worry about a database
now that said what do you do for data in
this thing well if we scroll down they
have a nice little graph here they shows
that the data sources that come from
posts which are simply just markdown
which we're gonna show you a little bit
of data coming in from JSON or yamo
files and then we have basic api's right
so this expects you to bring your own
P I so this doesn't include is any sort
of back-end or API stuff like that but
if you're building a blog or a static
site which you know this is a static
site generator then most everything's
gonna be in markdown or react which can
make things very super easy in fact I've
been thinking about redoing my personal
website in Gatsby J us just to try it
out it's so fast my sites already built
and react so it could basically do
nothing but make my site faster you can
see here you can deploy self host static
host github pages any of this stuff so
check out Gatsby what we're gonna do
here is we're gonna install we're gonna
check out the files we're gonna pop the
root and I'm gonna be seeing this all
for the first time myself and I'm gonna
call out little features here and there
stuff that I've basically picked up just
from reading this page reading the docs
checking out the tutorial so if we have
to get started
basically it wants us to install Gatsby
globally with this NPM install G Gatsby
cool of that so I can just paste it in
install Gatsby globally on my machine
now this assumes that you have node
installed and that you have a little bit
of node and react experience if you
don't you can still follow along things
might be a little bit confusing however
at the very least you can start to see
the benefits so this is going to
basically install a bunch of stuff that
is the Gatsby CLI now one thing you'll
notice when browsing Gatsby site is if
you do head to their tutorial I would
just sort of skip this entirely this
basically gives you a little bit about
Gatsby but as you can see it's a
four-part ur and there's only one part
complete and only is that one part
complete it's it's this tutorial is
actually pretty incomplete for instance
there's a to-do in here when we find it
where it says to do tell people to use
the Gatsby CLI package once that's built
now I'd assume that package is already
built because if you head to right here
it tells you to use the Gatsby CLI so it
seems like they need to rewrite their
tutorials that's cool
I totally get that there's a lot of
stuff here to go over anyways so what
we're gonna do see if this is all good
okay gatsby's install them in my sites
folder you can run this gatsby new
gatsby site I'm just gonna start copying
and pasting this stuff because I'd like
I said I'm just exploring here so we're
going to generate a new Gatsby site then
we're going to change directories into
it we're gonna fire it up and we're
gonna start exploring the files that
came with Gatsby I'm like I said keep in
mind this the first time that I've done
any of this so I'm seeing this all for
the first time just like you are you'll
give my initial impressions
you'll get sort of my initial views and
what this looks like and maybe the
viability of it all it seems like it's a
really nice static site generator and
keep in mind not every site needs to be
more than a static site generator I mean
if you're building a personal blog for
yourself and your technical editing
markdown files is no big deal now I
might not ask a client to edit markdown
files but you know who knows depending
on the client or the project and if it's
a pure static site you get to still use
your react tools and you could still
have all of the coolness of react and
its functionality inside a static site
generator okay so let's change
directories into gatsby site and let's
now I think the command is just get
speed develop which is going to fire up
a localhost at port 8000 see what this
does give me some success
okay bootstrap finished took just a
little over a second okay gives me some
issues about factories no big deal and
it's successfully compiled took just
over two seconds and my site is running
at localhost port 8000 and I have a
graph QL debugger running at port 8000
underscore underscore graph QL now I
didn't mention this but this whole thing
uses graph QL to basically manage your
data and that is a wonderful wonderful
thing if you've ever used graph QL you
can see here that we can test out our
queries and everything directly in here
I'm not going to get into the bones of
that right now because this is just an
introduction
but as you can see here by default we
have this Gatsby header hi people
welcome to our new Gatsby site time to
build something go to page 2 back to
home page awesome
so as you can see we already have some
basic routing nothing crazy at all here
but I mean that you see how fast this is
right I mean this is it's not doing
anything it's just swapping out some
HTML here and there but it's very fast
and I guess that's what you could come
to expect from something using react in
this kind of capacity no data static
HTML really nice so let's go and I'm
gonna go to my sites director I'm gonna
open this up envious code so we can see
this a little bit ok there we go okay so
check it out
this is Gatsby let's look at what we
have here you can see we have a basic
license file you may want to take a look
at this
yeah just read through the license to
make sure you know you're signing up for
I'll do that later we have our package
file which is just a standard Noda
package filer and we have our typography
typography package react typography
Gatsby plugin react helmet okay so we're
using react helmet although there is
this Gatsby plug-in business here which
I don't know too much about off to a
dive into that a little bit more like
why not just use react helmet but I'm
sure that has to do with how its
interacting with the static site
generation now we have Gatsby link which
is a way to link between pages and we
just simply have Gatsby so check it out
we also have a readme telling you a
little bit about it and we have a yarn
lock file for those of you who use yarn
we have gatsby config which is obviously
something that is going to allow for
configuration of your site overall we
see we have a title for the metadata it
gets be default starter let me see if I
can change that to just say up first
look see if we get some live reloading
going on here we should get that but I
don't know if it's going to change the
page title yeah it looks like this
didn't change the page title so I'm not
quite sure
you need to restart the server for the
something like this to take an effect
it's very possible because it's a config
file and that like a site file okay so
leave a cache folder which is probably
something you're not going to touch a
node modules folder we have a public
folder and an SRC folder our public
folder basically contains a static
folder as well as an index.html which
looks like it's something that we might
not want to touch because it's minified
here okay so let's head into our SRC
file or source folder where we have an
HTML j/s what you can see is basically
grabbing our Styles we have our main
HTML tags our meta content we're using
some type agraphia lement here and then
you can see this dot props dot post body
components now if we head down into
pages you can see we have two pages
index dot JSON
two high level up head to our page you
can see we do have some rate live
reloading
like I said that must have been then
that config for the page title stuff but
that was very fast right check it out
live level ups to save tab back I almost
beat it right that was really close and
we have page to j/s
right here now what I would assume here
is that it basically grabs your page
files from inside of here let's go ahead
and make a new file here I'm gonna copy
page to j/s let's make a new file you
know I do not want the title to be that
let's just say new page is and paste
this in here let's say it's interesting
here that okay this is page two but the
component name is index where the
component name is index here this is
kind of thing I like to do I like to
dive in without reading a ton of the
docs here so if we head to their docs
adding let's see building with
components and now here they have page
Jenna
raishin and they're about pages about
page extents component so I'm not quite
sure why both their page 1 and page 2 or
both index that could just be an issue
or it could be something more obviously
something I want to dive into a little
bit more for now let's actually leave
page and new pages index and we're going
to say new page and I'm just noticing
that these file titles are probably
getting their name or the path is
probably getting its name from the file
title so it's changes to new - page ok
and you might be annoyed that I'm not
reading the docs here I'm just sort of
pawing through this sort of uneducated
lis but this is a great way to learn
stuff because it can sort of smash your
assumptions about things and then you
head to the doc sort of adjust your
assumptions about things or you can
obviously pop through the docs freed
them through and through and know
exactly what you're getting into now
both of which are things I would suggest
to do but sometimes it's fun to just
play around with something for the first
time ok so on index looked at a new link
here and from page two let's go ahead
and have this just be new page and we're
gonna see if this works
like I said totally free styling this
based on a lot of assumptions here ok go
to new page so we're gonna link to this
new page and hopefully it's just going
to find new page so let's head back to
art gatsby site we can click go to new
page and it found our new page that's
great that's exactly what was expecting
to happen so basically the way this is
working is it's looking inside of your
pages it's finding this page and it's
assuming that the title of this page is
going to be a new page now let's
actually try something here like I said
I would sort of weird it out the fact
that this component was named index even
though it was the page - so let's change
this to new page extends react component
and let's see if this break stuff
doesn't break anything back to homepage
go to a new page cool so
I might want some clarification on that
why in fact if you know why this page -
has a class of index other than maybe
it's just something that needs to be
updated
either way naming this new page or index
didn't seem to mind so let's talk about
some other stuff here as you can see we
have layout components where you can
make a layout in fact there should
already be one in there where we have an
index so the layout here contains the
header you can see we have our Gatsby
text here we can change this to a level
of right because every word I delete has
to become level up and you can see here
changed our heading this will take us
back to the home page but this is a nice
layout I would obviously want to dive
into a little bit more like I said not a
full fledged tutorial just to first look
here we also have page templates so
basically we have layout components page
generation let's look at what we can
have with some posts because there's
supposed to be a really nice way of
having posts in here I don't know if
this is based on default we have pages
you can see some utilities some layouts
now here it says you may have noticed
that source /pages /mediabox 0 PS or
posts within this CLI version which is
cool if we head it to the react examples
directory oh and this link is broken ok
this is just another thing there's gonna
be things like this this is brand new
again might want to submit a pull
request or something like that like
let's see if this github link works it
does ok yeah maybe I'll hold when I'm
finished with this video I'll contribute
some stuff just to clean up these Doc's
a little bit but as you can see here
there is an examples folder which we can
head to here and it looks like you can
use this with Drupal you can use this
with other stuff to pull in your data
using worth WordPress that's pretty cool
I don't know to the extent of which any
of this stuff actually works or how it
works so I just I don't have to dive
into it a little bit you can use it with
redux I just want to see them maybe like
a basic post example so this is using a
RSS feed plug-in client only paths let's
see if this is good let's see we have
some pages now okay I'm gonna look for
an example or I'll just pause the docs
for a little bit when I'm done with this
video to basically figure out how we can
both get our posts and display them I'm
sure this page templates section where
it looks like a queries the graph QL
schema from a markdown data and then
renders the page using this data so I
would assume blog post template here is
going to be the key to this all in terms
of pulling in your markdown files but as
you can see here from the top of this
building components page you can see
that we do have a file directory where
you have something like posts and then a
date and then an index top markdown and
it's gonna be able to pull in that data
and you're gonna fall access that like I
said this is not a full-on tutorial here
I'm going to spend some time really
diving into this and potentially bring
out a full tutorial on this thing either
way so far so good if you're looking to
have a static site that's blazingly fast
and can be hosted anywhere generated
push to HTML whatever this thing looks
like a really nice alternative and the
best part is it gives you config files
it gives you code to edit if you like to
edit code and it overall gives you some
options
so check out Gatsby I'm going to like I
said play around with it
maybe submit some pull requests on this
documentation to maybe make things a
little bit more clear but that's
obviously to be expected with new stuff
you know not everything is easy to find
especially when there's this many pages
so head to Gatsby j/s
dot-org get this thing installed and
play around with it let me know what you
think I'm really interested in hearing
people's opinions about when they might
use this or if they want to use this I
personally have a whole bunch of ideas
floating around right now about when and
where and why I would use this so like I
said let me know what you think test it
out Jeremy repose of stuff youth built
with Gatsby if you've built anything
cooled love to see that thanks so much
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
