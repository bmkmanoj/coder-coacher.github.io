tutorials and in this video we're gonna
show you how you can create a sub theme
for a depth of theme in your project and
enable that and even start to see it
working a little bit so check it out
we're gonna get going right now okay so
when we left off we had actually set
this 80 sub theme as our default theme
we're gonna want to go ahead and undo
that so I'm gonna go ahead and just set
this bar tick back to the default and
then I'm going to disable the sub theme
now the sub theme is really meant to
just be used as a template to copy and
then create another theme off of so
let's head to finder and head to our
project now from our Drupal installation
we can go to sites all themes where we
installed adaptive theme and let's open
up this folder and you'll notice the 80
sub theme is right here what we can do
is simply just copy this 80 sub theme
and I did it outside of the adaptive
theme folder so we have it right here so
I'm going to go ahead and set this name
to level up just like so so this is now
going to be the name of our new sub
theme level up in addition to renaming
the folder we also have to come in here
and rename this dot info file so this is
adaptive underscore sub theme that info
we can change this to level up info just
like we did with the folder now we
actually need to open up level up info
in our text editor I'm going to be using
sublime text to edit any files you can
use of course any sort of text editor of
your choice now this name is just going
to be the name of our theme it's going
to be level up now the description it
can be whatever you'd like it to be this
is just going to show up on the
appearance page of your admin so we can
just say a new theme from level
tutorials okay and it's using a core
version 7 the base theme is adaptive
theme so we don't want to change that
and
the release is going to be 7 X 3 X and
there should be out good now we're just
going to maintain the screen shot here
once your theme is all done you can
actually make a screen shot or upload
your own and that should be all good so
let's go ahead and click Save and let's
head back to our project now let's
refresh this theme page and you'll see
we have a new theme here we have LevelUp
which is 7 X 3.2 a new theme from level
up tutorials we can go and click enable
and set as default
now let's come to the front of our page
here the home page and you'll notice it
looks just like we had the sub theme
before it's entirely blank nothing is
going on here at all so right now I'm
actually going to take the entire theme
the sub theme level up folder I'm going
to drag this into sublime text so we can
see all of the files and see what comes
with this sub theme so we have like most
themes we have CSS we have images we
have scripts we have your favicon we
also have a config dot RB file which is
going to be used to configure your SAS
environment if you're not using SAS or
any other CSS preprocessor I highly
recommend it it just takes a little bit
to learn is it's a very very small
learning curve it's essentially just CSS
with additional features it can save you
a lot of time and it can make writing
CSS really super awesome so we have this
config dot RB file which we shouldn't
have to worry about and then we have
this favicon we have our level up that
info which you've already seen we have
at the site logo we have the screenshot
which we've seen we have our template
dot PHP file which you should be
familiar with if you've done any sort of
Drupal theming if you haven't just know
that this is where you can put functions
that that alter sort of how your website
works in different ways we'll go over
then a little bit more detail once we
start getting to some more advanced
things and then we have themed settings
so as you can see it's for your gnarly
custom theme settings next we have
layouts where we just have our basic
naked page layout here we have this
image we have this include file and we
have
just a sort of non CSS file it's just
this very basic thing that loads this
naked PNG so you can see that this
layout is included here but you don't
have to use this now we have so you can
see that this layout exists next inside
of images so we just have some images
for an icons so far for bookmarking
icons we have an iPad Retina standard I
would recommend having more than just
these these Apple ones in addition
Microsoft and Google has their own set
of bookmarking icons that are something
that you'll definitely want to add to
your project and we can go over that as
well and then last we have their CSS
which is what is created from our sass
files and if you don't want to use the
sass files you don't have to but like I
said it's really worth your time so we
can come in here and this lets come to
global styles and let's just set body
background to red we can save this head
to our theme refresh and without doing a
whole lot we have our sub-theme up and
going with already modified a style to
it it looks ugly we're not going to keep
it but you've made an modification to a
sub theme that you created all on your
own and it was just ridiculously easy so
we now have our sub theme going and
we're ready to start learning a little
bit more about adaptive theme and then
we're gonna get into styling more with
sass so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorial so if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video edits up at twitter or
facebook at level up tutorials we'd love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
