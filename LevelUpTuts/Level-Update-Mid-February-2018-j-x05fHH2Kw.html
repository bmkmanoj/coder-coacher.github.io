up tutorials and in this video what I'm
going to be doing is talking a little
bit about what's happened so far this
month for level up tutorials and what's
going to happen in the next coming weeks
and I'm gonna try to do these sort of
bimonthly level updates like I was used
to doing monthly before but what I'm
gonna be doing is talking about the
upcoming pro series that's going to be
coming to level up tutorials some of the
new things that have happened on the
site some of the latest episodes of the
syntax podcast and basically just a
roundup of everything that's taken place
over the past couple of weeks so let's
get started right now so in this level
update I wanted to cover some of the new
changes and new improvements as well as
new series coming to level up tutorials
so the first and foremost thing I want
to announce is the next Pro series
coming at this month to level up
tutorials is going to be Pro Gatsby
Gatsby as a static site generator built
in react uses react webpack and whole
bunch of stuff to build blazingly fast
sites so this is going to be a pro
series available later this month that's
going to cover a lot of really
interesting stuff and how to build a
blog using Gatsby next in the past
couple of weeks we've released a few
episodes of the syntax podcast if you do
not know about the syntax podcast this
is a podcast I do with West Bus where we
talk all things web development and in
this podcast we just released an episode
on Wednesday called designing templating
in landing and sending email while we
talk all about our processes for
actually how we work with email on the
web and the week before that we had an
episode on our personal work-life
balance some of the things we like to do
for fun it was a sort of a light episode
on not coding stuff but a lot of useful
things on how to balance your hobbies
with your codes and then before that we
released an episode that is called a
snack pack where we answer a whole bunch
of individual questions from viewers and
listeners we talked about CSS frameworks
react higher-order components render
props designers who want to learn how to
code and how to advance your career and
we get to mess around a bit with a sound
board so check out the syntax podcast if
you have not we have a really
great episode up coming up next week all
about working with media whether that's
images videos and all sorts of large
files some of our techniques and stuff
we like to do for that now lastly
there's some been in some major
improvements to the level up tutorial
site that just deployed it today the
site is now fully server-side rendered
you can check out this source and see
all this server-side rendered goodness
in here and that's not the only change
the entire site moved over to a new
graph QL data layer that went up
sometime in January but it's been
quietly improving ever since so check it
out there's a lot of new stuff and
improvements constantly going up to
level up tutorials in fact just today I
just deployed a big ol update to the
site so there's going to be more and
more updates coming very very soon all
the time at the site just keeps on
improving let me know if there's
anything you want to see improve out of
this site and lastly I finished a new
free series called full stack graph QL
with Apollo meteor and react this series
is 28 videos long of teaching you Apollo
with meteor and react and it's gonna
show you a little bit about the basics
of all of these things and we're going
to be building a nice little resolutions
app with sub resolutions and meanwhile
I'm gonna be showing you user accounts
and how you can work with the graph QL
to take full advantage of all of the
benefits in graph QL so check out this
series suddenly front page level up

my favorite react packages a couple of
cool packages there as well so in the
past month and a half I've released 28

is Wednesday video every single week and
