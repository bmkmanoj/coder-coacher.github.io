tutorials and today we're going to show
you how to write your own functions
using stylist maybe the built-in
functions just I'm doing it for you or
maybe you have some piece of
functionality that you need to add to
your CSS code that you can do so with
your own function so we're going to show
you what kind of things you can do with
your own functions and what tools you
have to accomplish the things you need
to do so let's get started right now so
we've shown you how to use some basic
functions now let's talk about how you
can create your own functions and we're
going to go through some really super
basic examples so you figure out how
they can work and then it might open up
some ideas you have to create some more
interesting advanced functions or maybe
it doesn't and the right time will come
along when you just say hey a function
would be absolutely perfect here and one
doesn't exist I'll make it and what's
great about functions is that you can
pass them along and share them with the
community and everybody can take
advantage of the functions that you've
created if you have them on github or
someplace like that so let's go ahead
and write a function to write a function
this in text is actually very similar to
writing a mixin let's say we're going to
write a function that just adds two
numbers we could just say add and then
in parentheses we're going to take in
the the arguments that this function
expects to receive so we can say we're
going to accept an a variable and a be
variable ok now we want to say what this
function is going to do since its adding
it these two numbers we could say a plus
B in fact if we wanted to add a third we
could say C and just do a plus B plus C
so I'm not quite sure why the code
coloring is messed up on this last see
but I wouldn't worry about it too much
so what we can see from this function is
any time we passed three values to add
it's going to add those values up and
spit it out so let's go ahead and do
that on this margin left we no longer
want to be negative 10 let's say we want
it to be add and we're
pass it some values we're going to say
it's going to be 1 comma 2 comma 3 and
we should be expecting a 6 to come out
of here so if you'll notice we have
margin left is 6 now you might be
wondering well we want this to be a
pixel value right well if we want this
to be a pixel that you can actually pass
a pixel value into the function so if we
just say one pixel you notice that this
margin left is now six pixels and
likewise if we have all three of these
being a pixel value the end result is
going to be pixel what happens if the
values that we passed this act the same
for instance if we pass this a
percentage and then two pixels we save
it you'll notice that the unit that is
accepting is this percentage likewise if
we have let's say the middle unit as
percentage and this one as a rem we save
it you'll notice that we're getting this
REM value however now because we're up
adding a percentage it's adding actual
two percent which is a number its point
zero two so our value is no longer six
and it's 4.02 so if you want this to be
a six REM as our answer we could just
get rid of this unit for these other
ones entirely and pass it in like that
now let's say we want to Oh be able to
emit one of these values we want this to
always be three no matter what right now
if we try to save this it's going to be
accepting or expecting three separate
values and it's only getting two so you
most that this isn't compiling to
anything it's not changing if we check
out our our our terminal here we're
getting a whole bunch of errors so we
can get around that is by saying in our
declaration that we can define this as a
a permanent value we could say this is
going to be equal to three all the time
it's going to be its default value so
now actually let's make this so let's
say this number change let's just make
it four and you'll see our value at the
end is now seven
but if we want to do something like
overriding that we would just simply
have to declare this in the function
here past the argument into the function
and it's now overriding this for and
likewise instead of just hard coding
values you can even hard code with other
variables so you can say that see if
it's not defined is always going to be
the same value as a so just like that we
now have the ability to say that C is
going to be equal to ay ay is equal to 1
1 to 1 is equal to 4 so this is just a
really basic function where we're
accepting some values we're adding them
together and then we're returning the
output right here so let's actually come
up with a new function that returns
multiple values because let's say you
have a something like a margin and
you're going to want it to be returning
multiple values here and not just not
just a one value itself so what we can
do is create a new function here and
we're just going to call this Marge for
no reason other than I can't come up
with a better name at the current moment
and this is going to accept one value ok
now we're going to return multiple
values we're going to be splitting this
variable up into four separate values ok
and it's going to be determining a
margin for a given object so to do this
let's actually take this function and
I'm just going to I'm going to get rid
of this margin left here and I'm just
going to apply a general margin so I'm
just going to say margin is equal to
Marge and I'm gonna pass this 10 and
it's um let's just say 10 pixels ok and
now right now in our body mean it's not
going to do anything because the Marge
function isn't returning anything yet so
if we were to just say a like this
you'll notice that it's returning 10
pixels exactly however what happens if
we do space and then a
in there are most things get kind of
weird in fact we have this a colon and
then 10 pixels and then to send me
columns so let's try to use something
where we can return these values so
before we do have to use this return
command and this time we're going to
want to use it simply because the stylus
doesn't really know what to do when we
have these multiple outputs and if we're
saying return here stylist knows that
any variable that comes across here or
any value it's going to want to return
it so for instance if we say return a
space a save it the output is no margin
at 10 pixels and 10 pixels now we can do
all sorts of stuff with this let's say
we wanted that the margin on a top and
bottom to be 10 pixels but we wanted the
left and right margin to be 5 pixels we
could say something like k divided by 2
here and now we have 10 and a 5 or let's
say we wanted to be a times 10 left and
right margins are now 100 top and bottom
are now just 10 and likewise we can keep
going and say perhaps maybe the bottom
margin is going to be a times two so
then we have 10 120 and you'll notice
that we can just keep stringing along
things here and it's going to keep on
returning them and likewise if we wanted
to add a second variable something like
be we could also just throw be into the
mix here and perhaps this is the
multiplication values and now we could
say margin 10 pixels and let's say this
is going to be 24b now we're seeing here
is the value for a which is 10 then we
see a times 10 and then we see a x 20
and we get all of those values output
here just like this and you'll notice
that it's getting a pixel for all of
them because the original value a has a
pixel-based unit ok so we've created a
function here and then we've created a
function that returns multiple values
now you can start to see the importance
of how functions can be very very
flexible to do all sorts of different
tasks for you but what you haven't seen
is the use of things like condition
and some of the more advanced features
that you're able to accomplish with
functions functions that would be able
to accept values and then not only just
returned multiplications or additions or
math with those values but be able to
analyze them and tell you a little bit
about them like what their unit is and
what what their function is and then you
can use those properties to
conditionally output different things
things like this are reasons why i love
CSS preprocessors the immediate use
might not be totally obvious but the
benefits are completely there and it
gives you just a ton of ability to
create some really cool stuff so in the
next few videos we're to just talk about
more advanced function stuff we're going
to show you some of the cooler things
with stylus and then we're going to get
into some really awesome libraries that
exist for stylus like nib and a
typographic grid frameworks like jeed
and just really show you all of these
awesome things that you can do using
stylist so as always this is Scott with
level tutorials if have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video ahead
us up at Twitter or Facebook we love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
