up tuts
and today I'm going to show you how to
create a two column layout using CSS and
we're going to be using it something
called a float and what a float is is a
float is a way to push an element to the
left or right keep in mind you can't
have a float that goes up or down it's
just left or right and as you push it to
the right it's allowing other elements
to wrap around it so if you have
something floated all the way to the
left it's going to go as far left as it
can just like if you float it to right
it's going to go as far right as it can
so all the other elements that are
underneath it are going to sort of come
and wrap around it so let's check this
out with a quick example I'm actually
just going to float this headline to the
left I'm going to actually delete this
feedback to just for now just to get rid
of it let's go to our code here get rid
of this and then in our page I'll get
rid of this as well so we don't have to
have it sitting around cold okay so now
with this h1 since we only have one h1
I'm just going to put it here I'm just
going to say float left actually to
illustrate let's float right it's
already on the left side of the screen
so if we float right you'll notice that
this content comes up and around here
just like this and this is on the right
now as opposed to if we're just to text
align this right if we were to text
align this right and not float it it
would actually all the other content
would be still pushed down so if we do
text-align:right it's now at the same
spot but all this other content hasn't
filled up around it so this is important
for a couple of reasons it allows us to
do some really great things and with the
content in a way that you might not you
know think of it before
so let's I'll show you one more quick
example and you're going to find this to
be really useful okay
so I'm going to actually put an image in
here let me go and grab an image so I'm
just going to use the level up
logo like we've been using for the
background I'm just going to place this
as an image tag and see it should be
good okay so let's check out our page
now let's see make sure it came in okay
so here it is right now and let's say we
want to have all of this content sort of
wrapping around this image and in even
if the content is too long it'll come
down and then fill up the total space so
it's almost like if we float this image
left everything will just sort of fill
up the extra space so let's go ahead and
fill that up and then let me get rid of
this h1 floating right while I'm at it
and since there's only one image
actually let's just add a class to it so
one second class okay and then our CSS
for this for this class we're going to
write float and then we're going to say
left and then let's go back to our page
here and you'll notice it's already on
the left side but watch what this
happens once we float this left okay so
now this paragraph has come up and
filled the space another thing we can do
here is give this a little bit of a
margin around it so where's this
floating floating this thing right here
we're going to say we're actually just
going to give this a margin on the left
and we're gonna have to speed 40 pixels
and maybe a margin on the bottom to 40
pixels save this come back here refresh
this oops sorry I went I wanted a margin
right on that my fault
okay back refresh cool so now we have a
little bit of a column distance gap
between here and the content just sort
of fills up and around you with this
exception of this margin right here so
here we have an image that sort of been
pushed up into our content now that
content is wrapping around it and you
might be wondering well how we're going
to do two columns the two column layout
well instead of an image here I'm going
to have another
give in this div is just going to have
in another unordered list but this list
is going to be not display:inline like
the other one so I'm going to copy this
and let's see outside of this wrapper
main I'm going to put actually we're
going to do this inside of the wrapper
main I'm going to wrap this all in a
class and it's going to be well first
this will be left column okay
so left call and then here we're having
this other one ordered list and have
okay and close this div off and then out
and I'm going to make one that's main
column good boy okay
typing while talking and thinking okay
okay so that's all in main column so
let's come to our page and see what we
have so far okay so we have our left
column and we have our main column now
in a normal site you might want like the
title of the page to be above the main
column but we're going to do something
different with a heading anyways so I'm
just going to be able to push this
content to the left and the other one to
the right or to the left as well and
it's going to wrap around it so let's
check that out
in here and our CSS okay so now we just
need to add our classes in our CSS we
had a left column actually it's called
left - call and then we have a main
column from head main - column and now
so for our left column we're going to
want to flip this left and we're going
to give this a width of 20 percent and
we're going to give it a margin of well
we'll give it a margin of 40 pixels on
the top and the bottom or well 40 pixels
on the top at least
10% on the right 5% on the 40 pixels on
the bottom and 5% on the left all right
and we're going to give this a width of
let's say 55 percent and then margin is
going to be 40 pixels and then we want 5
5% on the right this time let me double
check I'm doing this math right 40
pixels and then to get this to equal 200
we need 80 and E we need just 5 more
percent on the left it doesn't matter
that that's uneven we'll check it out
and to make this really obvious we're
going to give these both a background of
some sort of a gray color and then have
this be 4 4 4 and the main column will
be a background of let's say 666 just so
they're a little different but we can
tell where they're their borders are and
we're also going to be floating this
main column to the left okay and if
you're wondering why that will happen or
why we're doing that is because we don't
want this the main column just sort of
fold around the left column we want to
stay in its own column
so let's come back to our site refresh
and sure enough here we have our left
column and then our main column if you
scroll down here it all is and if we get
the site bigger and larger it's going to
be adjusting because it's all in
percents well um the question you might
be asking is why does this background
not take up the entire length of the
content well if you remember when we
were floating items and let's the
content that's below it flow around it
so uh while the floating element itself
is not affected it's really long here
this background really has nothing to
latch on to because both this column and
this column have both been pulled out of
like the flow of the document so the
only positioning or width or height or
anything that has on this main wrapper
is what we told it to be we told it to
be have a minimum height of 200 pixels
if we were to get rid of that it would
go away and then if we get rid of the
padding it's going to go away even
further so how do you get by this well
there's a couple of men
and the one I'm going to show first is
called the clear fix and there's all
sorts of ways to do the CSS clear fix
the one I'm going to be using on this
site is I'm just going to pull it up
here it's from the html5 boilerplate I
been going to html5 boilerplate there's
some great code in there they do a great
job so I'm just going to grab all this
stuff because you can read later why
they did it the way they did it all it's
doing is giving you this class clear
fixed okay and I'm just going to throw
this class in my CSS I'll put it at the
very bottom because I'm not going to be
changing it or at adding or whatever
actually going to space it down even
more and now on my wrapper the thing
that we don't want to collapse when
items are floated inside of it we're
going to be giving this a class of clear
fix remember you can give items as many
classes as you like as long as they're
separated by a space so it's going to
get the properties from the clear fix
class and now let's come back to our
pager and let's refresh this and now
you'll notice that the wrapper is taking
up the entire width of the content and
what that's doing is it's after this
content here it's clearing your floats
and that's just saying hey content the
there's no items floated anymore and
it's flute it's clearing that after that
this content is over so that's why this
wraps to the very bottom instead of
pulling up instead of pulling up to the
top or just disappearing completely
entirely okay so there are other
techniques for doing what clear fixing
and you can play around with it but
check that out and like I had noticed
before if we would have not floated this
one left we wouldn't have had to clear
fix so let's remove this clear fix and
let's not float the main column left and
you'll see what happens the content is
going to wrap around this left column
sort of like what we saw before so now
we don't need that clear fix but it's
not really doing a two column layout
okay so that's how you do a two column
layout with CSS using
floats now floats are something that
you're going to take some practice
they're a little bit different and it's
really easy to sort of apply something
and then you know forget to do your
clear fix or something and then the
contents not looking exactly like how
you wanted but this is how you do the
two column layout and floating things is
a very useful technique in CSS as always
