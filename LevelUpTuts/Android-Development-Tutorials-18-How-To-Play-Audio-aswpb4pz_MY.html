up Tut's and today we're going to be
about using audio files in your android
app and what we're going to do first is
we're just going to trigger this audio
file by starting up our application so
we're just going to in this first lesson
show you how to get an audio file
working in your application and luckily
it's not too bad and it's nothing too
out of where we've been already with our
Android learning so what we're going to
do first is we're going to create a
folder inside of our res so inside of
your project and then your resources
folder click on your resources and go to
new and then down here to folder and
we're going to name this folder raw our
aw and what we're going to do is we're
going to put an mp3 file in here and I
have a an mp3 here amongst some my files
here that is cheer mp3 and this is
audience cheering very loudly and this
is going to launch whenever we open up
our app for whatever reason now keep in
mind I'm not going to put an app out
that does this this is this would really
piss a lot of people off you this would
be totally obnoxious if you had an app
that you know made a sound every time
you turn it on but for demonstration
sake we're going to do it and then in
the next video we're going to modify
this so I'm just going to go ahead and
drag this into my raw folder and it's
going to ask me if I want to copy them
I'm going to copy this that makes a copy
and puts it in the raw file as well this
leaves your original file intact which
is exactly what I want
so here we have our cheer mp3 so what do
we need to do well if you remember when
we reference anything before we had to
make that item in our code first before
we could access it so the same thing
we're going to do that with this and
what kind of data type is this we've had
a text view we've had edit text we've
had strings we've had all kinds of data
types well this is a media player so to
get this media player going we just have
to make a new media player so we can
say Media Player and then we're going to
name it and this is just going to be
cheer and you are going to know some red
underlines if you hover over meteor
player it's going to ask you to import
it let's import it that will get rid of
that and then we can do it equals and
just like we've done before we're going
to say media player and it's a capital P
there dot create and then inside of
parentheses it you can see it already
filled some stuff in for us the context
is going to be main activity and then
we're going to do dot this and this
other item here the resource ID is going
to be our dot raw remember this is how
we access our resources so we do our dot
raw this time and then we say dot and
you see cheers there so let's click
enter it auto fills us in finish this
off with a semicolon
and let's save it so it's underlining
and saying that cheer is not used at all
which I know this and if you remember
where we are this is on our on create so
when our on Kurt when the app is created
it's going to go do all of this stuff
it's going to set the content view it's
going to set all these variables and
then we have our onclicklistener
so if you would imagine if you want
something to play when the app loads
you're going to want it to play in the
oncreate and of course we need to do
that after we declare what cheer
actually is so to get cheer to start
here all we have to do is say cheer dot
start and then you can see it auto fills
us in finish it off with semicolon and
let's run our app just click this and
let's bring our emulator to the
forefront here when our app loads we
should hear some awesome applause
so now everybody's super psyched that we
just lived up this absolute cheering but
um so this is how we interact with audio
so in the next video
I'm going to show you how to use this
audio in a different way we're going to
press a button to get this audio we're
going to have a cheer when we get our
right number and you can start
experimenting with it already but you
might run into some problems so in the
next video we'll cover all that stuff as
always if you have any questions leave a
comment the video set the Twitter level
up HUD's
this is Scott and thanks a lot for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
