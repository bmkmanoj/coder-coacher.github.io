up tuts and today we're going to talk
about adding your own fonts using add
font face we're going to be downloading
fonts from font squirrel comm because
what they have here is a great
collection of free fonts that's
basically freeware that's licensed for
commercial work so basically you can use
these fonts in your projects and you
don't have to worry about licensing or
anything like that so these fonts are
all ones that you are able to use in
your projects without having to pay
anything extra and so we're going to use
a really obvious fun here that's all Doh
and basically here's your front page
tells you about the font you can click
here to download the OTF installed on
your computer
but what we want is this web font kit
link right here and actually some
thoughts on here are not going to be
able to have this web font kit and they
have a thing about whatever particular
license they have but this regardless
this font squirrel site is a great site
for finding free fonts to use in your
projects so we're going to click this
download add font face kit and it's
going to download a zip here let's check
out to see what's inside of this zip
that we have
so inside of here we have a how to use
web fonts HTML page it basically just
tells you to upload your fonts include
them in your stylesheet and then include
your stylesheet of course and then you
can use it within your CSS but we don't
need to read this because I'm going to
show you how to do it so inside of this
folder is a web fonts we have our font
here and you'll notice we have a whole
bunch of different versions and we need
all of these versions because different
browsers are going to use different
versions of this font and we want to
make sure that we support as many
browsers as possible so I'm actually
going to be making a font folder and
it's just going to be fonts and I'm just
going to drag these fonts right in here
and I'm actually going to open up this
stylesheet dot CSS because what's great
about this is it actually gives you CSS
that you're going to need and this way
you don't have to type it here and be
worried that you're going to mess
something up including what these file
names that can sometimes get long so I'm
going to copy and paste this whole @
font face deal right here and I'm just
not going to save it and let's come to
our CSS Styles that CSS and before we do
anything I'm going to paste this right
in here cool so let's take a look at
this add font face and this looks a
little bit different than anything we've
seen in CSS first of all it starts with
the ampersand then font - face what this
is doing is it's actually going to be
loading up these font files you'll
notice there's an e o T we also have an
e ot with this pound ie fix
format embedded open type it actually
gives it a format because it needs it
and then WOFF and then T TF and then
basically this SVG so we have all of
these formats so that we're totally
browser compatible you won't see any
issues with font face and then we give
it a font weight of normal and a font
style of normal and this is just in case
because this is in fact Survey
although regular if this was a bold font
you'd still see found white normal here
because we don't want the browser to add
bold on to the font for us we want to
use the actual bold font so in this
particular case this font family right
here is the really the defining line
here it says what we need to use to
actually use this so if we copy this
font family line let's actually throw it
onto this hello statement here where we
have this do before and we just paste
this here and let's fall back to a
sans-serif as well and now if we save
this you're going to refresh our page
and it's not going to work well notice
how we have our sans-serif fallback
and that's actually because we didn't
really tell this URL the right path
right so just like defining a background
image or anything like that we need to
actually give this a path so that I can
find this font and so new dot dot to go
back one directory and then fonts and
then that's it so it's going to be
looking in the fonts folder and now we
should see although pop-up right here
cool perfect and what's so great about
using CSS fonts instead of actually want
to make sure that there's no
font-weight:bold on this because it
looks like there's possibly some sort of
extra font weight but I could be wrong
font-weight:normal pod because it's a h2
there we go looks a little bit better
and so it's really great about using web
fonts over something like images is
besides being selectable and readable by
Google which is something that you
really want it you Ally allows you to
have way more flexibility with colors or
drop shadows or anything like that you
want to add a text shadow you want to
add a border you want on underlining
that stuff's going to work and you don't
have to worry about modifying an image
and coming back so in terms of
maintenance it's a lot easier but in
terms of just overall everything it's
it's a wonderful thing so if you can and
you have a license to the fonts you're
using I mean I almost would always try
to find a licensed font version of
whatever you're using
and serve a web font because at this
point using images for text is really
just not doing you a whole lot of good
so check out font squirrel check out
Google Fonts there's other paid services
like tight kit which are really great I
personally have a subscription of
Typekit and I use it all the time and
that just offers you more fonts they
have like professional fonts like future
on a lot of Adobe's font package because
they're known by Adobe but yeah check it
out use your own fonts at font face is
really great so as always this is Scott
