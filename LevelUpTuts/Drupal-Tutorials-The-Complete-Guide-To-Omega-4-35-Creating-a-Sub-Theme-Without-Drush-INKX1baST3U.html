up Tut's and today we're gonna be
creating an Omega for something without
using dress now I've stated a couple
times that I think the recommended
version is using in Russian and getting
that to work however if you just can't
manage that's no big deal we can still
create our theme and we can still use
Omega without it so how do we do this
well just like before in omega we have
another folder called omega and this is
the we also have a home here which is a
already created something that you can
go through but if you scroll down you're
going to see a starter kit folder and
inside of that starter kit folder is a
default folder now what we want to do is
create a copy of this and move this into
our sites all themes like so and now we
don't want to move it entirely in case
you ever want to start over
and use this starter kit again you can
see I just made a copy of it however now
that we have our new sub theme here we
can just give it a name so we can just
call this without drush okay just so
it's nice and clear that this one was
made without drush and now this themes
title is going to be without drush so
before in older versions of omega or
other themes you have to do things like
anytime you see the the themes name
you're gonna have to change it to the
actual themes name and since we're using
without drush as our themes name i'm
just gonna copy that you can verify that
within this level up omega theme that i
created for us see we have a level up
omega that info file so we can come back
here to our without drush and let's
click on this now if you were to compare
these two you'll see they're gonna be a
little bit different so let's open this
up it's a command for opening a new
window okay there we go
and let's open this up this is the level
up omega theme and this is the without
drush so sorry if this is too small here
looking at this and finder is never
very much fun but you can see that we
have things like this all level up Omega
info but here we have this default
starter kit Inc let's take a look at
both of these files I'm going to put
both of them into sublime text and we
can see what the difference is so you
can see this is the level of Omega info
file and this is the default dot starter
kit Inc so we want the name of our theme
to be the name of our theme and this
will just be without omega or without
drush and we don't have to have a
description we can just say this was
made without thrush but of course any
good theme you're gonna want a nice
description probably a screenshot of the
finished product what the theme looks
like and then of course we don't need to
change the engine or the core however we
do see this theme sanitized that
normalised dot CSS and that stuff here
and then our version for our level up
theme it says level up with our themes
name
so using sublime text I'm going to go
ahead and change everything with these
brackets here to be our without
underscore drush theme so now the themes
gonna be looking in our CSS for a file
named without underscored rush
normalized CSS of course that doesn't
exist right now and we're going to have
to modify the file that exists again
with this J s we're just gonna change it
to without Josh behaviors now we don't
need to modify our region's that's all
good now the only thing we need to add
here is our base theme so this one says
base theme Omega and that's just added
directly after the description and of
course I don't think the order for that
really matters but you might as well do
it how they have done it now to prove to
you that these are the exact same we can
give her these headers and this white
space and you're gonna see that both of
these are 19 lines long and
pretty much the exact same file despite
we created one by hand and the other was
created by drush I'm gonna add these
back in here just to have them and we
can save this file now I'm actually
gonna want to rename this file so let's
get out of sublime text go back to
finder and we're gonna want to call this
know that sorry we're gonna want to call
this without drush info and this is our
themes info file just like we're used to
having with any other sub theme so we
have LevelUp that info without josh dot
info cool so now what else do we have to
do to get this this whole thing working
well if you're called in our our level
up or without drush info we said that
we're looking for CSS without drush that
normalized well now we need to make
those happen like that
so in here we could just come into these
files and of course you could run a
command to modify all these files names
you could say look through all these
directories and replace a theme
sanitized with your themes name but
since we're not doing this with command
line at all I'm just gonna go ahead and
do these the way we need to do it here
now we also need to change our behaviors
jas file because I was looking for theme
sanitized there and then in addition we
have some of our sass files which are
actually the source files for the CSS
files we previously changed and if we
change these they would compile to the
correct ones but then we would have a
duplicate with the theme sanitized
version so it's you know like I said
installing this with drush is probably
the best way without drush you know make
it a little tedious there we go cool
without drush we're all good so now
let's check our site out now we're just
going to go to performance clear all of
our cache refresh our parents page
scroll down and we should see our theme
under these disabled themes if we enable
it and sets a default
let's come out of here and you could see
we're getting in the white screen of
death now I've gone and checked out the
error log for my PHP error log and it's
telling me that there's an unexpected
bracket Scott's site's level of Drupal
sites all themes without drush process
page process Inc so if we go to process
and then page process Inc you can see
that we're having a function here and it
says theme now we want this to say
without drush now there's other
instances of this happening as well we
have it in the theme settings file as
well you want to make sure function
without drush and then where it said
theme before also in page pre-process
there's going to be function theme here
like this and we can replace that and
save now let's check we refresh our page
and it looks like the same thing that we
saw when we had stub the sub theme with
drush so like I said installing with
drush is definitely the easier way you
don't have to go fishing through files
and stuff like that you don't have to go
changing file names
so dude rush if you can if you can't you
haven't out you could do it this way it
works and we have a working sub theme so
we're going to continue this series
using the sub theme we created with
drush however you can of course continue
to use our without drush sub theme as
well
so I'm gonna said this one is default in
preparation for the next video and I'm
gonna disable the without drush theme so
this series we're going to go for all of
the files that come with this nude rush
theme and what they mean and why they're
there so as always this is Scott with
level of Tut's if you have any questions
or comments leave a comma in the video
or hit us up at Twitter and level up
tubs or Facebook we're all over the
place so let us know what you're
thinking we love to hear from you thanks
