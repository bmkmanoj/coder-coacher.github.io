tutorials and today we're going to show
you how you can create a collection in
meteor so that we can not only store
data in a database but we can retrieve
it from the database we can update it we
can delete it we can change it any sort
of way so it's great about collections
in meteor is that it combines the
front-end and back-end functionality so
that when you're making a modification
to your collection it happens everywhere
so you'll see it happened live on the
screen as well as it's updated in your
database so it's just one of the many
things that meteor does really well to
save you a lot of time so let's get
started on that right now okay so where
we left off is basically we had this
helper that was essentially just gave us
an object with an array full of objects
and then we iterated over that in our
HTML right here and displayed just the
value of the title now what we want to
do is create a collection and now a
collection is essentially a way that you
connect to the database that's running
in the database is MongoDB if you
haven't used Mongo before it's pretty
awesome basically you're storing things
as JavaScript objects retrieving them
and using them is really similar to
working with any sort of JSON now
there's a lot of differences between
MongoDB and other database like my
sequel but we're not going to get into
these videos so take your time to look
up a little bit about Mongo on your own
time so what we're going to do here is
we're going to create a new collection
so I'm going to come to the top of our
page here and I'm going to create a new
collection that's resolutions so the to
do that we just have to make a variable
named resolutions and it's going to be
equal to a new space Mongo dot and then
C is capitalized collection like that
and then in parentheses we're going to
have the name of this collection which
is going to be resolutions
I should've picked a shorter word than
that so okay so we want to finish this
off with a semicolon here okay so now we
have this Mongo collection called
resolutions and we want this template
body helper resolutions to now get our
items not from this object here or this
array of objects we wanted to actually
check the collection itself so the way
we do that let's go ahead and get rid of
that stuff okay the way we do that is by
essentially calling the a function here
so we can say function and parentheses
and then sorry the other brackets there
we go the curly brackets and inside of
this function is going to return and now
it's going to hit this collection and
find one okay and it's actually it's
going to find all of them so if we save
resolutions like that we're using this
variable here I just pasted it in right
here now we want to call the find method
so kind so this is going to search the
collection to find the various records
so inside of parentheses we don't
actually have to have anything here so
we can just finish it off like this and
we can say resolutions find and with no
parameters and we just have a semicolon
at the end here so this is all we need
to display database records into our
template we have a helper which is
resolutions that's grabbing all of the
resolutions that exist within the
MongoDB collection resolutions and that
helper is going to be used the same way
that we have here however you don't have
any collections you can see our page is
totally blank so let's go ahead and add
some collections or at least add one or
two now here's where it's cool we
actually have access to the Mongo
database the MongoDB counsel from meteor
so the way we can do that is head to our
terminal so as you can see I'm in the
root folder of our particular project my
resolutions I can see the meteor folder
and all of the files we've been editing
so now from here we can just type meteor
and then Mongo what this is going to do
is take us into the Mongo console it
tells us MongoDB shell version connected
to our particular meteor app now we can
run commands to our database itself like
insert so we can say DB dot and then we
want to give it the collection which you
remember is resolutions with a lowercase
to make sure I spell this correctly I'm
going to go back to my app here head to
the j/s I'm going to copy this from here
so this is the name of the collection
this lowercase one here paste it in here
so DB dot resolutions and now we're
going to say dot insert ok so since
we're inserting in two resolutions what
we then have is parenthesis and then
curly brackets now we want to be able to
define what's inside of this record what
we had before was a title and so we can
say title colon and then inside of
quotes here we can actually give it a
record so hello resolutions and let's
finish it off with a quote now what we
can also do is give this a created add
date so we can hit comma and let's give
this a other another property here
that's just created at and then note I
have it in camel case of the a is
capitalized colon and then we can simply
say new space and then capital dat date
with parentheses now to finish all this
off we just have a bracket and a closed
parentheses and we can have a semicolon
here too if you'll notice this is really
just JavaScript and
part of the great part about working
with MongoDB is to do an insert all we
have to do is give it say the database
our collection insert and then give it
its properties just like ace normal
JavaScript object okay I'm going to
enter and it gives us no information
however if we pan back to our page
you're going to see immediately without
doing anything this collection has been
shown up on our page so like I said with
the auto refresh it doesn't just work
for editing HTML files or CSS files or
something like that it also works when
you're adding and removing things from a
collection and that is awesome I mean we
added a record to the collection from
terminal and it immediately showed up on
our page without us having to do
anything
in fact we've written uh we've written
what like five lines of JavaScript here
total maybe six lines of JavaScript that
we've written outside of this if is
client and we were able to do some
pretty amazing stuff already the fact
that this is immediately showing up in
fact if we go ahead and if you hit the
up key on your keyboard it's going to
show you the last command you typed
let's go ahead and hit up and then let's
change this and add another one so I'm
just changing the text between the
quotes here resolution number two and
I'm going to hit enter head back to our
page and it's already there okay so if
your mind isn't blown yet it definitely
will be because what's really cool about
this is if somebody else was visiting
this site on the internet or let's say I
had another browser window open or
anything they would see these
collections pop in now obviously there
are situations where you wouldn't want
this to happen and there's ways around
it so don't worry about that however
this is awesome and one of my favorite
things about meteor is just how fast it
is to get something like this up and
running okay so we've now created a
collection we've added things to the
collection through the Mongo interface
in our terminal
and we're pretty much ready to go into
using forms so in the next video what
we're going to do is show you how to
create a form that responds to the
submit that adds a collection to our
database and immediately shows up in our
list from there can go more in depth
about the views and what we can do there
events session variables adding and
removing extra packages a easy easy user
accounts all sorts of stuff as always
this is got with level up tutorials I
can't wait to show you more of meteor
and all of the great things you can
accomplish with it so thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
