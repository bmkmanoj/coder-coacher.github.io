up tutorials and in this video and be
showing you what's essentially like
Emmet is for HTML and CSS JavaScript
snippets is to JavaScript it's a quick
and easy way to add a ton of JavaScript
really quickly so if you're one of those
people that writes a lot of JavaScript
like myself here you'll find yourself
rewriting a lot of things a lot and you
can type something like make sure
Mountain you can type something like
council log right you can type a council
log a hundred times so there's a really
great package for Adam that makes this
really super easy to just sort of reuse
snippets of JavaScript
now if you've used something like Emmet
for HTML and CSS then this is going to
feel right at home but only for
JavaScript we have a package called Java
Script
- snippets now JavaScript snippets is a
really really nice package here you can
see it only has 35,000 installs so not a
ton but a good amount and what you can
see from here is that it's going to
function now that we have these package
installed let's go ahead and restart
Adam now you don't need to restart atom
for every package to work but some you
certainly do so now we can just come
into our JavaScript file and let's try
out some of these snippets for instance
you might be writing something like get
element by ID so we could just type GI
and now you can see we have get element
by ID already written for us now that's
just too easy
now we here's some cool ones we want to
write a loop you've probably written 100
loops we could type in Fe for for each
and now that's going to give us a for
each method or an array here okay now in
addition if we wanted to do F or in we
could do for I and you can see for prop
in object and you can see that it's
basically a for lit a for loop for us
generated without having to do a whole
lot in addition we can have a function
with FN
you can see here or we could even do
something like a set timeout with st as
you can see it's very just common
JavaScript patterns and syntax made easy
for you with some very predictable
keyboard shortcuts I mean what would you
expect counsel log to be we could just
do CL and here we have counsel log
there's also something like CW for
counsel warn we can have something like
us or use strict so basically what I
would suggest to you is if you have an
idea of what a two letter short could
could be for a specific JavaScript
feature just try it out and if it works
then awesome and if it doesn't then
maybe check the documentation in the
package to see if there is in fact a
shortcut for that either way this
package is just too helpful to not
recommend so javascript - snippets all
the way it's going to help you write
faster JavaScript as always this is
