level of Tut's and today I'm going to
show you how to update your Drupal core
if you remember in the past couple of
videos I've been getting this security
update available for drupal message and
if we click on available updates it's
going to have a Drupal core highlighted
in red here and it's going to say that
there's a security update run 7.12 and
it recommends 7.14 so before you get
started i'm going to recommend that you
take a backup of all your files because
what we're going to be doing is removing
all of your files except for the sites
folder so please take this time to take
a backup of all your files once you have
that done please come back to the video
and we'll get started okay so assuming
you have a backup of all your files
we're going to go to configuration here
and we're going to put our site into
maintenance mode maintenance mode is
under development in configuration ok
and we're going to check this I put our
site into maintenance mode click Save ok
we're now in maintenance mode so I've
actually already downloaded downloaded
the latest version of Drupal if you need
to do that you can go to Drupal org
slash project slash Drupal and grab the
latest version I have my files all right
here ok so what I'm actually going to do
is delete every single file in my actual
site folder except for sites if you
recall sites is where you save pretty
much everything your CSS your JavaScript
if you're installing modules is in here
sites all modules so don't delete sites
folder but delete everything else ok now
in the latest version of Drupal that we
downloaded it's seven one four we're
going to grab everything except for the
sites folder and here we're going to
just drag and drop these files in here
ok so now we have the latest version of
Drupal the files are all here now we
need to run the update script on our
site so if we go back to our site look
out of this this okay we can go to our
normal URL slash update PHP
and this is going to take you this
Drupal database update so we're going to
click continue and for pending updates
this is all the stuff that it's updating
you can read more into this but this is
just telling you the exact things that
this security update is doing and that
won't be all of them but that's sort of
like the major things so let's see I'll
just take a second here ok so now that's
run let's go to our administration pages
as you can see we're now back in here
usually after doing a large update I
like to clear the cache you know one of
those things in Drupal is pretty much
clear the cache if ever you're having an
issue that should be your first thing to
check but um so I always like to do that
right after running the updates and now
I'm going to uncheck this put site into
maintenance node save it and we should
have our latest version of Drupal so now
we just have one more step before we're
all done we need to go through and
delete some files so if you remember
when we dragged all these files in here
you can see there's this install it's my
and MySQL txt install and then the
install PHP we can delete we also can
install this or delete this install SQL
Lite install txt we can delete license
txt we can delete maintainer txt let's
see what else can we delete we can also
delete change log txt and then one more
it's just this upgrade txt so we can
just clear these out get rid of them we
don't need them
okay now just to verify of course I
didn't delete anything stupid you can
just click on your site everything's
working fine so that's how you update
your core version of Drupal in Drupal 7
