up tutorials and in this video we're get
started talking about navigation and
pages within Gatsby there are two basic
concepts that we're gonna need to
understand before we move forward so
let's see going on that right now
okay so in this video all we're going to
be doing is creating a new page and
showing you how the page mechanism works
and that's as simple as just coming in
to your pages folder creating a new file
well we'll just simply have a new page
called a bout dot J s now I have a react
snippet library so I could type RCC to
create a new react component if you
don't have one of these there's a whole
host of them nvs code I recommend at
least getting one they probably all do
about the same thing and from here we
could just name our component anything
it doesn't really matter as long as it's
the default export of this file and we
can just call this about now inside of
here we can go ahead and make an h1 just
like we've had before on other pages and
just say about us now I can have a
paragraph tag here and this can be
filled with any sort of lorem ipsum sort
of text I've always been a huge fan of
hipster if somewhere you can find it on
and is hip some dot-com just grab a
paragraph from hipster hipster mist
hipster version of lorem ipsum text okay
love it love it okay now we can come
back to our site and we can actually
browse to the new forward slash about
page now you can see we have a heading
with a paragraph down here now one thing
I want to do since we're actually going
to be building out some kind of a blog
here is give us a way to access this
page now I mentioned before in the last
video that the forward slash about page
title or page comes directly from the
file name inside of our pages folder
let's go ahead and head to the header
which is the index page AZ component
located in components header index okay
and inside of this component you'll see
we have a link which is simply just an
h1 linking
back to forward slash now this is this
is pretty cool all of this stuff is cool
we will change some of this but just
below the last closing div we're going
to have a new nav now if you're using
Emmet you can just hit a nav tab and get
a new nav from here we can have an
unordered list with a couple of list
items but for now we're gonna keep it to
just one list item so I'm gonna have ul
greater than Li I'm using Emmet to
autocomplete that just to save a little
bit of time inside of this list items
I'm going to have what's called a link
now link is going to be well you might
think of it as similar to the react
router link effect if you'll notice up
top here where we're importing is linked
from Gatsby link and you might be
thinking hey link and the syntax link to
a path is very similar to the reactor
outer in fact the link is actually react
router under the hood just like Gatsby
users react router under the hood so the
link component here is going to feel
very familiar if you've done any sort of
react routing so now we're going to say
link to and I'm simply just going to
have a string forward slash about and
the text inside of our link is simply
just going to be about as well
now this nav has no style and that's
okay but we simply just want to go ahead
and get our links up top here so we have
an about link which is just conveniently
blending into the purple color of this
background and instead of worrying about
changing that right now let's go ahead
and actually create a new link in our
links what I want to do is if you're
using vs code you can hold shift and
option with these lines selected and
then hit up on the arrow key to copy all
of these lines and let's go ahead and
just have a home link in Lincoln to
forward slash like this now next I want
to actually head back to our index dot
JSP
to that I'm going to delete the page -
2j s from our pages file entirely just
so we don't have to have that sitting
around okay those we're not using it
right okay so now we have a home page we
can click home we can click about and
you can see the sights really fast I
mean this is so brilliantly fast already
so this is one of these things that I
love about Gatsby now eventually we're
going to be adding on to this list here
or we're gonna have maybe like a blog
post listing or a contact form or
something like that but right now we
just have some basic static stuff going
on here
so absolutely nothing crazy home about
back and forth that's all we've got so
these are pages within Gatsby as you can
see it's as easy as just creating a new
file and opening up that file we kind of
did that in the last video but this time
I wanted to actually well just start to
build out our app a little bit so as
always this is Scott with level of
tutorials as we continue to go this
system is just going to get more and
more complex in different ways and we're
still at the end of the day going to
have a statically built site that runs
faster than anything so check it out
these are pages within Gatsby as always
if you want to complete this series head
on over to level up tutorials comm
forward slash Pro and become a pro to
subscribe to a level of pro get access
to all of this and more there's a ton of
pro exclusive series up there right now
a lot of great stuff or you can purchase
this series out right along with any of
them if subscriptions are in your a
thing so as always this is Scott with
level of tutorials thanks so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
