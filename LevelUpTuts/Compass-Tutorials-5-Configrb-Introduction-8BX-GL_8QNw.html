level up Tut's and today we're gonna be
going over the config our beef file and
the reason why we're gonna be getting
into this now is because in the next
couple of tutorials we're gonna be going
over some stuff like generating sprites
where a compass really needs to know the
organization structure of your project
and by default compass sort of assumed
certain things and let's say your
project is already set up and you've
installed compass into a project that
pre-exists it's not going to necessarily
know where things like your images
folder are so this config RB file tells
compass where then those directories are
located so let me show you where that is
it should have installed in the base of
your compass installation so as you can
see you know when we first installed
this I had my father than a CSS folder
and then when we installed compass it
created the sass and the Style Sheets
folder however if we would have edited
this config data our B file from the
start we could have put our sass files
and our CSS files in any directory or we
could have left them in the same
directory so let's open this up and as
you can see there's various options
specified I've actually gone in here and
told it where my fonts directory is and
I said it's in the folder fonts your
images directory I've told it that it's
in the folder image you'll notice there
was actually is in the fonts directory
there right now I think I might have
hidden this folder okay so there we go
and JavaScript directory we don't have a
JavaScript directory but I usually name
mine Jas so I'm just gonna change this
for fun and our sass directory our CSS
directory and our HTTP path cool so this
isn't all there is to this config dot RB
file in fact there's tons of
configuration properties the chances are
you won't need to touch a lot of these
especially if you're just doing sort of
basic implement
of this and you just want to tell
compass where your images and your
JavaScript and everything is living so
you know as far as touching this just be
aware that it exists and you don't
always have to have your images or your
assess or your style sheets in the
consoled errs that they've given you by
default and if you're using something
like code kit which is an application
that will compile and watch your compass
or sass files for you and even minify
them on output come error code kit will
actually ask you where the locations of
these things are and fill out this
config RB file for you when you're
initializing your project and saying hey
I'm using compass so in the next lesson
we're going to start getting into
sprites and and that's going to be
important because it's going to be
looking in this image directory so if
your image directory is not set
correctly it won't know where to find
those images and that could be a
problematic issue for you so that's it
for this config RB file I suggest
reading over this documentation there's
really too much to go over in this
tutorial other than just to know that
this stuff exists and if you want a
point to compass add your files this is
where you do it okay I'll see you in the
next lesson where we do sprites with
compass once again this is Scott will
level up Tut's and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
