up tutorials and in this video I'm going
to show you how you can have your own
wiki for your project now we can even
manage a swiggy through a visual
interface where you're typing directly
in the browser or you can actually write
this on your own machine and push up to
your gitlab and have it so you're doing
everything locally so this is going on
that right now so one of the areas that
Ghaleb really shines in is the wiki
feature so if we scroll down here we can
check out this little book here where
I'm in the project view remember how I
said to sort of be cognizant of what
view yeren
so I'm in the project view I'm gonna
select wiki and you can see we have a
pretty basic wiki page notice how you
can use the format as our doc esky doc
markdown I like markdown I'm gonna keep
it that way and we can do things like
welcome actually let me make this a
pound welcome to this wiki okay let's go
ahead and just create page now you'll
notice we have a single page we also
have a tab for pages where you can see
which pages we have access to let's go
ahead and make a new page here I'm gonna
have another one and it's asking for the
page slug and what's funny is that how
to set up is a great suggestion so how
to set up how to get going how to
install any of that stuff click create
page we can just say run and then npm
install this stuff okay just like that
let's go ahead and create another page
here now you'll notice we have the home
page up here we don't have any other
pages but if you click pages you can see
them both here now we can link to any of
these pages let's go ahead and click
Edit and you can see that we can link to
these pages simply with the page slug so
let me just copy this and paste it right
here and
can just be how to install okay and the
page I believe was how to set up I know
that it's confusing to set up but either
way all we have to do is link to the
slug right here and we can click Save
Changes now we have a link you can
select this and as you can see it does
take us directly to this page in the
wiki now this is just really super handy
because I mean we just created a couple
of pages and this is just so much better
than a readme of you have a lot of stuff
in your project is pretty large for
instance a lot of my projects are pretty
large and if somebody were to come in
they'd be scrolling forever and a wiki
they'd be scrolling forever and a readme
so having a wiki with everything you
need to know about the codebase is a
great idea now in addition just creating
new pages editing deleting them seeing
their history any of that stuff we also
get access here so let's select get
access and as you can see we have a very
specific URL here a git path here and
now this does say to install this column
thing which is a gem which basically I'm
sure it's just going to set up some sort
of server but you absolutely don't need
this to just edit this wiki on your site
in fact if you can read markdown which
you should be able to then you can just
simply grab this directory after cloning
let's go test wiki drop it into your
text editor and let's check it out it's
really just gonna be a couple of
markdown files in a gift folder you can
see that we have this how to set up and
we have this run npm this stuff and then
we can let's actually expand this to say
npm in stall more stuff just to stick
with this theme here okay but as you can
see i've made a modification to the wiki
i can come to that directory and i could
to get add dot get commit - m update up
dates install
okay and now we can do get push and as
you can see it's updated and pushed to
the master now and we head to our git
lab install I can come to the pages
let's select how to set up and you can
see that our updates been pushed so if
you're like me and you like to edit this
stuff on your local machine in your text
editor where all your tools that you
like to use your hair instead of some
sort of a online text editor or an
online mark down editor then this is
definitely for you the wiki tools in
here are really super nice and as you
can see we can click page history here
and we can see that I updated it updates
here's the commit message less than a
minute ago page version here it goes you
can even go back and view old page
versions if you'd like so all the good
stuff is here for working with wiki's on
your project and if you come back to our
page here although the wiki doesn't
necessarily appear right here it's
always going to show up and the sidebar
as the book if you wanted to and your
readme you could always link to the wiki
just with the URL address up top cool so
this is a wiki this is how you can add
and edit it all on your home local thing
if you want to add another page you can
simply just create a new markdown page
in the same directory and it will handle
it accordingly
actually let's go ahead and do that I'm
just going to say new file and let's
just say new file dot MD we can have
this be hello
save it let's do again get add dot git
commit and adds new page these are
terrible commit messages by the way so
don't mimic this get push and we can
have this be pushed up and as you can
see our new files up there we can head
we can click pages and just like that we
have new file which is a markdown and it
has our hello this is just super easy we
don't have to
register this page anywhere and we
didn't have to do clicking around an
interface anywhere so this is why the
wiki tools in the git lab are so so nice
to work with so as always this is Scott
