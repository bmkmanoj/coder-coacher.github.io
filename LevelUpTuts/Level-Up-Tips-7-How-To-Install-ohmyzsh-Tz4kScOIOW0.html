of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
oh my zsh now oh my zsh like it says
here is an open source community driven
framework for managing your zsh
configuration and now what does that
mean right
so Z SH is Z shell um it's basically an
alternative to using bash and it's a
powerful scripting language right so
basically you're when you type in your
commands in terminal usually you're
using bash right but zsh is just a
little bit different and in fact if
you've seen some tutorials and their
terminal is looking like this with a
whole bunch of helpful information like
this particular theme is telling you not
only what directory but what branch
you're on right for your git repo and
these themes are actually not just you
know color schemes but there are a whole
lot of useful information as well now
there's also plugins for oh my zsh that
do all sorts of awesome auto completion
and in zsh as a whole with oh my zsh is
just a really desirable experience it
does some insane auto completing for you
and I find it to just really really
boost my productivity in fact when I
have to go back to using bash I'm
usually quite upset just because I've
grown Sona
so accustomed to using oh my zsh so what
we want to do is we want to run this
automatic installer and basically we can
just copy and paste this curl command
right here and I'm going to paste it
right into my terminal and it's going to
go ahead and download it and looks like
it's telling us I need to agree to this
license if you have Xcode install that I
guess I do I don't need or I need to run
another command here and what I could do
is I could simply open up Xcode and
agree to their on their permissions and
everything like that or I can just run
this sudo exocrine
command and it's basically going to
bring up their license agreement yeah
okay hit enter okay let's get q4 quit
okay
now by typing agree I'm agreeing to it
now I'm just going to rerun this curl
command now you can see it's cloning in
and basically it's asking for my
password and it looks like oh my Z SH
has installed cool so it changed my
shell and you'll notice this doesn't
look any different though now it only
starts using z SH or Z shell once you've
restarted your terminal window so I'm
going to head go ahead and close this
window and now reopen up AI term and now
you'll notice that it looks different
right we have this arrow and this tilde
and this is based on the theme that
we're using now you might be wondering
okay we installed this this looks a
little bit different but will my
commands that I'm used to running still
work LS it still works now you just get
a nice theme and pretty much every
single command you go to run is going to
be just like you remember it now what
happens if we want to configure this
well I'm going to be making another
video where I show you a little bit more
in depth on how to configure oh my oh my
Z Sh but we can type in LS - LA and I'm
in my user directory right now my
current user directory and you'll see
this file dot Z SHR see now that Xia
sage RC is where all of the magic if our
configuration happens if we just say
them dot Z SHRC you can see that this is
what the configuration file looks like
it's telling us where the theme is or
what theme we're using and of course we
will show you how to use different theme
it's showing you basically alias
examples so you can write your own
aliases which I highly suggest you do I
will show you a couple the aliases that
I like to use and down here we have
plugins right now the get plug-in is the
only plug-in we're using now notice we
have plugins formats you can just enter
them as text here and it tells you that
the various available plugins can be
found here so check those out and you
can simply just add them to this file in
that format if you like but we're going
to talk about that in another video too
so I'm going to get out of here by
hitting escape and then a colon W or
colon just Q and then I'm out so now I'm
using zsh with oh my z SH and uh and and
I can take advantage of all of the great
features that it allows so as always
this is Scott with level up touch if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video hit us up at Twitter
or Facebook I know that installing oh my
zsh can sometimes be a little bit tricky
but uh this is a brand new system it's
running Mavericks and you could see with
relatively little issue I had a Xcode
issue but other than running that that
command it worked so of you having
errors or something papa
post them in the comments or google them
I'm sure many other people have had
those errors as well so check it out try
out
oh my zsh I'm a big fan and it's one of
the first things I set up when I get a
new computer so as always this is Scott
with level up tuts if you have any
questions or comments so please leave a
comment the video or hit us up at
Twitter or Facebook or the level of form
let us know what you think we love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
tutorial videos are going to resume

more videos on the way as always</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
