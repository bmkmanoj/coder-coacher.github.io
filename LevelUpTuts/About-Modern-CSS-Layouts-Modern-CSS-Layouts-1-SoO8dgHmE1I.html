up tutorials and in this series we're
going to be covering modern CSS layouts
now what we're going to be doing is
building layouts such as Facebook
Instagram tweet deck and my own personal
site using different techniques from
flexbox to CSS grid viewport units CSS
variables all sorts of latest and
greatest stuff so let's take a look at
some of the examples that we're gonna be
building and talk a little bit about how
this series is going to be laid out so
as you can see here what we're gonna be
doing is building several different
layouts using CSS grid and a flex box
now some of these are going to be
looking familiar to you now I should
mention that these layouts aren't always
trying to encapsulate the exact
functionality of Facebook for instance
Facebook has some things where they have
sticky columns that are using JavaScript
and stuff like that
but for instance we have some various
layouts here that are going to be
extremely helpful when you're developing
websites so you could see we have a
Facebook style layout with a scrollable
center area and two fixed columns we
also have an Instagram layout that is
going to adjust and check out this
profile information just how much it
changes upon media break points this is
all being accomplished with CSS grid now
we're also building some really cool
interfaces like that of TweetDeck where
we have individual scrollable columns
fixed headers and a sidebar over here
with a sort of odd grid shape so
definitely some really cool stuff and
we're even at taking CSS grit to rebuild
my own a personal site in a way that you
have never seen before this is going to
be using some really cool techniques to
have a full-screen background image and
place all of these things using flexbox
and CSS grid this code is really super
nice so if you want to learn how to
build awesome things with CSS grid
flexbox and modern CSS properties then
this is the series for you so fire up
the next few videos and check out some
of the basics of these techniques if you
want to learn all of these layouts head
