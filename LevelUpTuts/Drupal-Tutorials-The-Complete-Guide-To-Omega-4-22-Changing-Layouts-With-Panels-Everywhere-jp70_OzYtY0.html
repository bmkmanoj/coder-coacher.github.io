huts and today we're to continue talking
about panels panels everywhere in
relation to Omega 4 and in in the last
video we basically just got our way out
working sort of a catch-all every single
page on our site is going to be using
this layout and you notice that we turn
on the logo in the search bar but now we
need to sort of put our page back
together and it's actually really easy
to do that and remember this is a panels
anywhere so this is not like our main
content this is the page right so we're
in our default layout if we came to
structure panels and then default site
template you could also click Edit
that's where I am so this is the basic
sidebar layout that we created and if we
click around here you can sort of see
these menus that we've been on before if
you're not familiar with panels it is
and like I tried to stress in the last
video this isn't about panels more about
using Omega and panels so if you don't
recognize this stuff don't worry just
sort of click through get yourself
familiarized with your stuff and then
once it's working take some time to
experiment that's I feel like that's the
best way to truly understand some of
this stuff and so we have basically our
layout here that we're using as the
sidebar and our content so in the
content area let's click this little
gear here let's add a Content and we're
going to add the node actually let's do
page elements and this is going to be
page content so all the stuff that would
normally go in our main like content is
going to be in this little block here
what's cool about this is this allows us
to basically it allows us to use a panel
for this main page content already
within here and then we can further
dictate how that stuff is output so now
in footer we can add another m and let's
just add something stupid like the
powered by drupal and it's not stupid
but it's just insignificant okay do need
to belittle the powered by drupal cool
so if you'll notice on the homepage
where we didn't have any content we just
have the part by drupal nothing
also sort of there but on our test page
wow we have our test page 1 title along
with the text itself and then powered by
drupal what's cool is that when we
approach this not logged in I have no
idea what's going on here I'm sorry I'm
using there we go you can see this lines
up perfectly and it's exactly what we
had before the search process absent
probably because permissions by default
are set up that way but pretty cool and
we also had some sort of main navigation
if you remember so let's come to this
page for our site template and in the
first sidebar to click this we can add
content and let's add the let's go to
menus we'll just click main menu okay
and now let's update and save here's our
page it's back to what we had before
perfect all good and of course because
it's using our layout code nice and
responsive just like we had it doing the
exact same stuff it was doing before
perfect so now how do we show a
different page layout for the homepage
right well we can do this in our default
site template by adding a new variant
and let's say add a variant and this is
going to be home page and this is also
going to be a panel but we need
selection rules so let's check this
selection rules and create variant and
now we want to say if this is a notice
how we can say this is the front page
just in this drop down here and let's
click Add and we don't want to check
this reverse box because we want to say
if it's the front page use this template
okay all criteria must pass sure we only
have one so it doesn't matter let's
click continue and let's say Omega page
layouts we're going to select home let's
click continue and again let's disable
all Drupal blocks and regions now let's
click continue
once more and now we have this just like
last time and you know we could do
things where we're creating a mini panel
for the header and footer and stuff like
that and in fact we should probably do
that but for now let's take this and
let's say again we want to have these
page elements we want to have the site
logo and maybe just to have it be a
little bit different in the content we
can put the user profile for the
currently logged in user just so we can
definitely confirm that besides the
layout change this is using a different
layout so let's click create variant ok
now the variants been creative created
and now update and save it so now you'll
notice we have basic sidebar and layout
in homepage but if you were to come to
our home page and refresh you're still
going to be getting this this two column
layout that's non front page layout and
that's actually because the way these
things are evaluated here are variants
it's sort of like an if statement so
even though this one's looking for the
homepage it's going to get all of these
ones in the basic sidebar see that
there's no special circumstance to
display this one and it's just going to
display it so what we need to do is up
top here on the right reorder variants
now we want to put homepage on the top
update and save now it's going to act
like an if statement it's going to say
our way on the homepage if yes then show
this home page layout if not then just
show this sidebar layout so now on the
homepage we have this layout it's
showing my user account my user account
information remember for one month on
three weeks when we started this course
and now for on this test page beautiful
we still have this layout so now here
we're using both of our our layouts and
it's within panels and panels everywhere
and if we wanted to do some more stuff
in panels it's pretty much just like how
you use panels before if we go to
structure panels you could create a new
panel page and you know have everything
within their but the layout itself is
going to be determined by the panels
everywhere and you can create your Omega
layouts based on that so as always this
is scott with level of Tut's if you have
any questions or comments please leave a
comment in the video below let us let us
know on Twitter or Facebook or anything
what you're thinking I hope this is
helpful we have a layout now switching
with panels and panels everywhere and
and that is a pretty fantastic so as
always this is got with level of Tut's
and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
