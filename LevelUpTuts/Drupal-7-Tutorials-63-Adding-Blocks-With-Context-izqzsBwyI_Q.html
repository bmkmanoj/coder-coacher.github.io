of Tut's and today we're going to be
talking about context in Drupal and
we're going to using the latest version
of context so at the point of this
tutorial the latest version is 7x and
then 3.0 betas sex so this is version
3.0 essentially of a context for Drupal
7 and what context is is it's a very
important module that I feel like is
used on a considerable amount of sites
and so context allows you to define
conditions to modify things basically
you give it some sort of a definition
based on it's this path or this type of
node and then you're able to do various
things based on that so if we want to do
have a specific layout or something only
for the about page we could say the
about page if the path is slash about
then we're going to do something so it's
almost like setting rules however rules
is an entirely different module which
we'll go over at some point in the
future
so what's cool about context is if
you're using it in addition to the Omega
theme there's actually a special module
called Delta that allows you to do some
really really great stuff and almost
specifying entire new layouts and new
responsive patterns for different types
of pages which is really really powerful
and we'll get into that in a little bit
but first we're just going to show you a
super basic example so as you can see I
have context and it comes with a couple
of other modules which you're going to
need context UI because without the UI
it's it's just not there and you don't
really need context layout but enable it
because there's some cool stuff in there
too but yeah context UI you can't use it
really without the UI so let's come in
here and we're gonna go to structure and
then context is just right here and you
can see I have a context already made
for the project
Paige and this is actually doing what I
just described it's having a delta
so you'll notice on the about page here
if I show you the blocks we have the
sidebar second in this main content
however when you go to projects that
sidebar is nowhere to be found
and this content takes up the entire
width that's because I wanted these
images to take up the entire width here
so like I said we're not going to do
that this time but we are going to
modify some other things using context
so let's click Add here and one of the
first thing frustrating things about
context is its name has to be its
machine name so lowercase letters just
maybe keep the the name short and sweet
so we're just gonna call this one test
for right now just so I can and you know
keep track of it for later this is a
test in the descriptions where you can
give it a little bit more information
and now we have this checks box but
we're going to skip that for a second
and we're just going to look at these
conditions and reactions so the
condition is something that must be met
for this context change to happen so if
you click on the conditions you'll see
what sort of options we have views so if
it's a particular view page you can do
something a user page a particular user
role taxonomy term path text out of me
itself a node type menu our context so
there's a lot of stuff here but I think
these when a grasp is just path so path
is the same as sort of your blocks right
so if we want to do something to the
about page we would just want to grab
the about path which is really just
slash about and if I had other pages in
this about section if this was a larger
site we could have it be about slash and
then asterisk to catch anything that's a
subpage of about and this is I don't
have that I'm not gonna worry about this
but I'm gonna throw it in there just in
case there's any particular situation
that ever would arise that I wanted to
have a you know more about pages with
other information so I'm gonna I'm gonna
have this just like this mostly as an
example for you and then we
reactions and based on the word reaction
you can probably guess that this is the
stuff you may just make this a little
bit larger this is the stuff that
happens after this condition is met so
you're on the about page this is what's
going to happen notice how you have
options blocks which is allows you to
add a block breadcrumb which allows you
to set the breadcrumbs you can give the
page a class and stuff like that you can
specify regions if we click on menu you
can see the menu active class using
context so you can give this particular
menu an active class so it's pretty darn
cool it allows for all sorts of stuff
you might not see some of these options
like Delta because that's a separate
module but let's try one out here let's
add a block and you'll notice we have
all of our our regions here all of our
areas so we can add something to the
main content and to do that it's
actually sort of weird down here you
have to click a checkbox so let's see
what sort of blocks we can have let's
find one that'll be really obvious if it
wasn't there before let's say we want
the featured product block to be on this
content area on the about page we'll
click Add button and then now you'll see
it shows up under content so even though
this block is told only to show up on
the front page in the blocks section
this context is going to ignore that so
let's click Save now let's come to our
about page I'm going to refresh and
here's our about page and down here is
our featured product our project I've
apologized so this is a context at its
most basic here we're just adding a
block using context cool we'll feel free
to play around with context there's a
lot of options here in the next video
I'm going to show you how using other
extension modules onto context you can
accomplish even more
as always this is Scott with level up
Tut's if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video hits
a pictorial level of Tut's we're also on
Facebook we post there as much as
possible we get to your emails as soon
as we possibly can it's really just me
answering emails here so yeah please
don't be upset if you don't get a
response back immediately because I'm
getting to those as absolutely fast as I
can so as always this is Scott to let's
pee and thanks for watching
