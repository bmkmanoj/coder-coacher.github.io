Louisville up tuts
and today I'm going to show you how to
use imce and imce WYSIWYG bridge to add
an image upload field to your WYSIWYG
editor so this is different than the
field that we used before where we made
an image field and then we just chose to
insert it into our WYSIWYG this is an
actual built-in file uploader into the
WYSIWYG so it's a little bit more
advanced but a little bit more
functional so the first thing I want to
go to is drupal.org slash project and
then the module name is imce we're gonna
go ahead and just download the latest
one and then also we need this WYSIWYG
bridge this is what gets imce talking to
your WYSIWYG so we'll just click
download here on our sip as you can see
it only supports ckeditor f-ck editor
and tiny MCE right now since we're using
CK editor if you follow along with the
videos before then you should be totally
fine so let me just install those
modules I'm just gonna put those in
these sites all modules folders if you
remember from before
unzip these okay let's throw them in
there and our modules folder
okay now let's enable by modules just
scroll down we can see them let me just
Dad okay so imce
is here and then we just need the
WYSIWYG Bridge which is under user
interface we'll click to enable that
let's save this configuration so now to
get this working we're gonna have to
configure it let's scroll down to our
IMC module right here and there's a
little gear with configure we'll click
on that and here you're going to say so
here if you notice we have a couple of
things and this might be confusing if
it's your first time in however we have
configuration profiles enroll profile
assignments if you notice this profile
name is user one if you are the user
that installed Drupal you are user one
and that is it no one else is user one
this is just a profile name for these
configurations so if you see this a site
maintenance account is set to user 1 if
you
all administrators on your site to also
use that same thing we would select user
one since we do you know if you want if
you have other users if you have other
types of users like let's say you have
specific content editors that are only
going to be editing content what you can
do is you can create a new profile and
set that all up for them so let's
actually click this edit here we're not
going to create a new one but we'll edit
so you can see what kind of options are
available so of course you can give your
profile a name you can have a maximum
file upload size so let's say you don't
want users uploading gigantic images to
take up space on their website you can
give it a megabytes limit you can give
the directory a quota so if you have
these uploading into a specific
directory you can make sure that they
don't upload a certain amount total user
quota in megabytes permitted file
extensions right now we're pretty much
allowing anything by with using this
star here and just like these there is
no quota or maximum file size because
they're all set to 0 we can have a
maximum image resolution right now it's
1200 by 1200 so that's no big deal I
don't think I'll be uploading anything
larger than that and then our maximum
number of files per operation of course
we're going to keep this as unlimited
because right now I want to be able to
upload as many images as I feel please
do so now it's going to ask for a
directory so this is the directory that
the files the images are going to upload
into so this file needs to be something
that has proper permissions so that it
can be accepting images so if we want to
use our image folder let's go to my file
structure let's go back here so if we
just want to create an image folder
we'll just create a new folder I'll just
do it IMG and then we can say that it's
going to be root IMG that these files
are going to be uploaded to if we have
any problems with that it's going to let
us know so thumbnails it's going to tell
you the size medium large you can change
these if you like we'll leave them and
we'll just click Save
okay so changes have been saved okay
we're all good here okay so now let's
add this imce button to our WYSIWYG to
do that let's go back into our
configuration and then we're gonna look
at WYSIWYG profiles so we're gonna click
on full HTML edit because full HTML is
the WYSIWYG profile that we're using so
we're gonna set this up and we're just
gonna click buttons and plugins here if
you remember this is where you turned on
which items you want it to show up in
your WYSIWYG so we have to turn on two
things in here we have to turn on image
in then imce so we'll just click image
and then imce right here and then let's
save this so now that we saved this we
should be able to use our imce let's go
to some content I'm just at this this
first article that we made here and if
you see now there's an image button
right here so if we select this it's
going to bring up this menu this menu
allows us to do a couple things send an
inline width and height allow you to add
a border horizontal split space vertical
space to set the alignment alternate
text or you can actually have your URL
let's say you want to have an image
that's already in your image upload
directory you can browse your server and
find it well let's say we want to add a
link lets click browse server and it's
gonna bring up this file browser window
here you can see our directory root
image and it's asking if we want to
refresh it because i just clicked on it
but this is where our images are going
to be stored on our site if you notice
here there's an upload button let's
click this upload you know let's choose
a file and I'm not sure I have any great
image files or she' let's take a
screenshot really quick okay now there
should be a screenshot right here let's
use that we'll click upload and we're
gonna create thumbnails forward to while
we do and just click upload here okay
so the image was resized because 1200 by
1200 was what we had the maximum set as
if you remember before you can now see
we have our screenshot our small medium
and large we're just going to use this
large one and we're going to click
insert image actually let's use the
large one we don't need this giant one
for this example so let's click in
image here and then we can just click
okay here under advanced tabs you can
add an ID or a class and link you can
set it be linking something however
we're not so let's just click OK and as
you can see our image is right here it's
now in our post and we didn't have to
add an extra image field also you can
set up more advanced profiles to see who
gets access to this field on your site
so that's how to upload images and
browse your server for the ones you've
already uploaded using imce and imce
WYSIWYG bridge once again this is Scott
with level up tuts and thanks for
