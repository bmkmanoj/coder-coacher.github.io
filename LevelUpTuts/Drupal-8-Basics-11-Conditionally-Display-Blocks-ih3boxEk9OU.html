up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you how to conditionally show
in height blocks perhaps you only want a
block to show up on one particular pager
for maybe one type of user so we're
gonna be covering that right now now
let's talk about some further block
manipulation in control let's say we
only want the tools block to show up on
the home page now this isn't exactly a
practical example but as you can see
when we go into a particular post or
even onto another page you can see that
the tools block is there let's go ahead
and click configure block and you notice
this is a block menu so as different
from the powered by Drupal block we have
this menu levels and in past versions of
Drupal menu block was an additional
module you had to add on to Drupal and
Drupal 8 it's been added into core and
that's a great thing because now we can
say start at the initial menu level and
have unlimited menu levels deep
now this isn't totally obvious because
we only have one menu item in this menu
and that's why it's just showing up
however in future videos this menu
levels will become important let's go
ahead and scroll down to pages let's
click on this tab and let's go ahead and
say show for the listed pages for
instance we only want this to show on
the front page now you'll notice it says
front is the front page and you only
want to enter one path per line and the
asterisk is a wild-card for instance if
you wanted to show up on any user page
you could type forward slash user
forward slash asterisks now that would
show up on every single user account
page so any URL that had the beginning
user string user and then ended with
anything else this would show up however
front is a little bit different you
might think hey we'll put this forward
slash here and that's the front page not
the case we actually need to say less
than front greater then
now what this is going to say is that
this black is only going to show up on
the front page let's click Save black
and you'll notice on the about Us page
there's no tools because the URL path is
no longer the front page in fact if we
come to the front page you'll see tools
here we come into a post it's not there
either
let's say we wanted that the opposite to
be true we wanted this to only show up
on every page that's not the front page
we can come back to configure block
pages and now here all we need to do is
negate this condition so it says hide
for the listed pages so now is only
going to hide on the front page save the
block once more and as you can see on
the home page it's hidden about us we
have tools and just like wise any other
post or anything like that will have
tools as well now let's say we only
wanted this to show up on this one
specific post
we have the URL which is just node two
I'm just gonna copy the end of the URL
here let's head to configure block let's
go to pages I'm going to now replace
this with forward slash node forward
slash two and I'm going to check this
negate the condition show four listed
pages so we're going to show only on
forward slash node forward slash two
let's go ahead and click Save black here
now as you can see on this particular
page we have tools on home we have no
tools on my edited post tools about us
no tools so as you can see these view
options for where your particular block
is posted is super powerful you can have
as many things listed here as you'd like
if we wanted this to show up on node 1
and node 2 you just put it on another
line like so and you could keep going
down for as many as you'd like or if you
want it to show up on every node you
could just use the asterisks like so now
this is going to be something that
you'll use over and over and over again
so make sure that you have a good
understanding about
how you can add your pages to the
display for your particular blocks now
you can modify this for any single block
on your site and that can be very very
powerful so this is how you can choose
where your blocks display on your site
and how they're displayed as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments have a
coming the video r me up at twitter or
facebook at level up tutorials I'd love
to hear from you thanks for watching
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
