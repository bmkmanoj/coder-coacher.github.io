of Hudson today we're gonna build on
what we did last time and we had this if
statement going and it was basically
just checking these two values for
Sankey if 3 is greater than or equal to
3 then I'll put something and that's
cool because 3 is greater than or equal
to 3 let's do this with a variable
instead because it's a little bit more
fun so I'm going to make a variable and
it's just gonna be var and this is going
to be val val is going to be equal to 3
right and so now we can replace this 3
with Val
so if Val is greater than or equal to 3
which it is then output bill is cool so
that's great cool but what happens if we
wanted to say you know let's make Val
let's make it 2 right so now 2 is less
than 3 it's not greater than or equal to
3 but we still wanted to output
something oops and we wanted to help put
something different then if it were died
just output you know Bill is cool so we
want this to say Scot is cool if this
value is incorrect so if we were to have
this say like Scot is cool right here
what would happen is no matter what it
would say bill is cool because I mean if
this equaled true then it would say bill
is cool and then it would say Scott is
cool but we won't only say this if this
is false so how do we specify that well
we can use something like an else so
after this first bracket here you're
gonna have a space and you type else and
then you'll do two more brackets just
like that and then we're gonna put this
other Council log inside of here
so now this is going to if Val is
greater than or equal to 3 it's going to
output something however if it's not
it's going to output something else
so since val is equal to 2 it would
check this here say false and say else
scott is cool so you can think of it
this just as like a sentence if bla bla
bla
otherwise do this and so this is this
otherwise here we're having this here
well you can have even more control over
that what happens if you want another
check right so what if you want to say
if value is greater than 0 output bill
is cool ok and now we want to say else
if value is we want to say if value is
less than 0 and so now this is going to
say otherwise value is less than 0
output Scott is cool now if we have
value is equal to 0 we're gonna want
another else in here and this is going
to say console dot log no no one is cool
at all cuz if I'm not cooling though
isn't that cool ok so check it out so
basically this is checking this value
first if not then it's going to this
statement if not then it's going to this
as its total fall back so that's pretty
cool now we have the ability to not only
check something but have a condition if
it doesn't pass that first condition and
then it can check that second condition
and you know what you could keep
stringing these ifs along so it could
say else if this else if this else if
this and just keep on going right and in
fact there's actually a way that
JavaScript and most coding Lang would
just make this really easy on you and
that way is something called a switch
statement and we're gonna be going over
a switch statement in the next video so
hang tight and we're going to do an
extended else if sort of situation using
a switch statement so those up with this
is Scott with a level of Tut's if you
have any
questions or comments hit us up on
Twitter Facebook Lester what you're
thinking we always love to hear from you
thanks for watching and check us out the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
