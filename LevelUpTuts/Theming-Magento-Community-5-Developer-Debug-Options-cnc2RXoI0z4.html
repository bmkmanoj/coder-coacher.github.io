Tut's and in the last lesson I showed
you about modifying template files in
Magento well right now you may be
thinking how do I know this was in page
HTML header as the template file to
modify this header information well in
fact if we go into our template our file
structure you'll see there's a ton of
template files so how could you possibly
know where everything is going to be for
instance if you want to modify a
product's page you may not think to look
in catalog product view and then it is
depending on which of the items here we
have media includes the the content for
our image and attributes includes the
content for our attributes at the cart
so these things may not be totally
obvious how do you know which ones to
edit well luckily Magento has included
some developers tools into the site to
allow that things discovering these
template files to be much easier so to
do this we need to go into our
configuration you're going to go to
system configuration and we're going to
go down all the way down at the bottom
and it says developer so now in here we
actually need to change the
configuration scope of our site we want
this to be main website because we won't
actually have the options that we need
under default config so change to the
website you want to edit for us we just
have this one website it's going to be
main website so let's open all these up
we don't have to look at this right now
but under debug you'll see this template
path hits you want to turn that on and
add block names to hits you can turn
that on as well however we won't be
going over that in this lesson now let's
save this and you'll notice when we
refresh our page there's going to be a
whole lot of information on here so
there's all these red boxes one of which
gives you some ideas about where the
layout file is going to be and others
give you information about what template
it's using so you'll see on the
right-hand mage page block HTML header
cool well this information is giving us
some clues about the layouts however
let's look at here it gives us the
direct path to the template file that's
looking at so front-end level up default
template page HTML header which is
exactly what we needed to have
let's also modify something else let's
change this right here let's inspect
this tag line that what do you want to
buy right now it's just a paragraph tag
we want this to be something different I
want this to be an h3 this out this is
going to be you know important text here
it's more than just a welcome message I
want it to be you know big and bold okay
so let's check this out if we'll notice
in here we can see it's actually in our
header PH tml file so let's come back to
this file and it means the welcome
message must begin here so we can see
here it is P with a class of welcome
message let's change this to an h3 save
this we can refresh our page and then
now see our what do you want to buy is
now presented as an h3 well this is
important for the layout of the site
it's important because I believe this
information is more important than just
a paragraph tag so semantically it
should have an h3 ok well let's say we
wanted to do something else let's say we
wanted to go to a particular product
page so I'll just click on any of these
we'll click on the Sony Vaio and once
this loads here we can have our product
information and let's say we wanted this
to not say details we want this to say
product information well this is under
front-end base default template catalog
product view description ok so what you
might want to do is you might feel like
getting lazy and coming in here and
going to this
Act file base default let's see base
default template catalog product view
and description and you might just want
to start editing this file well you
could just edit this file and these
changes would show up on your site but
this is not how you want to do it
because these files are core files for
Magento and if you edit and modify these
details when Magento updates
you could be overriding the changes that
you've made which can dispel huge
disasters for your site so what you
always want to do is create a copy of
the file in the same folder structure
just like we did the last time
so here before we add template page and
this time we're just going to do
template product and then in here we're
going to have a new folder that is going
to be view actually I believe this needs
to be in catalog
so let's kept a log and let's dump this
product inside here okay product catalog
product view and then the file is a
description dot P HTML okay we're now
going to open this in sublime text and
you can use whatever text editor you're
most familiar with but I would probably
recommend sublime text or text made or
one of those everybody has their
favorites so whatever works best for you
so inside of here here's our our product
description and this is PHP echo this
details well you know we could do a
number of things here you could just
change the text inside of this or you
could just delete this if you don't if
you're never going to worry about
heading this you just wanted to be
static text in your file that's
perfectly fine we could say product and
formation okay now let's come back to
our site let's refresh this and as we
would expect it says product information
well that's perfect that's exactly what
we want and now we know that if we ever
need to modify anything in one of these
files we can just come in to the
template that it's
referencing here and get that
information out put our own code in do
what we want and some of these template
files are going to be a little crazy
especially if you don't know PHP so um
if it's more than just basic modifying
of these templates like we're doing here
changing product information let's say
we wanted to make some heavy adjustments
to how many the way the products are
displaying in the product listing per
the different categories right like if
we go to cell phones you'll see how
they're listing out here what if we
wanted to modify this in some way well
let's actually take a look at this
template file and scroll all the way up
and you'll notice that it's going to be
in catalog category view so let's model
let's check out this template and you'll
soon begin to see if you're not familiar
with PHP this could get a little
complicated for you so let's go to view
and let's open this up and let's scroll
down and here actually actually this
isn't even the right one let's go back
to our site I'm sorry it's product list
sometimes it's a little hard to see
exactly what these red boxes are
encapsulating but it's product list and
so that's catalog product list HTML
let's open this up and these are really
just HTML files with PHP in them and
there's a lot of code in here and some
of this just might look like a complete
mess to you if you're not familiar with
PHP if you know PHP great you can even
use some of this code to modify and get
it to do exactly what you want without
necessarily learning a lot of Magento's
way of doing things other things are
going to be much more complex some of
the things that Magento does isn't
really the same way as you'd see with
other products so it's something that
you want to just take a look at and
maybe if you can't modify it that's the
point when you maybe want to either some
by your design or contact a PHP
developer or somebody is more familiar
with Magento score inter-workings so
that they can modify this PHP for you so
as you can see these template files
range from very simple to exceedingly
complex just to output exactly what
Magento needs to output but if you don't
know any PHP it's not a huge deal
because you can actually modify so much
just by knowing CSS the default layouts
are pretty good so if you don't need to
change into this template stuff and you
can just CSS it there's all sorts of
different ways you can make this content
look it just may be stuck into quite a
bit of the same grid or whatever they're
using here also if you have really good
eyes you may have noticed that this test
that we got rid of in the last lesson
actually popped up right here again well
we can find out how that is you can see
it is still looking in the same template
so we really must have missed something
there let's go back to our HTML and
let's look at this inside of here we
have our logo this is where we're
looking before however this was wrapped
in an if statement this is saying if
this is the homepage then output this
however else output uh this which is
actually including the same strong tag
that we didn't want before so we're
going to have to get rid of that there
to save it and now on inside pages we'll
also get rid of that test perfect okay
well this is how you can turn on these
developer tools to help you understand
how Magento outputs your pages as always
if you have any questions leave a
comment in the video or in a separate
order level up tuts let us know what
you're thinking and once again this is
Scott with up Tubbs and thanks for
