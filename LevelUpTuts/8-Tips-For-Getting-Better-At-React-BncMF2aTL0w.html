up tutorials in this video I'm gonna be
giving you eight tips that make you a
better react developer now these are
things from tooling to actual code style
stuff like that that you can implement
right now and make yourself a better
react developer pretty much instantly so
let's get going right now so what I want
to do in this video here is really go
over eight things that can make you a
better react developer now the point of
this video isn't necessarily that these
are the only eight things in fact if you
have other things I would suggest
putting them in the comments and languor
tips your personal tips or ideas on what
you can do to become a better react
developer however these things are are
just things that I've felt like over
time and developing things that I've
just noticed that are nice to really
understand well and will make the
biggest impact in writing excellent code
for yourself so one thing I wanted to
talk about first is linting and so if we
head to my text editor one thing that's
really important is good linting and
this one will go
maybe the farthest in terms of writing
excellent react because if we have a
good set of linting rules set up and I'm
gonna give you exactly what I use in a
minute here if we have a good set of
linting rules set up your text editor is
going to catch anything that could
potentially have a problem right and
that could save you some headaches but
more than just catching problems you're
es lid set up is going to be constantly
making you aware of react best practices
it's going to say hey don't do this
don't do that
do this instead if for instance if we
wanted to reference a new property that
it could be passed in here console dot
log and no don't make a new element and
we were to say this dot props dot hello
okay this prop doesn't exist but you can
see as mile enter immediately gives me
an underlined and
and lets me know that hey it's missing
prom validation and this is coming in
from the react prop types rule here so
this is definitely something that is
going to constantly make you aware of
these best practices left and right in
what it's going to do is just really
shape your understanding of the code
because obviously once you hit a mistake
once or twice here you're going to start
to avoid those mistakes when you write
your code overall in turn just making
you understand more about what it is to
write excellent react code so my advice
for you is to set up one es lint if you
actually purchase the react 16 for every
one course I have a whole video on
setting up linting and talking a little
bit about configuring it and stuff like
that so if you wanted to get your
reactive lint setup you know open up
that video and I'll show you a little
bit more however what you don't want is
es lint and you're going to typically or
at least I really like is this Airbnb
JavaScript style guide you'll you'll see
this used quite frequently and this is
more than just a react this is going to
be more just JavaScript stuff but it's
going to solve a ton of your react
issues as well because at the end of the
day writing react code is mostly just
writing straight-up JavaScript anyways
you're also going to want to use the
react es lint package which I believe is
just under the name react so you'll want
to go ahead and make sure you have the
es Linnton react package as well as air
B&amp;amp;B set up in your es lint if you do
this
es lint config when you get started with
it I believe it asks you if you are
using a popular library or framework and
you can just go ahead and say yeah I'm
using react and air BnB so es lint major
major thing to get set up and teaches
you to write excellent react code now
next we have something that I mentioned
just a minute ago in this video when
mile interacted up is be able to use
prop types and default props some of the
rules that are set up in this by default
is if your prop type is not very
wired then it needs a default prop so
like let's say user is loaded is no
longer required what we would need to do
is have a aesthetic default props is
equal to then we could have user is
loaded and this actually should be false
obviously okay so now you can see that
errors gone away so basically what we
want is anytime we have a prop type
that's used in our component we need to
set a prop type for it as an user is
loaded is always going to be a boolean
and again if this is not required then
we're going to need to have a default
prop if it is required you don't want or
need a default prop however the rule
also state that you shouldn't have
ambiguous prop types like object or
array so in this case we're using shape
and we're saying the user ID is a prop
types of string and the entire user
object is required so making sure you
have your prop types and default props
set up on every single component that
uses props will go a long ways because
the moment those props aren't getting
that information that they're expecting
to have your error log is going to let
you know that you're either passing this
in something incorrectly or something
that is expecting it is not there and
that makes error finding just wait wait
if you're writing a lot of reusable
components it also makes them a little
bit more self documenting here okay next
we have know when to make new components
this is the User Profile component and I
could have brought in some of these
things like my orders or my downloads
this could have been all in line here
because I'm really just pulling the data
information from the same spot and these
could have all just been this one my
intent and maybe I'm not reusing my
orders anywhere else and maybe I want to
be able to use it somewhere else but
maybe I'm not you know at the end of the
day here my orders is its own
encapsulated thing right this thing
basically is its own thing and when
something is its own thing is a good
time to make it into its own component
so while there aren't any hard and fast
rules on when to make a component just
staring at this screen right now I
invite you to try to figure out what
these components might be for instance
we have the orders component the
subscription component the my votes
component we have the user photo user
menu component up here we have the
header component overall we have the
main navigation you can see here that
these things are these nested components
right so anytime anything's
functionality becomes unwieldy or it
represents its own thing or it's
something that you're gonna reuse you're
gonna want to move it into a node its
own component so the easiest one I guess
of those is to determine if you're going
to reuse something it should probably be
its own component right that way you
don't have to type it again it makes
your code dry so that it doesn't repeat
itself and it will make things easier to
update and debug so that one is the
easiest some of the other ones I guess
visually you could look at something and
see when it's fully encapsulated and
just sort of see what it's it's own
thing is these things are a little bit
more up to your own judgement but the
last thing anyone wants to see is a
giant you know 200 line component that
has all these crazy bells and whistles
and it might be definitely much easier
to read when I can see oh here's my
orders my downloads my subscriptions my
votes that sort of stuff you can see
this component is instantly readable
okay next we have know the difference
between component verse pure component
verse a stateless functional component
and when you're going to want to use
them you'll notice that this component
up top pure component but what's up with
pure component versus stateless
functional component verse a normal
component well let's actually check out
another component like a stateless
functional I can open a billboard
billboard and here we have a stateless
functional component now
this is going to be maybe one of the
most common types of components in your
arsenal and I again in the react 16 for
everyone series I have a video teaching
you all about these but the idea with a
stateless functional component is well
it's stateless and it's just a function
so what's nice about these is you're
defining it just as a constant function
you know it's equal to an arrow function
and this one is simply just returning
some stuff it doesn't have state it
doesn't have refs it doesn't have any
life cycle methods none of that stuff no
that extra stuff right and the react
team has promised performance benefits
in the future from these and not only
that but this thing is super simple
right you could take this anywhere as
long as you're using JSX and a project
whether that's pre act or whatever and
this thing is going to work because it's
a just a function that's returning JSX
so if your components aren't using those
elements that's state and refs and that
sort of stuff then you're gonna want to
almost always use a stateless functional
component these things should be super
common within your project and as you
can see they're really nice and concise
this thing is just presentational
nothing crazy and if you're wondering
about pure component verse a normal
component well a pure component doesn't
do deep checking right when a component
gets new props into it it usually rear
Enders right it'll trigger a rear ender
but sometimes it's getting new props and
those props haven't really changed and
it's triggering a rear ender and what a
pure component does is it doesn't do
this deep checking of an object like for
instance if a prop is a string or a
boolean and it changes a pure component
is going to recognize that but if a
property within an object is changing
and a pure component it's not going to
trigger a rerender so there's a really
excellent react package believe it's
called why did you update and this is
this is kind of a micro optimization
right but it can help potentially help
you understand where there are maybe
unnecessary
rear Enders in your content and then you
could use a pure component rather than a
component to prevent things from having
an unnecessary
rerender like I said this is a great
tool if you're going to start diagnosing
issues but if you're just fixing
something that isn't broken it could be
again like a micro optimization or a
premature optimization but again you'll
want to know when you can use a pure
component and when you should be using a
regular component again a pure component
can help you potentially save some
unnecessary renders by not doing deep
checking okay so use and know the
difference between component pure
component and stateless functional
component okay next we have one that
should be commonplace by now but it's
use react dev tools if you're using
react chances are you've been yelled at
by your council to use react dev tools
it exists for the major platform so go
ahead and grab the extension you can see
here it gives you access to well a dumb
like structure for your entire react it
allows you to see inside see all these
props allows us to do things like dollar
sign are in our council here to go ahead
and load up the current component and
see all of the nice stuff in here so as
you can see here this is just a really
excellent way to explore your react
components and help diagnose issues is
this component not getting the right
props well why is it again use props
where do they stop where does it end so
this is an excellent excellent tool that
you're gonna need in your tool belt and
will help you work in react okay number
six I believe this is and this one it
might I don't know no I don't want to
say this is going to ruffle some
feathers and my opinion using inline
conditional statements are going it's
going to be something that cleans up
your react code considerably take in
mind look at this I have a basic
function is this person and affiliate
next I have double ampersands and then
my thing here my component so basically
what's so nice about this is that I
didn't have to write a function up top
here I didn't have to have an if
statement in my render thing I didn't
have to have
you know basically a link to somewhere
else in this component right it wasn't
like a variable here and you see this
variable and say okay where is that
defined it's defined up here at an if
statement okay what it does is it puts
your conditional directly in line and so
how you can use these is simply by using
this double ampersand so inside of our
brackets you would have a if statement
essentially it could be anything right
could just say true and this will always
show the my affiliate info box right but
this is a function that evaluates to
true or false and then it goes ahead and
if it exists or if it's true with this
double ampersand has our component now
it's nice about this is you can also use
the ternary operator so we could also
say : here and you might want to use
parentheses to make this a little bit
more readable so we could say if they
are an affiliate show the affiliate box
otherwise so show some other stuff right
and this makes some nice little error
things fine right you could have here if
if it works show this otherwise show
something else so again some people
might not like this they might say hey
it's cluttering up the JSX in my opinion
this syntax right here when it gets back
with the ampersand this syntax right
here is infinitely more readable than a
variable that's to find up over here and
then you have to use it down here right
this keeps everything nice now granted
if it's a giant big old conditional
monster I could see it being an issue
however I don't feel that this is an
issue I actually really really like this
syntax seems super readable next is use
a snippet libraries whenever possible
let's go ahead and create a new file I
can just say this as test badge is I'm
going to delete this after this video
but you could say it's to type in RC and
then you could see our CC our CP for a
pure component I believe this with prop
types you see I have some different
snippets here and if I hit enter you can
see it's set me up to just say hello
right and what's so great about these
snippets is that not only do they help
you potentially save bugs but they help
you identify the latest and greatest sin
taxes so the snippet library I use for
vs code is react let me see I use es 7
react Redux react natives and snippets
and this includes a whole bunch of
insanely excellent snippets and it shows
you all of them here and like I said it
uses the latest and greatest syntax with
like static prop types and stuff like
that it imports everything for you and
it will make working and react a breeze
because you don't have to potentially
type and have a bug somewhere anywhere
in here okay so again uses snippet
libraries like I said the one I use es7
react Redux react native jeaious it's a
long long name but super duper useful
there's a lot of snippet libraries go
check out some popular ones and see if
there's any that are looking good to you
ok so that was number seven and now
we're on to number eight number eight is
something that well you don't
necessarily have to do but it's going to
make you a better react developer this
is learn the internals of react and I
found this great post by Matt Greer at
net guru org I can share this in the
video description and again if you have
another post for this that you think is
excellent or better or whatever feel
free to share I like this one it talks a
little about about building your own
sort of a light version of react and
stuff like that but it goes really
in-depth into the different areas of
react and sort of how it works and the
reason why this could be important is if
you were having issues with something
that you might not have understand fully
if you understand how react works itself
you're going to understand Winn and how
to do things right I have this idea but
I don't quite know where to execute it
and react well if you know exactly what
reacts doing at any given point you're
always going to know where to put your
code so understand
the basics of how react works will make
you a better react developer absolutely
so to go over again
get some good linting setup es lint
Airbnb react linting okay
number two use prop types and default
props never let your component have a
prop type that's not required not have a
default prop okay number three is a
knowing to make new components okay
number four is component versus pier
component versus stateless of functional
components know if it's affecting your
performance by unnecessary rear Enders
or if you could be using a stateless
functional again linting is going to
help with this if we have a component
like this and we're not using anything
you'll notice I have this big old red
underline it's gonna say this should be
written as a pure pure function we
prefer wrecked stateless function okay
so as you can see here again linting is
going to help you immensely okay next
use react dev tools you gotta use them
they they make your life better
constantly number three use conditionals
and inline ternary statements because
honestly it makes your code more
readable unless it's like a monstrous
giant conditional statement okay seven
we have it used snippet libraries they
save you a ton a ton of time when
creating new components or even adding
things like component did mount and
stuff like that who wants to type all
that stuff out potentially having bugs
and missing things basically they inform
you of excellent react syntax so you can
use it without having to type it
yourself and lastly number eight learn
how react works now you don't have to
learn the new degree of everything but
having an understanding about how react
works will definitely make you a better
react developer okay so I hope these
eight tips helped you a lot these are
things that I've noticed have improved
my code quality considerably and if you
want more and more react goodness from
level up tutorials head to level up
tutorials forward slash store and check
out react sixteen for every one where I
teach you a lot about this stuff right a
lot of the stuff I mentioned here is
present in this series we do excellent
modern react in this series or you can
become a subscriber
level up tutorials forward slash Pro and
you can access to the streaming and
download with that as well so either
become a pro to subscribe or head over
to the store and purchase it outright
either way you can learn excellent
modern react and we make some really
cool stuff in this series using AP is an
excellent modern JavaScript so thank you
so much for watching as always this is
Scott and I will see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
