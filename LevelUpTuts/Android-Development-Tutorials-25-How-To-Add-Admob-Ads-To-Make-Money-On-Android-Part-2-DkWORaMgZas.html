set up I have my private information
out zone you can't see my abs you can't
see my publisher ID that sort of stuff
but you want to go under monetize and
then we want to go to uh all apps so
let's click all apps and now we want to
monetize a new app so we'll click this
button and now we're going to allows you
search for your app or add an app
manually so let's add an app manually
and our title of our app was just a
level of Todd's so we'll call it level
up
tuts select the platform is Android
continue now let's look banner as ad
type and that's fine refresh rate can
refresh every 60 seconds standard banner
is fine with me
and we'll just call this um banner ad
perfect
save it okay cool so now it's given me a
unit ID which actually includes my
publisher ID as well so that's the way
that when people click on this ad it
knows who the publisher is and what the
ad is and who to pay so I'm going to go
ahead and copy this unit ID and I'm not
pasted in my app so I'm going to click
done our unit ID can be pasted in here
and that's all good and we just need to
add some more ad specific things so
we're type ads colon and then ad size
equals and then in all caps banner and
then now ads test devices and so what
this is going to do is basically say hey
the test emulator or type test emulator
and here all caps with an underscore you
could also have a comma and then an ID
for your actual device if you're testing
on a device that way doesn't falsely add
clicks and fraudulent clicks can get you
kicked off of Adsense so do not or AdMob
so now fraudulently click your app try
to make money because you're not going
to make any money so let's do ads : load
add on create equals I'm sorry equals
true okay so we want to load the set on
create and of course we need to close
out our XML element here with a forward
slash and there's one more thing
we'll need to do you'll notice we're
getting this red X here and that's
because we need us line up in here in
our relative layout and in our relative
layout here we're going to add I'm just
going to add this right under this tools
and it's going to be X M L and s : ads
equals and then we're going to add in
this URL here again you can get this
specific information on the AdMob SDK
page I will of course paste that into
the comments so you can have that
information but you can see this address
here it's not worth really typing out
you might mess it up
so we're just about there where we just
want this ad to display right so in the
next video we're going to make it look
nice and have it be at the bottom of the
page and everything like that but for
right now we just want to get to
displaying so what we need to do is
adjust this height right now our button
is going to take up the entire screen
with the fill parent so let's just say
this is like 100 DP or something and
keep in mind like I said this is just
for right now
also we need to specify where this is
going to show up in the relative layout
so we can say Android and this can be
where it appears after so we'll be
layout below and then we can just say
it's going to be below the the button
number one so we can just say plus ID
button 1 save this and now if we run
this app we should see our ad so I'm
going to run this in our emulator and ad
job keep in mind like I said it's not
going to be pinned at the bottom it's
not going to be perfect but it's going
to show up
so we can see our app starts up here and
while it takes the a couple seconds for
the ad to load you'll see it's not going
to show up but then our ad loads pops up
says success you are now ready to travel
through the app galaxy and so here is
our app here's our ad and we're ready to
start making some money on Android with
advertising sweet so in the next couple
of videos what we're going to do is make
this ad better and then we're going to
learn how to publish our app and then
we're going to started an entirely new
project and I'm going to use the new
Android studio for that which is still
in beta but pretty cool so we're going
to use that instead of eclipse so it's
going to be really exciting lots more
stuff to come but we have an ad going
and you should be good so as always this
is gobble up HUDs if you have any
questions or comments you know his stuff
on Twitter or Facebook at any of those
places let us know what you think thanks
