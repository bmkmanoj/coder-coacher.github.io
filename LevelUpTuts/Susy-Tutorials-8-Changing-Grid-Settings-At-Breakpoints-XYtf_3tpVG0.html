up Hut's and today we're gonna be
building even more complex responsive
sites where we're going to be changing
our grid based on different break points
now if you remember in the last video we
had our basic grid that just starts with
one container and moves to two here well
that's awesome that's great now let's
say this layouts working for us however
when we get this wide this sidebar is
little too wide also we'd really like if
these three paragraphs went into three
columns so let's go ahead and pick a
width at which that will happen so let's
say at 1200 pixels we want this side
content to actually go smaller we want
each of these paragraphs to be in its
own
we want each of these paragraphs to be
in its own column and we want our grid
to now be 24 columns
well that's really attainable and easy
using break point and Susy so we can
write a new break point here and it's
just @include break point and then 1200
pixels okay now we could have it say
inside of here we're going to do at
include and if you remember we use the
layout mixin before so we can type in
layout and then all we have to pass it
here is 24 so this is effectively
changing our grid from a 12 column grid
to a 24 column grid now what happens if
we refresh our page and let's make sure
this is 1200 which it's not but now it
is you'll notice that nothing changed
and you might be wondering why we told
this to be 24 columns
well in other grid systems when you have
something that has that many columns
it's that many columns all the time or
it's changing based on the size of the
grid however with something like this
your divs
and your content basically that you're
assigning positions and widths to
they're not being told the update until
you pass it in some data right so even
though you're changing the grid to 24
your CSS or your SAS code is never ever
telling these columns to go onto the new
grid so notice that the instant that we
put these mix-ins are these this code
here that we used before just adding
span of 8 and span for it 9 here the lab
is going to be wrong but they're now
going to snap to this new grid and in
fact when we go here you can see it the
change happened right there so now we
just want to get these three paragraphs
in their own one and so to do that
there's an even division of 7 that means
us this one is going to have to be it's
going to have to span maintenance going
to span 2
one columns to encapsulate all three of
those those columns inside of it and the
aside is going to have to be starting at
21 and going to three columns wide so
that goes from 21 to 24 so it's starting
at the twenty first twenty second twenty
or twenty fourth okay so now we need to
add some classes to our HTML and we can
just say class call one and I'll just
add these classes here two and call
three there we go and it's out of our
main here we can just say dot call 1
comma 2 comma dot call 3 and now you
might be thinking okay we have a 24
total columns the aside is taking up 3
therefore each of these should be taking
up 7 and our grid here is going to be
based off of percentages however its
percentages of the container so if we
were to say at include span of 7 because
3 times 7 equals 21 plus 3 equals 24 and
I refresh you'll see that these don't
quite line up that's because it's
actually doing 7 out of 24 it's treating
this main as a container and saying hey
you have three more columns left to use
within here so to get this to fill up
we're going to be saying a span of 8
save that and we can refresh there we go
and now we have our three columns just
like that now another way of writing
this we could have said it is going to
be one of three now if we refresh
and you see when we refresh that we
actually have three columns here
although the the padding is a bit
different right the the gutters are more
spread out and that's because we have
our gutter set to 1/4 and that's 1/4 of
the column width so when we have three
wide columns we have wider gutters so if
we wanted to reduce the size of the
gutters we could always just say 2 of 6
and this would cut the size of the
gutters in half and that looks a little
bit better and of course if you wanted
to reduce that again we could always
just keep doubling this so now we could
say 4 of 12 and eventually of course
we're gonna be back to where we were but
now we've refresh and of course we have
our three columns here so that's an
important thing to note is that it's
always going to be filling up the
parents eyes right it's not necessarily
going to be of the the total columns but
if it makes more sense to you if you're
going to be having a sub column
structure here then you can always just
define your columns directly in to the
span so now we have three layouts right
we have this big layout we have a two
column layout and then we have a one
column layout so 2 and then 4 and this 4
column has a sub structure here so what
you see now is how to completely change
and manipulate your grid based off of
breakpoints right all we simply did was
at a layout 24 and it changed this to 24
columns and again I'll wait to say is of
12 down here and it was able to put
these in a column of 12 it's just really
doing the math for you and there's it's
not like a normal grid system that has a
class that already has predefined widths
attached to it it actually takes and
calculates the math and gives you
percentages back that way everything
works out and you don't have to have a
lot of CSS Oh
4head with a normal grid system you'd be
working with just a whole CSS file here
it pretty much only adds what you need
it see you can see our entire CSS for
this site already is only 81 lines which
is awesome
so you can see certainly see the power
of Seussian breakpoints now keep in mind
this one thing that could be great to do
with breakpoint is to set all of your
wits and your breakpoints into variables
so you could say something like small is
going to be 400 pixels or some m value
right medium is going to be 700 pixels
or some m value and then large can be
like 960 or something and then desktop
can be even wider but that way you can
simply say alright I want this
breakpoint to take place here instead of
at the 12 so you can see let's see if it
even got that there we go now it's
taking place at 960 what this does is it
really just has you to have a large a
lot more control over your variables you
want to change it you just have to
change it up here because I guarantee
you're not just going to be wrapping
everything in your breakpoints you can
use this breakpoint mixin inside of
things right so what we could do is we
could say break point inside of here and
and again we could do this exact same
thing inside of the aside
just like this now let me delete this
extra bracket and fix our alignment and
this is equivalent to what we had typed
before so this is really cool because
now you can just sort of throw in
breakpoints whenever you need them
however in the case where you wanted to
change this you would then have to go
find it everywhere you declared it but
now we can just say medium and medium
and you would only have to change just
in one place so that's a nice part about
using variables for your breakpoints now
there's still more to talk about using
breakpoint however in the next video I'm
going to talk about the breakpoint and
Susy integration they call it the Susy
toolkit it's the Susy breakpoint toolkit
so it allows for some integrated use
into breakpoints so that's cool we're
gonna go over that next time and so in
the meantime keep checking it out keep
trying new things
use breakpoint check out their
documentation just experiment with it
it's a great new system it allows for
some really interesting ways of writing
your CSS full control and you're
obviously using less lines than if you
were loading up a full grid system so as
always this is Scott with level of Tut's
