up Hut's and today we're gonna do our
second gulp video and what we're going
to do in this is we're going to show you
how to add a plug-in into gulp so that
you can do more advanced things than
just outputting a hello world tag like
we did in the last video so keep
watching what we're going to do is grab
the gulp uglify node package and we're
going to add it to our task so that we
can minify javascript files on command
so keep watching we're going to get
started right now so to get started
we're going to want to find the go
plugin that we want to use and you'll
notice that a gulp J's calm slash
plugins you can see that it says there's
605 gulp plugins that already exists so
there is a ton of people writing a ton
of extremely useful plugins for gulp so
we can go ahead and search however I
already know which exact plugin I want
to use it's the gulp - uglify so this is
on NPM j/s org and it's gulp ahh -
uglify and what this is going to do is
it's going to minify basically it's
going to take away all of the space in
your code so it effectively becomes
unreadable but it cuts down on file size
so therefore it's super useful so let's
get started the first thing we have to
do is install this gulp uglify package
locally to our project we don't have to
install it globally or anything just to
our project itself and in fact there's a
better way to do this which we'll go
over in a future video
by creating a package file where you
don't you describe all of the packages
you want to use and then in one command
install them however since we're just
going to get going let's just go ahead
and install this at the root level of
our project using NPM install then - -
save - dev space gulp - uglify in this
command is listed on the NPM page and
for me I have to run sudo in this
directory so I'm going to go ahead and
do that ok we now have gulp uglify
installed you can verify that by
checking out your node modules folder
now inside of our node modules folder
instead of just have
nope we also have gulp uglify so what's
next well all we have to do is require
this other gulp plugin just like we
required gulp in the first place and
then we can use its functionality so
let's check it out
you can declare your variables however
you like in JavaScript I'm going to do
it like this where we have a comma in
just one bar statement and we can say
uglify and uglify is going to equal
require and then inside of a require
statement is going to be the name of the
the note package so it's gulp - uglify
great so we now are requiring gulp
uglify and we're using it as uglify so
how do we how do we do this well before
we just have a hello world so let's
actually get rid of that we don't need
that any longer what we want to do is we
want to run a command on a source file
so there's a method of gulp so it's gulp
dot SRC and this allows us to run a
command on a particular directory so by
specifying a directory inside of quotes
we can say it's going to be our Jas
directory and instead of our Jas folder
we're going to use the asterisk which is
a wild-card which means any file now to
make sure we're not just using any file
we're going to use any file dot Jas so
any JavaScript file inside of this J's
folder is going to be used now next we
need to use dot pipe and pipe is going
to allow us to run a command on this
file essentially
and inside of here we want to run our
uglify functions so we can just type
uglify misspell it correctly uglify and
then parenthesis and all this is going
to do is it's going to uglify the code
right so if we were to run this right
now it wouldn't actually ever give us
anything it would act it would minify
the code but then simply give us nothing
so now what we need to do is dot pipe
another function and this is going to be
the gulp destination function so we can
say gulp dot test and then we want to
pass it in the destination now because I
don't have anywhere I necessarily want
to put this right now we can just make a
new directory and call it min Jas for
this example and typically the way that
you're going to see these files laid out
is to have each one of these pipe
statements on its own line so if we do
something like that it's not looking a
bit more organized and you can see
exactly the steps that we're going
through so we're going to load the files
we're going to uglify them and then
we're going to save them into min
Jas okay since this is our default task
still all we have to do is write the
command gulp so let's come back to our
command line and type gulp once more
okay as you can see it started default
and a finished default last time it took
a very small fraction of a second you
can see this time it took five point
three one milliseconds so you can tell
it is done something more than just
output text so let's come to sublime
text and you'll see that we now have a
min Jas folder and inside of here is
every single Jas file that was inside of
the min J's folder we have this main and
plugins main just typically looks like
this before we minified it now you can
see afterwards double clicking on named
Jas here we have everything in one line
oh cool you have now just written your
first build script it built your je s by
minifying it and this is really just the
start of all of the great things you can
do with gulp so in the next video we're
going to get going with some more
complex things to make this j/s task
even more robust and more interesting so
as always this is Scott with level of
touch if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video is up
at this up that Twitter Facebook or
pretty much anywhere we love to hear
from you
so thanks for watching and I'll see in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
