of tutorials and then this quick video
I'm gonna be showing you a nice feature
of gitlab which is equivalent to a gist
on github this is going to be a snippet
in git lab so now that we have teams we
have projects let's take a look at a
feature that's really nice now in github
this is a gist
however in get lab it's sort of more
appropriately named snippets
now when a snippet is really just a
snippet of code that you can create and
share so if we click new snippet after
we select snippets in our toolbar we'll
be able to go ahead and create a new
snippet from here we can just say a our
first first snippet okay now this could
be public to the world and let's go
ahead and if we were to give this file a
name like let's say we give this a file
name like hello dot J s okay now in here
let's go ahead and it just console.log
some string that's just going to be
hello okay just like that
this is least this is the lamest snippet
on the planet officially this is not a
snippet you're going to want to post
somewhere to show off your JavaScript
skills okay now we can go ahead and
click create snippet and as you can see
what's great is because we chose to name
this hello J s that it actually get
correct syntax highlighting for us it
knows that this is a string and this is
nice it's not like amazing syntax
highlighting but it's way better than
anything that we would have had if we
wouldn't have given this a name so now
we can create all sorts of types of
snippets that you can go ahead and share
you'll notice that this has an address
and if I were to pass along this address
this snippet being public could be
accessed by anyone without even needing
to login so let's go ahead and open up a
new incognito window and paste this in
here I'm not logged in or anything like
that and I can still see this snippet
super cool
so this is just about as easy as it gets
there's really nothing to this we
basically have created our snippet the
best way to actually use some real stuff
in here let's go ahead and create a
snippet and we can just have the speed
test - this can be public as well and
let's go ahead and grab some actual code
so I'm just gonna fire up Adam and
that's a blonde text and I'm gonna grab
the first thing that I see here that's
usable okay so this is some this is an
Android manifest file so maybe not great
let's go ahead and actually grab hello
Deus okay we can grab this this is very
basic hello Jay yes but a little bit
more stuff than the other one we can
just have this be hello - Jay s now
let's go ahead and click create snippet
once more and you'll be able to see we
have a bit more here a bit more syntax
highlighting obviously it's stumbling a
little bit with the JSX stuff but that's
kind of to be expected if we wanted to
copy this whole thing you could simply
copy it from here click the copy button
and come to your code you'll notice I
pasted it in it's the exact same or if
we wanted to view the raw itself there's
just the raw button here and that's just
what the raw text right here again you
could do this manually and copy and
paste it in so super cool snippets
they're not crazy there's nothing
amazing about it you know notice how we
don't have comments or anything like
that but this snippet is something you
can share now or you can keep this
private and just have it in your own
public repository of snippets stuff that
you're gonna use over and over again
cool so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you'd like to grab
the rust-eze gitlab videos before
they're available on youtube you can add
to store that level up tutorials comm
and become a level up pro all level up
pros get access to instantly stream all
of these early access videos super cool
so as always thanks for watching and
i'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
