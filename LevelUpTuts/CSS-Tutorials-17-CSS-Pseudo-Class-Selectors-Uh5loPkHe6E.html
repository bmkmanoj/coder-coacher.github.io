love Tut's and today I'm going to be
talking about CSS pseudo-classes okay
and what CSS pseudo-classes are is they
basically allow you to do effects to
some of your selectors and we've already
witnessed some of these pseudo-classes
in action when in previous lessons when
we were styling links if you scroll down
here this a colon hover our hover state
on the anchor and our active state on
the anchor our pseudo-classes and what
those do is we use them to create an
underline when we hover over these links
um
and change the color of our active links
so what is most important about these
pseudo classes is that you're basically
affecting whatever comes right here
where you have this colon and then this
action so if we were um before we only
be these on links but let's try
something different
very similar though I'm a rapper let's
add the colon hover do it directly after
the rapper and we're going to just make
this again really obvious we'll do a
background blue just so it's totally
obnoxious
and we're refresh and now when we hover
over the rapper you can see it changes
color to blue so uh these pseudo-classes
a:hover in particular doesn't it's not
just for links you can use these on any
item with the note that you do need to
declare a doctype on your HTML as you
can see here we're using doctype HTML
this is the html5 doctype I would um I
don't know if I'd recommend not using a
doctype ever so if you're doing any sort
of modern web development at this point
i think you'd want to use duck type HTML
and that will that will cover you so so
the other pseudo classes as you remember
we had we're active link and was in
visited well there's also several other
some of which we'll be getting into in
our styling forums tutorial like focus
and focus really just gives you a style
when a form element is focused on when
you've clicked on it other ones could be
some really interesting effects here so
let's go to our paragraph and let's say
in our paragraph here we're going to say
for all paragraphs and then we're going
to do :
first - letter and what we're going to
do with the first letter is we're going
to give it a font weight of bold now
let's refresh as you can see the first
letter of every paragraph it's now bold
so this is a pseudo class what else do
we have we have a first line if we give
the first line a font weight of bold
I'm sure you can guess what's going to
happen let's refresh this now the first
line of our paragraphs is bold now let's
check out some more okay so let's try
something else let's say if we wanted to
have the first list item in our
navigation list we want to have that be
bold itself we're going to say nav Li
and then on the Li we're going to give
this a pseudo class of first child and
really this is going to say the first Li
that's a child of nav is going to have
let's say font-weight:bold
now let's refresh so you can see our
first link has a bold text right here
and the same thing works if we're doing
less child while we're at it I'm going
to remove that hover blue because just
get on my nerves okay and now let's
refresh the page and you can see our
last item now has a font weight of bold
so really these pseudo classes can
sometimes come in handy you don't always
have to give something in this case we
said before we gave our our list items
we gave them first
last class we could have done that using
last child if we wanted to
of course it's sometimes it's maybe a
little bit more useful to do this
however saying the last child of this
list is going to make the last item bold
so css3 actually brought a whole host of
new student class selectors that we're
going to go over once we eat into the
css3 stuff but it's going to be valuable
to know what a pseudo class selector is
and really what you can do with them
first child last child and there's some
really great ones we're actually going
to get into in the next lesson we're
going to be covering the before and
after pseudo class now these are a
little bit different than something
you've seen before so I want to dedicate
a whole tutorial to these but these are
enough to get you started
know that you can use hover on elements
that aren't just anchors to create some
cool effects and once we get into some
css3 stuff you can use transitions and
different classes to even have more
effects with your CSS as always leave a
comment on the video below or hit us up
at Twitter LevelUp Tut's let us know
what you're thinking once again this is
