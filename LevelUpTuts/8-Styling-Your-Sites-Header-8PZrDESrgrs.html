up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be showing you how you can start
styling your website in a way to make it
look like a real modern website so we're
gonna get started from the top down and
we're gonna get styling our header for
our website and then we're gonna move on
to things like the navigation and the
main content area of the footer and
sooner or later gonna have a really
nice-looking foundation that we can
build the rest of our website on so
let's get started right now so in the
past few videos we've been covering a
lot of foundational stuff and we have
what's looking like a pretty lame
website right now so I think it's about
time we start get going on actually how
to make this website sort of look like
something you would actually want to
visit instead of just a total mess so
we're going to start with the top down
we're gonna first do the header and then
we're going to build a navigation then
we're gonna go into sort of the body
then the footer and we're gonna show you
along the way some nice tips and
techniques so now before we get started
it's important to know that the browser
defines a whole bunch of styles for so a
bunch of styles that we don't want now
there's a lot of strategies for getting
rid of these styles but pretty much the
way that people work on the web in a
modern way is to using something like
CSS normalize so if we go to Google and
we type CSS normalize you'll see it
comes up and basically it allows all
browsers to sort of render the CSS the
same way it gets rid of any sort of
browser specific stuff and it just sort
of makes your life a little bit easier
to start off so what we can do is
essentially just click this download
button and you can see it gives us a
whole page of CSS now what I can do is
copy this by selecting all and then
copying let's come back to our website
now in our folder first site I'm going
to click new file and I'm going to hit
command s and select type the word
normalise dot CSS
and I'm gonna paste this all in here we
could paste this into our previously
used CSS file and it would work just
fine but we're not gonna be modifying
any of this CSS you can pop through it
and look at it if you'd like but we're
not going to be modifying it so we can
simply just save this and sort of forget
about it but we do need to link it up in
our HTML so let's come to the header
here and on the linked page let's come
here and before our Styles dot CSS we
want to say normalize that CSS so now
it's going to be referencing this first
one and then afterwards is going to be
loading this Styles dot CSS there for
anything that we define in styles here
is going to override what is being
defined in normalize so now that we did
everything correctly we should come to
this page and we sits refresh and be
able to see some differences right away
the main one is that we no longer have
this serif text we now have a sans-serif
text and I think it's Arial it's just
this font family sans-serif so it's
whatever your browser defines as the
basic sans-serif and some items will be
completely different if you notice
before we had on the body we had we have
margin all the way around so we no
longer have that margin so that makes
this nice and easy it's not really
assuming we want to do anything okay so
let's come to our page and let's start
go to our HTML first and the first thing
we're going to do is give a class on
this header so it's going to say class
equals and this is going to be site -
header now you might be wondering why we
need a class here why can't we just say
header in our CSS and style it that way
well the reason you don't want to do
that is because you can use the header
element in places that are other than
the header the very top of your site the
header element can actually mean the
header of all sorts of stuff it can mean
the header of a page it could mean the
header of a specific type of content or
an article like a blog post or something
like that so we don't want to
necessarily say header just in case we
want to use that somewhere else so now
we can save this file
we can come to our CSS let's get rid of
this color red on this h1 let's just
delete all of that now what we can say
is period site header and then open and
close curly brackets now we can define
some styles here and we want to
essentially give this a background color
so we can say background and this is
going to be a nice blue color so the
color I've selected is going to be three
f5 1 b5 okay
so now I can save that and now in
addition to that I wanted to say color
and I want everything inside of this to
be the color of FFF or white
now with colors like this where you have
repeating characters like ffffff you
don't have to type 6 FS in hexadecimal
if you type just these three FS here
it's going to get the picture so we can
come in and now we can refresh now what
you see is that we have our header is
blue and our text is white so that's
accomplishing what we want to so far and
however you'll notice there's this white
space above here what is that so the
best way to find out is to right-click
on this and inspect element if we hover
over this we can see that orange that we
decided was the margin before it's
actually popping out of the header now
it's a little bit of a weird reason why
that does that we're not going to get
into that right now however what we need
to do is essentially pull the margin
entirely off of this h1 now what we
don't want to do is pull the margins off
of all H ones so we don't want to say h1
margin zero because if we do this any
time we ever use an h1 on another page
if it's in a different location it's
gonna have a margin 0 and that's maybe
now what we want so because we don't
want to make those assumptions what we
can do is target this age one
specifically by saying period site -
header and then space and then h1 so the
way this works is it's a
an h1 that's inside of a site header
give it a margin:0 so let's come back
here and refresh and perfect we now have
this text here it's white there's no
weird spacing or anything like that
however this blue is coming in a little
tight all the way around what we could
do is we could assign this header a
height and we could say height 100
pixels right and see that makes the
height that makes the height bigger
right there but another thing we could
do is add a padding to the header now
padding is essentially going to add what
it sounds like padding on the inside and
it's going to push things inside so we
can come here and simply say on the site
header padding and what we can do is we
can say we can say 20 pixels and 5% okay
before we break this down let's come
back to our page and refresh and as you
can see we now have our header and as we
grow this you can see it sort of stays
there and cool so we now have a bit of a
header
however it's maybe a little much so
let's come again and adjust the size of
our h1 so we can say font - size give
this a font size of something like 20
pixels and let's go ahead and adjust
that padding so like I said before not
to worry about it now we're going to
dive into this a little bit more with
padding you can assign things by saying
padding - the top and simply give it a
padding top of 10 pixels or you can use
this shorthand that we're using here and
the way it goes is it goes top right
bottom left or if you only have two
values it goes top and bottom right and
left so by having ten pixels here the
site header is
of padding of 10 pixels on the top and
bottom and 5% on the left and right so
if we come and hover this over you can
see that the left and right padding is
going to be changing when we're making
our our site wider right it's it's not a
constant width at this point where the
top and bottom is a constant 10 pixels
no matter what so this right here 10
pixels 5% and is analogous to 10 pixels
5% remember top right bottom left so if
you'd like you can just simply shorthand
that to this perfect so we now have our
site header let's refresh and it's
looking quite a bit better so now what
are some other things we can do this we
can actually give this a bit of a shadow
so it maybe hangs over the side a little
bit adding some depth here now you don't
want to go crazy with shadows and you
don't always want to use them but
sometimes it's nice to have them so we
can say box - the shadow like so : and
now the first pixel is now the first
property is going to be how far to the
right or left it goes we don't want it
to go right or left just up and down so
we're gonna say 0 then this is up and
down if we say one pixel it's gonna go
down one pixel if we were to say
negative one it would go up one pixel
since this is a shadow that we want on
the bottom of our header we want it to
go down okay in addition we can now say
how much you want to spread out so we
wanted to spread out three pixels and
let's give it a color as the next
property and this color is going to be 3
3 3 okay if I save this and refresh
you can see we now have a gray it's
three three three shadow on our text
right here
if we want this to be less strong than
three three three since it's on top of
white we can take this to a lighter gray
so we can say something like nine nine
nine save this refresh and you could see
it's a little less strong but it still
definitely exists okay so we now have a
nice-looking site header at this sites
already light-years better than it was
in the last video so we're only gonna
keep taking this further and further in
the next video we're gonna show you how
you can build a navigation into our
header so as always this is Scott with
