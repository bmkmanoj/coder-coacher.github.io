up Tut's and today I'm gonna give you
some sublime tips to make your
experience just a little bit nicer and
in this video we're going to be using a
sublime project so we're gonna save this
as a project and then we're gonna be
able to edit that project file to hide
things we don't want to show maybe we're
not going to edit and it's just gonna
help your workflow out cuz it's gonna
only really show you the folders and
files that you need to actually be
editing so here I have just a normal
sublime project I just dragged a Drupal
folder in here and this is an entire
Drupal site and there's all sorts of
stuff here on the right sidebar such as
authorized a PHP any of these text files
cron dot PHP there's also the core
folders like includes and the core
modules and these are things that I'm
never going to edit in fact if you're
editing this stuff it's really bad so
it's just bad practice and there's
better ways to do it so I really don't
need it to show up I mean why do I need
the stuff cluttering up my project when
I really just want to see my project
files that I'm going to be working on
okay
so there's a great way to do that and
the first we just need to save this as a
project so we can come up here to
project and go save project as now I'm
like I'm just gonna save this into the
projects folder that way if I move the
project or anything it stays with it so
I'm gonna just call this Drupal because
that's the name of our site however if
this was a real site I would probably
have that something a little bit more
relevant and I'm just gonna save this
now you'll notice we have now a drupal
that sublime project file here and if we
click on this project file and open this
up in a text editor like sublime right
here we see that there's a folders
object and inside of here we have follow
symlinks true and path with a period in
it to exclude files and folders we just
need to add on into this section here so
if we type comma at the end of this to
add a new item to this we can say folder
underscore exclude underscore patterns
and you're gonna make sure you spell
that correctly of course and then we're
gonna put a colon and in here now we
need to have brackets because we're
gonna have multiple files here or
multiple folders we want to exclude and
then inside of quotes so I don't want to
see the profiles folder and I don't want
to see includes and I don't want to see
misc here so let's type those in and
I'll type mm is C for miscellaneous here
and then the next one I don't want to
see is includes and then I also I don't
want to see let's say profiles make sure
this is in quotes okay cool I don't want
to see any of those and check out how
cool this is the moment I hit save
they're gone they're gone from this
right column or this left column here
and you don't have them cluttering up
your works braces anymore now we can
also hide files so I'm gonna place to
come at the end of this so that we can
add another item here and then of course
delete that now as you could probably
guess the word here is file exclude
patterns now what's really cool about
any of this stuff is that we can use
things like wildcards to get all of
maybe certain types of files like we
don't want any system files like the the
DF store files or anything like that we
don't want any files that start with an
underscore like a dot and then an
underscore so in quotes we could say dot
underscore and then asterisk for a wild
card we don't want any files like that
to show up we don't want a dot d s
underscore store to show up and we don't
want any text files to show up so we can
say asterisk dot txt just like that and
let's say let's just save this real
quick and you can see instantly it got
rid of all those text files it's
cleaning this up a ton now let's go
ahead and add Spore we can say
that PHP and what's great about this is
that these are Drupal specific files
right so if I wanted to just keep this
excluded patterns for folders and files
across all my Drupal sites I could
really just copy and paste this into any
of those projects and then we clean
those up immediately now you could have
one of these for each type of project
whether it's you know WordPress or
something like that basically if you
don't want to see files you can just add
them directly to this file exclude
patterns so that's pretty much it here
we can just continue keep on adding
these and it's going to keep on hiding
these hide as much as little as you want
or you know if you want something to
come back it's really just as easy as
selecting this and then saving and then
our includes is back what's also cool is
that if we do this if I try to do
command T and then search for cron dot
PHP not only does it not show up in our
left sidebar but it doesn't even show up
in the files that we're looking between
in our project so again if I wanted to
look for any dot txt file like I could
just type in dot txt you'll see nothing
comes up right so that install that txt
so this is not only great for hiding
them from the sidebar but hiding them
from your total projects view so they're
just not going to get in the way so one
thing I like to do is hide all of the
sass cache files all of the get folders
so of course we would want to put in
folder here we want to say that get we
want to say that sass - cache like that
and this is really great because these
are files that you are never gonna want
to see and it just gets them completely
out of the way ok that was just a quick
tip to make your projects a little bit
more manageable and nice and exactly
what it takes to work nicely I'm all
about improving your workflow so this is
just one small step to make things a
little bit better as always Cisco would
