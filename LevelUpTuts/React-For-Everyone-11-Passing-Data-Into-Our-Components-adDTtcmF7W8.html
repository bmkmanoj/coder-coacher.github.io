up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be taking our data that we had
hard-coded in our component before we're
moving it up in our chain of things and
we're going to be passing that data
along through our components and
eventually outputting it in our contacts
list so let's get going on that right
now okay so here we have our contacts
list it was really just outputting some
very very generic data that we just had
in here based on our contacts list
jeaious you can see I'm just outputting
this directly here now in this video
we're not going to be pulling data in
from an API or anything but what we're
gonna be doing is creating an object
here in a pas we're gonna be throwing
that in it to our apps props and then
we're going to be using that data in our
actual contacts list so let's go ahead
and first let's go ahead and create this
data we can say let context equal and
it's really just going to be an array of
objects so we can have an array we can
have an object in here and first thing
we want is a name property so this name
can be Scott and let's go ahead and have
a comma here and you know what I'm
actually just going to have this be an
object at first since we're not going to
be iterating just yet
and let's go ahead and just have a phone
and now this phone is also going to be a
string and it's going to be a fake phone
number here okay and later on we can add
some other information maybe some
personal contact deals details or things
like that but right now we just
basically have this context now we've
seen before that we can pass in props
and use props in our components now what
we want to do is throw in that this
contact variable here we want to throw
this in to our props for our app
component so let's go ahead and just
type in contacts is going to be equal to
this is just going to be inside of
brackets like this we can say contacts
like that
so the prop contacts is going to be
equal to context which is just a
straight JavaScript variable which we're
actually setting here with this let
declaration okay if we see this we
should be able to head to our page and
you're not gonna see any changes but if
we inspect our code or anything we're
not gonna see any errors as well so we
have no issues going on here at all but
we are in fact passing this in here now
that we're passing this in to app you'll
see that it's in our app now and if we
wanted to do something like a council
log we could come in here and actually
let's do this in the render function we
could just say Council log and this dot
props dot contacts so you'll see that we
hit now have access to this dot prop
stack context and this dot props that
contacts is referring to this okay
so as you can see here in our council
log if you can't see let me bump up that
font size and it's getting a little
outrageously big but as you can see in
our council we basically just have
object two named Scott phone okay so we
now have this and you might be wondering
how do we get it into here well in react
there's sort of this like parent-child
relationship that you need to get used
to where you're sort of passing things
down from parent to child now as you can
see we have this contacts list component
which is where we're actually going to
be wanting to use this value so let's go
ahead and pass in context in to this as
well so let's go context is equal to
this dot props dot contacts so as you
can see now the values of contacts is
first getting passed into app then from
app it's getting passed in to contacts
list now let's go and just pull this
line
great out of our app that extends and
what this is here that council log we're
going to now use that council log on our
contacts list because we've declared
another prop this prop on contacts list
named contacts so context that Jas we
can head to our render function we can
paste this same exact thing in here
because the same prop name applies right
we have this stop prop stack context and
you should be getting that correct
information but till it's sort of one up
ourselves instead of just doing a
console log here let's go ahead and
delete Scott right here and we can say
inside of a single set of curly brackets
this dot props contacts and if you
remember our object we had a property
called name so this dot prop stock
contacts that name and a phone number so
let's go ahead and let's head back to
the page you can see not only is the
console log working correctly but it
says Scott here let's go ahead and
change up this number in our app jsm
just had some threes in here just so we
can definitely see that this is a new
phone number once this reloads so let's
get rid of this five five five business
and we can type this props dot contacts
dot phone okay so we now have this that
props that contact our name this tech
props dot contacts dot phone and let's
actually get rid of this counsel log
statement here as well because we don't
really need it anymore and as you'll be
able to see we now have this data once
this refreshes we now have this data at
five three three so it is in fact
getting that new information so as you
can see here we now have some props that
are getting passed down to a component
that are then once again getting passed
into another component which are then
being used now in the next video what
we're going to be doing is we're going
to be taking this turning it into an
array we're going to be
mapping over that array and we're gonna
be out putting those into a new
component that's an individual contact
so as always this is Scott what level of
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments I become an the video app add
Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials much more content as coming
very soon thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
