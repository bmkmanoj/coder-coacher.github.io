up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna show you how you can quickly and
easily get going by installing Drupal on
a shared hosting platform now the shared
hosting platform I'm going to be using
for this example is Bluehost so if you
have a Bluehost account you can follow
along and if you don't don't worry about
it a lot of these 1-click installs are
are kind of similar however a Bluehost a
subscription is only like 395 a month
and if you sign up using the link in the
description to this video you'll
actually be helping support level up
tutorials so let's get a Drupal install
up and running on the Internet in no
time at all so after we've logged into
our Bluehost you can see it's taken us
to our hosting panel or also known as
occasionally as a cPanel and other
services and here we have some options
right so we can come down here and you
can see things like install WordPress or
use a Weebly one of these things here
however you know maybe see a installed
Drupal ticket there we actually need to
go to 1-click installs now this is going
to take you to an entirely separate site
however it's sort of connected with all
these install scripts through Bluehost
called this mojo marketplace now here we
can actually select what we want to
install and you'll see there's no option
for Drupal 8 just quite yet because that
is not fully released yet however we can
install Drupal 7 which is the current
latest version so let's go ahead and
select Drupal 7 here and we can click
the green install button now it's going
to ask you which of your domains you
would like this to install to if you
have multiple domains on your account
you can go ahead and pick them up to the
drop down or you could install it into a
directory however I'd probably recommend
just installing it to a domain and not a
directory on your account now we can
come and click check domain this is just
going to run a quick check it's going to
allow you to see some Advanced Options
which yeah we'll like to see some
Advanced Options and you want to check
the I've read the Terms so for the
Advanced Options we can have things like
our site name and title so we can just
say Bluehost Drupal okay just so we can
have something the site email and this
is what email address you'd like the
site to send it email updates to so I'm
just going to put my email in there now
admin username and admin email address
and an admin password here now feel free
to not use or try this password on this
URL because it's not going to work I'm
going to change it just after submitting
this install so you can go ahead and
click that Install Now button and it's
going to go ahead and start to install
your site okay so now you're greeted
with this message that your install is
underway it's going to let you know when
your install is complete if your install
is complete you'll be able to access it
and you'll have a site online with the
domain already totally set up now the
difference here between what we covered
in the rest of the Drupal tutorials and
what this sort of installation is like
is that in the drupal tutorials we're
showing you how to do everything on your
local filesystem with the intent that
you would later move that website to a
hosting platform or something with
Bluehost or a shared in one of these
1-click installs this is your site it
exists online and if you want to access
the files first site you'll have to do
so through an FTP interface now if you
don't know or understand FTP now might
be a good opportunity to brush up on the
basics of that ok so we have your
install is complete and now we can view
credentials and we can click view if you
would like to see your credentials for
the site however we can actually just
browse to our site based on the URL that
you have your Bluehost account
registered to we can simply just type
that in and you can see we have a Drupal
install and it's using our Bluehost
Drupal it's having the basic Drupal
theme here and we can go ahead and add
our username and now that we've logged
in let's go ahead and save this password
we now have access to the admin
interface so like I mentioned before
when adding modules and things like that
you're going to want to go ahead and do
so a via an FTP interface because these
files are not located on your local
machine but located on the shared
Bluehost server but either way this site
now exists online and at the time of
this video if you're checking this out
you could really go to this URL which
I'll have in the description of the
video and see that this Drupal Bluehost
site exists so perfect we now have
Drupal 7 up and running in absolutely no
time at all installed on a shared
hosting which is blue hosting of course
and our sites on the Internet and we're
ready to start getting to modifying
adding our content changing up our theme
and doing all sorts of cool stuff with
your brand-new site so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments in a
comment the video artist of a true or
face book at level up tutorials we love
to hear from you also if you're
considering signing up for blue hosting
please do so with the link in the
description of the video that actually
helps level up tutorials out a ton
seeing how we don't charge for in our
videos so if you are interested in
Bluehost go ahead and sign up as a
shared hosting service I can highly
recommend it if you like this video
