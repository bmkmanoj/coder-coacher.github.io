love-love Tut's and today we're gonna
talk more about
more importantly Drupal Commerce
as a whole what's cool about commerce
kickstart here as it has all this stuff
for us to make everything nice and easy
and particularly you might be noticing
this doesn't look a whole ton like
Drupal but you know it's it's mystery
will start to you know show through and
you'll be able to start to see all the
Drupal elements and they're just
rescanned redone in a way and it's gonna
feel like home if you're used to working
in Drupal so one thing is when you first
install it it comes to that getting
started and it gives you a little video
and some information if you click down
to that and you want to get back to it
you can actually go to help and it's
gonna show up here getting started and
down here it gives you all these great
resources how to get set up with PayPal
and all this stuff and there's a Help
section built in to Drupal shows you how
to do all this great stuff so this is a
huge jump forward because when Drupal
commerce was first released for Drupal 7
I mean it was just it was really
confusing there was no documentation
things were breaking non-stop and
because nobody was using it nobody knew
how to use it
and you'd had to pay a specialist to do
anything so this is a huge jump forward
and commerce kickstart 2 is pretty much
the only way I would do a Drupal
commerce project at this point so it
looks great so let's give a brief tour
of Drupal commerce kickstart here and
you first item on your menu is reports
we don't have access to any reports
right now because to do that you need to
sign up for this giraffe account and you
can do that and then you'll enter your
ID and token it's going to show up we'll
do that in another video so let's not
worry about reports just yet so down
here we also have products if you click
on products it's going to take you to
basically this is the equivalent of
content you click on this and this is
going to be sort of like the content
screen you can filter by you know your
content types and stuff like that you
can see all your most recent content
however it's really just products if you
hover over this and we click manage
products it's going to be the same
screen so this is your manage products
if you go to add a product this is where
you can add your different types of
products and here you have all these two
types of products which would be like
your content types and you'll notice
that we have over here another tab
that's add content and this might be a
little bit more familiar because these
are your Drupal content types basic page
however they give you a couple other
ones they give you ad push they've
renamed article to blog post and they
have slideshow which is the slideshow
right here so that's great and let's see
what else we have for settings we have
categories so our categories are sort of
like our taxonomy you see edit
vocabulary so we have bag size if we
list the terms this is going to be the
different bag sizes but this is really
just a taxonomy so all of this should
feel right at home because this is the
same thing you're doing in Drupal it's
just a little bit different if you go to
variation types same deal it's going to
be your content types
it's so familiar that we have manage
fields manage display edit it's the same
thing it's reskin it's a little bit
different but it's the stuff you want
and it what this is this is why this
commerce kickstart is so great you're
all set up here and this is a storefront
this doesn't feel like this doesn't
necessarily feel like Drupal has been
you know twisted into something it isn't
this feels like it should be a store
okay so next up is orders here we have
all of our orders you can manage them by
default the sample data it's given us
three orders we can do this quick at it
and it's going to allow us to edit that
information here or we can click this
drop down edit and edit it further we
can also add an order directly from the
backend adding line items we can add a
discount you can put in your your
customers information so over here we
have content so content is just like
products except for it's your content
visit it should be exactly what you'd
expect it's your normal Drupal content
your your comments your content you can
add content
you can add content types if you use
Drupal this is all exactly what your
going to be exactly what you'd expect
however one thing you're gonna notice
here is that not only do you have your
content types
like your blog posts and stuff you also
have your products which they are
referring to as a product display here
and the simple yes lets you know that
this is a type of product and this is a
page itself cool so we can always add
more and we'll be doing lots of that and
star settings is where it gets a little
crazy in site settings where you'd
expect a lot of this other stuff to be
that you've used before some of it under
a different name so in the next video
we're gonna go over these two settings
and we're gonna get you all set up so
you know exactly what to do when you
want to start your drupal commerce
project as always this has got a little
of touched thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
