huts and today we're going to be talking
about loops in javascript in why might
you use a loop well so we have this
array here and i actually going to just
remove it so it's just numbers one
through five just like this and this
array it just contains what to do for
five what happens if we wanted to output
every single item in this array you know
we could say we learned last time that
you use this bracket notation to pick
out an item with its index out of an
array and so we could say 1 2 or 0 1 2 3
we could go on like this and eventually
let's refresh our page here you could
see it counsel logging off you know all
of these items well we just wrote four
lines and got back four measly
characters so that really doesn't seem
efficient because I mean really the
whole point of computer programming in
general is to take things that are
complex and make them simpler using the
computers language that do things for
you right so this isn't doing anything
for us we're doing this out ourselves so
what is a way that we can go through
this array and print out every single
item to the council well the answer lies
within loops and the first loop we're
going to show you is just the for loop
so to do this loop we're going to say
for and then parentheses and inside
parentheses we're going to first need to
define some sort of counting variable
and because we're using a we're going to
be outputting items from this array with
an index starting at 0 so we can get the
first one it makes sense for our counter
to be 0 so the way we define this is
just VAR i equals 0 and then
semicolon now keep in mind that this
variable name we're using I hear that's
just because it's pretty standard for
what people use but you can definitely
use whatever you want I would probably
just use I in most situations unless it
makes more sense to you something else
but if you see this it's just a
convention now the next thing the next
parameter we need in here is going to be
basically the statement that keeps this
thing running so we want to say as long
as I is less than and then we want it to
be less than the total length of this
list so as long as I is less than the
length of this list then keep going so
the list is 55 items long right via
right here so we could say if I is less
than five then keep going but what
happens if we were to then modify this
and say here like this this would break
our app and then we'd have to change
here and here to actually get this
working a better way to do this is to
pull the length directly from the list
itself and we can do that with the
length object property so we can say my
list dot length and that's actually
going to give us the length will be 5 or
6 or depending how ever many items we
have in this array and so now we can say
this loop is going to keep on running as
long as I is less than my list dot
length and then for the last thing we
need to do we need to say what happens
every iteration of this loop and now we
want to increase I by 1 every single
loop so every single time this loops
around I is going to advance by one now
instead of here we're going to counsel
log and inside of our parentheses we
want to output my list but this time
inside of the brackets we can just use
our I variable and this I variable is
going
the index at every single point through
this loop so basically our code is going
to hit this it's going to define my list
and then it's going to hit this loop and
it's going to say okay I is equal to
zero is I less than my list length yes
all right now go through and the council
log my list with an index of zero done
now add 1 to I okay it is I less than my
length yes now count a log of my list
with an index of one okay now add
another one and it's going to keep on
doing that until this property right
here is satisfied and saying that this
is no longer correct so let's come to
our page here refresh and you'll notice
it's council logging one two three four
five just like we expected and now check
this out we can say you know anything we
add anything to our list refresh and
it's always going to output this entire
list so loops are extremely powerful
you're going to use them a lot and
there's lots of different types of live
loops so we're going to go over another
type of loop in the next video and it's
going to be the wild loop and you're
going to see the power of that and then
you can experiment with them as always
if you have any questions or comments
please to become in the video and it's a
bit Twitter level up tuts ross on
facebook we're all over the place come
to our website check it out and let us
know what you think and this is scott to
lenski the level of Tut's and thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
