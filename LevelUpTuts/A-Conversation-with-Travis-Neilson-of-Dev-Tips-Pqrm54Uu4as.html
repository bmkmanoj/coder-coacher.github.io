Tut's and today i'm talking with travis
nielsen from dev tips on youtube and if
you haven't checked out his channel you
got to check it out it's / dev tips for
designers at YouTube I'm gonna put a
link in the comments to make sure you
get a hold of that he's got a lot of
great content including a great new
series on how to build a site from
scratch which is something that a lot of
viewers on level of Tut's have been
asking for so instead of waiting for me
to put that together you should just go
to dev tips yeah so just check his
series out you're going to get a lot of
great information so I just want to say
how did Travis how you doing today uh
well um just today actually I stayed
home from work and did YouTube like all
day long so um that started this kind of
morning afternoon ish when I had a live
broadcast an episode of dev tips called
dev tips live with an exclamation and it
was it was so stressful to be honest it
was like fun and stuff but it was so
stressful because um like I was trying
to get get all my materials organized i
forgot half of the things i wanted to
say and you know like in them in the
moment and and like even half it halfway
through the broadcast i clicked stop
broadcast on accident and I shut down
the whole the whole thing and you can't
just start again like Google I don't
know why but you can't just start
broadcasting again so I'd like make a
new one and I'll try to get everybody to
come over to it was just it was quite a
mess but we had a lot of fun I think
everybody that was there enjoyed it did
some giveaways we did some some code
examples and just kind of like met
everybody like on a human level try you
know learn their names where they're
from what they do we have a really wide
audience all across the globe there's
people from Africa Gemma joining in
Europe was there of Ukraine i think was
there a few from America but not as much
as you'd think it was really really fun
nice so have you was this your first
time doing one of those
our view done like a live meetups before
with the like the coding community I've
done meetups like in person like I have
a series on my channel where I go to
meet ups and interview people one-on-one
and ask them questions I try to make it
like you know really cool I try to make
it cool I try to make it like like um
insightful you know like I asked them
questions that may be new designers or
creators or maybe even seasoned people
would like get inspiration from that
that's the word I try to make it
inspirational when I do that and I think
there's like three or four videos
probably the most popular one is where I
I talked to to Dan cederholm who's the
creator or the co-founder of dribble and
I talked to him for a little while and
he talks about why he got into the the
creative community and what he does to
help out and what what it does to pay
him back and like the good feels and
stuff so that was a really good video
but yeah this is the first time that
we've done like a Google Hangouts live
thing and it was not without
complication but you know you live and
learn and I think that it's possible
we'll do another one although like I'm
like d decompressing from it it was like
I don't know if you can tell when you
watch the video but I'm like uh uh is so
bad I mean that's kinda that's got to be
really just a great way to meet like you
said meet the community and inspire
people and everything like that that's
got to be it like a great experience and
certainly something that level of Tut's
should consider but you know I don't
know if I'd be able to handle like that
kind of audience that's one of the
tenants of my channel is that it's it's
about you know people um I try to keep
in mind that when we're creating and
coding and designing and kind of it's
not just a job or it's not just a hobby
but it's a way to connect people you
know what we live in you know of course
the most connected generation of of the
history of the planet earth but it's
because of people it's because of this
tech now
but also again it really almost all
boils down to just being people and
being human and so I'm interested in
people's stories a lot I like to ask
people you know how they arrived at the
spot there in and what kind of lessons
they've learned along the way and
hopefully I can like glean from them and
kind of add their stories and their
lessons into my own cool yeah so let's
actually talk a little bit about your
channel right so dev tips you started it
when um dev tips started a little more
than a year ago um so the story behind
the channel of the quick story is I work
for a company that um that helps youtube
and people who use YouTube and I was not
a youtuber at the time but I went to a
YouTube convention and I just met all
these creators and as a designer and as
a developer myself like I know what
creativity looks like and I and I and I
love the rush of creativity and just
being at this convention it was like
oversaturated with just that that raw
creative power everywhere I looked
everybody was like doing something and
excited about it and just like enjoying
each other on like a very human level
and it was like really really thrilling
to see and and um while i was on the
convention show floor I signed up for
dev tips on YouTube that's a that's like
that's got to be like super inspiring to
just look feel that energy and just know
like I'm just gonna do this right like
I'm sure that was just like a moment
where you just like felt felt right to
wanna to start it and I mean your
channel looks great so you have this
like whole just hold general aesthetic
right and the one the first thing I
noticed about your channel was your
welcome video it's just really well shot
and well well made so can you tell me a
little bit about like what was your
inspiration for the visual aspect of
your videos I know like like I said the
very first thing you notice is just like
when I saw that video and you had like
great lighting
no obviously high quality I was like man
I gotta step up my production game right
because this is this is like some high
quality high quality production well
thanks for saying that yeah I do take a
lot lot of time and effort to put into
the videos and and they're not all on
the top level you know like some are you
know better than others of course but
like I do take a lot of interest in
making sure that it that it looks good
and is entertaining and it feels good
the video that first video mentioned is
a funny one because um I had that was
actually the first video ever made right
like I didn't make a few videos and then
make it welcome I like started out with
a welcome video and which outlined the
vision of what it was going to be and
and like if the vision went this way
like what actually happened went way the
way up this way and so it's really
really funny to go back and look at that
first video of a year ago and like to
see like the the ideas that I had that
what would be and kind of what it would
it ended up being what the reality was
but I think even from the beginning it
the channel has always been inspired by
the the YouTube aesthetic or the YouTube
culture of vlogging and so it every
video nearly every video anyways begins
with my face and it's not because I love
my face it's because I want that
connection again it's it's I really feel
that it's all about people so I feel
that when when people especially you
know I have sometimes in my head the
vision of this kind of young creator
this young programmer or designer who
just wants to get better and doesn't
know doesn't have a mentor you know
wasn't lucky enough to find somebody or
a class or somebody and they're looking
to latch onto up to a personality and I
think that dev tips can offer that a
little bit anyway because I I mean I
respond to every comment that's put on
the channel I like I want to hear
from people how they're using the things
that they're they learn in fact the long
the long the series that you mentioned
earlier that how to how to create a
website from start to finish I planned
it out to be like like seven or eight
videos but it turned out to be 23 or 24
and the reason is because we were we
were collaborating on github so I would
like put something up and then I would
get like 20 pull requests the next day
and I'm like well okay so i made a video
about pull request and then everybody
saw that I was making videos about pull
requests and they they brought those in
so it so it's really cool in the way
that like it's not just about getting
the job done or learning the skill but
it's about like you know learning how to
work with somebody and learning how to
respect somebody's ideas and their
preferences and you know their history
their past what they bring to the table
I think that's that's all a big part of
what coding and creativity and design is
is um interacting and understanding
other people cool and I think that's
just like a I mean it's it's great
because there are like a lot of just
like straight tutorial channels out
there right and I think that's really
what sets your channel apart is really
that it's about it's about more than
just like just saying hey type these
keys you know and this is the result you
get like you said it's about it's about
like the people involved in everything
like that and I think that's just a like
a really fantastic aspect about your
channel I'm glad you like it it's not
for everybody some people I get some
comments sometimes that are like what is
this dude's face doing on the YouTube I
don't need this face just get to the
code everybody's like you know you took
20 minutes to explain something that I
could have explained in five I get a lot
of that kind of stuff too not a lot
actually I get some of it most of the
community is actually very very genuine
and they're very helpful too yeah no I
mean I see the same thing I get like
most like ninety-five percent of the
comments are like really positive and
then
there's always like the one person who's
like why did you decide to do it this
way or look what why did you decide to
take this long to explain something and
look well you know I wanted to appeal to
everybody but you can't appeal to
everybody and at the end of day there's
always gonna be some people who are feel
you know not with it there but have you
seen that me that meme it's a and E from
the office oh yeah and he's like I'm so
sorry I bothered you with my sincerity
yeah yes or whatever yeah it's like
sorry I bothered you with my free
contact yeah I know that you did not pay
for and that you're watching for free
onion right I know I ok so your first
video was your introduction which is a
great first video my first video was a a
terrible Adobe Premiere tutorial and
they were like so bad I pretty much like
promptly abandoned that series I think
they're actually still available it
might be like the first video on my
channel I have like one or two premiere
videos and then they're just like don't
exist anymore because at first yeah I
wasn't just gonna do web development it
was like level of Tut's was going to be
tutorials about all sorts of topics and
then I I narrowed the focus down a lot
to web development stuff right but so
what was your first video that was on
topic of what you want to do your
channel so you had your welcome what was
your first video experience like when
you're actually creating your content
like can you tell me about it cuz mine
was super awkward and it took me hours
to do and the editing was terrible so
yeah if you watch um the so okay so the
first video series that i did was html5
basics i called a basic series so and
it's really cool actually I'm still
pretty proud of it it steps you through
like the history of it where it came
from why it's important like the ideas
behind it how it's built like why they
why did the creators of HTML choose to
create it that way it talks about all
that stuff and then it talks about the
tags and then the attributes and then
you know how to nest in the Dom and it
talks about all that stuff too but like
it really goes into the ideas and those
were the first ones that I that I
created but it's really funny if you
look at them it's like
it's like this dude this dude does not
know he's doing and it's like it's like
like everything is a quick jump cut and
everything is like ah you're not like
like HTML it's really really really it's
really something else um but I think
like over time you get like into a
rhythm and you kind of find out what
your voice is and the only way that you
can do that is by creating you know if
you if you sit in your room and plan out
what you're gonna be like you never
actually know what you're gonna be like
you just know what you plan to be like
and it's always different yeah and I I
totally I totally get that I feel like
um some of the first times i'm on camera
like in my videos i think they the
current introduction video i have is
like super old it was shot on in my old
camera and like at that point i just
didn't have like I wasn't comfortable
and i'm still like it's still like very
new to me right but the audio aspect of
if i don't have a camera on me like i
can just talk and at first that was
uncomfortable and after a year or two it
was just like like you're talking to
anybody like you're talking to a friend
or something like that and then it all
just gets easier and easier and then
you're like second nature whatever it's
fun you know yeah yeah it's interesting
the idea of finding so so when I made
the Welcome video I didn't know what dev
tips was going to be I didn't really
have a personality for it yeah I thought
I did but didn't so I've taken I've
taken that learning and I'm doing a new
project with a friend of mine were doing
a podcast and before we even released
the first episode we're going to we're
going to record and edit and produce and
write three episodes and we're gonna and
we're going to lay them out on the table
and say okay what do we like what what
are we what are we good at you know and
beef and I'm really excited about that
kind of that kind of process before I
just start like if I release the first
episode before I know what the podcast
is going to be about like what's our
cadence going to be a and I think that
it would it would turn out to be not as
focused as if we discover ourselves
first and then start publishing in it
it's very similar to you know somebody
who wants to be a designer or somebody
who wants to be a developer that they
have that like they have those few years
before they're hired or before they have
that big job and make that get their
break where they can just make weird
stuff you know and and just kind of like
figure out what their voice is I think
that is a is a really precious time for
people that want to be creators and it
can also be a really hard time as well
people have a frustration they have to
like work through this i this this stage
in their life where they don't have
their voice they don't know what they
want to say or how they want to be
portrayed or or what they want to build
but they know that they want to build
something great and they have they
understand what greatness is that's a
really frustrating time for a lot of
people and I think that a lot of the
people that watch my channel kind of
fall somewhere in there I mean there's
some very very very very um like
experienced people that just you know
join in and on the channel but I think a
lot of all of the people that that are
watching them you know they want
something more and they're not exactly
sure what they have to offer and where
they fall in line cool yeah soo ah so in
your professional career and in dev tips
or just your your life essentially do
you see yourself as any more of a
designer or developer or are you just
serve this like more of like a holistic
like everything I just accept you know
web or not just web or whatever like
what would you define your your primary
not only like professional expertise but
just primary like what excites you to
make things and and you know that was
like a lot of great question yeah that's
a great question how do you label
yourself yeah exactly yeah propelling it
more concisely there yeah when on the
other video when I was asking me other
questions when you're in the hot seat I
mentioned that you know like right here
like if you know if this is my interest
a meter Yeah right here is is coding and
it's really high actually I love coding
I think it's fantastic I get such a kick
out of it and then right above it I'm a
designer professionally yeah I I love to
work with people and understand how they
would approach a problem and try to
design for them and solve a
communication thing and then and then
above that probably like the thing that
really gets me going is is the idea of
creation and what that looks like when
when people are going through their
lives you know like what are the daily
practices that a creator will assume in
order to become a better creator being
in charge of their creative health and
being in charge of their their career if
that's what it is or being in charge of
their happiness through creation there's
this concept that I recently ran into
and in it and I've understood the edges
of it for a very long time but i
recently watched this TED talk and it
just kind of you know like when you when
you hear something that you know already
but they're saying it in a way that's
very clear my brain was just lighting up
like I was so excited that somebody
understood this thing's better than me
so they could tell me something that I
already knew better than that I knew it
does that I don't know if that makes
sense but they were ok so it was about
creative flow this video and this guy
who have you seen this one I feel I've
watched a absolute ton of TED talks and
I may have so it might sound familiar
like halfway through yeah so it's very
specific this guy had done a lot of
research on what makes people happy and
he and he had this awesome grid and it
was and he had this grid which was like
um like on the on the ex sorry on the y
it was like um difficulty right the
culty of the problem and on the y or
started i'm getting infused right now on
the huh that's the X on the X it was um
this skill level that you currently
right so all of your problems can be
plotted somewhere on this graph it's
very difficult that you have a lot of
skill is not very difficult but you
don't have any skill it's it's very
difficult and you have all the skills
you know like that all that kind of just
plot them all on there and and they
measured what makes people excited what
kind of problems make people give people
vitality right and and they they found
out that it was definitely when you know
when you're on the up and to the right
so when you have a difficult problem but
you have the skill to solve it that's
what makes people go into a state where
he described it as flow okay and people
are confident in what they're doing
they're excited by a challenging problem
but they but they have like this energy
for it right and the you get into this
zone called flow and the way he
described flow was that you um you
actually will lose part part of your
ability to understand yourself let me
back up let me back up that didn't make
sense so he started with the premise of
understanding your your nervous system
your nervous system can can can
translate 110 bytes per second to your
brain okay so if you're talking and
somebody's speaking they speak at 60
bits per second to brain right 60 so
that's why you have a hard time when you
get more than two people talking at you
at one time to understand anything
that's going on because your brain gets
overloaded literally so this state of
flow will affect your whole brain in
your nervous system so much it will make
you so excited and like you'll be
building and just kind of like in it so
much like and you've had these moments i
know you have where you've forgotten to
eat or you didn't realize it was cold in
the room or somebody was speaking to you
and you didn't hear them like like the
reason that happened in a very like
physiological way is because you were so
excited and focused on a problem that
you're trying to solve that your brain
could not pay attention to the rest of
your body yeah and that's interesting
that
speaks like very very true to like I
think my wife has said several times
like if it wasn't for me you would never
eat cuz like i do i get it like i'll get
home and i'll just be working on
something like level of Tut's or
anything and just be just in it right
and and then next thing i know it's
eight o'clock i haven't eaten dinner I'm
like well get some maybe a little hungry
or something you know but yeah I know
exactly the feeling of just being so
into something that you nothing else is
is in your thought process at all so
that's that's really cool to hear when
you asked me to describe myself or put a
label on it I think that's where I would
definitely go towards like I i make i
make designs and I make code so that my
designs can live and I make videos so
that my codes can live with designs and
and and and now i'm making a podcast so
i can tell people and talk with people
about the creative lifestyle and you
know it like it like it i have another
channel where I make music and I work I
do a teach people how to use the iPad to
make music and and it's all like this
big circle of create creation right it's
not like it's not the traditional idea
of creativity where you think this
person is creative they must do things
it's about grabbing different things
that exist in the world and putting them
together into a unique shape and
creating something new out of that I
don't believe that I don't believe that
anything was created out of nothing I
don't I don't think it's possible I've
never seen it but I think that
everything that we experience stands on
the shoulders of something that came
before it and and I'm just very very
interested in that so if you ask me for
my label i would say creator I have to
that's I have to create yeah no I think
that's like very obvious from your work
both on youtube and off of youtube like
I think like the stuff you do is just
very um I don't know it sort of just
very genuine looking right there if
there's like a no other word to describe
it it just looks like it was created by
somebody who who just like who feels
things right who creates it like not not
necessarily like
I'm going to create this because I have
to it's like I'm creating this because
it is me and it's part of all of these
experiences I've had in life it's pulled
in and in like it's shout out in these
different different ways right I just
viewed that abuse I think that shows
that I'm very flattered that's that's
very known that I think it's like
tremendously obvious with not only the
visual appeal but just like the general
style and and just like the well-rounded
everything just like sort of speaks to
that that as a whole so I think that's a
I think that's like the one of the most
inspiring things about things like in
art or or technology in general right so
like even in music there's some artists
you can just hear that that uh that like
genuine um force that it was created
with and it just feels differently than
music that was created for purely like
monetary reasons or purely just because
they have to put out a record because
their contract right it just feels very
different you'll see this in a lot in
when bands put up their first album you
know it's full of angst and and kind of
like reroute that realness because
they've been like they didn't make that
album yesterday you know they made that
album three over three or four years as
long as they've been a band and their
second album is usually like what
because they didn't have three or four
years of angst and like uncertainty to
kind of like inspire that album it was
like okay we you did good now do it
again and like and you know to me in
like it's it's a different way of going
about it so bands that can that can keep
that like the magic of their first album
usually have like a way of understanding
of understanding themselves that you
that you don't see with bands that lose
it right away I mean you're obviously
like you you're really into the YouTube
creator seen in general right you you
follow YouTube creators you know a lot
of channels right so what are
your favorite like most inspiration
non-development tutorials like non web
or creative whatever tutorials like what
what kind of like channels excite you on
YouTube and you don't have to give me
like a certain number just like one or
two but like what channels and like why
do they excite you so um what one
channel that comes to mind is is a good
mythical morning do you no good mythical
more and I don't know it's it's a talk
show it's it's these two guys that are
they're very funny very cool like
they're very nice and they have this
like this kind of a present that you
just like that you're talking right to
them and and I've always thought like
they they know it they nailed it like
they know what they're doing you know it
they also have another channel called
rhett and link which is I think maybe
more popular i'm not sure but it's a
talk show so like every every episode is
just like a different topic like
sometimes they eat peppers sometimes
they talk about something in the news
and it's not unplanned or you know
off-the-cuff it's very it's very
scripted very like very professional
they have a very beautiful set to it's
really good but I I love the way that
it's just like so personal I think that
if I could touch people in the way that
like I perceive that they are then I
think I would be a really big success I
really like them and also another
another channel that like you know
either might be a shock that I like it
or might be obvious that I like it you
know it depending on where you come from
is PewDiePie yeah yeah like okay so
obviously he is the biggest channel on
youtube so a lot of people like it sure
but I don't like like I like pewdiepie
because I think he's super super genuine
I do like and I know that you might
think like oh he's a millionaire from
YouTube he's got to be you know a
celebrity kind of whatever but like if
you like watch his stuff like he's just
such a genuine happy person like I don't
know I really like him and like I think
I mean that speaks exactly to what we
were talking there's just something
about like that authenticity
and the things that you're making that
just shines through the material level
of whatever you're doing whether it's
like a video but that authenticity just
like cuts right out of that video like
into the viewer and I think that that
really makes like a big difference if
you do something to do it like as you
doing like how you how it feels right
for you to do it right and I think that
just that shines through so I think
those are those are like great great
inspirations especially for like what
you're trying to do with your channel
yeah I tried to bring actually know like
when I talked about sorry like what I
talked about creativity is pulling from
different you know it like if I focused
on just what I perceive coding channels
to be only that and that was my only
inspiration it would look exactly like
every other coding channel which is not
bad like there's very very good channels
out there but I tried to pull from
different things so I look at news
broadcasting I look at hi honey so I
look at news broadcasting I look at
different like kind of talk shows and I
want to incorporate that kind of very
very close pneus with with the audience
