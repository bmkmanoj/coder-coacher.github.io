up tutorials and in this series I'm
going to be showing you a new text
editor called Visual Studio code now
Visual Studio code as you can see is
free open source and runs everywhere
that means you can use it on OS X
Windows and Linux so just like atom or
sublime text this sort of follows in the
steps of these new sort of text editors
that follow in the footsteps of things
like text mate and text Wrangler things
like that that came before it now what
is cool about Visual Studio and why
should you use it over let's say atom or
sublime text
well Visual Studio code is in fact built
on electron which is the same thing that
atom is built on so you might assume
that vs code ends up having these same
issues that atom has in fact you'll be
happy to know that vs code is without
many of these issues for instance I've
been using atom and sublime text for a
long time I've been using both of them
and in some projects they work just fine
sublime text performance wise works well
all the time however as my project grew
Adamle got slower and slower and
initially Adam wasn't a great fit for me
because I felt like it was a little slow
and improved and then as I got really
comfortable with it I really liked it
however once my projects got bigger Adam
did not work and in fact I saw a lot of
things if you google atom high CPU usage
your atom high memory usage you actually
get some people who work on atom saying
perhaps Adam isn't the right platform
for your development if you need
something faster so that brings me to
visual studio code now how much faster
is Visual Studio code well I can't
necessarily give you any sort of real
metrics however I'm using it on the same
project that really caused Adam to
stutter and
not had any issues it's been a really
nice experience and at first coming
directly from Adam to Visual Studio code
I was not convinced but let me but let's
actually check out Visual Studio code
here and you can see some of the things
I like so much about it so let's go
ahead and click download and it's going
to just download a zip just like would
be used to with any sort of their
application now you can see that there's
you know a lot of good stuff here and it
tells you you can watch these basic
videos or things like that we're going
to be covering all the basic stuff but
what is it Visual Studio code give you
that some other platforms don't well it
gives you a built-in interface for
things like get and that debugging
allows you to debug directly from chrome
and it gives you intellisense which is
sort of their auto completion and syntax
highlighting which is great and
occasionally will get in the way and
annoy you however it is very very nice
now the get stuff that's built in is
top-notch and works really really well
and the debugging stuff is great too now
there's also a whole ton undone of
plugins and extensions some of the
things support I wish was a little bit
better for instance you can't really
theme vs code itself like the sidebar
right now it's only changing the code
and some of the tabs you know this blue
bar is probably here to stay for right
now unless you want to get in and tweak
the CSS what vs code does really well is
it borders the line between a full-on
IDE and a text editor so that you get
access to a lot of features that you
wouldn't get it normally access to and a
lot of other text editors you get them
in a nice easy package that you can also
just use as a text editor if you'd like
so okay I opened up the zip finish
downloading I have vs code here I'm
going to drag it to my applications and
from my applications I'm going to go
ahead and just drag it into my dock and
it won't leave there because it's what
I'm using currently on my main machine
okay so now that that's there we can
click visual studio code yes we want to
open it Thank You Apple for looking out
I guess let's come in here let's open
this and let's make this a nice big size
here so at first going
ants vs code looks very familiar to what
you'd be used to we have our line number
we have our tabs over here we have some
files we have searching we have get we
have debugging and we have our
extensions now let's go ahead and I'm
going to open up a new project or not a
new project with an old project I'm
going to open it up in vs code so we can
just sort of see what it looks like out
of the box okay dropping this in creates
a new window for us I'm going to
maximize this a little bit feel the
option and shift and click this green
button right here it's going to zoom it
up full screen rather than go full
fullscreen and you can see here this is
what we have to show all commands you do
command shift P and that brings up all
your commands to go to a file you can do
command P to find in files you can do
command shift F and it's going to give
you the find button and then if you just
hit f5 it would give you to the deep
bugging or you can even toggle the
built-in terminal which is nice to have
a built in terminal now many times I
still use item 2 just because I like it
so much and I have all my profile set up
but having the option to be able to
let's open up the terminal here at the
adoption to have a built in terminal
here is really nice especially just for
up and getting your app up and running
ok let's close this let's close the
search and let's check out the files
here you can see over in the left hand
column we have sort of a similar
Explorer to what you see in other
platforms the benefits are here is that
we get a little bit more action here we
get some a new folder new file refresh
we get collapsed all which will close
all of these if we open them up
if we click to open a file you can see
it looks really nice so with the default
color it's a little bit washed out but
you can always change your syntax theme
easily enough and we also have open
editors which is basically just our
files that are open if we click that
it's gone ok so this isn't going to be a
full on a bout vs code right here just a
little introduction as you can see we
have everything
up and running and we have V s code
going and we have our project open to it
if you didn't catch how I open our
project I simply just dragged the
project folder on to the icon and it
opened it up similar to as any other
program that you would use like this but
vs coders are really nice an alternative
over the next few videos are going to be
showing you some of the finer features
I'm going to be showing you some of the
great extension some of my favorite
stuff we're going to get this tuned up
so that it is working really nicely for
you you can add your own snippets you
can add your own extensions and just
sort of really customize vs code to work
really well for you so as always this is
Scott without love tutorials if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment the video hurt me up at Twitter
or Facebook ad level up tutorials thanks
so much for watching and I'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
