up tuts and today I'm gonna do a quick
tutorial just to introduce variables and
strings within Java and really like I
said in the first couple lessons these
aren't going to be comprehensive Java
tutorials at all and really I'm just
going to teach you as much Java as you
need to get around and build your apps
in Android but I figured I would start
at the very very basics just so those of
you who have no programming or no Java
experience once whoever will sort of
know what's going on of course if you
have any sort of Java experience and you
know even if you've been programming a
little bit this is gonna be a breeze and
there's really nothing crazy here at all
so feel free to skip this video if you
know any bit of Java because this is
gonna be the absolute most very basic
thing you could know okay so first off
I'm gonna start talking about variables
and a variable is sort of what you'd
expect it to be it's sort of something
that holds some bit of information so
that you can reuse it so one type of
variable is a string and a string is
just a group of characters like a word
or anything like that that you're going
to repeat it's not a number that you're
it's not an array of things those are
other different data types so this data
type string is what you'd be used for
any sort of text that you're going to be
printing out or something like that so
what we want to do to declare a variable
is you need to first declare what kind
of data type it is so like I explained
these are going to be strings and a
string is text so we need to say is
string okay
and so we're declaring that this
variable is going to be a string we'll
go over like I said other data types
like arrays and true or false values and
things like that in later tutorials but
okay so we're saying that this is a
string and then we're going to declare
our variable name so our variable name
is sort of like an alias that you give
your variable so when you're referring
to this
it's the variables name so you can refer
to it by this
and they convinced for this is to start
with lowercase and if you have more than
one word it's called camel case where
the second word is capitalized and the
you can use numbers but generally
conventions are don't start with a
number don't use any special characters
unless it's like an underscore or
something and the general is to use this
camel case so I'm gonna say this string
is a hello world string and so notice
how I capitalized world and next I'm
going to say it's equal so the string is
equal to and then when you're declaring
strings you need to wrap them in quotes
so I'm gonna say hello world string is
going to be equal to hello world era
let's say hello
tuts okay and one last thing we need to
finish this off with the semicolon a
semicolon is a way to end your line in
Java so this this right here string
hello world is equal to level up tuts
this is setting your first variable
hello world as hello level up tuts and
now later in our application when we
want to do things like print out hello
level of tuts anytime we want to do that
we just be printing this variable and
it's gonna know to print this text like
I said this is just the very basic
overview of strings we're gonna be
getting into a lot more stuff and how it
pertains to Android so in the next video
we're gonna be taking this knowledge of
variables and strings and we're gonna
make a variable and we're gonna do
something with it on our actual Android
application as always if you have any
questions or comments please leave it
come on this video hit us if it turned
our love up tuts like I said this is
very basic this is a very very small
chunk we're gonna be going over lots
more so let us know what you're thinking
this is Scott and thanks for watching
