tutorials and in this video we're gonna
be showing you waffle grids and flexbox
grids now waffle grids like vertical
grids are a little bit different than
something that we've seen before and
flexbox grids are really what we've seen
already with lost except for the code
sort of powering the grid system is just
a little bit different at using flexbox
instead of floats so check it out let's
get going right now so in the last video
we went over some helpful properties
that come with lost with the lost align
and loss center in this video we're
going to be talking about the waffle
grid as well as the flexbox grid that
come with lost so to get started let's
check out what the waffle grid exactly
is so let's come to our code here and
we're going to essentially let's come to
our HTML and I'm going to get rid of
these paragraph tags that we have the
last time we don't need them and I'm
going to combine grid one Ingrid to like
so then we have a lot more grid items
okay so let's see what that looks like
it should just be one big grid like that
cool and this is just your standard
wrapping grid like so if we were to
let's say have a one two three four i'm
just going to count up here that way we
can see exactly where each grid item is
that way we know what's vertical what's
horizontal that sort of thing okay
nothing crazy nothing crazy going on
there i can actually go ahead and give
this a font size of let's say like two
M's or something that should probably be
sufficient and for some reason an auto
completed two font style instead of size
okay there we go so we know if the
numbers here let's go ahead and try out
this waffle grid so we use lost hyphen
column before so let's come to our
widest breakpoint at the widest break
point which is this 13 right here you
can see that we have it into four
columns cycling on for with the 50 pixel
gutter now let's actually just
get rid of lost column and let's say
waffle so lost waffle I'm going to get
rid of this uh the cycle and all the
stuff too and I'm just going to say one
quarter so lost waffle one quarter notes
come and refresh our page and you'll
notice it's sort of interesting here we
basically have these divs and each of
their heights are wrapping the actual
container they're not really given any
height the height of the div is actually
being taken away the gutters vertically
and horizontally however are absolutely
the same so what is a waffle grid doing
it's sort of a combination vertical and
horizontal grid where the spacing is all
even and it's going to fill the height
of its parent now these because we
didn't give a height to the parent are
wrapping the content to sort of the
smallest size they can possibly be and
then with the gutter size so this is the
total height there let's go ahead and
actually give this grid a height so we
had grid one and we can give this a
height of something like 100 vh now this
is really interesting here if we inspect
this let's check out this grid let's
make sure it's at the widest spot here
so we can make sure the waffle girls
going on and you can see that we have
grid one and the height is 100 vh so one
hundred percent of the viewport here so
now each of these grid items is taking
up one quarter of the width as well as
one quarter of the height of its
container so it's creating sort of this
box or waffle where we have a bunch of
even spaces even gutters and even size
divs here so you can see when we
decrease this the height because the
heights not changing the height of each
of these divs won't change however if we
do change this from something like we
had 100 vh let's come to our CSS and
let's actually change this from 100 vh
to height and let's say 90 vh so you can
see as we go
down it's maintaining that even space to
visualize the height of the container
you can see that the divs are taking up
one quarter each so the waffle grid is
essentially combination of vertical and
horizontal grids so just like other
grids we can assign this a cycle and a
gutter in the same order and then a
determine whether or not it's going to
be using flexbox so let's actually get
into the flexbox grids for loss this is
a nice time to talk about that now the
flexbox grids are way cleaner than using
like a floating grid because you don't
need clear fixing it's using only flex
box instead of just floating your
elements and that's awesome however
flexbox has quite a bit less a browser
support then even calc does now calc you
can even augment with a polyfill and
flex box you can do some stuff to make
it a little bit better too but if you
need more backwards compatibility by all
means stick with the floating grids and
use the polyfill but if you don't check
out using the flexbox grid now you can
actually make any grid a flexbox grid
simply by adding flex to the end of the
properties let's actually remove this
waffle just to make things less
complicated and we're just going to say
column again and let's say it has a four
cycle it has a 30 gutter and let's go
ahead and say flex now by passing this
the Flex property here we can refresh
this you see we're almost there but
there's some weird stuff gone when if we
hit to our section you'll notice that
it's not actually getting a sort of
display flex obviously because we
haven't told it to so in our CSS where
we had our lost center we can simply add
flex here now I'm going to remove this
100 vh because we don't need anymore and
let's come back to our page and refresh
and as you can see our grid is now once
again looking like how we'd expect this
has a display flex on it so it's using
flexbox each of these items are no
longer floating what they're actually
flexing in here however let's go
ahead and say what we don't want to need
to throw flex on to everything right but
we still want to take advantage of the
Flex box grid we can actually set
flexbox to be the default grid system
simply by a setting here so let's come
it to the top of our page and let's add
a global setting like we did with the
gutters we could say lost and then now
the setting is going to be flexbox and
the value is going to be flex now if I
save this you'll notice that I don't
have flex box on my Center I don't have
flex box on any of my grid columns
however when we come to our page you can
see it all looks the same the sections
getting display flex and it just needs
and it just knows you want to be using
flexbox now for me I love using flexbox
and I don't need to support older
browsers like IE 8 so I typically use
the Flex box setting all the time
however if you do need to support those
browsers and make sure that you know
what is supported and what isn't before
getting in over your head so as always
this is scott level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments leave a
come in the video hit us up at Twitter
or Facebook I love to hear from you
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
