up tutorials and today we're gonna show
you how you can have your stylus
compiling and a more convenient nicer
way using gulp instead of this stylus
watch command now gulp
runs tasks for you like compiling your
sass or minifying your JavaScript or
anything like that and you don't need to
know a whole lot to get started so if
you want a little bit of a background
check out the level up tutorial series
on gulp it's really super helpful and
getting started and maybe getting a
little bit of an understanding however
you don't really need to know too much
about it because we're gonna be starting
at square one in this video so keep
watching we're gonna install cope we're
going to make a new gulp file and we're
going to get our packages ready so that
we can compile our stylus using gulp now
like I mentioned before I highly
recommend checking out our level up
tutorial series on gulp it's definitely
going to give you a good handle on
what's going on however we don't need
that for this particular video all we
need to do is install gulp globally on
our system first then we're going to
stall it within this project then we're
gonna create a configuration file and
then we can get started adding packages
like the gulp stylus package allows us
to compile our stylus from the gulp
build process so let's go ahead and
install it globally by typing sudo npm
install and then - - global and then
gulp it's for your password and it's
going to go ahead and install that for
you so now that we have gulp installed
globally now what we want to do is
install it into our project before we do
that I'm gonna go ahead and create a
packages file for our project that way
we can save our dependencies and reload
them anytime we're starting we're moving
this project around so to do that I'm
just have to type in npm in it it's
gonna ask you some questions now because
this is just a throwaway project i'm
just gonna hit enter through these
questions however if this is any sort of
legitimate project you're working on
you're gonna want to enter the the
values for these truthfully to what your
project is
so just asking for your name version
description entry point get repository
keyword that sort of stuff and I'm just
going to say yes because it's asking me
if this is okay okay so we now have a
package JSON file now let's add gulp to
our particular project by typing npm
install now we can type - - save - dev
gulp now this is going to install gulp
into this particular project and it's
going to add it to our packages JSON
file so if you check out that JSON file
you'll now see we have gulp three point
eight point one one added here as well
as we have this node modules folder with
gulp right here now let's actually get
started writing our gulp file let's go
ahead and create a new file in the root
of our directory and it's actually going
to be named gulp file J s simply like
that and what we're going to do is first
write a little bit of boilerplate code
so we can save our gulp equals require
and then within quotes gulp this is just
making this file have access to gulp
itself now we can say gulp that task and
we want to give this a task and uh here
we're going to give it a name this can
just be styles
now the philosophy behind gulp is you're
essentially creating a bunch of tasks
then you can create other tasks that
reference those tasks you can even have
like a default task that watches your
sass compiles when you change it or
anything like that so like I said if you
want to watch the gulp videos to get a
better handle on how to write more
robust and in better gulp files please
do it's definitely well worth your time
and now we can say comma function
because what this is doing is is running
a callback function
so once Styles task gets triggered this
is what it's going to do inside of here
okay so this is our little bit of
boilerplate code now what we can do is
go ahead and add our gulp stylus package
to the mix that way we can get gulp to
work with us in stylus so let's head
back to our terminal and let's type NPM
install and then we're a new - - say if
- dev again and then the package we're
going to be installing is gulp - stylus
so just like that gulp - stylus grenade
enter and if we head back to our project
you should see that we now have this
gulp - stylus in our package file and we
can go ahead and get adding it to our
gulp file so once again we can do var
and then we're gonna say stylus is equal
to and this time it's going to be
requiring the gulp - stylus package so
gulp - stylus and then finish it off
with a semicolon here so we're now
bringing in this variable stylus to
watch our stylus code and let's go ahead
and set up a task that compiles our CSS
so we're gonna say gulp period and this
method of gulp is going to be SRC and
this SRC method is going to be watching
a particular set of files for us it's
just going to be watching our main
stylus file that we had and that was
just styled
sty up and that was in the root
directory so within quotes we can go
ahead and just say simply style sty L
just like that now on the next line here
I'm going to tab over just to keep this
neat we're going to use what's called a
pipe and we're gonna say period pipe and
then inside of the parenthesis here
we're gonna use our new stylus variable
stylus just like that and simply by
saying pipe stylus here what that's
doing is it's grabbing our main style
and it's running this stylus command ok
so to do that we need to have
parenthesis like so so it's grabbing
this file it's running this piping in
this stylus function
and then we're going to pipe in a
destination so we do that the same way
by saying pipe and then now gulp dot
best because that's giving you the
destination and then inside quotes we're
gonna want to give it the current path
so we can do that simply by saying
period forward slash and we can end that
up with a semicolon so now this isn't
watching this is simply grabbing this
file and compiling it once now since we
don't have any of our packages in here
this won't work as is so I'm gonna go
ahead and select everything I'm gonna
comment it all out I'm gonna add in one
simple body background equals red okay
that way we can see if this CSS in fact
changes so let's come to our terminal
and now we're just going to type in gulp
space and then styles because that's the
name of our task it's going to say that
it started and finished our Styles task
we can come here and as you can see our
style dot CSS has been overridden and we
now have a background of red now what if
we want to have this watch our main
style sheet to see if anything's been
changed or as a matter of fact we want
to watch all of our style sheets in case
our stylist style sheets in case any of
them have been changed it's going to
rerun this gulp task and it's going to
compile our CSS so let's come over to
our gulp file here and let's write a new
task and it's just gonna be gulp task
and it's gonna be watch : Styles so it's
now gonna watch our Styles and it's
going to come a function parentheses
brackets just like that so now I decide
to here what we're gonna use is the gulp
watch method so we can say gulp watch
that's gulp period watch now watch takes
as a parameter a path to the files it's
supposed to be watching we can simply
say
asterisk asterisk forward slash asterisk
st yl and what this is saying is it's
going to look for any file from our
current directory forward with the
extension st yl and what's it going to
do once it finds us well this is now
where we have to tell it which tasks to
run now that it's noticed to change so
to do that we can simply just say comma
bracket and this is the square brackets
here and then we're going to pass in a
string of the tasks that we wanted to
use which of course was sty le s styles
and since we don't have anything to
output or anything from that this task
ends at that all this task is doing is
watching for any changes and then once
it's noticed a change runs this task
this test gets run it compiles our
stylus and it outputs it so let's go
ahead and use this watch Styles gulp
task here so we could say go watch :
styles ok as you can see it's watching
now if we go ahead and come back to our
code let's come to our stylus and let's
change this background red to a color
red instead of background red we saved
it we go over and our code has already
been compiled if we head over to our
terminal we get this nice starting our
Styles finished our Styles after because
it noticed a watch change but this is
going to keep running until you stop it
so if you want to stop it you can hit
control C and stop it for now in the
next video we're going to show you how
you do get our packages in the mix by
showing you how to use your packages
within this gulp command and you can
have a really nice build process started
so as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video hit

tuts we love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
