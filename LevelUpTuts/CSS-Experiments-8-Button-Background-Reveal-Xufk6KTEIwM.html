today I'm going to show you how to do
the effect that we have on the level up
website where you hover over a pager on
one of the videos that says you know
click here to view the next video and
there's a sliding up but instead of just
changing the background color or
something like that it's actually
masking and wiping the text as well and
changing the text color so it's a pretty
cool effect if you want to see that
effect head over to a video page on the
level up site so let's get going so the
effecting question that we're going to
be showing you is if you'll notice we
have these pager buttons and when you
hover over them they change color but
it's not just that they're changing
color and it's sliding up but that the
text is being revealed to be a new color
it's not fading in it's actually like a
wipe up to a new color sort of masking
the text now I'm going to show you
exactly how to pull this off so to get
started we're actually be starting with
the same base that we had as for the
last video as you can see here we have
the revealed content we have the reveal
top reveal wrapper all of this stuff is
going to be the same now the difference
here is we're going to take this hello
and we're going to push this directly
into the reveal top as well so we now
have two items here reveal top hello and
the reveal content hello now once again
I'm going to remove this background
color from the body and we're going to
replace this with a light gray which is
just CC C and I'm going to give reveal
top this background of purple so we can
say reveal top and now this has a
background of this purple and if you're
following along and have an eagle eye
you will notice that in the last video
and in this one I had an extra a in this
word reveal so if you notice that
awesome ah yeah sometimes that happens
just a little spelling mistake here and
there so just ignore that I've gone
ahead and removed from this example
every instance where that a just popped
up here re a ve ail so keep in mind that
that spelling error did exist a second
ago and has now been resolved
old so let's go ahead and open this up
and you'll see that I have added the
background purple to this reveal top now
likewise before we give this a position
of absolute we said position absolute
and we gave our rapper a position
relative which we're also going to do
again and we're going to give this a top
of zero and a left of zero and a width
of 100% and a height of 100% now we're
also going to add in the padding 100
pixels in here because we want this to
be an exact replica of the layer that's
on top of it now you can see there's
some weirdness going on that's because
it's adding the padding to the width
what we're going to be doing is taking
care of that with a border box fix so we
can say asterisk an asterisk just means
everything we're going to do box sizing
border box now if you don't know about
box sizing border box I recommend doing
a quick google search we have a video
and level up that's about it basically
it fixes the box model so that when you
have a hundred pixels padding it doesn't
add it to the width it just makes it
part of the width so now we have this
reveal top it's sitting on top of our
reveal content and it's an exacta mirror
just a different color so the downside
of this technique is it does require
this duplicated HTML however the effect
is really cool and if you're just using
it on a button here there it's not
really going to be too much of a problem
in your code I mean if you're
duplicating lots of code that's
certainly a problem but for this little
example I don't think it's a problem now
we want to do now is add an
overflow:hidden to reveal top not a
reveal wrapper but our reveal top but
not because of that overflow:hidden we
can modify the height and actually see
something really interesting
so if we say 50% height here you
actually notice there's a little bit of
a problem it didn't go
50% and that's still because of this
padding now box-sizing border-box fixes
some things but it doesn't fix that and
modify how we're going to be displaying
this hello in the middle the box now
padding in your actual wrapping divs
here this reveal top and reveal content
will mess up this effect so let's go
ahead and effectively get rid of that
padding itself and let's use positioning
on the h1 itself to place it at 100
pixels padding so we can say neh ones
that exist within reveal wrapper are
going to beginning 100 pixels of padding
and simply by removing that heading
you'll notice that we left our our
height at 50% here we're now getting
this really interesting effect where we
have this hello text but the top half is
showing from our reveal top the bottom
half is showing from our reveal content
but it's perfectly in line and it's
being essentially masked so this is how
this effect is achieved if we do
something like 60% you can see it's down
here so let's make this height by
default 90% and now when we hover over
the page wrapper we're going to have the
revealed tops height be modified and
we're going to put a transition so let's
put a transition on the height and we're
going to do this transition again at 0.6
seconds and we're going to ease and now
we're going to put a hover State on
reveal wrapper so we're going to say
reveal wrapper hover and of course we're
going to be targeting reveal top here
like that and we're going to be
affecting the height so we can say
height we want this to be 0% okay so
here we have this div we hover over it
and our text is revealed so this gives
the same effect that the button on the
levelup's site has were revealing the
text instead of simply transforming it
by fading the color or something like
that and if we were to take this h1 and
make this pixel value for the padding a
little less substantial you can see it
actually look a little bit more like
that button here right let's come here
we hover over it and it works just like
that now if you were thinking well this
is a bunch of divs this isn't a button
the great thing about html5 is that
now rapping block content like divs
in an anchor tag is now valid HTML so we
can say a draft link it to wherever we
want and put an anchor around this whole
reveal wrapper obviously I want to
change the font color here but as you
can see and a text underlined but as you
can see the effects still working and
now it's going to function as a link
this entire block of content okay so I'm
just going to remove that and here is
our finished product so as always this
is Scott with level up tuts if you have
any questions or comments leave become
in the video here to set up a Twitter
Facebook ad level up Tubbs we love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
