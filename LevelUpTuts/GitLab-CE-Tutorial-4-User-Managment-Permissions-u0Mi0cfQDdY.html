up tutorials and in this video and be
showing you user permissions and role
management in gitlab so let's get
started with that right now okay so what
I'm gonna do is actually open up a new
lab level up Tut's calm and an incognito
window so I won't be logged in and
you'll be able to see we will be greeted
with this sort of login asking if we're
an existing user and allow you to create
an account now the problem with this is
is that I want this to be private so I
don't want people to create an account I
want to create an account for them so if
we were to actually head to admin area
and then let's go ahead and head to
users let's come to the admin area then
we can scroll this down until we get to
settings as you can see we have some
settings here if we scroll down we can
see that we can have sign up or sign in
enabled right if you are the only person
using this you could disable these sign
in and nobody else can use it
however let's just go ahead and disable
this sign up and we can scroll down
scroll down all the way down and let's
click Save now when I head it to my
incognito window and I refresh here you
can see we just have a sign in window so
now only people that already have
accounts can actually use this well
that's great but we actually want to
have somebody with another account so as
an administrator I'm gonna come in here
and let's head to users I can click new
user and let's give them a name we can
just have this be Courtney let's say I
wanted to give Courtney access and this
can be her username can be see note
right and I can just say Courtney at
level up tuts
she doesn't actually have a level up
that's email address so don't email her
here it won't get anywhere and as you
could see when we created an account
it's going to send them a generated
password link that they can login with
and now we can say what sort of access
they have well maybe you can give them a
limit
for projects right they can only create
a certain amount of projects or they can
be an admin or they can create their own
group I'm gonna uncheck all of these and
the one I want is actually external and
then what I want here is I want her to
have only access to the private repos
and projects when I want to now in the
future I'm gonna be creating a group and
giving that group access to this but for
right now we're gonna leave this checked
as external so that she doesn't really
have any sort of capabilities offhand we
can click create user and what's cool
about this is we now have this users
page we could see if they have SSH keys
identities groups accounts all sorts of
stuff here we can block them we can
delete them but basically this is a
user's account and let's say I wanted to
see exactly what courtney has access to
what I can do here is I could click
impersonate and now I'm accessing gitlab
as her and you can see I don't have
access to any projects I don't have any
projects if I see I can only see - duze
activity groups in projects itself I
can't create any projects because I
don't I don't have the capabilities to
create any sort of projects so let's say
this is a user that you just want to
have access to give access to your code
and maybe they can download or see you
repos or something like that
let's go ahead and actually modify our
project in the new tab and I'm actually
gonna stop impersonating for a minute
now make sure that you're in the admin
area if you're not - go ahead and click
admin area here what we want to do is
head to projects then select
administrator tests and you can see we
have project members over here where we
can now give access and we can say let's
give access to Courtney and let's add
her to this project so she now has
access to this project as a guest and
you might be wondering what is a guest
well we can read more about these rules
right here a guest can create issues
leave comments see build see build log
and download and browse artifacts
however they can't do
like pull the project code download the
project or create code snippets now to
do that you'd want them to be a
developer now this is just a really nice
interface you can see exactly we have
guest reporter duck developer master and
owner and pretty much the only thing
that a developer can't do is do things
that are going to essentially break the
project here we can't have them add new
team members so you can't add somebody
who's gonna be an admin and destroy it
they can't push two protected branches
basically a whole bunch of stuff here we
can't add deploy keys
they can't configure hooks or runners or
switch visibility levels but basically
they can create a wiki add tags create
issues manage merge requests pull
requests whatever C commit messages and
push and pull from the code so most
people are probably end up being
developers unless they're owning a
project or you want to give them full
master owner rice so let's actually
click head back here and I'm going to
click Courtney here and click the edit
button and I can make her a developer
and click Save
now let's head back to the
administrative area so we can click
admin area up here we can click users
let's click Courtney here and let's
impersonate her now I'm impersonating
her this is what she sees she sees
administrator test I can click on this I
have access to the get path here I can
see the readme I can see the commits
notice how I'm still impersonating her
and this is definitely one of those
things where before she didn't have
access to any of this stuff and now she
has access to this code and she'll need
to add an SSH key if she wants to be
able to pull from here but as you can
see we have branches commits whatever as
a developer on this they have access to
all of this now let's say we didn't want
this person to be a developer let's go
ahead and click stop impersonation we
want them to actually not be an external
developer right we want them to actually
be somebody who can manage their own
projects or create
own projects on this site we can come in
click Edit up top here and we can scroll
down and let's go ahead and uncheck all
of these but let's give her let's say
ten projects so she's no longer she
can't create a group she's not an admin
but she's also not external so we can go
ahead and click Save and now let's
impersonate here to sort of see what's
going on here now instead of just having
one project that we've been assigned to
you can actually create new projects
ourselves we can give them a new path
and you'll notice it stores them at /c
note her your username you can import a
project from any of these other places
such as github at a description we could
make it private public internal so this
can be seen by Annie logged in user or
any public person it's going to just
create this public pet and this could be
see notes test project I'm public okay
so this this one is entirely public we
click create project and now check this
out the lab dot level up tests that calm
for it's a scene out forward slash test
project in an incognito window without
being logged in is totally visible and
because they're public anybody could
come and pull this you could see issues
just like github so if you want to have
your own open source projects here or
even have several team members sharing
open source projects or maybe just a
group of people to have open source
projects and not have it be on something
like github or your bitbucket
you can create that here and and share
these paths just like this so that's
that's pretty sweet I mean if there's
one thing that get lab is it's
definitely full-featured and fully
capable of doing really anything you
need it to so here we have a public repo
created by a user that I created because
I'm not allowing sign up so anybody has
a sign up can't create one so let's tab
back and let's go ahead and click this
stop impersonation at the top and as you
can see creating users impersonating
them and sort of checking out their
permissions is a great way to see exact
what people have access to and what they
can do as a user on your get lab you
don't want somebody who you don't trust
to have access to be able to delete your
projects and all sorts of crazy stuff or
else you could be in big trouble so here
we have the admin area we have a new
user who has had both limited and a
little bit more open permissions now you
can always make trusted people admins
let's check out what happens when you
make somebody an admin and click Edit
and I'm gonna select admin here and I'll
click Save Changes and now this is
site-wide Courtney is now an admin so
when I click impersonate you'll now
notice that in addition to seeing her
repos she can also see the admin area in
the admin area she can come in and she
can create a new user if she wants
basically anything that you can do as an
admin she can do so you're gonna they
want to be very careful about who you
give admin rights to because those
people are going to have full control
over your gitlab but as you can see by
unchecking everything there we go
Courtney has just permission she needs
to create her own repos but not only
that see private ones that she's been
added to but what happens if there's
private repos that she hasn't been added
to I am no longer impersonating her so
let's go ahead and just create a new
project really quickly and we can say
this is going to be a private and this
will just be route private tests okay
and we'll keep this all here as private
and there we go okay so this exists
under my projects let's go back to the
dashboard see all the projects you can
see that my projects are private tests
and tests okay but let's see what let's
head to admin area users select Courtney
let's see what she now has access to
we can click impersonate and you can see
she has access to administrator test and
Courtney but if we click add
administrator test or let's actually
head to the path that just /root
the user page for route she can see
stuff where we have the push to a new
branch a master administer test because
she's involved in this but what she's
not seeing is that I created a project
called private because she's not
involved in that project although she
isn't said to external she still doesn't
see that project at all cool so I hope
this was very informative you now have
access to basically set up your user
accounts however you would like them
within get lab to be either as locked
down or as open as you want them so as
always this is Scott would level up
tutorials if you want the rest of these
videos before they're released on
YouTube had to store that level up
tutorials dot-com and there you can
purchase these videos and actually get
access to some exclusive videos such as
how to add gitlab to an existing Ubuntu
machine on a digitalocean droplet that's
already been created so you're not going
to be doing this one touch install and
we're going to be going over some more
advanced features so check that out
store that level up tutorials calm or
become a pro by sending up and also at
store dot level up tutorials comm by
subscribing becoming a pro you also have
access to streaming all of the videos
before they're available on YouTube as
always thanks for watching and I'll see
you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
