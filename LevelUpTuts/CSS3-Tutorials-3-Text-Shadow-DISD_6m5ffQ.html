up Tut's and today we're going to be
talking about css3
text shadow and css3 text shadow sounds
like something that you might use a lot
I mean people use drop shadows for text
all the time on the internet and while
you know it sometimes
it's bit overused didn't sometimes you
know it doesn't necessarily need to be
there it is something that couldn't give
a page more depth and of course like we
said with border-radius if your designer
has designed the site to have a text
shadow on it why would you rely on an
image to do that just to support some
older browsers
well in fact unfortunately ie10 is going
to be the first browser for Internet
Explorer to support text shadow however
it's pretty widely supported on every
other browser
I mean Firefox is from version 3.5 and
up and chrome is from version 4 and up
safaris from foreign up operas from 9.5
and up and iOS Safari 3.2 and Android
2.1 I mean text shadow is going to be
pretty universally accepted except for
on IE and of course they're just going
to have to deal with not getting that
text shadow unless of course it is
somehow crucial to the Year design let's
say there's like white text on a white
background and you're having a drop
shadow differentiate it well you're
gonna have to think it something
different for IE users but the for most
cases you're going to be able to see it
just fine okay so let's add something
that we want to have a text shadow one
I'm going to put just nh-2 right on in
our main column I'm just going to say
it's an h2 and just go say welcome okay
- great okay and I'm gonna have this
class of
hello it's going to be the hello text on
our page and I'm going to give this
class of hello well I'm going to give it
a color 333 and I'm going to give it a
text shadow which you may have guessed
the property is actually just text
shadow text - shadow subtext - shadow
okay and you'll notice a text shadow
accepts three or four different values
okay it's first the x-coordinate the
distance on the x value if you're
familiar with Photoshop it would be the
distance slider and the angle would be
determined by the angle thing well
either way this is just position on the
x value and then the second value is
position on the Y value so let's say
we'll have a shadow that goes one pixel
to the right one pixel down and then the
third value is the blur radius to keep
this so you can see what's going on um
at first I'm gonna have this just be at
zero in fact let's bump this a little
bit up so you can see this a little bit
better I'm gonna have three pixels three
pixels zero for the blue radius and then
I'm gonna pick a black okay the fourth
value is the color so let's see what
this looks like when we're on our page
okay let's refresh this okay and if you
notice we have this black and this is
hideous actually let's change the fun
and bump up the font size thought it's
going to be concise so you forty pixels
and our font family will just do
sans-serif okay
all right awesome you see this welcome
right here let's bump it up to 80 pixels
you can see it even bigger okay
beautiful so now you'll see that there
is this black shadow it's not blurred at
all so it's not really shadowy but it's
you know where it's a flat shadow and
it's totally black cool well let's let's
mess this up a little bit more let's do
one pixel one pixel and let's have this
blur radius be five pixels we can
refresh this and now you can see it's
softer it's a blur drop shadow might be
something like you're more like seeing
and keep in mind with css3
will be going over something like RG RG
ba so you can get transparency in your
colors so if this black is a little
strong we'll be able to make this black
a little bit transparent
but for this case since the background
is 333 anyways if we bump this down to
one one one it's going to appear to be
softer on that background color okay and
of course you can always get crazy with
it and there's all sorts of you know
people who have dedicated to just seeing
what they can do with these css3
properties so Google around about some
interesting text shadow effects and see
what you can do well another interesting
point about text shadows that you can
make comma separate and have a second
shadow so let's have another shadow and
we're going to make this one totally
heinous and it's going to be to five
pixels five pixels we're going to blur
it out ten pixels and this color will be
yellow okay so this isn't going to be
great look at this thing okay so tidiest
don't do this but you can chain your
shadows if you'll notice this yellow one
is rendered underneath the black one if
we were to change the color change the
order of that for that matter it would
happen the other way around
see now the yellow shadow is the
prominent and the black is underneath it
and you can keep chaining and as many
text shadows as you'd like and it can
get really interesting I would recommend
googling around and seeing what effects
people have done and I would you know
keep it tasteful it's going to look good
so this is tech shadow and css3 if you
have any questions please let us know
hit us up at Twitter or level up Tut's
let us know what you're thinking
and in-between this lesson of the next
I'm going to fix this up because it's
looking it's looking terrible okay so as
always thanks for watching
this is Skyway level Tut's bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
