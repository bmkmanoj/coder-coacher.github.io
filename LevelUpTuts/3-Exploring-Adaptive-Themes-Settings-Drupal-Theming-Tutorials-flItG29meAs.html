up tutorials in this video we're going
to explore adaptive themes settings and
configuration options now this isn't
going to be the definitive how to use
layouts or how to use all of these
features but it's going to cover a
little bit about what adaptive theme
just has to offer out of the box so
check it out let's get going right now
so in the last video we showed you a
little bit of the code with adaptive
theme we created our sub theme and we
got going so now what we want to do is
talk a little bit about what comes with
adaptive theme in the settings here so
if we climb to settings so as you can
see we have some layout options now we
are first able to choose the sidebar
position now I didn't actually have my
sub theme layout working at first I had
to come in here and click save
configuration after that when I
refreshed it actually started clicking
in so if if your layout doesn't show up
maybe click save on appearance here and
it's going to start using these layouts
so as you can see with no configuration
here let's I'm going to open up inspect
this element just to be able to change
the width here so as you can see we now
have this main theme that is actually
already responsive out-of-the-box and
you get some cinema fun-sized text
changes you go from two columns to one
column and in addition we have some
options here whether we want a left and
right sidebar or we want to left side
bars or sidebars on the right now we can
go ahead and select side bars on the
Left we can refresh and you're not gonna
see a whole lots changed because the
sidebar on the left already existed
however if we were to inspect this main
content area right here you'd see that
it's taking up a considerable amount
more space now if we come to appearance
you'll see that there's some percentages
here we have the first sidebar is 25%
the second sidebar is 25% and the main
the rest of the page is going to be
taking up just the remainder now the
page width is going to be set to 1
percent so it's going to be fluid change
rather than a pixel-based changed if you
wanted this to only be a pixel-based
change you would have to change this
unit do pixels or M's and then you can
set a max width now max width of 1140 is
kind of old-fashioned I'm gonna do 1440
just to give it a little bit more space
on the larger monitors no need click
Save let's come back to our theme and as
you can see refreshing that's already
giving it that more space here so
without having to dive into the code
we're already managing to change our
layout a bit now this video isn't going
to be the definitive guide to these
layouts we're gonna cover these
considerably more but just know in the
settings here you can change the
standard layout the tablet layout and
you'll notice down here it says that
this layout is triggered by the media
query 581 between and 768 so as long as
your browser device width is between 581
and 768 it will be getting the tablet
layout and nowadays this is going to
encompass a lot of phones as well so
it's not necessarily a tablet it's you
know all sorts of devices in that pixel
range so keep that in mind because
phones are a lot larger than the old
iPhone was which of course was 32 so we
now have a small touch phone which is
smaller phones and allows you to set the
layouts for those as well and whether
you want your sidebar stacking or left
and right in addition we have some
panels and G panels information here
we're not going to be using panels or G
panels with this so we're not going to
worry about that just yet however if the
demand is there I might dive into that
stuff too now under global settings you
can change whether you want this to be
mobile or desktop first now I would
recommend not checking this mobile first
is the way to go so by all means you can
check it if you absolutely would like to
I would prefer to develop mobile first
and then you could disable the
responsive layout as well and something
I'm also not
going to recommend because of course
Google is now even penalizing sites that
don't look good on mobile so if you
haven't been developing responsive
websites by now which is hard to believe
you should be developing responsive
websites that's all there is to it okay
next we have file management allows you
to have the location of your public
files so as you can see generated files
are going to be contained with an
adaptive theme level up files and then
you are allowed to combine aggregate
files so we can click combine CSS and
combine j/s files now you might say to
do this however there's some good
modules for Drupal for aggregating and
combining your J's files already or
personally I might not have the site do
it in another video or two I'm gonna
show you how to get going with something
like gulp certainly using some sort of
other additional build process the one
of which I'm going to show you is going
to be gulp and don't worry about that I
will provide a default file that you can
use as a drop-in replacement for
adaptive themes sass features so let's
go ahead and click CSS which again just
gives you some information about the CSS
aggregation which just gives you some
more information about this as CSS
aggregation it allows you to enable
assume custom media queries as well that
way you can have some overlap to media
queries if you'd like I mean personally
when I'm developing a site it's gonna be
more heavily in the CSS than it is going
to be clicking through these settings
menus however for site administrators
these tools are really nice now
polyfills html5 support with the html5
Shiv is definitely going to need to be
checked like it says turning this off as
bad news for a high 6 through 8 if you
don't need to support 6 through 8 and go
right ahead and I serve all the things
you can fix some rounding errors in 6 &amp;amp;
7 nobody's using ie6 or 7 if anything
you should probably just have to support
8 so I wouldn't check this media is a
media query support for 6 &amp;amp; 6 through 8
with respond jeaious I would probably
check this if you need to support ie8
but only if you absolutely need to
and then responsive JavaScript you can
notice that it is decorated deprecated
we saw the script in there at media
queries Jas it allows you to just use
some media queries in your JavaScript
themselves and the scale fix for iOS and
there's a bug here we could always check
that if we need it for now I'm going to
leave it unchecked now meta tags allows
you to have the view port device
initial-scale 1.0 which is what you're
gonna want so that your mobile devices
actually display the responsive site
correctly other than that I would
probably just leave this as is now
debuggers we can have highlighting
regions we can show window size and we
can run the sub theme compatibility test
you can also load your panels let's go
ahead and click Save configuration and
sort of see what this does now when we
refresh you can see that all of your
regions although they're labeled with
these sort of obnoxious boxes in front
of them I wish that was as easy as a
toggle on your interface here sort of
like Omega
however it's not we just have these
annoying region boxes on top of our
content better than that it shows you
exactly where all of your regions are so
you can visually tell and it makes it
nice for really understanding what's
going on with this layout here and we
get a constant output of the browser
windows dimensions here next we have
extensions and the additional extensions
that come here as something that we're
going to go over in a future video now
down here we just have our toggle
display settings which is something that
you've seen in almost every single theme
where we can uncheck logo and it will
get rid of our logo uncheck sites Logan
I'll get rid of that user pictures and
comments verification stuff like that
and logo image settings where you can
click use default logo and this used
default local we can actually uncheck
this and upload our own logo if we'd
like or we can just keep this checked
and then replace that file with our logo
file itself and shortcut icons likewise
we can do the same thing or give it
paths to new files okay I'm gonna come
back to these debuggers I'm gonna untag
Alize like so I'm gonna save our
configuration
and there we have it we have our
adaptive theme it's responsive it's
ready to go and we're gonna get started
actually theming this thing very soon so
in the next video I'm gonna cover a
little bit about the sass setup so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave it come in the video or
hits up a Twitter Facebook at level of
tuts we'd love to hear from you thanks
for watching and we'll see in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
