Tut's bringing you your first Adobe
After Effects tutorial in this series
this this first after effects series is
going to be after-effects basics and
while it's just the basics by the time
you're done with these you'll be able to
know how to you know start a project get
some animation going whether it's on
some shape layers or some photoshop
imported content I'm going to show you
how to link up to adobe premiere in case
you want to edit there and I'll show you
to export directly from after of X so
after that after this series is complete
we'll be getting into a couple more
advanced topics and there'll be a couple
more advanced series on all sorts of
stuff from compositing to motion
tracking to advanced effects and all
sorts of cool stuff so so the first one
is going to kick off and I'm just going
to show you the absolute basics of
starting after effects here by the way
I'm reusing version cs5 if you're not
using cs5 that's a okay I found that you
know c is for cs3 in interface wise
there's not too much changing so I me
shouldn't get lost and I'm probably not
going to be getting into any crazy
features or anything super new in these
introductory videos so after you load up
after effects this is the the welcome
screen this is sort of familiar if
you're using any Adobe product and you
know you could uncheck it here if you
don't want to see it doesn't really
matter just depends on you know personal
preference so when you start here the
first thing you want to do is create a
new composition and a composition is
sort of like sort of like a contained a
timeline and you can group smaller items
into smaller nested compositions we're
going to get onto that later but right
now all you need to know is that a
composition is
basically your timeline and so we're
going to leave this preset at HD 1080
you know square pixels spine this is
basically saying that your first your
main composition whatever you name it
believe it is comp 14 now is going to be
30 seconds long so let's say we wanted
to be a minute just because 30 seconds
isn't really that long and then based on
sort of what you're you know what your
source footage is let's say you're
compositing this on something and it's a
light background so most your things are
black you're going to you'd be wanting
to have this as a light background since
we don't have any real plan right now
for what we're doing we'll just leave it
at black because it you know doesn't too
much matter at this point okay so click
ok and what that does is it opens up
your composition if you'll notice it's
created a composition in your project
window here you can you know you can tag
it you can give it colors and that will
sort of change how it looks some key
information over here its duration you
can give it a comment if you want to
leave that kind of stuff if you want to
rename this you can you know click on it
or rename also if you'll notice down
here this tab open comp 1 this button
right above it is create a new
composition so let's say we create a new
composition that's basically the exact
same just come to now you notice that
there's comp on and come to these are
tab just like a your web browser or
something and every time you open up
anything it just throws it down here if
you don't want to see it you'll click to
get rid of it you can always double
click to get it back so this is where
your composition window this and it's
almost like in Premiere where there's
your timeline this is when you have
footage or you have things that you're
animating it's all going to be happening
down here this is your your you know
your basic viewer right now it's up to
twenty-five percent you can you know fit
you can fit up to a hundred percent
you can select or you can use your mouse
your mouse scroll wheel if you have one
of those to zoom in and out some other
important things that's right now this
is set to auto for your playback
resolution so this wouldn't be your
projects resolution but because after
effects is doing a lot of work you don't
always want it to be it at full quality
our salute computer is going to have a
heart attack so I mean I set this to
quarter or depends on what kind of
clarity you need for what you're doing
right now it's at auto doesn't really
much matter for this let's see basically
this is your info over here it's going
to give you you know some rgba values
it's going to give you the position of
your cursor not too not too much
anything crazy there this is your
preview controls you know your standard
play pause all this stuff you can
advance by frame last frame you can
control these by hitting space bar their
price play pause space bar you can set
to loop this is like a ram preview
basically you're storing the rendered
video in RAM so that you can play back
and see things at full speed like I said
before and after effects it's typically
doing a lot of processing at once so
your computer can't really always just
play things back at full speed without
saving a ram preview or something like
that first in this kind of case you you
know you have to specify in your
preferences how long these r &amp;amp; previews
would be whether it's like 10-15 seconds
based on what your computer can handle
in the standard workspace you have your
effects and presets over here I should
like to throw those over here just a
personal preference it's a little bit
larger a viewing area other than that
there's not too much going on here up
top is your workspace you can select
which workspace you're in all panels
asian effects and so on I typically
leave it in standard and then you know
it depends on if you want a little more
in the view space let's say fit set it
to fit and then you don't have that many
layers but you want to get a nice big
picture you can make that nice and big
you can grab any of these and move them
around like I did over here we just by
grabbing this tab and the purple and the
center means that you're adding it to
that one this means you'd be putting it
on top if you see it's now taking this
spot so you have a workspace that you've
made up and it's perfect and it's you
know what you want you can do new
workspace and what that does is it saves
your workspace allows you to name it and
then you can have it be set as a preset
like any of these already up here so
that way you know if you have things
custom just the way you like it you can
always jump back to that alright so this
is a the very first After Effects
tutorial and I hope you are up and
running and if you have any questions or
you weren't able to get to this point
for some reason you know just send us an
email you know right in with a comment
or something and just let us know what
you're thinking if there's anything you
want to learn in the future let us know
we'll be happy to help once again this
