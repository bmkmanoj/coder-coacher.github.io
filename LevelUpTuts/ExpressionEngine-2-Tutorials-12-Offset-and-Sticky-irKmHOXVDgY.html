level up tuts in this video we are going
to expand our knowledge that the account
the expression gin channels entry tags
and what we're going to do hop over to
the home page and I've turned off that
debugging that we saw in previous video
and again that was just done through the
admin menu under system system
administration so I've turned that off
and now what I want to do is I'm
actually going to revisit this list and
what I've decided is what I want to do
first is I want to have an output I want
to output one story and then I want to
help with the body under that and then
under the next two stories I want to
output just the titles and so that's
sort of what I'm doing here but I'm
gonna do it a little bit differently i'm
going to do that using the limit and
then the offset parameter so what I'll
do is to keep this the way that it is
i'm going to go ahead and change this to
say featured hand open and copy that
down to this one
and like I said the first I'm going to
do is I want to limit the first result
to one and then the second one I'm
actually not going to limit but let's
just see what happens when I do this
we're going to see this story and then
we see this story again and that's not
right so what we're going to do now is
use the offset parameter and I just say
offset equals and then the number that i
want to offset it by right so i want to
offset it by one because this is the
first one hit update go ahead and
refresh this and now here we go we have
story number three and then these other
two but I said again I said you know I
wanted help with a body and this one so
just go ahead and you know maybe this
one going to receive some special
attention and then i'll put on the body
right here
so there we go so now we have we're
outputting the first one and then
offsetting and then skipping the story
again and then repeating the other two
so that is one way to our another
parameter that was it introduce you the
offset parameter and again it works in
tandem with the limit so we could say
you know why do a limit of two and then
offset this by to hit update refresh
that and now we're going to see same or
a story three with the body story to
with the body and then the last one just
off by itself another thing that i want
to show you in this video is just
another parameter and this one is called
is sticky and by default it's set to yes
and basically all that that sticky does
is if a entry is set to sticky then it
will go to the top of a channel entry
output so I'm go ahead and get rid of
the second list now we don't eat it and
so by default it's going to honor
stickies and actually we don't have any
entries set to be a sticky so I'm going
to go ahead and say that this first
story is a sticky so I'm going to go
into this story entry news and sample a
new story also going to add a number one
to this and then under the options menu
we have an option here to make this
entry sticky we checked that hit submit
and what happens is when we refresh that
story is now to the top and
and it doesn't matter we're not we're
actually still using the default here so
just ignore that for a second so it
actually doesn't matter which way we're
sorting we say we want to sort ascending
refresh it doesn't matter you notice
that below the story simple story three
and two swapped maybe didn't see that
but they did it cares about those but
because this item is set to sticky it
stays on the top now what the sticky
parameter does is say you want it to
just on this particular loop you don't
care you want it to ignore that so what
you can do is you can set it to know we
hit update and refresh and now it's
listening it in one two three order so
let me change this again the sort just
so you can see a change because I think
it actually helped put it in the same
order it's kind of a fluke but here we
go so now we're saying three two one and
it's totally ignoring the sticky so
again if I take this off now it's going
to honor the sticky any better refresh
here's number one here's three here's
two okay great well so in this tutorial
we covered the how to use limit with
offset parameter and also the sticky
parameter thanks for watching and please
