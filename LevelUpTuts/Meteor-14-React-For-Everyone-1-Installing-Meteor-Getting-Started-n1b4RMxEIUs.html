of tutorials and in this first video I'm
gonna show you how we can get started
we're going to install meteor and create
our project let's get going now
so in this series we're basically going
to take a look at the basics of react
within meteor now in the meteor for
everyone series before it was sort of
encompassing what was covered in the
meteor and react forever wind series as
well as the intermediate meteor series
so I covered routing and stuff like that
this is going to be a little bit
different I'm going to break it up into
two separate series this time so we're
going to have sort of the basic meteor
and react for every one which we'll be
doing in this video series and we're
going to have the intermediate which is
going to follow the intermediate meteor
series more closely rather than sort of
trying to do it all in one so to get
started here we first need to install
meteor on our computer if you have not
done that what you need to do is come
and head to meteor comm and click the
Install Now button this is going to take
you to an installation instructions page
the most of the current version of that
filming this video is 1.4 we're going to
be covering that all the new stuff that
came within one point three and one
point four and we're going to be talking
about the meteor developer group
recommended approach of using react
within meteor so we're going to be doing
containers and we're going to be
grabbing the data directly from meteor
inside of a container itself this is
going to be different from the approach
that we used in the meteor and react for
everyone series previously where we use
tracker react now the reason is is these
packages like tracker react they get
created they're great they make things
nice and easy I still use it on projects
however if it doesn't get updated
doesn't get maintained it just sort of
sits there and there are issues out for
tracker react things that need to be
fixed and you don't know if those things
are ever going to get fixed so in this
process we want to take the recommended
approach that minier developer group has
laid out for us
so let's go ahead and install meteor we
want to do so with the
with sex Linux if you're on OSX you can
just do so by simply copying this curl
command or on Windows you can click
download the Installer and install it
via that now for my command line I'm
going to be using I term - this is
actually a beta version which is why
mine looks like this and the colors in
this sort of shell interaction I'm using
is called fish shell I have a video in
the level up tips
playlist that shows you how to install
and setup fish shell this shell
offers a ton of awesome auto completion
and theming features over all along with
plugins that you just don't get with
bash now you could get these things a
little bit better with zsh which is
another shell that i've used before but
fish is a really nice modern shell so if
you like the way this looks and
functions check out those videos so I'm
going to clear the screen here and what
we want to do copy this curl command
paste it in here and as you can see it's
going to install meteor now this is it's
removing my existing installation if you
already have meteor installed obviously
you don't need to do this it's not going
to hurt anything by reinstalling meteor
here but as you can see it's just
downloading and reinstalling meteor if
you don't have it installed it will
install it for the very first time so
let's just wait for this to download and
install and let's get started with
creating our application okay it's going
to ask for your password omit my
password enter and now you can see here
that it gives you some get started
instructions now meteor doesn't offer a
way right now to start a react meteor
project out of the box and that's a-ok
because I mean we don't really need to
keep it in the stuff that you get other
than the meteor file when you create a
project I'm going to change directory
into my sites folder where I keep all of
my sites and I'm going to go ahead and
create a new application now we're going
to be making a voting application I
figured that would be relevant to the
current situation that we're in where we
have a an election in the United States
coming up here I know you're sick of
election stuff but about general voting
seems like a pretty cool idea we already
made this app in the meteor for everyone
1.4 series so I figured it would be nice
to keep things cohesive there so let's
go ahead and inside of the directory
where you keep your websites it doesn't
matter where we can go ahead and type
meteor create and I'm going to call this
voting app and then I'm just going to
say react I'm using camelcase here where
you'll notice the first letter is under
case where I have uppercase in an
uppercase for each word after that you
can do that if you'd like you don't have
to and I'm going to hit enter
okay as you can see it's created our
folder so let's see D and then voting
app react to make sure that we're in the
project now from the root of our project
we can just type meteor it's that simple
and we can hit enter
as you can see it started up our MongoDB
we didn't have to install anything like
that we didn't have to install anything
really other than meteor and that's one
of the strengths of meteor even though
uses these other technologies like
MongoDB and node and stuff like that all
we have to do is have meteor installed
and it's sort of self-contained so
because we installed meteor and we ran
the meteor command it served up
everything for us and got us an app up
and running at localhost port 3000 we
head to our localhost colon 3000 you can
see a welcome to meteor I'm gonna
enlarge this here and as you can see and
click this button and then you can see
it's been pressed as many times okay so
in the next video what we're going to do
is talk a little bit about meteor
overall I'm going to show you the files
the platform that it comes with we're
going to delete a whole bunch of stuff
and we're just going to talk about what
meteor gives you out of the box so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you would like to watch
