of tutorials and in this video we're
going to be making our contacts list
even more modular by creating a contact
listing element in this contact listing
element is going to be an individual
list item now what that means is that
we'll be able to use that list item on
its own separately just by simply
passing in the parameter values that we
need or we can use it within the contact
list itself so let's get going on that
right now so what we want to do now is
create another new element I'm going to
go ahead and select the root of our
project because our current contacts
list item is actually saved in the root
of our project we'll want to change that
eventually but now it it's totally fine
and so we can make a new file and she's
going to be contact HTML okay and inside
of contact we can actually pay some
stuff from contacts list I like to just
sort of you know save time wherever I
can by you know using things as a
boilerplate so polymer is contact and
then close that off like so okay and now
let's come in here to our template I'm
gonna get rid of all of this stuff we
can always paste it back in here but I'm
just gonna leave this blank and we can
just say hello for now I'm also going to
get rid of the Styles in here and I'm
going to have the ID just be contact
okay and we're still gonna be importing
polymer HTML just like so and actually
we need this to not say contact it needs
to be hyphenated so we could do
something like contact listing okay
let's go ahead and just have this be the
element name instead of just contact
like so and I'm actually going to modify
this contact HTML to say contact listing
data HTML okay so we have contact
listing HTML and contact list now if you
remember going back to this google map
element we were able to use another
element with inside of this simply by
importing it the same way that we
did in our index.html and so you can see
here it's just importing this Google map
marker which is in itself is its own
element along with some of these
resizable behaviors Google API sort of
stuff here so to use our contact listing
element inside of our contact list we
simply just have to take this import
statement that we have here we can copy
it and paste it below the import polymer
and we can change this text to say
contact - listing dot HTML so now that
we're importing contact - listing we can
now come here and we can use contact
listing inside of our template so we can
say contact listing and close it off
like so and let's come back here we can
refresh and we're not seeing anything
but if we come to inspect this element
scroll down here you can see that we do
have our contact listing here in fact
let's go ahead and come in here and
throw a div inside of this template and
we'll just have this be hello like so
now when we refresh we see that we do
have this hello here so we're now ready
to start sort of moving some of this
stuff into our contact listing item here
so one thing we can certainly move in is
a lot of the CSS so we had the anything
that's sort of having to do with an
individual listing we have here like so
and we can go ahead and just pull this
out of here so the only thing we're
really keeping is this list-style:none
now let's go ahead and contact listing
I'm gonna paste these Styles in here and
I'm actually gonna give this a class of
listing wrapper no listing wrapper is
going to get some of this stuff that
these list items had here before so we
can change any of these that have an Li
- listing wrapper
and I'm still gonna hold out on this
border top one that might be heading
back to the parent element and now let's
come to our contact list and let's grab
some of this stuff in here I'm actually
gonna pull out everything except for the
list item itself and I'm going to put it
in where we have our hello like so and
I'm like I said with this list item l1
l1 I kind of want to keep this in the
list itself because this is really
having the border right and you don't
necessarily want to top and bottom
border on something if you only have one
of them so if we want to use one of
these contact listings by itself we
don't want this border top on it so we
can just leave that in here and say if
you know if there's a listing and
there's multiple ones at a border top so
as you can see here we can sort of pick
and choose the styling of a list first
an individual listing okay so now we're
repeating and we have this contact
listing we have all of our data we
really have everything except for the
data is sort of here and here now we can
approach us at a couple of ways now we
could pass in the entirety of the data
or we could pass in the items
individually what we can really do is
come in here and essentially throw in
this contact listing like so and let's
go ahead and add some properties if we
remember in our hello world
we added property simply by coming in
here and under the is polymer object
here we we had a property so we can
simply say properties
I guess spell that correctly okay and
this is going to be an object and we're
going to have name which is a string
we're gonna have email which is a string
and we're going to have image which is
also a string like so now we can
actually use instead of item dot we
use name image and email like so so now
this is going to be referencing these
properties when it looks here so it's
going to hit this template it's going to
say give me the source it's going to be
looking to the property that gets passed
into this individual contact listing now
let's go ahead and make sure we add
those properties to the contact listing
element we can do so simply by saying
name is equal to and then we're going to
pass in if remember it was item dot name
so now that we've gotten this far let's
make sure this is all working as
expected so if we come to our page and
refresh you can see that we're having
all these listings Scout timba and Bobby
it's hitting that contact listing
element and it's passing the value scott
into the name and then that contact
listing is then saying hey i have a name
let me out put it right here because
it's not gonna be other things it
they're not showing up but since we know
that that's at least working let's go
ahead and we can paste this in here as
name I'm actually gonna space these out
on their own lines to make this a little
bit more readable here let's do one more
okay and so we had email was equal to
item that email and image is equal to
item dot image now if we save this
refresh our page you can see that all of
our glorious data is now showing up once
again and we have this even more modular
than we ever had it before now the
benefit to something like this is now if
we want to go ahead and use a single one
of these contact listings somewhere else
let's say maybe you're on a different
page and it's Tim's page right and you
would select this that way you could use
his contact data over and over again and
it's going to maintain that HTML
structure and style that we had embedded
into
contact listing so we've now broken this
out into a couple of custom elements and
it's pretty sweet here every single time
we add more to the data it's going to be
referencing a whole listing of other
elements we can come in here in our
inspect and see unordered list full of
list items filled with contact listing
which is all of our data so this is
absolutely perfect this is just what we
want and it's a nice foundation for
going forward for making something a
little bit more dynamic so in the next
few videos we're gonna take this in a
way that shows you how to work with this
a little bit more add some actions so
this can actually do something other
than just sort of sit here and look nice
so as always this is Scott would love
love tutorials if you have any questions
or comments leave it come in the video
artist up at Twitter or Facebook we love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
