of tutorials in this video we're going
to wrap up by showing you how to have
your chart using a logarithmic scale and
diving into some of the scale options
allowing you to explore some of those
options yourself so let's get going on
that right now
okay so pretty much everything we've
done so far has been in a linear scale
but let's say we wanted to display
things logarithmic Li now it's very
possible to do so and in fact if you
ever use something like d3 we would have
to modify the data before doing anything
with it now it's great about this
charting libraries that we can do so
without actually having to touch the
data itself so let's go ahead and
actually get rid of this I'm gonna leave
the options object here but it's going
to remain empty I'm also gonna get rid
of this array of colors but keep one of
the colors of which I'm just gonna keep
this blue and I'm gonna actually make it
into a background or a border color this
is do border color okay and now we can
keep everything else in terms of our
datasets and all that stuff let's go
ahead and change the type though to line
super cool so we have a line we have
that data and everything should be
pretty good to produce a nice little
line graph here now this is great all
the data points are actually like very
logically represented here but let's say
for some reason we wanted to actually
have this be a logarithmic graph here
now we can do that by passing some
things into our options the first thing
we need to do is have a scales object
we've seen scales before when we modify
the tick's starting at zero and now we
need to specify the axis so we could say
the y-axis and now from here we need an
array of objects and we just have one
object in here now at this point we can
actually start defining some things like
we can define the scale of which we can
say it's a type of
logarithmic it make sure to get rid of
that extra why okay super cool so let's
go ahead and actually refresh this and
see what happens now now you'll notice
our chart looks quite a bit different
you know we're no longer you know 10 is
now at the very bottom here and the
distance between all of these points for
instance the distance between 20 and 30
is now less than the distance between 10
and 20 so this is going to be using a
logarithmic scale in addition if we
wanted to go ahead and specify the
beginning and ending we can save ticks
and ticks is going to be an object where
we can give this a min and now let's say
a minimum of 1 let's do a maximum of
let's say 60 and let's check this out
and now you can see something really
interesting this space below between 1
and 10 is really large and the space is
the numbers get higher up is crunched a
little bit more so as you can see you
based on how you need to represent your
data logarithmic scale is super easy to
add in turns out J s I found it to be a
much more logical approach than having
to modify all the data and stuff like
you do in d3 obviously these are two
different beasts so you can't really
compare them that that way but I just I
like the way that they handle the
scaling within chart is it's nice and
easy super cool so basically there are a
ton a ton of scale options if you head
to the chart dot J s documentation you
can really see just how many options we
have from display before update where we
get all these functions where we're
getting callbacks when the chart and the
data is ready before build ticks before
data we have access to a whole host of
things that we can use at our disposal
in case we want to be able to access
this data at any given point in addition
these options within scales will give us
the options we really need to do pretty
much anything with drawing our ticks
color line white any of these stuff font
color yeah so this is where you
going to find all of your options here
and you're definitely going to find lots
of value of spending some time inside of
this section of the documentation now if
there's anything in particular you want
to see from scales please let me know
they're ours almost too much stuff to
cover here are too many very specific
use cases so if there's a use case you
really want to see let me know and I'll
hook it up in a video as always this is
Scott with little of tutorials I hope
you're having fun with charts Jas it's
definitely sort of blown my mind in
terms of what's easily and quickly
possible in a charting application
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
