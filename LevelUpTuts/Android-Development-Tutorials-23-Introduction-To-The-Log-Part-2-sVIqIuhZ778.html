we're going to continue talking about
log and i'm actually on
android com which is a great resource
for developers to learn more about that
android development platform in general
there's all sorts of great information
here and i would highly recommend going
through here and just looking at things
reading and just reading the docs i mean
there's all sorts of great stuff and you
can usually find what you want as easy
as you can so what we want to go over
here is that there's different types of
error messages and i did in fact fix
that error message i was getting before
or that log spamming i was getting just
by updating so it's no longer there in
fact if we go to the app that we were
currently running before and you'll
notice as i click you'll see our button
clicked and there's no sort of messages
spamming down here anything like that so
we should be all good to go so we have
different types of messages based on the
different types of priority so the
verbose is the lowest birdy de bug is a
second and then info and then way of
warning then error fatal and silent and
so really if you have a warning maybe
you can put this in your code it
shouldn't be getting to this spot or
something and if it is it's doing
something you should output a warning in
these warnings they're going to change
how the log looks in the log message so
if we come here and instead of using D
let's just say we use e and for some
reason we didn't want this button click
method to go here so this is going to be
an error whenever this button is clicked
it shouldn't actually get here so let's
run our app ok and now I'm here and
notice how every time I click it it's
giving us red it's giving us errors and
then we could filter and say only give
me the errors and you'll notice here's
our errors we have them all right in
front of us and it's really easy to see
what something went wrong if we put
these error messages in here bright red
in your face whatever so that's really
cool however we talked about maybe not
having this main activity let's say if
this activity name changed or we're in
another activity we wanted to drop this
codon we wanted this still to say the
activities name so what's something we
can do to automatically assign the main
activity to a variable
well we can give this a variable it can
be public and then so this is going to
be a public variable you can use it all
over the place it's static and final
because we're not going to change this
this is a static variable it's not it's
only going to get set once at the
beginning here and that's it and so
we're going to say it's a string and the
name of the string is well in fact if
you remember when we were creating our
log if we type log that D and they
called it a tag so we're going to call
this tag and because this is a final
will do Rai static where it all caps
here and it's going to be equal to and
then we're going to grab the main
activities name so how we do that is we
type main tivity that class dot get name
sweet okay so now with getting the name
and it doesn't matter what the name is
it's just going to automatically set it
to this tag and then come down here in
our log and we can just change this main
activity to tag and now let's again i'm
going to change this to w just so you
can see a warning in action save this
app i'm going to rerun it now reboot sit
in my emulator and when i click on this
actually let's turn this filtering off
we'll just have be verbose and never
time i guess it i'm getting this warning
button clicked and it's orange perfect
nice and easy to see but most
importantly if we make this a little bit
larger here you can see that it's
grabbing our tag has come dot level up
to level up Todd's main activity so it's
grabbing our main activity directly from
our directly from the activity itself
and getting the name exactly what we
wanted and that's perfect so this is how
what we wanted to see
we've tried different couple of error
message or different types of lugs and
now you can just drop logs and wherever
you want and instead of maybe if you
wanted to test this you know your users
got the number right it's before you
output on the screen or something just
so you can test that interaction these
are great and then you don't have to
have anything output to the user and
when you bundle your app for production
these errors are these log messages
aren't going to come along with it so
you don't have to worry about anyone
seeing these log messages ever any of
your end users so I guess that's oh it's
important what you want to do is get
used to using these log messages but by
all means come to the docs here and just
read over this there's more valuable
information in here then I can try to
spout off in one of these videos so
check it out and if you have any
questions leave a comment as always hit
us up on Twitter or Facebook let us know
what you think this is Scout with all up
Tut's and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
