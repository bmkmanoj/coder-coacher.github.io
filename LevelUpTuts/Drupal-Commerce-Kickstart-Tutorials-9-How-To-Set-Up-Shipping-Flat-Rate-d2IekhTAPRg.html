of Tut's and today we're going to take
on Drupal commerce shipping and we're
gonna start with the absolute basics
which is flat rate shipping and we're
gonna use a couple of parameters like if
the order is more than $50 then they'll
have the ability to have free shipping
or otherwise they have two other
shipping options and if you installed
commerce kickstart chances are these
shipping options might already be there
but what I'm gonna go ahead and do is
show you how to make them yourself so
that you can truly understand exactly
what's going on with the shipping
settings and so like in the last video
when we set up text this is using rules
so it will give you a little bit more
experience understanding what rules are
about and what they're like so the first
thing you want to do is we want to go to
store settings and then shipping and you
may have some default ones installed
depending on what you installed here if
not you'll have no options and you'll
have a button to add a flat-rate service
so why is it just flat right well if we
come to our sites modules most open this
up in a new tab here we can type in
shipping here and you could see that the
only shipping module that we've enabled
is shipping shipping UI so this is
really that all that comes with it and
then to have other shipping methods you
need to install those so the other one
that was installed with this
installation was flat right so if we
type in flat right you'll see you flat
rate shipping was installed with
commerce kickstart incomes here already
so if we wanted to add some other types
of shipping modules like this
Kalish pack and ship integration that
sort of stuff we'd have to download them
and enable them so let's go back to our
shipping page and we're gonna head off
light right so let's click this button
and then then we're going to give this a
title and this is going to be free
shipping and the display is also going
to be free shipping because the display
title is what your customers are going
to see this is what it's going to show
up in
and and you can give it a description if
necessary but we can say for orders over
fifty percent fifty dollars shipping for
orders are full okay whatever for orders
over $50 fine and base rate is going to
be zero dollars so let's click a flat
rates a flat rate great cool so now
let's actually go to our page here let's
check out our cart we have more than 50
dollars worth of stuff in our cart
already and let's go check out and let's
we have our shipping information already
in here continue next step no shipping
rates found so what's going on here
well we've created our shipping rate but
we haven't told it to show up for any
particular reason yet especially we
haven't said for over $50 so there's no
reason why this should be working so
let's go to configure component right
here and that's going to take you to the
standard rule screen so now we're going
to click configure component and it's
gonna take us this pretty standard rule
screen well we notice that we already
have an action and the action is a day
rate for a shipping service to an order
and so if we click edit we can see a
little bit more about this but it's
really just going to say the value free
shipping is going to be added to the
order so like I said we don't have to do
anything here what we do want to do is
add a condition in which this applies
right now we have no condition so it's
not going to apply so let's click add
condition and here we can say down here
we want to say data comparison and now
we can click this downwards arrow for
the data selector to see what options
are and this data selector is really
like what piece of data we want to
compare and we want to compare the order
total we want to see if that order total
is over $50 so we can click this
downwards arrow and we can say commerce
order dot and then it opens up some more
options and we're gonna look down here
we want to look for
order total so commerce order total and
then total amount so this very first one
commerce order total amount perfect and
let's click continue now it gives us an
option so we could say if the commerce
order total is exactly and if it equals
an amount but we don't want to do that
we want to say if it's greater than and
then instead of a data selector here
we're gonna click this switch to direct
input mode and for the value we're just
going to say 50 so if the commerce order
total amount is greater than 50 then
apply this role so I saved that shipping
room I'm gonna go back to shipping and
you can see that it's right here and now
let's refresh our shipping page in the
checkout and now you'll see we have an
option for free shipping I could
continue the next step and it's going to
tell me pretty much I have free shipping
and it's not adding shipping to anything
cool well lets up going to add another
shipping and let's click add a flat rate
service and we're just going to do this
one more and it's just gonna be called
shipping and this can be
normal shipping I'm not exactly sure
what normal people would call this but
normal shipping we could say it's gonna
be five to eight days and the base price
is going to be twelve bucks because it's
so expensive and notes click save flat
rate okay so just like the last one we
want to configure this component and
just like the last one we have actions
already in here and we just need to add
a condition so let's add a condition
again and just like last time we're
gonna pick data comparison then
downwards arrow commerce order converse
order total dot dot commerce order total
amount continue and then in the value
we're going to say is greater than zero
so sorry we want to switch this to
direct input there you go so as long as
the order is greater than zero they
should have this option so let's click
Save now refreshing anybody is going to
have this normal shipping option if we
selected here we click continue it's
going to add this into our total price
you can see our shipping is twelve
dollars here let's make this a little
bit bigger there we go
and now it's eighty four ninety nine is
total with the fourteen dollars or
twelve dollars shipping which is pretty
awesome because that was really easy to
do now let's go in our cart and let's
actually remove some things from it so
let's go back to check out here and we
have our products I'm sorry let's go to
this checkout right here
and in here we can actually remove some
of our products I'm gonna remove this
expensive backpack that's taking up a
ton of our order and now our park is
only $39 so if we click checkout you'll
be able to see that once we get past
this shipping screen to continue the
next step you'll actually see that we
have our free shipping option still I
mean why is that we did say that it
should be for any order under or greater
than fifty dollars that free shipping
should appear and here we have free
shipping
still showing up well there is a good
reason for that is is we messed
something up right and this is a very
common thing to mess up and that's why I
wanted to do this so we can go to
shipping and then free shipping
configure component this is actually a
little bit of an issue I have with
Drupal commerce sometimes they expect
things out of you and they don't tell
you so here it says value and you have
50 in here for your value so you might
be thinking that's $50
well what 50 is is it's actually 50
cents
so Drupal commerce they're using micro
and I forget what they have a name for
of micro currency or something like that
where 50 equals 50 cents and there's no
differentiating it so the solution here
is actually to type 5000 instead of 50
so 5,000 you can just imagine a decimal
point being in here and that is going to
be it so as long as our shipping is over
$50 or 5,000 for the value we should
save this and now if we refresh here
goodbye to free shipping and likewise if
we go to our cart and add something
let's add the quantity to like 10 or 12
or something and check out it's gonna be
right back there cool so this is how you
add shipping rules that are
conditionally changing based on the
order price in the the total order price
so this is Drupal commerce shipping at
its most basic and we're gonna give this
some UPS or USPS one of those in the
next one and we're just going to talk
more and more about shipping and then
the order process so if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment in
the video I'm gonna submit toward our
level up test Leonard you're thinking we
love to hear from you as always this is
Scott with a LevelUp tuts and thanks for
