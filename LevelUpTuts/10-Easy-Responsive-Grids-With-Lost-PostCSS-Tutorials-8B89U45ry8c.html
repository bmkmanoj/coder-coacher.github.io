tutorials in this video were to continue
talking about lost grid by showing you
responsive grids using lost now we're
not going to be doing anything special
with media queries or just going to be
sort of plain old media queries but it's
just going to show you how easy it is to
get a really nice rib going with lost
that changes responsively so let's get
going on that right now so in the last
video we had some asymmetrical grids
here I'm going to go ahead and actually
remove some of that not get rid of this
entire section here i'm going to add
back in some of these grid items uh so
we have some additional items in here
and i'm going to remove the stuff here
about the enth child so that way we have
a normal sort of grid i'm going to do it
13 like so okay there we go so as you
can see the only real code we have here
is a clear fix on the wrapper and we
have a lost hyphen column of one-third
on each individual div here now we're
going to be doing in this video is we're
going to be making this into a
responsive grid that goes from 1 column
2 2 columns 23 24 based on the browser
width okay so we want that break point
to happen sort of where it feels nice so
obviously what we want by default is to
get rid of this lost column we can even
say one out of one here like so and then
that way what you get is every single
one of these items and actually I'm
going to get rid of these interior divs
here as well so we just have grid items
like so
okay and now as you can see here with
this one over one each one of these
takes with the one hundred percent of
the parent and as you can see we have a
nice sort of stacking going on and that
they're doing that for the entire width
so the next thing we want to do is head
to our CSS and what we're going to do is
we're going to throw in a media query in
here and as you can see i'm going to say
at above 400 pixels I want you to copy
this whole little statement here like so
okay now at this point I want this to go
to one half so at 400 pixels this grid
is going to go to taking up half
therefore it's going to be two columns
so as you can see how you refresh and we
get to actually think i had this
backwards its max width let me have this
a min with 400 refresh okay so we have
one column at under 400 once we hit 400
we break into two equal columns now
let's sort of just feel this out right
so then we can come to here and say
about let's say like 900 it's feeling a
little wide here so let's go ahead and
add at this another media query we can
say now at 900 pixels we want these to
be each one third like so now when we
refresh we get one-third and Kylie make
the smaller to 11 third there we go and
then now at let's say 14 let's just say
baby 13 not not so much 14 at 13 we want
this to go to four columns okay so we
can come in here and now we can just say
1,300 here and 1300 is going to go to
one quarter
ok now we refresh and you can see huh in
pretty much no time at all we the best
part is we didn't have to define any
sort of cycle we didn't have to define
any sort of rows we didn't have to say
how many items were in here all we had
to say was yeah take up one fourth to
take up one-third take up one half we
didn't have to do any margin right we
didn't have to do any clearing other
than the clear fix on the parent as you
can see that's a pretty sweet responsive
grid for the couple of seconds
essentially that it took us to throw
this together so while lost itself
doesn't provide any sort of features
essentially for building responsive
grids it does make it super easy just by
having this easy syntax in general and
depending on what sort of CSS
preprocessor using like I myself use a
stylus and then i use the rupture
package for media queries i'm telling
you using something like rupture with
lost just makes the syntax and just the
whole thing of working responsively
endlessly awesome so check it out this
is how you build an easy responsive grid
using lost it's essentially just
defining these different various lost
columns I mean you could throw anything
on here you could say okay now we want
you to cycle for and we want you to have
now we want you to have a larger let's
say gutter here we want you to have a 50
pixel gutter now you can see once we get
up we have this large or 50 pixel gutter
so I mean you really have complete
control over everything with one CSS
property and you can use you can break
this out and say lost hyphen cycle and
things like that if you'd like however
this shorthand this one line is doing a
whole lot for you and it's super super
convenient so as always this is Scott
