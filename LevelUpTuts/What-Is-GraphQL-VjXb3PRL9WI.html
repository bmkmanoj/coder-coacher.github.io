tutorials and in this video this is what
is Wednesday and today we're going to be
talking about graph QL what is graph QL
hopefully I'll have that answered very
quickly for you here and before we get
going I want to say if you want to learn
a little bit more about graph QL over
the course of an hour or so the syntax
dot F M the syntax podcast which is West
vos and myself we just in the entire
episode on graph QL so if you watch this
video and you think hey that sounds cool
I want to learn a little bit more head
over to syntax style FM check out the
latest episode is on graph QL so with
that said let's actually answer this
question what is graph QL now graph QL
is a query language in fact that's what
the QL would stand for it's a query
language for your API that's entirely
unlike anything that you've ever used
before in terms of a standard API so in
other a P is that you'd hit to get data
let's say you want to fetch data from
the YouTube API and you can say hey
YouTube give me this information now the
way those typically work is that you
have a specific endpoint or a URL that
you're hitting and that URL determines
what data comes back and you can pass in
options to a URL and that can change the
shape of the data or maybe what comes
back in it but at the end of the day
with a normal what's called a REST API
you fetch a URL and the URL is returning
typically something like JSON or a
JavaScript object full of data and so
this is how it's worked for a while now
right before that we typically we worked
with XML and stuff like that now api's
have typically been essentially just
REST API x' for a long time no what
makes graph
q well new and exciting indifferent well
graph QL aims to improve upon those sort
of ideas so instead of an API where you
hit a URL and just accept whatever data
is coming back graph QL allows you to
ask for specific kinds of data this
might be hard to see with the screen
size but in this example that's on the
graph QL org you can see that we've
defined the way our data looks right
it's a project with a name a tagline and
contributors then you ask for what you
want right so this is the actual query
so instead of hitting an API and just
accepting data you say hey give me the
project with a name of graph QL and
return the tagline okay and then the
results come back with exactly what you
asked for which is a an object with
project and tagline rather than just a
whole bunch of stuff maybe you asked for
didn't ask for now in addition to
filtering out fields that you aren't
necessarily going to use graph QL allows
for really excellent relational queries
and I'll show you what I mean here in a
real environment in a second that allows
you to well save trips for instance the
YouTube API I keep going back to this
one but the YouTube API you hit it and
you get a list of videos which is
essentially the video IDs but if you
want all of the information about that
particular video you have to then go
back to the API and you have to say oh
yeah so okay I got this ID but now that
I have this ID hey YouTube once more
tell me all of the information about
this video with graph QL you can do this
extremely relational queries that only
make it so you have to do one trip one
trip to the API data comes back
okay so graph QL is a query language
it's a way to get data from an API into
your application so who owns graph QL
well graph QL is actually a
specification and the fact that graph QL
was created by Facebook is one of those
things that can worried people they can
say well I
don't I don't want to use some Facebook
technology because if maybe Facebook's
reputation now now Facebook has some of
the best engineers around and they have
some amazing projects so I don't
personally agree with that but I
understand it so if if you don't want to
use Facebook's code that's the best part
is that graph QL is a specification it's
not an implementation as in you don't
see an install graph QL anywhere on this
site that's because you to use graph QL
you need to use an implementation of
graph QL and one of the coolest things
about it is that because it's just a
spec there's competition in the
implementation space so you're not stuck
using Facebook's projects and there's
room for a lot of interesting ideas not
only that but you can use graph QL on
any sort of platform so if we went to
the the code part of this site you can
see that graph QL is sort of two parts
right there's the server component and
there's the client component now if an
API has a graph QL server that already
exists you can just use that with only
client-side graph QL and you don't need
to learn the server-side stuff but if
you're building a full stack app such as
level up tutorials you need a server
library as well so the cool part about
graph QL again is that there's just all
this choice here so you can see that we
go to server libraries and there's
categories where you can find graph QL
implementations and all of these
different languages and if I were to
select JavaScript you can see that while
we have some options graph QL j/s
Express graph QL we have Apollo server
which is what I'm using and all of these
are great because again we it gives us
options to use something different
let me explain a little bit about what
the graph QL server actually does the
graph QL server essentially takes in
your API you write your API as a series
of type definitions so you're defining
the shape of your data and resolvers
which is stuff like a query right if I
say get me the tutorials that's going to
be in the resolvers and then the server
sort of
takes all of that stuff in and exposes
your graph QL API via an endpoint
remember I mentioned that typical REST
API is you have to hit an endpoint right
well with graph QL you hit one endpoint
and then ask for this stuff you want so
we only have one particular endpoint
which is typically forward slash graph
QL but you can actually set it to be
anything you'd like and that's the graph
QL server right and allows you on any
sort of server environment to be able to
expose this information the flexibility
of graph QL and an implementation like
Apollo is absolutely amazing
now in addition to having server
libraries or implementations there's
also graph QL clients which is the
front-end component of it this is where
you actually are able to accept the
queries on the front-end connect to the
graph QL endpoint and asked for the data
you want to receive and again with
JavaScript there's a lot of them if you
want to use Facebook's own code there's
a Facebook framework called relay if you
want to potentially easier to get
started option there's the Apollo client
which is actually made by the folks from
meteor the meteor development group and
Apollo client is honestly it's what I'm
using it is SuperDuper excellent you
don't need to know it it's it's not
connected to meteor at all so if those
words scare you don't worry about it
Apollo client is a great way to get set
up and be able to query from a graph QL
endpoint okay so I have been talking
primarily from the viewpoint of
JavaScript so if you are not a
JavaScript developer it's okay all of
this stuff is still applicable you can
see go graph QL and one of the cooler
things is that some of these like Apollo
you can see there's Apollo Android
there's Apollo iOS some of these are
cross-platform like that and if you can
use one thing for a whole bunch of
different front ends that seems like a
sweet spot to me
so okay I've talked a little bit about
graph QL and what it is and how it works
let's actually see some graph QL in
action this is the actual level of
tutorials graph QL API now here you can
see I wrote a simple query that just
says say and the data returns back is
hello world now this is stupid because
that's simply just returning a string
it's not having hanging the database but
let's actually see some of these
relational queries in the action for
instance on the level of tutorial site
I have playlists and I have tutorials
and some of this information is
relational and sometimes I would have to
hit to api's and maybe combine some data
to to get this to do what I wanted to or
I had to have some custom code on the
backend and the API to return all of
this information but but what graph QL
makes it easy to do is write one sort of
query and make it flexible for instance
let's say I'm on a tutorial page and I
just don't want
let's do tutorials okay which is going
to return an array here and let's say I
just want the title it's gonna give me
the title of every single tutorial in my
database that's amazing now let's say I
want now let's say I actually want to
get the playlist now the playlist is
actually in an entirely separate
collection but I've written my API so
that if I ask for a playlist I can say
hey now that I have the play this give
me the playlist title and hit go and
just like that not only do I have the
tutorials but I also get the title and
the playlist with the title and just by
describing the shape of a playlist or
describing the shape of a tutorial I can
now ask for anything within this
playlist object I could even ask if the
user bought this series and say hey did
the user buy this series you can see
yeah hey I bought this one but no I
didn't buy this one I bought it no so
this is you can see just a small little
example but the query language here is
absolutely unreal for getting the right
data you want very quickly now in
addition this little interface here is
called graphical and this thing is a way
to test out and write your queries
another key thing in graph QL because
this thing right here allows you to make
sure your queries are working in the day
is coming in exactly as you'd expect you
can copy-and-paste right out of here
into your coat okay so a lot about graph
QL here let's talk a little bit about
implementations now my again my favorite
implementation is the Apollo client so
if you want to head to Apollo graph QL
comm again nothing against relay to be
honest I haven't dove into it more than
just looking at the dock so it really
looks like your thing go ahead man I I
just really like Apollo the
documentation for this stuff is great so
again it check out Apollo if you're
interested in you know just messing
around with a with graph QL here now
okay let's scroll down and let's talk
about some other little things that are
kind of interesting we went over these
in the the syntax podcast again so watch
that if or listen to that if you are
interested in some more stuff but we
have things like graph CMS which is
going to be really cool it's gonna look
like it's essentially like a wordpress
backend and all it does is expose a
graph QL API so then what you would do
is well connect to that API write your
queries and get your data now this seems
like an excellent modern implementation
of how you could write a back-end on a
service and then write your front-end
and have them talk to each other really
like something like this and we also
have something called graph cool which
is kind of similar without the backend
it's a graph QL back end with no
interface where graph CMS has a
beautiful interface right so this is if
you don't need that or maybe it's
something like a client facing interface
this allows you to write a graph QL
backend and query it on the front end
and not have to worry about the database
layer or anything like that at all so
with graph QL there's a ton of cool
stuff now also have you been following
level up tutorials you've probably seen
some tutorials on gatsby which is a
static site generator for react using
graph QL so this again is you write your
queries in a graph QL and then when you
generate the site it uses that to fill
in your data again some cool stuff with
crack you
well again graph QL is a specification
for a query language okay it's just
saying how it should look and work the
implementations are things like relay
and Apollo so to use graph QL you have
to use an implementation of graph QL I
highly recommend just coming to graph QL
code click I think it's code here and
then look into your languages check out
the libraries and see how you can get
started it's all seriously cool stuff if
you would like to learn graph QL in the
context of react and meteor and
JavaScript and node and all that good
stuff there's actually a free series on
level up tutorials right now that's
going to show you how to connect Apollo
to meteors account system and again if
you're afraid of meteor don't worry were
you mostly using meteor for the build
tool the server and the account system
none of the other stuff within meteor
and it'll be very lightweight app here
that we're building but if you want to
do that that's a free series that's up
on level up tutorials comm right now if
you want to learn more about graph QL
overall there's going to be a ton of
premium content on level up Pro this
year so sign up to become a pro at level
tutorials com forward slash Pro thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
