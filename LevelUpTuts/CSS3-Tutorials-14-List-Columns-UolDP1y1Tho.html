up tots and today I'm going to show you
how you can split up a list item they're
an unordered list into CSS three columns
without having things get transferred
over to another column that maybe
doesn't belong let's save a really long
line item or something like that either
way we're gonna get into how you can set
up and break up a list into multiple
columns using CSS 3 columns so check it
out let's get started right now so in
this example we have an unordered list
and as you can see the third item in our
list is bit longer than the others and
that is going to cause some problems in
a little bit and I'll show you why so
let's go ahead and let's use our new CSS
columns abilities to create columns
without of this list so what we can say
is we have an unordered list and this is
where we're going to apply our columns
and let's use our column count so we can
say column - count and we want to break
this into two columns
there we go and you'll notice that our
error ellipses they went away and are
listed and we want to show our ellipses
so we need to tell the list style to be
inside so we can say list style and then
we're going to say it's inside and disk
okay we'll save that and I'm sorry then
not disk with a K disk with a C and
you'll see that we have our issue is
nice and obvious we have our list items
we have the bullets but CSS columns
doesn't say hey you have a list item
we'll keep it all in one column it says
hey this content is too long for this
column we're gonna flow it into the next
column which is why you see list item
list item same one carry over into the
next column now typically when you're
gonna have a multi column list you're
not going to want this behavior and now
you could want this behavior but maybe
not usually so how do we go about fixing
this
well we have a property that we can
apply to the list item and we can say
that we are not going to allow this to
break in the middle of a list item so
using this awesome CSS property called
column break we can say Li and then the
properties for that are going to be
column - break - inside and then the
property we want is avoid now nothing
has happened and you can tell that this
property is not as well supported
because browser prefix r isn't even Auto
prefixing this so we can say a - WebKit
- and then that the entire property here
just like this
upon saving that you can see that our
long list item is now unbroken in fact
we have two equal columns and that this
item is not broken in fact it will
remain not broken no matter how many
columns we have it's going to always
fulfill its space to make these columns
as even as possible you can get away
with WebKit column break inside a void
as well as Moz column break inside a
void for the latest browsers and you're
gonna see the proper action working
however your other users who might even
support the standard column count might
not get that break inside avoid working
correctly now that's up to you to decide
how to handle that if you're using
something like moderniser or if you're
just going to let that degrade for users
who aren't on those latest versions
luckily like with browsers like Chrome
they auto update pretty much all the way
for you so a lot of your users are going
to be on the latest versions or at least
a version that will be able to handle
column break inside a void great so you
can now handle lists in CSS columns and
have content not break your list by
being too long I hope you found this
little introduction to CSS columns to be
super useful it should serve as a point
for you to just get messing around with
CSS columns and using them to create
user interfaces that you could not
create only a few years ago
so as always this is Scott love-love
