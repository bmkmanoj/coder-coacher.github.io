of tutorials and this is going to be our
first angularjs tutorial now in this
video we're just going to get started
we're going to set up a basic HTML page
and then we're going to have sort of the
classic first angular example by showing
you two-way data-binding which is
something that you haven't used angular
or a JavaScript front-end frameworks
before it's going to be really cool and
it's going to make you feel like as
their tagline says that you have
superpowers because it really allows you
to do some cool stuff really quickly so
let's get going on that right now
so we're going to start with this basic
HTML page we really just have a doctype
of HTML for html5 doctype we have our
standard HTML opening and closing we
have a body a head and a title
absolutely nothing here effectively come
to Chrome absolutely nothing I'm
actually just loading this file up based
on the the path so I just dragged this
file from finder unto my browser and
future videos we're probably gonna set
up a server or something a simple server
with Python or something like that
however for this particular example we
just want to get started with some of
the initial angular magic right off the
bat now as a disclaimer this data
binding stuff is super cool and is a
great way to get into the idea of using
angular because you could see how
instantly powerful it is and it might
seem sort of magical while you're doing
it however I should note that you can
really dive into angular really deeply
and understand exactly what's going on
and have complete control of your
application and angular is good for more
than just some sort of fancy data
binding example however it's a great
place to start off so let's do that what
I'm going to do is go ahead and grab a
script tag it's actually from the hosted
Google scripts here so I'll put a link
or so I'll put the URL to the script
into the description of the video and
you can grab it right from there for me
I'm just going to paste it in here and
as you can see it's going to load in
just angular version 1.3 point one five
at the recording of this video this is
the latest release
now that we have this script our
websites going to be loading up angular
okay so one thing with your angular apps
what we need to do is sort of declare
that this is going to be an application
so one way to do that is in our HTML tag
we can type ng - app like so okay so now
angular is going to sort of recognize
this HTML file as an angular application
so let's go ahead and add a text input
here we can just say input and then it's
going to be a type text and now we're
going to be using what's called a
directive now this directive is going to
be ng - model now what directives do an
angular it's essentially giving your
application functionality this
particular directive is sort of allowing
you to store some data right so once we
get into more advanced angular stuff
you'll be able to write your own
directives and see why they're truly
powerful for now we're mostly going to
be using directives that come within
core angular so what we can say is ng -
model is equal to and then let's give
this a variable name this instance is
just going to be a name a person's name
right so let's say your name is going to
be the variable name that you're saving
as this ng model okay and in a
placeholder we can type placeholder and
we can just give this a value of enter
your name okay so here we have this
input and it's a type text and what this
does here by having this ng model here
when we type into this input without us
having to do anything additional it's
going to be saving what we type as we
type it into this variable your name so
for instance we can come here and in an
h1 tag like so we can output this
variable and it's really easy to help
put this variable Simula by saying
bracket bracket bracket bracket it's a
tag in angular that lets you
you're using some sort of angular
template tech for this instance simply
by outputting our variable names such as
your name like so it's going to grab the
contents of this variable and help put
it here now what's great about this is
it's going to do this without us ever
having to say go as we type each
character it's just going to show up
so let's come back to our HTML here as
you can see I've refreshed it let me
zoom into the page so you can get a nice
and as I type in my name
I can just say SC OTT and as you can see
as I type without doing anything we
didn't write a single line of JavaScript
we're getting this to change the text
here so this works in all sorts of ways
in fact you can even use these template
tags here you can use these inside of
HTML elements for instance this is going
to be using some inline Styles here just
for this example we can say styles and
style is going to be equal to and we can
say background and colon now instead the
value here we can give this bracket
bracket bracket bracket finished off
with a semicolon
and inside of here let's just throw in
this your name okay and while this might
not do anything off off the bat here if
we type in a hex value here let's say
pound 3 3 or e you'll notice this is
instantly changing the background color
and it's instantaneous so we can say 0 F
F 0 0 F and as you can see we have this
neon this teal color and it changed
while we were typing this in fact if we
change any of these values it's going to
change once more let's actually change
it to something usefully different here
there we go so you can see that
instantly with this data binding simply
by just outputting this we've not been
able to do something like change the
background color instantaneous as we're
typing it and see that help put on our
now imagine trying to do this with
something like jQuery as fast as we did
it just now like I said this data
binding stuff is really sort of a Wow
example however this should give you an
idea about just how powerful this stuff
is out of the box so over the course of
the next few videos we're gonna be
building some cool applications we're
gonna be learning about all sorts of
core directives within angular
we're gonna learn how to work with data
we're gonna learn how to structure our
applications we're gonna learn how to
use directives and importing directives
that other people have written and most
importantly you're going to feel really
powerful with JavaScript so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials
thank you for watching and we'll see in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
