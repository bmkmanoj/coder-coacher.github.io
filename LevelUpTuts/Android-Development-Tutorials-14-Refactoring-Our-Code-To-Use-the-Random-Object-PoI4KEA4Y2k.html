up tents and today we're gonna be
working on this random code that we used
here and we use this math dot random to
give ourselves a random number but today
we're going to be refactoring this code
and by that I just mean rewriting using
the random object instead and what you
can think of an object like as an object
is sort sort of what you'd describe an
object like in real life so you have
let's say a phone and the phone has
certain abilities and properties right
so the phone could have like a color
might be its property Lord's name would
be a property but its ability would be
to call receive calls or text message so
in Java
those are called methods and we're going
to be using a method called next int on
the object random and that's going to
give us an integer that's random so I'm
going to go ahead and delete some of
this stuff I'm gonna leave rando here
but I'm gonna delete this stuff and
right here above this I'm going to
declare a new random number generator so
we're going to just like we created a
content or just like we created a data
type of a string or a text viewer but we
started off with the name of that data
type we also start out this off with the
name of that type so we're going to say
random and this is random and then we
give it a name which we're going to call
Rand Gen and so this R and Jen is going
to be an instance of the random object
class and so we're going to say random R
and
Gen is equal to new random and we finish
this off with some parenthesis and a
semicolon so what this is doing is it's
achtung a new random number generator
and you'll notice we have some
underlining here and it says rad and it
says import random so we have to import
this class we click import and we'll go
up to tier two our imports and you'll
see we have Java utilities random so we
have that in here now it's been imported
and now we want to use R and Gen which
is our new random objects so unwritten
gen we're going to be using the next int
method and you'll see it's even giving
us a little code completion here so we
can go ahead and enter and it's gonna
get us that nice and perfect and now if
you'll notice here we have to give this
an argument and the argument we're gonna
give it is a number so by default this
is going to give us a number 0 through
whatever you have here since we have 4
items we're gonna put 4 keep in mind
that this number will never show up if
we've run random next int and then 4
it's never going to give us a 4 it's
going to give us a 0 a 1 a 2 or 3 so if
you want it to give you a four and have
this be 5 however if you want it to be 1
3 or 4 you can always add 1 to this so
we want this to be 0 through 3 or 0
through 4 0 1 2 3 so that we can get out
of this array and this should be perfect
so let's run our app and make sure we
save it and then let's click run here
and make sure that it's functioning
exactly like how we would expect
so let's press this button and we should
see Kourtney Scott Kourtney
Tim Tim Tim Tim - Tim Ben and it looks
like everybody's showing up and it's all
perfect cool so we now have this random
generator using our random object and
it's great well what happens if you
wanted to display some sort of random
number itself on the screen well we're
going to tackle that in a quick video
next time so check out the next video if
that interests you if not move on
forward to the next one as always this
is Scott with level up Tut's we have any
questions or comments please leave a
comment the video hit us up and toward
our level up Tut's and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
