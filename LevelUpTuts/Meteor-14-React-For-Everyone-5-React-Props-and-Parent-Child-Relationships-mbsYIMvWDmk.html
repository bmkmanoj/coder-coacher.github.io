tutorials and in this video we're going
to dive into some of the key concepts
with react so we're going to be talking
about props we're going to be talking
about state and we're going to be
talking about components overall so
let's get started right now okay so when
we left off we had our app Jas which
we're importing into our main digest and
we have this basic at click function
where we had our our function within our
component here go ahead and remove this
commented out part and just head it in
there just so I could keep it in for the
code examples and it's gone okay now I
want to talk about state but before we
do that let's go ahead and install a
package you can see that it says my
language is JavaScript with JSX if we
come to atom and then we come to our
preferences we can install what we want
to look for is a babel package so let's
go ahead and do install you can say
babel bab-ee l and we'll want to go
ahead and you'll notice that this is
already installed here what we want to
do is look for a package named language
babel so we want to go ahead and install
this here and then we can set our
language to be Babel or es2015 and the
things should be a little bit better
okay now that that's saved let's go
ahead and we don't need to touch any of
these options here but I think we should
be able to change this to Babel now we
can come down and select Babel as you
can see the highlighting changes a
little bit but the important parts are
going to be the tabbing indenting and
things like JSX comments because you
can't use a normal JavaScript comment
within this so there's a lot of nice
little things that come with this most
of what you're not going to go over but
it's going to be better going forward so
as you can see here we have our new
Babel language setting we have our
export default class app extends
component now let's go ahead and talk
about a state what we need to add is a
construc
before we can use States so we can say
construct tor like this and this is just
going to be a function now you might be
wondering what the heck of constructor
is well a constructor is really just a
method here that allows you to
essentially perform actions when a class
is being instantiated so the constructor
is the first thing that runs when this
class is being instantiated instantiated
and because of that this is where we're
going to want to set our state and next
we need to call a super so we can say
super like this now why do we have super
here well it has to do with how this can
structure how this constructor accesses
itself so what is super do here well it
actually allows you to access functions
from the object's parent so because we
need to use this state well this dead
state exists because super so we can say
this state is equal to and this is just
going to be a standard JavaScript object
inside of this object we can go ahead
and give our state variable a name the
property value which we can just say
this is going to be a count okay and the
initial value is going to be 0 so just
like any other object we have a property
and a value now let's go ahead and we
can actually output this so if we were
to change this on click or whatever
let's remove this hello stuff and inside
of here we're going to have brackets
once more and we can say this dad state
that count now it's important to note
that this dead state that count is only
referencing the current components state
and not any sort of global state or
anything like that
let's also go ahead and get rid of this
hello Scott because we're not using it
so just like that we should see a 0 a
big fat 0 here cool we click it we get
hello well now let's actually click it
and increment this number
so we can do so by saying this dot set
state so we could say this dot set state
and now set state is a method that
accepts an object and we can say count
which is the property is going to be
equal to this dot state dot count plus
one okay so this current state we're
going to add one to it and we're going
to set that as the new state value now
what we can't do is we can't do this dot
state dot count is equal to a you know
plus one or whatever plus equals one we
can't do anything like that rule it just
doesn't work so we need to use the set
state method okay
so let's go ahead and try this it's
going to fail but I'm gonna explain why
when we click this boom cannot read
property count of undefined what's up
what's up with that well there's
actually a lot of issues with this this
particular instance using this syntax
here this class-based syntax we don't
have access to this this does not refer
to the component itself and we need this
to refer to the component so in
something that most people don't really
like that much but sort of one of the
things you have to deal with when
working in react we have to say this dot
heading click dot bind this ok by adding
this dot bind this method we're now have
access to this and this that we need
within our handling click set back to
our chrome now when we click it you can
see it increments every single time we
click it as long as you it click it sews
ut that is the application state if i
refresh sets it back to zero so the
state is just one key component of react
now another key component of react is
the parent-child relationship
of components now I'm going to go ahead
and create a new component super quickly
and I'm going to say class heading
extends component and this is simply
just going to have a render returned
because we need to return something okay
and inside of this return let's just go
ahead and you'll notice that when we
have react components we can't just
return some text here you actually need
to be wrapped inside of an object okay
so inside of here what we want to go
ahead and do is just simply return let's
just simply return an h1 we can say h1
we can simply just say h1 and this can
just be I'm going to have this as a 0
for right now we're going to see I'll
show you exactly what I'm doing here in
a second and this h1 where we're
clicking is now just going to become a
header not an h1 okay okay now I'm going
to put this on some separate line so we
can read this a little bit better okay
so what's interesting here is we now
have a header which is the standard HTML
component when we're clicking we're
still doing all this stuff right it
doesn't matter that's not h1 but let's
go ahead and get rid of this set state
count or at least comment it out now
what I want to do is use our new heading
component notice we don't have to import
it because it exists right here then the
same page it's defined here so we can
use heading and what we should see is an
h1 that just outputs 0 there we go
0 so nothing fancy there right we're
just simply saying hey inside of this
component use this component now this
might seem like a big deal and it's not
but this is the first time we've ever
made 2 components and put one inside of
another so congratulations for that but
what I want to do is I want to show you
how we can pass along data from one
component to the next now keep in mind
that passing
data from components in react is from a
parent to child relationship as in all
the data comes from top down you're not
going to be passing a data up from a
component down to or from a child up to
a parent it just doesn't work like that
now this might seem a little bit weird
but once you get used to sort of the
parent to child relationship aspect of
everything it's going to make a ton of
sense and everything's going to feel
right at home so let's just go ahead and
defined what's called a prop we can
define a new prop just simply by saying
count okay and let's say count is now
going to be equal to and we can use our
state from our parent so I'm going to
cut this out of here delete this comment
and say heading is now has a property
called count and count is equal to this
dads data count now in our actual
heading component we can once again have
brackets here and say this dot props dot
count so to get access to any of the
props on an object or a component we
access them with this dot props this dot
product count is going to be equal to
this dead state count which is going to
be equal to the component state so we
should see a big fat zero and when we
click it we should see the updating once
more so just like that we have this
thing we have a multi-component react
application here we have an event that's
updating a number and we're working with
something called props props and state
parent-child relationships this is all
what react is about and you might not
think that this right here is that
important right now at least but as we
get going you're going to just see how
powerful some of this stuff is so as
always this is Scott with level of
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments if you comment the video of me
up at Twitter or Facebook in the net
today we're going to be bringing in some
actual
Meteor stuff now that we have a little
bit of a react foundation we can work
with state we can work with props we can
make new components we should be able to
start getting in some awesome meteor
stuff so if you'd like to watch the rest
of these videos in the series head to
store level up tutorials comm and you
can purchase the series right now all of
the videos are available with code
examples and you can learn the in the
basics of react and meteor together or
you can become a level of pro and get
access to all new series while they're
in pre-release or series like this that
have been updated and will only exist
will only fully exist as a level of pro
or for purchase thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
