up Tut's and today we're going to be
learning our first bit of css3 and we're
going to introduce some new ideas here
in the CSS something you haven't done
before it's and the idea so with the
vendor prefixes okay and what vendor
prefixes are is it's a prefix on to your
CSS property targeting specific browsers
made by specific vendors so if you
remember before here we have our
properties right well let's say a only
Firefox supported background for
whatever reason and they only supported
it with the vendor prefix of mas because
that is Mozilla 's vendor prefix in this
case of background we would write that
as - mo z mo z - we are going to be
using this idea in future properties
here that we go over because not all of
the spec is complete but you can still
use some of these properties with vendor
prefixes and they'll be supported on
older browsers so if you recall on the
level up test site of course the site
though is not in any stage of being
complete we have to behead this one page
up before where we had these the
different types of tutorials we have and
this was just real basic and see they
kind of move when you hover over them
but you'll notice we have these icons
that we're using here but this box and
this box they have rounded edges it's
not something that we've seen so far in
CSS there's been nothing to do rounded
edges other than using an image there
used to be some really old image
techniques where you would have
transparent corners as an image and you
drop it on top of your div I mean it's
just it's an unnecessary now it's saving
you so much hassle if the designer comes
to you with rounded corners then
it's no longer a big deal and then
whatever isn't a huge deal but it was
always a pain so let's talk about what
browser support border-radius if you are
an IE user internet explorer you're only
going to be seeing border-radius on
versions 9 and the latest version 10 and
then for firefox you're going to see
border-radius working from for in more
current and chrome border-radius is
supported all the way back to version 5
Safari version 5 opera version 10 and a
half
iOS Safari is version 4 and android
version 2.2 for the browser BlackBerry's
browser supports in version 7
Opera Mobile and 11 and chrome has
always supported it for Android Firefox
for Androids that are supported it
however there is one thing you need to
know about this remember when we talked
about browser prefixes before or vendor
prefixes we said that they support a
little bit more right if you have people
in Firefox that need to see this rounded
edges that are using Firefox version 3
they're not totally out of luck here
using a vendor prefix you can use
border-radius going all the way back to
version 2 using a - WebKit prefix you
can use it on version 4 in chrome and
3.1 3.2 and 4 in Safari as well as iOS
Safari 3.2 and Android 2.1 so as you can
see using these vendor prefixes are only
going to widen your progressive
enhancement and that's a term we went
over in the previous video so let's go
ahead and do something real quick let's
let's make some rounded corners in fact
let's just try to do something similar
to what we were doing on the level up
side I'm going to do background and I'm
gonna set the background be to this tan
color
make sure cool all right it's not it's
not great-looking whatever and let me
just take some put some padding on the
whole thing we just do universally 20
pixels okay so we can see these all here
and in our list of them let's add 10
pixels of padding as well okay cool
look it a little bit more close okay
well in any other CSS property all we
had to do was type border and then now
of course the property is radius so
border radius and then in our border I'm
sorry colon and our border radius you
just give it what border radius you want
so let's say you want this to be super
curvy we'll say 20 pixels refresh and
you can see uh this border announced has
a border radius of 20 pixels as in the
radius of the border itself is 20 pixels
okay well this is pretty cool I mean
this doesn't look great but let's see
what happens if I add a little bit more
subtle five pixels it's going to look a
little bit better cool so now it's not
totally rigid it's not totally angular
but at the same time it's not totally
goofy so you can see how border radius
can really just sort of help designs
look a little bit cooler and it's not
something I would throw in everything
right if the design has border radius
then then up can use border radius but
yeah just maybe down don't throw it on
everything on your product project it
makes sense when it makes sense right
so what happens if you're saying I want
a different border radius for some
corners than others well just like we
had with other properties we can space
this out and let's see what happens when
we do five pixels 20 pixels 40 pixels
and then zero
okay let's refresh our page and check
out what we got me pull this back here
starting in the top left we have five
pixels then go in clockwise we have 20
pixels forty pixels and zero pixels and
let's say we did just five and twenty
refresh now we have five twenty five
twenty clockwise around just like you'd
expect and we have some interesting
shapes so already you can see what cool
stuff is happening with css3 with sort
of more interesting things you can make
okay so this is border-radius
and we mentioned earlier about vendor
prefixes well this page is only going to
be supported in the browsers I told you
in the beginning and if we wanted to
support it in Firefox version three to
add that vendor prefix all we have to do
is we can copy this we can paste this in
here and then right here we're gonna do
- mo Z - border radius and you'll notice
that we're displaying this twice and we
refresh this you're not going to see a
difference this is only going to affect
these older Mozilla browsers that are
looking for this mo Z vendor prefix okay
well that does it for border-radius
as always if you have any questions
please leave a question the video hit us
in the comments let me know what you're
thinking on Twitter it's at level up
tuts or a test olenski let me know as
always this is Scott and thanks for
watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
