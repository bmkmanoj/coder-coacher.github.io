of tutorials in this video we're going
to take that filtered input that we had
in the last video we're actually gonna
use it to filter our contacts list I'm
going to show you a nice way that you
can have some instant filtering going on
right in our website so let's get
started right now so now we're actually
going to take this information that we
got in the last video we're going to set
this up to actually filter our values
with the search bar so we have this
update search and with the default Texas
level up right now we don't want any
default text so I'm gonna set the
initial state of search to just a blank
string absolutely nothing in here okay
so now that we have that straightaway
let's go ahead and talk about what's
going to be happening we're gonna type
in this input it's going to update the
state variable unchanged now what we
need to do is filter this information
that's actually coming into our map here
that's going to be passed along to the
contact itself so let's go ahead and
let's take a look at what we can do
first inside of our render method I'm
going to make a new variable we're going
to say let and this is going to be
filtered contacts is going to be equal
to and we're going to set it to this
that props that contacts okay like so
now I'm gonna copy this variable here
and I'm just gonna paste it in here in
front of our dot map so now map is going
to be mapping over this array of objects
itself right here which is now defined
as this dot Propst at contacts so let's
head back to our application and we
refresh you can see nothing's changed
even though we're just passing along
this data to another variable so what we
really want to do is filter this dot
props context based on what the value in
our state is which is being set through
this input so we can simply at the end
of this context we can say dot filter
now inside of here we're going to have
an arrow function so what we really want
here is any time the characters in the
search box exist within the stop props
out contact we want them to remain in
filtered context so to do that we can
have an arrow function where we can pass
in contact so this is the individual
contact and now we'll want to return
where contact and if you remember from
our app KS we using name so we can say
where contact that name has an index of
which if you are familiar with
JavaScript you should know that index of
is really just looking for the index of
that particular character string or
characters that we're looking for so we
can say index of and we this is where we
want to say this that prop and this is
where we want to say this dot state dot
search and where this does state that
search is going to be wherever it's not
equal to negative 1
so what this is basically saying is if
you cannot find this dot state dot
search within this particular contacts
name then do not return it however in
the instance where you can find it where
it's not equal to negative 1 negative 1
would mean any value that it cannot find
then go ahead and return that contact
remaining keeping that contact within
our filtered contacts list where we're
then going to map over let's head back
to our page now that I've refreshed you
can see there's no arrow errors which is
good because this contact whole thing is
actually kind of messy here there's a
lot of JavaScript going on and a lot of
opportunities to mess something up but
what we can come back to is now we can
tight start typing and I can say s and
here you instantly see
t let's find out a letter that's in both
of them so I just typed a lowercase T
and it found Scott and Kourtney however
when I did an uppercase T it found Tim
now let's say we wanted capital T or
lowercase T to return everybody with a T
so Scott Tim and Courtney well we can
just start throwing on some two lowers
on some things so it's some two
lowercase so before we're looking for
the index of we want to look for the
name but we want to make the name two
lower case
okay and we can chain these methods
together so make the contact name two
lowercase and then find the index of in
addition we also want to take this and
say this does state does search dot to
lowercase so we're going to be making
everything lowercase that way we're on
the same playing field whether it's a
capital T or lowercase T if I type in T
here it's now automatically making this
a lowercase T and saying Tim Scott and
Courtney but if I do t I we're only
getting Tim likewise e C awesome so as
you can see we have a really nice
searching interface here actually let's
go ahead and just take this input and
let's just put it on top of an unordered
list it's really like sort of
distracting to have it jump around like
that the bump the font size down just a
hair just so it looks a little bit
cleaner and let's see if I messed
anything up here looks like it should
all be good and as you can see we can
now once again type in and now it's
being affected like that perfect now we
know so we know our data filtering based
on this input cool so this is all
working all in good in the next video
we're going to have an input box that
allows you to add things to this list
and then we're gonna do some little
animation stuff and we're gonna drop in
some CSS in here to make the
look a heck of a lot nicer because this
looks terrible so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
