love tutorials and in this video it's
going to be all about how we add react
to meteor now this is going to be
through NPM we're going to install react
and we're going to actually get it going
so let's get started now okay so last we
had basically we nuked everything we got
rid of all of the files that we were
looking at and as you can see nothing
here no as I go I'm just going to be
working and Adam here as I explained in
the video before however I always get
questions about the theme and all that
stuff so I'm using material dark and I
believe it's just material dark inside
of here we can check for preferences
look for themes atom material material
dark there it is cool just so I don't
get any questions about that but as you
can see here we deleted everything from
our client folder except for main dot
CSS and we have nothing in the settings
folder are there the name Jas which is
just some initializing code so let's
actually get started in actually making
it this an application the first thing I
want to do is I want to open up my
terminal from the root of our
application so you can leave media
running you can see it's running here I
just opened up a new tab if you're using
I term if I believe you for the command
D it should open up another tab from the
same folder that you're in and from
inside of your application we just need
to do meteor and PM install - - save and
then we want to install react and react
- Dom now before react dum used to be a
part of react to sound a separate
package in addition if you have NPM
installed if you've done other node
projects and have used NPM before you
don't need to use this meteor command
before here you can simply type in NPM
install package just like any other
ecosystem the reason why we do meteor
NPM install is because basically you
don't need
npm installed on your machine to use it
if you type meteor npm install you don't
have to have node or npm installed or
anything and it just takes care of it
but as you can see here I'm going to use
meteor NPM but from here on out I'm
going to just use normal and PM anytime
we also we add anything I just wanted to
make that distinction clear and as you
can see we've now added react to our
application if we check out our code you
could see we know of a node modules
folder which includes react at all its
dependencies in addition our package
JSON has been updated under dependencies
we now have react and react dumb super
cool okay so now what we want to do is
let's inside of our main our inside of
our client folder let's go ahead and an
a new folder or a new file it's just
going to be mayonnaise tml I know that
this is the same main dot HTML that we
just deleted but I want to start fresh
here so we can have a head and inside of
our head we can give this a title and
this will be react New Year voting okay
now I want to go ahead and have a body
tag and inside of this body I can just
have a straight-up div with an ID of
render target
okay the ID doesn't matter we're just
going to be using this to reference but
render target makes sense it's what
you'll see in a lot of tutorials render
target say hey this is what we're gonna
render our application now if you're
wondering how I did that out of
completion I'm using a package called
Emmet which is pretty standard fare at
this point a lot of people use it and
like Emmet if we were to do something
like pound let's do the pound word you
can see it creates a div with an idea of
word and likewise if we do dot word tab
you can see it creates a div with a
class of word instead of an ID I'll be
using Emmet throughout this and I can
call out these shortcuts if you do not
know them but otherwise the HTML should
be pretty clear I like to keep my text
size pretty large when I'm doing this so
as you can see here we have a body and
we have a head and in
our application we should now at least
see the title of our application if you
look up top here media react voting
despite not having anything actually
showing up okay so now that we have our
render target let's go ahead and add a
main je s file we can do a new file main
je s and we're going to import react
from react okay and you'll notice that
this is capitalized this is all
lowercase single string quotes so you
might be wondering what's up with this
import react from react syntax that we
have to have and if you've ever worked
in meteor before or maybe you haven't
worked in any sort of newer JavaScript
frameworks you might not be accustomed
to seeing something like this because in
meteor previously we never had to import
anything from anything well technically
in the client folder we don't have to
import anything write everything in the
client folder is going to be sort of
lazily evaluated and in fact if we were
to get rid of this what we're about to
type would work just fine but it's nice
to be able to get used to this syntax
because any time we want to use
something in another file you have to
make it available right especially once
we get going with our imports folder and
I'll draw more attention to importing
and exporting as we go but really what
we need to do right now is actually just
to go ahead and render something so
let's go ahead and also import meteor
while we're at it we can import and then
this time we actually have to have some
brackets and inside of these brackets we
can say meteor and then from and instead
of a simple one-line string we actually
have a path here and this is meteor
forward slash meteor a little bit on
that more as we import more things for
meteor and now another thing we need to
import is actually render we need to
import the render function from react to
Dom so we can say render from and then
we're going to say react - Dom
okay now to explain a little bit about
these brackets here it makes more sense
to talk about it with this react down if
we were importing a react Dom just
straight up you wouldn't need these
brackets but since render is essentially
a sub export you could say of reacted um
we need the brackets to say yeah we're
not bringing in all overreacted um we're
just bringing in render from react down
again when we write our own export
statements this will make a lot more
sense now let's go ahead and just simply
write a meteor startup function we can
say meteor that startup okay and now
inside of this function what this takes
is it's going to take a callback
function here so we have another set of
parentheses and then we can have an
arrow function and then we can go ahead
and have brackets here cool okay so just
like that we have this callback function
here note an arrow function is no
different from a regular function except
for how it scopes this we're going to be
using the arrow functions in some places
and the normal function syntax and other
places and it will make more sense once
we actually need to use this but for
right now the arrow syntax is just nice
inside of this sort of style it takes up
less space and we're not using this so
typically you wouldn't use the arrow
syntax just because it takes up less
space but in this particular instance it
works just fine and what we want to do
now is say render and we get to use this
fancy render function from react DOM and
we want to render what would be a react
component now we don't have any
components yet but let's just go ahead
and pretend that we do pretend like we
have a component named app now a
component in react is serve just like an
element in HTML you can totally just
imagine this as a self closing element
like like an image tag or something like
that either way a component in react is
essentially you could think of it as an
element that you can reuse over and over
again
this particular case the app element is
going to be sort of our container for
our entire application now we have a
comma and the second thing is going to
take is the location in which we're
going to be rendering app so we want to
render app within document dot get
element by ID which is just standard
JavaScript and inside of here we have a
string and if you remember in our main
dot HTML we had an idea of render target
so let's go ahead and make sure we have
render target and we're going to render
the app component in to render target
now at this point we should be able to
head to our document I'm going to go
ahead and inspect this and we should see
a very specific error app is not defined
which should be obvious to you because
we never defined app right so simply
having a component named app needs to be
defined now many times you would want to
do this in a separate file and we will
in a minute
however for right now I think it's
important just to get up and running so
let's go ahead and create a new
component simply by just saying class
app extends component okay
now this might be confusing again we're
learning a lot of new stuff here
component where we get component from
well we haven't imported component so
let's do that we can say import react
comma and then inside of brackets
component so we're going to be importing
the component from react and now we can
use component here now if we weren't
going to do this we could have actually
just done react dot component because we
already imported react and it would have
worked just fine however this just seems
nicer to me and it's definitely how
you're going to see things a lot through
a lot of different other examples and
it's just going to make a lot of sense
now
let's go ahead and simply have a render
function
the render function is required for all
react components and let's go ahead and
have a return inside of this function
keep in mind that react can seem kind of
weird and there's some things that may
be a little bit different from how
you're used to doing them but at the end
of the day it's all JavaScript and even
though it's JSX or essentially a
different type of JavaScript where we
can use essentially HTML elements within
our JavaScript it's still JavaScript so
we have a render function it needs to
return something so let's go ahead and
now let's just have a straight-up h1
that just says hello without a W because
that's not how you spell hello and we
just closed this off just like this okay
so this is standard and this is what a
react component is going to look like
for you basically we say a new class the
component name extends component we have
our brackets we have our render function
and then we actually return something
now a component can be a lot more
complex than this and most of the time
it will be but this is a great first
starting point what we should see now
it's hello so this is pretty fantastic
because I mean well I didn't have to do
anything really we just created a start
up function in an app and then here we
have our component nice and easy so if
this is your first time using react this
HTML inside of JavaScript or HTML
outside of an HTML document is going to
feel super weird and it might be a
little unsettling but trust me I had the
same feelings and after a couple of even
days using react you see the benefits
almost instantly so here we have our
hello our class app extends component
and this is our very first react app
using easier and it works awesomely okay
so this is non complex at all
in the next few videos we're gonna be
getting into actually adding things to
our database we're going to have what's
called collections we're going to be
able to have actual stuff and see some
of the benefits of meteors such as
instant updating when you add things to
the database it's sort of like if you've
ever used any sort of data binding where
you can type in an input field and see
that text updating live on the screen
well imagine that while it's saving to
the database the whole time it's super
cool so there's a lot of really great
benefits to using meteor especially with
react so in the next few videos we're
going to be taking this example more and
more complex and we're going to build
out our voting application and it's
going to be used super cool so as always
