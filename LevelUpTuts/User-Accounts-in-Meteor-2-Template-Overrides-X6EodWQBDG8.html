up tutorials in this video I'm gonna
show you how you can override the
templates that we get when we drop in
that at forum
now before we just dropped in this UI
unstyled and it gave us a forum but
there's a ton of little components
within that forum and we have access to
all of those templates really easily so
let's get started okay so in the last
video we created our login signup we
created this modal that shoots out of
here like this and allows us to sign in
here and this is pretty good however the
amount of code we actually had going
here doesn't really give us access to a
whole lot of stuff in here if you were
to remember we could check out our
actual code under accounts under login
modal you'll see we're really just
saying app form I mean we're we're
having the entire form coming in through
this add form and that may feel like you
don't have access to really get in there
and change things
so let's actually talk about in this
video how we can customize this much
further simply by overriding Blaze
templates so again at this point we're
not actually writing JavaScript or
anything like that to handle the logins
or anything like that but we're diving
deeper into customization and you're
gonna see just how much you actually
have access to without having to write
everything from scratch so what we want
to do right now is add a new package we
can say let's head to our packages file
and you can either do this through
meteor add or we can come down here and
just type it in ourselves let's go ahead
and add a new package and this package
is going to be al deed : templates -
extension you can always google this
template extension meteor package if you
want to grab this official string and
just paste in here otherwise you can
just look at this al deed : template
extension we can check our terminal
command line make sure everything is
grabbing looks like it's grabbed version
4.0 and you might be wondering what this
does but it basically allows us to
override
Blaz templates so all this stuff that's
in add form is a whole bunch of little
blaze templates there's
a whole bunch of templates in here and
we have access to overriding any of them
you might be wondering how do I find out
what I can override it
well if we head to the meteor guide
which is at guide meteor comm and then
we had to user in accounts you can see
under the customizing templates header
here we can select in this directory on
github this is going to show us every
single template that we have access to
and this should give you a good idea
exactly about all that exists in here so
let's actually check some of this stuff
out right so let's say we have the
password form button and you might
notice that this has some default stuff
here right we have button type submit'
class although it's just essentially a
button with the type of submit and it
has its own classes and IDs and
sometimes we want to write our own
classes right I have my own class system
I don't know what 80 - BTN is and it
doesn't really fit into my plan for a
style sheet so what I want to do is I
actually want to override this template
let's go ahead and head back to our code
and we can come in here you'll notice
that let's actually check out this this
site this is what the button currently
looks like okay now we want this button
to not look like this anymore but we
want this to be the actual primary
button and so if I come in here and
actually modify the CSS we can type in
BTN - primary and give it a space and as
you can see this blue style is what the
primary button style looks like this is
more of a confirmation of more of
affirmative than a red right I don't
know how many times you've seen a login
button be read like that sort of like I
do not enter sort of thing unless the
only colors on the site are red so let's
go ahead and head to our code and then
we can come to our counts folder and
let's go ahead and make a new file now
what I'm going to name this is going to
be over ride and I like to keep my
templates the same as the
template name so @pw form PWD form so we
can say at PWD form BTN and so this is
just for the button itself HTML and
let's make a new template now this
template is going to be also named name
is going to be over ride and then at PWD
form BTN okay now let's go ahead and
just copy everything from the inside of
this template here we probably could
leave you and copy those template tags
and saved us some typing but it's okay
and as you can see I can actually get
rid of this at BTN class and I could get
rid of the submit class I can do all
this stuff but what actually what I do
is just add my class to this so I can do
BTN - primary and now what we want to do
is add a JavaScript file of the same
name it actually looks like I've messed
something up when I created this file so
I'm just going to rename it looks like
it decided to add a whole bunch of stuff
okay so we can see our override at
password form button dot HTML now we
need a JavaScript file this is
essentially going to just tell our
template overriding system to use this
template to override the default so we
can say the same thing over ride - at
PWD form BTN that j/s inside of here we
can say template and then now this is
going to require brackets and a string
and we can pass this in override at PWD
form BTN so we're giving it our
overridden template here and now we can
say dot replaces and now we can pass in
the actual template it's replacing that
of which if you remember as at PWD form
BTN which we grabbed from the github
repo so in one fell swoop here we're
able to override this button permanently
by essentially copying this template
bringing it into our own project
modifying it by adding this class and
then coming to our JavaScript and saying
hey you template override replace the
actual form here let's go ahead and
Ameri phi that this worked here I'm
gonna refresh my topics in meteor page
and let's click the log in and as you
can see recruited with a nice new blue
button and if we inspect our source you
can see that BTN - primary is in fact in
our template just like we liked now if
you head back to the github repo you can
see the @ form that HTML itself right
here this will give you a good idea of
exactly everything in here so we have
add form and we can see that there's an
@ title at Roth @ sep at error at result
all sorts of good stuff in here and we
can really use this as a guide to coming
back here and then you have access to
any of these templates which you can
override so if you're using blaze and
you need to override any of the
templates that already exist in this UI
package you can do so using this method
now in the next video we're gonna talk
more about these variables here and some
of the configuration that you can do so
we're going to be adding new form fields
to this such as name last name we're
going to be changing the text on things
doing something like coming in here and
removing this variable so we're gonna
show you how you can have actually have
access to variables like this quickly
and easily so like I said there's a ton
you can do to customize your user
accounts experience without writing
everything from scratch cool so as you
can see here we now have a more
customized login with this blue button
it's very minor but the ability that we
now have by overwriting templates is
significant so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video hurt me up at Twitter or
Facebook at level up tutorials thanks
for watching and I'll see in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
