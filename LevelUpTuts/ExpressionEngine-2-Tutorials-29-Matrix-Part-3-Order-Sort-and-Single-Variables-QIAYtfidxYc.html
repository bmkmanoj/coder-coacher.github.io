we are going to stay on the pixel and
tonic module for expression engine
called matrix in the last couple videos
we cover just basic uses of it and also
the search functionality in this video
I'm going to show you how to change
around the sort and we're also going to
dip into some of these single variables
this will probably be the last video on
matrix if anybody has any questions any
further questions about matrix be sure
to leave it in the comments on the
YouTube video page and while you're
there remember to subscribe to our
Channel and hop over to Twitter if
you're on Twitter and bobbles the level
up tuts you can follow me at Ben shaft
alright so I've added one more item to
this entry so it's hop over to the entry
are always hopping so we'll see you know
we set up for four different columns or
four different cell types we have a you
know a boolean one that tells us whether
it's a video or an image if it's an
image then were you know having our user
fill out you know upload an image and
give it a caption and if it's a video
you know they're just putting the embed
code into the source otherwise think you
can enable another button but whatever
and one thing that you'll notice here is
that I sort of dragged around these
things these items to reorders remember
we're going to talk about sort so
they're sort and they're ordering by
right so sort really talks about you
know it's basically just like you know a
to z or random or Z to a right those are
like the three options ascending
descending in random what order by
refers to is you know what is the piece
of content that you want to order by and
we can order by any one of these columns
by using the column name so one thing
that I wanted to show was that
you know here we have an image then we
have a video here we have an image here
we have a video we go to the page and
we're seeing this content outputted in
the same order that is presented in the
back of the system I call that natch the
natural order I don't know if that's an
actual technical term or not but you
know go ahead and mean you know when you
use that people should probably know
will probably know what you're talking
about so what we're what we were going
to want to do is change that what will
you want to do when the last video
showed you guys like sort of how to you
know two ways to sort of lump content
together like we we did a conditional
where we said you know I'll put the
images and then output the video and
then we also did separately when we did
that search right we said you know
search through the images and then
search for the video all right so we're
going to do it a little bit differently
this time so we're going to hop over to
again more hopping hop jump over to the
template and let's see here umm I'm
going to do this differently well
actually not well this will be fine so
what we're going to do though is we're
going to say order x equals and say
calorie
so you know it put and put it in you
know the like items are now seeing
together right and if you remember the
value for this was image and then video
so IV so by default you know it's it's
in the ascending order if we want to
change that so here's order by and by
the way you can you can order by more
than one field just using a pipe
delimiter so then we could say sort
equals descending now we should see the
opposite right videos on top images on
the bottom and then the one last thing
on this item is let's get rid of the
order by and like you have a gallery or
something and if you're showing a couple
images actually I'm pretty much doing
the same thing somewhere else but i'll
just show you this think in my right
column i just have it like randomly
putting these images in one order
another so let's see what happens here
seeing video for seeing so we'll see
goes here we have the sublime text video
and then we have the Indy winter and
then we have css3 and then we have speed
of life here let's go better give that a
refresh right totally different order so
there you go so that's a big you know I
could be a cool thing again like you
have a gallery and you wanted to you
know a random one to show up and then go
through like a slideshow or something
like that that that's cool that's easy
to do with this all right so that's that
wraps up you know sort order you could
also you know like I said this is so
similar to the channel Center you can
also do things like limit so if you want
to do
you know random and only have one so the
nd we have one the vide you know here
now we're seeing the sublime video indie
sublime and you know so here's the other
one so there you go that's pretty cool
alright so quickly I want to talk about
the single variables so a single
variable is different than sort of what
we've been doing so far which is the
parameters that you know these are
parameters and you know these are tags
and a single variable you know sort of
is very similar to this right we've
talked about this all over the place
either blah blah blah I don't know I
can't find any good examples right now
but anyway let's do want to know so what
we what we will want to do we'll sit
let's just take away this whole mess and
one of the items is like row ID what row
ID will give you is the you know ID of
the row that that entry belongs to so
let's do that row ID and then we'll do
let's do this row so there's also row
count and then i'll give you one sort of
example of one you would do something
like this row our total rows that's the
other one okay
alright so let's go ahead and do this
update fresh this so so the row what
it's referring to is not um it's not
like one two three four but the way that
they was entered i believe so that's why
we're seeing some discrepancy like now
this one's one this one's three actually
know what no I'm being an idiot what it
um the reason why we're seeing it may be
in this order is because I have this
sort of weird you know if if stuff here
or something but anyway so what you can
do actually if you wanted to limit
something to just one particular row you
could say you know row ID equals this
I've never had to do that what I had to
do is something more like this when I'm
trying to apply a class or something to
the last item what I can say is you know
some can do this if the row count is
equal to the total number of rows right
so there was four total and the number
was four and A four would equal four
then I could apply my you know class of
last or whatever and then don't even put
an else because then we don't even you
know but there's there's no need there's
no need to do that you just put an if
and then close it out so those are just
some of the single variables that you
can use and then lastly the very last
thing on this topic I'll just I'll just
do this 12 repeat thing twice just so
you can see the difference there's a
single pair that you can use and output
this whole field just as a table like
very quickly and you could apply some
you know table stylings to like setting
this
padding and cell spacing and that type
of stuff but I'm just going to roll this
out and sort of like the default way so
here we're seeing you know you know
here's a table head header row and you
know here the values just outputted you
know as a as a table so depending on
what you're doing this you might very
quickly be able to do this and not have
to you know if what you're wanting to
display is very tabular you know that
that might be it like even like a really
light gallery maybe that's all you need
to do so you know here here's the first
instance where I said you know gallery
colon table and then here here it is
again we're repeating it you know where
I'm you know putting this all out sort
of outputted whatever whatever way I
want totally customized on like this one
which is sort of like a prefab output
alright so that's it and that's going to
be it on the matrix add-on for for
expression engine like I said if you
guys have any questions leave it in the
comments if you're curious to know more
they have documentation over on their
website which is pixel and tonic calm
and I think it's just slash matrix so
you can check it out there thanks for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
