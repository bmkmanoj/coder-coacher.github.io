up tutorials and in this video we are
going to talk about conditionals and
we're going to have parent-child
relationships with more than one
component in react so let's get started
on that right now okay so in this video
we're going to accomplish a couple of
things we're gonna create another
component we're gonna pass in a couple
of values and we're going to do some
conditional statements now you might be
used to how you normally do conditional
statements within other things like
angular or any other sort of framework
or anything like that however
conditionals in react you can do them
that way however it's actually a good
practice to do them a little bit
differently so we're going to talk about
that as we get into this video so let's
go ahead and first we're going to create
another component so we have this hello
world create class you know let's go
ahead and just simply copy this I'm
gonna copy this and it's going to be
very similar to this hello world so we
can just leave this as this can be an
individual so this can just be a person
okay for now we're just going to simply
be passing in instead of this type props
that name we're going to actually be
calling our new person inside of here
and pass an name to that now this may
seem overly abstract and sort of
unnecessary especially because we had
hello name coming out here but this is
just really to illustrate how data goes
down through components rather than up
through components right so it's always
going to go from parent to child and not
the other way around so let's go ahead
and have some fun here what we're going
to do is we're going to add another prop
type to this one I'm gonna get rid of
this is required because we don't need
it and we can have comma here and we can
say is person now this is going to be a
react dot prop types dot bool okay so
this is gonna be a boolean now this is
going to decide whether or not this is a
person or not if it's a person we're
going to render hello the person's name
if it's not a person we're going to
render hello
okay so let's go ahead and first deal
with the situation where we're at this
is going to be a person so we want to
say is person is equal to and then now
to make sure that this is an actual
boolean and not a string of true you
have these two brackets and that allows
us to have JavaScript inside of here so
is person is equal to true now let's
work on our person object right and we
can leave this default name that's fine
now in our render statement we don't
want to include hello and any of this
stuff anymore we just simply want this
to be like a span so we can just simply
say span like so so now we're just going
to be rendering this dot props name now
this dot props that name refers to the
name that's passed into person now if we
come up here we can simply say person
and person's name is going to be equal
to and inside of brackets once more this
dot props dot name so to reiterate name
Tim is coming into this initial hello
world from hello world it's then being
passed in to person and then it's going
to be output here
so now let's refresh our page here and
check out what the results are and the
results are a syntax error because I did
not close off this component which you
if you had good eyes you would have seen
that I do not know this is a good
opportunity to mention if you have a
self closing component as in not like
this h1 h1 that has a closing element
here you do need to close your elements
so we do need to say forward slash
greater than otherwise it's going to
give you an error if you don't have this
forward slash okay so back to our
component that's actually typed
correctly and we now see two hello Tim
which is passed in through two
components down from parent to child
okay now let's write some conditional
stuff we want this to only output
person itself if this is declared as a
person so inside of our render function
let's let's go ahead and define a
variable we can just save our greeting
now the default value for greeting is
just going to be simply a string of
world okay now let's go ahead and write
our conditional and what we can say is
now keep in mind I'm writing this out in
sort of a long form just to make this
very very obvious here we could say if
this dot props dot is person then we're
going to be having the greeting is
actually equal to now this is the fun
part what we can do is have two
parentheses here and we can paste in
person's name here I'm going to cut this
from here and say person's name so now
here within our hello what we can simply
have is bracket bracket like so and we
can say greeting so by having greeting
inside of these brackets it's using the
variable here greeting and if if this
step props that is person was equal to
false it would never set this to this
person's name now you might be wondering
why the heck would we do it this way
instead of having the conditional inside
of our template or inside of our return
statement or something like that well
this way the return is what's rendered
and if we don't need to render the
person component which is an entirely
another component we don't have to we
would only be rendering a string so if
this step props that is person is equal
to false it's it's not going to go
through the process of rendering this
component at all this person component
so to verify this is working head to our
browser refresh it still says hello Tim
if we were to come back to our code
let's head down here is person false
let's say this is false this is not even
close okay false it's not a person we
refresh
and even though we're passing in Tim and
Tim is being passed down it is rendering
hello world because of that conditional
okay so we now have Illustrated
conditionals in our JSX
and we have some parent-child passing of
props so so keep watching as we grow our
react skills into something a bit more
practical in the next few videos as
always this is Scott with of log
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a come in the video herd
me up at Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials I'd love to hear from you also
if you helped feel like supporting level
up tutorials check out a level of a per
oh it's a subscription service from
level up tutorials that right now just
allows you to view the site without ads
and allows to download videos however in
the very near future as in later this
week there is going to be premium
content available for level up pro users
and the premium content is only going to
grow monthly so as always thanks for
watching and i'll see in the next one
