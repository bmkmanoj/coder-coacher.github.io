of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
some of my favorite features about
sublime text - and this is the multi
select so if you're familiar with
textmate - that this feature might be
very welcome and at home it might be
something you're totally used to but
there is a little bit of a difference in
the version that sublime text as that's
really cool so I'm going to get started
with the most basic usage let's say you
have an unordered list right you want to
make it on our list here you do a ul and
we'll close it up right here and you've
got to make a list item you have to type
it out type your stuff let's tie them
close it okay next one well what
happened you know what if you wanted to
have let's say 5 list items and or 10
list items you had to do this a whole
bunch it just be a pain right so if I do
a space here and then do a bunch of
spaces so I'm gonna have my cursor here
I'm gonna hold down the option key then
I'm going to drag down and you're going
to see this cursor lines up like this
well that's really cool because what we
can do now is we could start typing li
and then we can do a close list item and
here we just made a whole bunch of list
items tab these all over and let's say
you had anchors in here well now you can
even start with an anchor and you can
type all this stuff and it will save you
so much time now all you have to do is
go in and fill out your list items
individually yes ok
and let's say these are all going to be
like a pound sign you can click here
again hold option go down shift pound
really cool right
so it allows you to edit multiple lines
at once well let's say I came in here
and I made maybe a similar mistake on
also to these lines say I have a space
randomly inside of here and none of them
want none of them needed to do that well
there's another way you can use this
multiple select by holding the command
key instead of the
Shiki we're going to hold command and
we'll have the curse make sure you have
the cursor somewhere where you'd want it
to be hold command and I'm going to
click here in front of this space here
in front of this space here from this
space and then in front of all of my
spaces and you'll notice that it's
creating multiple cursors on the screen
if we're likewise if we were to start to
type it would start to type or if we
delete it's going to delete get rid of
that all of our spaces at once even
though they're not in a straight line
and yet still if I wanted to get rid of
all this stuff I don't like it anymore I
can just hold option drag down and
here's my cursors or I can grab it in a
big old selection like this let's say if
I wanted to get rid of most of these
anchors I could do it like this get rid
of a lot of these anchors just by
holding the option key selecting and
dragging and really I find myself using
this all the time and I'm gonna use the
command to get all these out of here
command go ahead okay Wow okay perfect I
get one they're going to adhere but yeah
so this is multiple selection and it
comes in really handy
just like wise if you're doing a find
and replace like if we do a command
option F and we're going to find Li what
it's going to do if we click find all it
actually selects the multiple selectors
in front of these items so if I did
located command option F and then
clicked find all that's how it puts this
multiple selectors in front of all of
the list items on the page and then from
here I can type backspace and it's going
to get rid of them or I can just keep
typing like this and it's eventually
going to go down and then they're gone
and let's say if we wanted these to be
oh I have turns out there's an Li up
here but let's say these are span we
want these to be spam tags now it's
typing it up there as well which is
great but perfect so this is multiple
selection in sublime text - and you can
use on all sorts of ways it comes in
really handy all the time so check it
out let me know to think as always this
is Scott with level up Tut's
