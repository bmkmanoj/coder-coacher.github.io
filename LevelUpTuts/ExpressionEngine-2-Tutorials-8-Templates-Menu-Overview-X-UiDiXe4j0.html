level-up Tut's today we're going to
level up our expression engine skills by
covering the design tab and so let's go
ahead and start so we're going to look
we're already logged into our expression
engine two incidents I'm gonna go under
design and i'm just going to hover over
templates just we can see the options
here so there's a template manager from
there that's where you manage the
templates and template groups
synchronize templates when you create a
template you have the option to save it
as a text file on your server and the
advantage that is then you could use
your favorite text editor to edit the
file you're not stuck using the built-in
editor which is a little bit clunky but
still improved upon where it was
expressionengine one so synchronize
templates once you click that it will
look to your server and synchronize what
puts in the system to what's sitting on
your ftp snippets what that is is what
you can imagine little pieces of code
that maybe you were used over and over
throughout the site maybe it's a menu or
something like that or maybe your footer
is always the same stuff like that can
go into a system as a snippet global
variables those are variables that will
then be available throughout the
templates so there are actually quite a
few global variables that are already
provided by the system you can see a
list of them on expression gin
documentation some that I used
frequently our site name and site URL
maybe a home page and so and then I'll
certainly in bed but you can also define
your own templo bowl two variables
within that menu temple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
