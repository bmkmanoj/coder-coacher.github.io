up tutorials in the last video we talked
about editing and now we're going to be
talking about sort of a counterpart to
editing which is revisions let's say
somebody makes a bold change it to some
content and you want to go back and go
back to a previous revision so let's get
started on that right now so now let's
talk about revisionists let's say you
have a couple of workers and different
people are working on the about Us page
and somebody comes in and they decide
that this blog post are this about page
maybe this whole first paragraph doesn't
need to be here so they click create a
new revision and say removes first
paragraph now from here they come in and
let's actually remove the first
paragraph so they've deleted the first
paragraph and saved and published so now
we have an about Us page that's missing
the first paragraph somebody then sees
the site and says oh no we need that
first paragraph that was actually a
mistake to remove it well luckily
because they checked that make revision
box you now have this revisions tab
right here and anyone can come in and
say revisions and you can see the
different revisions so the current
version removes the first paragraph
however the previous version is here
with the revert button we can also
delete that older revision if it's now
out of date and we never ever going to
go back to it let's go ahead and select
revert and it gives you a confirmation
now upon reverting we now have a new
revision being logged it actually loves
us as going back to that previous
revision now this is really cool when we
click view on the page our first
paragraph is back and if we see revision
so we can see exactly that the admin
originally made the post then the admin
removed the first paragraph and then the
admin reverted back now if you had
multiple users working on the site you
would see their different user names and
you would be able to keep
track of who did what that way in case
that person needs extra training you
could go and talk to them or maybe you
just wanted to see who in fact and made
that edit perfect so we now have a nice
revision assistant and in by Drupal it's
out of the box we didn't have to turn on
any extensions to get revision to work
and this is a great improvement to
Drupal overall so as always this is
Scott would level up tutorials if you
