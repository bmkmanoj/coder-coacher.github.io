up tuts and today we're going to show
you how you can use the iOS design kit
that comes in sketch 3 to be able to
quickly mock-up iPhone apps with all of
the basic system UI information already
pre created as symbols so that we can
just drag and drop them and modify them
directly in our project it's extremely
handy for creating mock-ups and testing
out new layouts and designs so check it
out we're going to get started so in the
last video we introduced you to symbols
and we made our own and we got to use
them and that's awesome you could create
your entire own library of symbols if
you wanted to luckily a sketch 3includes
a UI kit for iOS and what this
essentially includes is a whole bunch of
symbols from the iOS user interface so
let's get started by selecting file and
let's go new from template now we're
going to select iOS UI design and you
can see it gives us some brief
instructions basically it's just telling
us we have our document structure
there's the Welcome page and the
collection of symbols basically you can
use a whole bunch of symbols and
textiles that are basically for the iOS
pre-determined user interface guidelines
so it's saying to remove this pane when
you are done with it so we can just go
ahead and delete this pane let's delete
the layers uh I should have said delete
layers delete the layers now let's
delete this iPhone kit stuff up here and
we can start in this artboard that says
start here so now let's get into adding
some symbols and you can really see how
a sketch threes symbol uikit is just
totally powerful for this so going ahead
we're gonna go to symbol
and now we have a whole bunch of options
we have controls icon shapes keyboards
we have navigation bar status bar and
alerts so let's go ahead and add a black
status bar and we can just drag this up
top here okay in fact we can select this
and tell it to be at position zero zero
now let's add another symbol we're going
to want that to be the navigation bar
and let's have it be a navigation just a
normal nav bar here and you'll notice
this actually includes a status bar so
let's go ahead and remove the status bar
and click here put this in position zero
zero perfect so as you can see what you
really can do is just drop in a whole
bunch of these symbols and get going cuz
this I mean this is a good start already
we would have had to find something from
the internet and drag it in here but now
we have all of these items from scratch
and we can go ahead and do something
like change this menu bar title we can
have it just be our app so we can just
say level up tuts
I know I just use the word level up tuts
for any example but I mean it works so
we now have this this heading bar and we
can do things like change the background
cool so now let's get adding some more
stuff let's drop in a keyboard here so
let's go to symbols and then let's add
in a keyboard and let's just be the
normal keyboard let's throw it in here
we can say the position 2x Bish's x
position is going to be 0 and we just
want this to sink down here at the
bottom
perfect okay so this is beginning to
look like a nice little mock-up and
let's say we're doing maybe like a
settings page or something so let's
throw in just one more item it's going
to be a section with a switch on and we
can have this just here position to the
zero on the x-axis and you can see that
basically we have these items from the
iOS UI drag and drop and you can just
start styling your app that way now
what's really great is if we go ahead
and make a duplicate of this now with
that duplication we can go ahead and
remove things like the keyboard from
this one and you know whatever now we
have a bank blanks light for this other
layout so you can do that in mock-up
your entire app using these UI tools so
there's really not much to these UI
tools other than that they are symbols
and then there are text styles so we can
add a text style really quick let's just
say a button Center and I mean it's
really it's really that simple it's just
the iOS textile basically the stuff that
you're used to so the tools you're
presented with here give you more than
enough for a starting off jumping-off
point for either mocking up or designing
your entire app so this is the iOS UI
kit it comes with sketch 3 check it out
play around with it throw some stuff on
a canvas and just see what you can
create maybe inspire yourself to
actually create this app that you've
been thinking about making so as always
this is Scoville level of Tut's if you
have any questions or comments like a
calm in the video or hit us up at
Twitter or Facebook pretty much anywhere
we love to hear from you thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
