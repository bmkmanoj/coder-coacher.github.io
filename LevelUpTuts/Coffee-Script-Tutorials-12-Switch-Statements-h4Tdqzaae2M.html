tuts and today i'm going to show you how
to do nice and easy really cool switch
statements using CoffeeScript and just
like everything else coffeescript makes
switch statements even better so switch
statements in JavaScript or you know not
the best you have to make sure to have
the break at the end of each case or
else it's going to go through to your
default case and it's just really not
the it's just really not ideal compared
to the CoffeeScript solution okay so in
a typical switch statement you'd be
testing something like a variable let's
say colors right so let's say we want to
do switch and then in JavaScript you do
you know your your argument that you're
testing and then brackets case blue and
then I'm sorry and then whatever you do
for blue okay whatever you whatever you
want to do and then you have to do a
break this needs to be tapped over okay
so yeah so you'd have to you know do
something right well this is this is
fine i mean is how you've always done
switch statements in JavaScript when
coffeescript it's really great you can
say switch and then we're just going to
say colors and next line tapped over
we're going to have wind so now you're
going to be testing it's sort of almost
more like speaking just like how the
conditionals are with a copy script you
can say when the color is say blue then
and you can it do something right let's
say you want to alert blue you can alert
blue okay also you could say when green
then let's say name equals
marine so I just changed my name to
green when the color is green okay so I
think you get the idea it's just like a
switch statement instead of having a
case and then having what you do and
then having to write a break you're
saying when something when the color is
one of these options then do something
pretty straightforward right you can
even test for multiples you could say
when black comma sorry comma brown so
this is testing if it's black or brown
and then let's say you want to do
something special if it's black you just
say if black if I'm sorry if color
colors is equal to black and alert black
okay and
and actually I didn't notice i didn't
have quotes around this blue okay so
let's also set name is equal to brown
black okay so here it's saying if it's
black or brown you can test if it's
black if it's black that's going to
alert black but either way it's going to
set this name is equal to brown / black
so you can just have something extra in
there and then now just like if
statements before you know you had your
default statement but the way that
CoffeeScript treats switch statements is
you'd have an else statement so you're
saying you know when blue than alert
blue whatever wind green to do something
when black then do something else and
then you can say alert no color so this
is 8 switch statement in CoffeeScript
let's take a look at what it outputs in
your JavaScript and it should be exactly
what you would expect and it looks like
I actually have an air of get an arrow
so i have this colon in here i don't
know why that got in there let's save it
okay now we're good check it out where
is it so this is your pretty standard
switch statement switch color case blue
alert blue break case Green name equals
green break case black or brown if color
is equal to black alert black either way
set name brown or black default is alert
of colors so that's exactly what you
would expect that is how a normal switch
statement is written okay so this is
nice and easy really good-looking switch
statements in CoffeeScript if you have
any questions or comments please leave a
comment on the video hit us up a Twitter
level of Tut's let us know what you're
thinking like I said a few tutorials ago
there's going to be a lot more tutorials
coming very soon this next month all
sorts of stuff is going to come out as
always subscribe if you want to see more
