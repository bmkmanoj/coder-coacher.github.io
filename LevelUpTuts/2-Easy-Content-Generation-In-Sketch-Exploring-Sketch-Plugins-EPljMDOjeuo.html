up tutorials and today we're gonna be
covering another sketch plugin that
allows for quick and easy placeholder
content
this one's content generator now content
generator does more than just bring in
images it doesn't necessarily have the
control like we had with a day player
where you could say bring in photos of
Nicolas Cage but it does allow you to
quickly add a lot of user photos text
that kind of thing so let's get going by
installing content generator so let's
head over to our sketch tool box this is
how we like to install plugins it's nice
and easy and if we search for content
you'll see it's showing up as the first
one let's go ahead and select this okay
so now that it's done installing what's
it open up sketch and check it out so it
out here is just a real basic art board
with nothing on it but let's say we're
making some sort of a chat app and we
have these circular heads that are going
to be indicating who's chatting so what
I'm gonna go ahead and do is insert a
and new oval just by hitting o holding a
shift and then making a circle now from
here I can duplicate this by just doing
command E or you can hold option and
drag and create another one so as you
can see I'm just making a bunch here and
okay let's go ahead and select all of
these and then from here I'm going to
vertically align them I'm going to
evenly distribute them and that should
be good
however because this is a chat let's
have some people responding just by
shifting over a few pixels like so okay
and let's actually add some text here we
can just have this be named my name okay
make sure this is not white so we can
actually see it make it something like
18 pixels okay
and once again duplicate all these I
could have actually done this before we
did the circles but that's alright it's
not like this took too much time
so as you can see we have these all
pretty evenly distributed I'm not going
for perfection here anything this is
just a quick demo what we can do here is
now is select Elise circles right and
let's come to plugins content generator
now you'll notice we have some options
we have geo which we're going to show
you in a second we have persona which
can get you details like an email or
phone we can get names male or female
and then we can get photos male or
female if you come to photos we can also
get all sorts of different kinds of
photos like my photos music artists
nature and urban and text we can get
some dummy text well we want these to be
profile photos so let's go to persona
photos and let's just go to mail okay so
we now have a bunch of faces that these
people are going to be the ones
commenting on our work and since they
don't necessarily have names that are my
name let's go ahead and select all these
text layers and then select plugins
content creator or content generator
persona names and let's just do mail
okay and as you can see we now have all
these male names some of them are
getting pushed a to line so let's make
these like so so all of this content
came out of nowhere and we didn't have
to make it asked these borders on these
I'm gonna get rid of the borders there
we go cool and as you can see it added
these images as fills to the oval
instead of having to do masks so that
works out nice for us but let's say we
have a sudden we don't want these all to
be male let's go ahead and select one of
these right here and I'll select this
photo let's select a couple of them
actually and we're going to make these
be female so what we can do is plugins
again content generator photos and her
persona and then photos and let's just
click female and it's now replaced them
we can do the same with the names so
let's select these content generator
persona names and let's look female okay
so we now have a couple of different
options here and we've brought in all
this content without having to do
anything so what kind of other
information can we get let's actually go
ahead and just create a new text box
it's gonna have nothing I'm just gonna
leave it as this type something
when we can select this and come to our
plugins if we wanted to get some
geographical information let's just say
a random city in the ended States we
just click city and as you can see it's
given ask Washington which is actually
also a state so let's try again and get
another city so we can do geo USA City
and as you can see it's just grabbing us
another city so this is really nice in
handy if you need to generate faking of
information in this way as well now
let's say we wanted larger blocks of
text for instance these people are going
to be chatting maybe we want them to
have chat text that's longer than just
one a couple words here so we can select
this text once more and let's go to
plugins content to create our text and
let's come to dummy text and you can see
we have filler ah tea hipster up some
lorem ipsum all that sort of stuff so we
can actually throw in hipster em some
and we can say generate here and as you
can see we have all of this hipster
Epsom we can modify as we need let's go
ahead and get rid of some of this text
here
let's get rid of some of this text here
and let's go ahead and make it a couple
of points smaller and this isn't the
most beautiful design ever but that's
quite alright because this is just a
demo and let's duplicate these down here
like so and once again we can select
them all we can align them horizontally
we can space them vertically like that
and it's really not that perfect but we
can spend time aligning this later now
you'll notice here that this suffers
from the problem of now we just do play
all these paragraphs and this is really
sort of not being the point of having
really good dummy content because it it
just looks like the same thing copied
and pasted let's go ahead and select
this all and then once more come to
plugins generated content text dummy
text now this time let's actually try
something different but instead of you
didn't generate let's do replace now you
can see with root places even though
some of them are the same it's changed
up quite a bit of them and what's good
about this is it's kept these the same
length if we were to beating generate it
would be adding a whole ton of text here
just like we had that we had to trim up
so the replace is keeping the text
length the same but giving us access to
a wider range of text here so as you can
see content generator is super powerful
for getting your content into your
mock-up really super quickly it also
feels quite a bit better than just
grabbing the same lorem ipsum text or
using the same photos or perhaps even
just rectangles or circles instead of
photos themselves so I hope you find
content generally useful when using
sketch I've been using it all the time
in my mock-ups so check it out its
content generator you can get it in the
sketch toolbox or you can download it
from the github page itself which is
content generator sketch plug-in I can
always leave a link to that in the
description of the video so as always
this is Scott will level up tutorials if
you have any questions or comments leave
a comment a video or his stuff at
twitter facebook at level up tuts we
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
