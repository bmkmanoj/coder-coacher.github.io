information let's talk about how we can
work with shapes further in fact we can
combine shapes to make new ones let's
say we hated this arrow which I
certainly do let's go ahead and actually
create our own arrow so first what we
want to do is get rid of this and I'm
going to take this rectangle and I'm
going to take this triangle and I'm
going to lay one on top of another and
let's adjust this a little bit now if
you hold shift and select the side here
right the side square when you click and
drag you'll notice it keeps its shape
well that's not necessarily what we want
I'm gonna hit command Z get this back to
where we want we just want to increase
the width of this triangle overall or at
least the base of this triangle so let's
go ahead we can select this how can we
make this shape just wider well we can
do so a couple of ways if we were to
hold the Alt key you'll notice it has
some red lines these are often used for
measuring of which we'll get into when
we get into more more practical
techniques but if I hold the Alt key or
option key
that's it should say option alt on your
keyboard you can go ahead and click this
square here and it's going to allow you
to adjust the width while not changing
any locations of anything like that and
it's adjusting both sides equally out
from the center so you can see here we
can get this just about right to where
we want it to look now let's go ahead
and click and drag select both of these
and I'm going to remove any sort of
border now I'm also going to change the
color we're just going to make this
let's make this default blue color
because it's a nice color we can select
this blue right here okay so we have a
nice nice looking blue arrow much nicer
looking than the arrow that we would
have gotten doing this through sketches
own arrows tool but the problem is is we
click this whatever it moves now we
could always do something like this
where we select both of them and we
could come in and do command G to group
them which
puts them into a folder together so now
anytime we select this it moves as an
arrow but that's not good enough because
really what's happening here is it's
it's essentially just two shapes inside
of a folder right it combines two shapes
here and if we were to want to do let's
say a border around the entire shape we
could add this border we get this funky
border that's actually the bottom border
of the triangle here it's ugly
let's uncheck this checkbox right here
let's select both of these again I'm
actually going to remove these from a
group you can do that by selecting the
group holding command shift G okay
so command G to group command shift G to
ungroup now we have our triangle both
items are selected here now let's come
up top here to our toolbar where we have
some tools now up top we have these four
different merging layer tools we have
Union we have subtract we have intersect
and we have difference if you were to
guess which one we would like to use
please do so now what we're going to be
using is the Union tool now the Union
tool is going to take both of these
shapes and combine their geometry so
you'll notice when I hit Union like that
instead of a folder while we do still
have an arrow where we can access both
the triangle and the rectangle we now
have what's considered a combined shape
in fact if we were to double click in
fact the reason why that's different is
instead of a folder where we just have
everything grouped together we now have
some options over in our tool bar where
we can modify the fill of the entire
shape we can make this this teal color
this yellowish green this purple
whatever but as you can see it's filling
in the entire shape and not just what
would be the the two separate shapes
individually this is immediately
apparent if we add let's say a black
border to this thing it's going to be
ugly but I can bump up the thickness I'm
going to hold shift and hit up maybe
bump this down to 10 and as you can see
now our border is now within the two
shapes together and follows it around
and no more ugly border from the
triangle and both the rectangle and this
is also going to apply to things like
drop shadows or inner shadows or blurs
right if we add a drop shadow on this
increase the blur here you can see it is
of the entire shape no overlapping or
anything now I just added a shadow
really quickly which is something that
we're going to be doing a lot more of
and I didn't really cover it too
extensively and I might be doing that a
lot through this series right we're
going to do something maybe once and
we're going to go back over it later but
all you need to know is that you add a
shadow where it says shadows on the
right you just simply click Plus same
thing for inner shadows you just click
plus and then here you have options to a
whole bunch of tools now how do we get
rid of shadows let's say we're checking
these and adding a whole bunch more
click the check box then click the trash
check box trash check box trash that's
how you get rid of a shadow let's go
ahead and get rid of the shadow check
box trash okay so now that that shadow
is gone we now have our combined shape
now if we want to make a shape that's
essentially a donut what we can do is
let's create two regular ovals I'm going
to create one oval I'm going to click
off of it hit Oh again and create
another oval with both of these ovals
selected we're going to use our
alignment tools which we're going to be
getting into more in-depth in a minute
where we're going to hit this one with
the align horizontally when we hover
over it it looks like two bars with a
straight line down the middle and then
we're going to do the exact same thing
horizontally or vertically where it's
two vertical lines of the line down the
middle and you can see that these two
shapes are perfectly aligned within one
another and we can hit subtract now
let's head back up to our union tools or
our combination for shapes and let's go
ahead and click subtract you can see we
now have the donut shape and where the
shape again if we were to change the
border the border is going to be the
border of the
on itself and not necessarily both
shapes individually you can see this
totally cut out if we were to take the
shape and lay it on top the center here
is completely Hollow so as you can see
we have a hollow center because it's
physically cut out one shape from
another now in addition to Union we also
have intersect in difference we can
quickly illustrate those by aligning two
shapes selecting them click intersect
you can see that the only thing we have
left is the two points is the points in
which those two shapes intersect and
those are our new shapes now difference
is the exact opposite it's just going to
cut out the middle so the parts where
they line up it's going to cut it out
however you'll notice we have some
interesting stuff with the borders going
on let's actually go back and let's do
the intersect now what I want to do is
after the fact this shape isn't exactly
what I'm looking for
I'm going to come over here to my layers
open up this drop-down and you now have
access to each of these shapes
individually and we can select this oval
and using the keyboard I'm going to hit
over to the right and you can see I'm
modifying what is the actual
intersection of these two shapes you can
now click off and just like that we
still have this shape now you could do
that with the borders and everything
intact in fact we could adjust the base
sides of our triangle let's say this
base is no longer it's too skinny right
it's not going to hold it up that top is
too tall let's go ahead and select the
rectangle right here I'm going to hold
the Alt key I'm going to grab the square
here and I'm going to increase the base
size and that looks a little bit more
natural so as you can see here we've
done quite a bit using Union subtract
intersect and difference and we've come
and we've created a more complex shape
that we can now use all over our project
we can style certain ways if we'd like
and we can use it all over our project
so you'll be doing a lot of shape
combination when you're creating more
complex shapes and maybe you're creating
like let's say SVG I
Conn's or something like that this is
going to be how you could do that right
you're going to be creating a bunch of
simple shapes and then combining them
another way that you're going to want to
create this stuff is through use of the
vector tool so in the next video we're
going to be covering the vector tool
which is a standard feature in so many
other illustration applications and
something you're gonna wanna you're
going to want to at least use to be able
to use proficiently let alone to master
if you want to become really great at
creating illustrations within sketch so
fire up the next video as we learn the
vector tool if you would like to
purchase this series and see the rest of
it we're going to be doing three full
chapters of sketch tutorials basically
taking you through everything you need
to know from basic examples and sort of
foundational knowledge to actually
building real world application designs
and using real world techniques that
you'll see in the office so check it out
