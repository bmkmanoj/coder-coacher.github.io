tutorials and I know there's a lot of
what is Wednesday topics they want to
cover and for instance the next what is
Wednesday is going to be on redux I'm
gonna get into some graph QL Apollo that
kind of stuff but for this one I wanted
to take some time to talk about parcel
which is a new application bundler and
this was sort of making the rounds last
week or a couple weeks ago and so I
wanted to do a what is parcel to sort of
go along with our what is web pack video
now what is parcel simply put its a
simple bundler and I kind of hate the
word bundler even though it's accurate
right because so many people are used to
hearing build tool you know you would
use things like even code kit you could
consider to be a build tool even though
it's an application you've used things
like gulp and grunt and all that stuff
and you've written all of these config
files and what is a build tool well it's
something that takes all of your
different parts of your website from
images to HTML files to JavaScript and
CSS preprocessor files like sass or less
oh and what it does is it converts it
into different bundles right whether
it's a development bundle that you can
work on and see your progress in a
browser or a production bundle that's
all minified and ready to go so that
it's as small as possible simply put it
takes your files of your website and
turns them into something that browsers
can totally understand because the
browser can't understand the sass file
in the browsers on different you know
JavaScript configurations maybe can't
understand some of the latest and
greatest JavaScript es6 features or
something like that so this build tool
is basically going to take all of your
JavaScript files all of your HTML files
CSS files all that stuff and combine
them in the ways that you have them
imported and exported and it's going to
minify them and it's going to allow you
to use modern features you could compare
this to like I said code kit which is an
application and less of like a build
tool but more importantly you could
compare to a web pack a gulp or grunt
just without the configuration steps
but Parcel aims to be a super-fast
zero configuration build tool that's
supposed to create really small bundles
quickly now they have some comparisons
about their build times and stuff like
that and I'm not necessarily willing to
say that parcel is the fastest or best
date you can see the nine seconds
compared to 20 seconds because this tool
is still new and I haven't used it on
any major big projects but the whole
goal of parcel here is to be 0 config
code splitting module replacement bundle
all your assets without writing config
files and it it seems to deliver on that
promise in the best possible way so you
may have heard west boss and I on the
syntax podcast if you aren't a listener
check out syntax FM talked about the
future being build tools that don't
require a ton of configuration and this
really falls in line here which is why I
kind of wanted to do this video really
quickly because this in my opinion is
the future of build tools we get access
to well
bundle all of your stuff install this
thing and just get up and running for
instance to use parcel all you need to
do is load your script and pretty much
it right we get access to importing and
all sorts of exporting and all the sort
of stuff that we want to do in
JavaScript and modern web applications
but we don't have to configure and we
don't have to tell it to use babel we
don't have to tell it to use post CSS or
any of that stuff so parcels really
super cool in my opinion because it's
really just the future of this kind of
build tool and i can't wait to see more
stuff like this so parcel Jas org this
is not an advertisement or anything like
that I have no connection to parcel at
all I just think it's a really cool
thing 0 config bundle build tool
whatever you want to call it and there's
even some advanced features if you want
to know how it works you want to change
your asset types you want to change what
kind of packagers you can write
configuration with this thing if you
want but for the most part the killer
feature of parcel is the house
it is to just get up load your script
and get going now I'm going to try to
use this on a whole bunch of stuff
because how many times if you wanted to
just get up and running with a quick
project whether it's react or whatever
right and it doesn't have to be reacted
it can be any sort of JavaScript or even
just HTML with a little bit of
JavaScript I mean imagine that you're
doing a basic HTML page you're using a
little bit of JavaScript and you want to
use modern j/s features you'd have to
get set up with web pack and es6 or
whatever or gulp you'd have to do all
your build tool just to be able to make
sure that your java scripts compiles
down to browsers that understand what
this it makes that SuperDuper effortless
and again I'm so excited to see how
tools like this evolve so check it out
parcel Jas org
what is parcel it is a zero
configuration web application bundler
it's a build tool it's a build tool that
does everything for you without having
to write a bunch of config so check it
out as always this is Scott what level
of tutorials I just wrapped on the and I
wrapped I mean completed the recording
of the Redux and react for everyone's
series and that is going to be released
sometime later this month hopefully very
soon and that series let me tell you is
one of my best yet so if you want to
become a LevelUp pro and get access to
that series or purchase it when it comes
out hand on over to level up tutorials
comm forward slash door and become a pro
or you know check out anything that I
have for sale there it helps me create
free tutorials I got a whole bunch of
stuff coming I promise there's new
Gatsby videos I'm going to be doing some
stuff on get in a whole bunch of new new
react packaged videos so thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
