of Tut's and in this video we're going
to continue talking about context and I
want to talk about adding on to context
so what's great about this extension is
that not only does the functionality
that comes with it insanely powerful but
it also is extremely add-on a bulb so
basically if you go to drupal.org and
you search for context you're going to
see a whole lot of modules that work
with context to do all sorts of stuff
and by all means just go through and see
it because there's a whole ton and you
can really accomplish some great stuff
so if you're looking for something that
changes your site contextually by all
means search for it under context on
drupal.org and you might find it so to
illustrate how useful these can be I'm
actually going to be using an extension
called a module called context no title
so context and you can see I have
installed this context no title module
and it's pretty cool because really what
it's going to allow us to do is just to
say hey on this page don't display the
title so you know that actually could be
very useful because maybe on the about
page I don't want this big title that
just is about I just wanted to say you
know hi my name is or hi I am so let's
get started creating a context so let's
go to structure context and I can click
Add just from this menu but you can go
to context and click add yourself just
like we did in the last video and the
name for this is just going to be know
about title and title I'll just give it
a tag of title removes title from about
okay and now for its conditions I'm
going to click Pat and again I'm just
going to say in the about path and the
reaction is now going to be no title and
page
and all I have to do is check this box
that says no title on this page save it
now let's come to our page and refresh
and there there's no more title it's
doing things that you would normally
have to I know in the past without
context maybe I would have overridden
the template for this particular node to
just remove the title and so this allows
you to not have to remove in overwrite
template files and things like that
you can just do it all within Drupal's
interface which is really nice because
it can become very flexible if you're
building off paths or on views or
whatever and you don't have to worry
about you know this is node number one
and this is actually know number one so
this is you know you wouldn't have to
worry about editing node template number
one so this is how awesome context is
you can take this and expand upon it to
do even things like just removing the
time on the page without having to go
into a template file so this is a really
basic example go to drupal.org and
search for context and just go through
it and see all of the context extensions
that you can add on and just see how
they can do awesome things for you in
the next video we're gonna go over
context with Omega and Delta which is
another module used with context and the
Omega theme to be able to change
completely new themes so it's awesome
it's pretty cool so check that out as
always if you have any questions and
it's up at Twitter on Facebook we're
always looking to hear from you
