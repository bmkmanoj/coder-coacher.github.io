what I want to show in this video is
some of the amazing get features for
instance right now this app is not being
tracked we do have a good ignore already
here but we do not have any repo
initialized now one of the cool things
about this application is that we can
come in here and simply just you'll
notice by clicking on this logo over
here which is our source control you
could choose your source control ours is
currently set to get that's the only
thing we have installed and we can just
click initialize repository now by
clicking initialize repository it's
basically showing us all of the tract
and untracked files now what we could do
is we maybe want to start adding and
tracking some files so if we want to
stage all of our changes we could just
click this plus and if there are
anything we don't want in there we could
always click this - what is giving is a
beautiful interface for all of our
different changes in get files right so
this point everything has been added
there's nothing here that I don't want
to add no settings or something like
that that shouldn't be made public and
what I want to do is type a message
which is just initial and after having a
commit message I can just click this
check box or of course command to enter
like it says here and it commits and
just like that all of these files are
being tracked so now what's interesting
is that without us doing anything let's
see when I make modifications this file
and I save it you can now see that app
j/s has an M next to it as it's been
modified so we didn't have to do
anything in get features are right in
here right we didn't have to do anything
for this now let's say we wanted to
change this we can add in a just a new
constant variable down here Const test
is equal to hi I'm obviously going to
delete this later because this code is
for another series but you can see we
have this being added here and now it's
the fun
parts we can actually let's say we want
to see what changed from the last commit
to this file maybe something went wrong
here the codes not working we knew it
worked in the last commit so I can click
this open changes right here which is in
the top right now let's close the git
menu over here and brilliantly we have
this beautiful interface for sort of
seeing what's changed here you can see I
added a line right here in addition I
added this line now this is in addition
to just being really cool it's a great
way to see exactly face to face what's
going on in your files
we can even toggle through next change
and previous change that way I can go
through and maybe delete something if I
need it now I can close this and you'll
notice it gets rid of that entirely now
we want to commit this change we simply
just come to our tab here and we can say
adds test bar okay ctrl enter and it
committed now one really cool thing is
we can actually branch our code really
nicely to simply by coming down here
you'll notice we now have this master
which wasn't there before so we can
check out a new branch directly from
here and let's say we don't have a new
branch let's say we wanted to have
staging you'll notice it's not going to
let us do this so how do we add a new
branch well we can come in here click
these three dots in our source control
and you'll see we still don't have any
sort of branching stuff here so so where
could this be well one thing you'll
notice about this particular application
is that you'll access a lot of stuff
through what would be this actions menu
where we can do shift command P and now
I can say get and you'll see all of
these different different get functions
in here right pretty much anything we
need to do will be inside of here and
that's not even just forget that's for
vyas code entirely so command shift P is
a command you're going to want to learn
to use a whole lot now from this point
check out to is going to be the same as
just clicking on this what we want to do
is create branch we can have a new
branch which is going to be staging
enter now you'll see we have our staging
branch I can make some changes to this
code I can come in here I can jump
quickly between our two branches by
selecting master here we're now in the
master branch what's beautiful about
this is vs code is always going to tell
you what branch you're on so that's
really super nice now let's go ahead and
make a change to the staging I'm going
to simply delete this test variable and
delete this line I'm going to save this
file and say removes test var ok we can
click the check box now I want to move
this into our master branch
so let's have to master by clicking the
word staging then select master now I'm
in the master branch you can see our
files are back and we could come in here
and do command shift P and do git and
let's look for merge it's not in here so
one of the bummers here is that we don't
have access to get merge now there's a
couple of ways around this we could open
up our terminal and we could do so by
using control and then the tilde and you
can see we have our terminal here where
we could notice that we're on the master
branch and from here we could always
just type our get merge and then the
staging and as you can see if we close
this control tilde it's gone so just
like that it's a bummer that v/s code
does not have built-in merging tools
because all of the other get stuff is so
solid right like I mean just to have a
git merge in here would be really just
super nice but what's cool about Diaz
code is that when it doesn't have
something like that and you know that
mean that's something you could do via
terminal anyways we could always just do
control tilde open up our terminal and
get it done the old-fashioned way so
certainly a bummer there that the the
interface doesn't have a git merge but
having access to the terminal works
really really nicely instead ok so these
are some of the get features in vs code
now in another video I'm going to be
going over some extensions to make they
get features even better like a get
Gutter type of thing and a few more
things where we can see the history of
all of your files and merges and stuff
like that there's a whole bunch of stuff
that is really nice with vias code
extensions and get so keep watching as
we continue to explore some of es codes
best feature as we dive into more
extensions theming key bindings and more
so as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment in the video
hit me up at Twitter or Facebook a level
up tutorials thanks so much for watching
if you want to help support free
tutorials head over to story level up
tutorials comm and check out what
premium and paid series we have
available there and where you could
become a LevelUp pro and get access to a
whole bunch of stuff that is not
available on YouTube a bunch of really
high-quality series including meteor and
react for everyone both parts 1 &amp;amp; 2 or 2
we dive into all of the intermediate
stuff going on with media and react and
a brand new react native Syria that is
coming very soon so keep your eyes open
for that thanks so much for watching and
we'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
