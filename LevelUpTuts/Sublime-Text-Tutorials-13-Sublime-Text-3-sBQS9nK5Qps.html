up tubs and today I'm going to talk to
you about sublime text 3 now sublime
text 3 isn't necessarily a huge visual
jump ahead of sublime text 2 and nearly
most of the changes if you're not a if
you're just a daily user of sublime text
2 you might not even notice but I found
it to be a great overall experience and
if you love sublime text 2 you might as
well be on the latest and greatest which
is sublime text 3 now if you purchase
sublime text 2 since it's in beta
I believe you can still use your wha at
the time of recording this video you
could still use your serial code from
sublime text 2 to get access to the beta
now he did state the developer that is
did state that you would have to
repurchase sublime text 3 and it looks
like it's running about $70 right now of
course it's still in beta though so you
can test it out and try it right now as
you'd like so the address is sublime
text comm slash 3 now I'm on oh s X so
I'm going to go ahead and grab the
latest now if you're like me and you let
sort of you know experimental stuff um
you know running Chrome Canary I'm
running Firefox nightly is that sort of
stuff there's also the dev builds here
that you can get access to and now it
says the dev builds are currently
available for only registered user so if
you have an account for sublime text you
purchased it then you can use these dev
builds and their experimental they may
be buggy they may be all sorts of stuff
so use it your own risk but they could
include the latest and greatest features
before it hits the standard version so I
have the standard version uh downloaded
right now as a disk image I'm just going
to throw it on to my Applications folder
like so and you'll notice a not a whole
lot has changed with sublime text
including the icon so if we go to my
applications we can see that it's no
longer called sublime text 2 or sublime
text 3 they're referring to it is just
sublime text I'm going to throw this in
my doc
and I'll plug here it is sublime text -
in any future videos and just do the
remainder on sublime text 3 the
differences aren't really great in fact
when we open up sublime text which is
sublime text 3 you'll notice that it's
going to look the exact same as you're
used to sublime text - looking like in
fact now if I go ahead and I'm just
going to throw a big old project
directory on there just a it's going to
look exactly like what stock magenta
look like we have mono Kai we have this
base theme we have our normal file
browser in fact all of the keyboard
shortcuts you're familiar with are going
to work just fine now what we don't have
is we don't have package manager or
package control so you're going to have
to download and install that again using
instructions from their site and you can
even use the same video that we use to
install it on sublime text - the process
is the same you're just going to want to
make sure you grab the latest version so
this is sublime text 3 play around with
it you'll notice them some nice little
things improvements here and there but
ultimately it's just a newer version of
your favorite text editor and it's great
to be on the latest versions so as
always this is Scott with LevelUp Tut's
