Tut's and today we're gonna level up our
expression engine skills
this is gonna be expression gin -
tutorial - introduction to the control
panel so and also a while I'm on this
page please subscribe to you can get
updates whenever we post some new videos
alright so if you have if you're
currently logged out let me back up one
second here because again we haven't
developed any of the front-end of this
site it should be blank but to access
the control panel you need to log in and
to get to that you just type in admin
dot PHP and it's gonna jump you over to
this login screen enter your login
credentials and here we go so welcome to
the control panel homepage abbreviated
to CP home all over the place so we're
going to talk about the screen along the
top we have the main menu and then the
right side we have basically just a link
to our home page so if I were to click
on this and do it in a new tab just
going to redirect and then bring us to
the home page of the site breadcrumb
here over here my name if you click on
that that hops you to your account so
this is one quick way to get into your
account where you can edit your username
we'll look into that a little bit more
in a second I'm gonna hop back to that
control panel home page by clicking this
home button the main nav logout and then
there's this like thing that's really
easy to miss but it's pretty cool it's
the reveal sidebar if you go ahead and
click on that because some jQuery going
on here and we can see another way to
pop to our user we're seeing what our
user name is versus our screen name the
role that we're attached to you can have
a little notepad your ability to search
the site and then some Quick Links and
I've added some here and we'll go over
how to add more later but these are
useful if you are you know linking to
documentation or linking to this with
you know your YouTube page or whatever
the case
is but anyway this this is nice in an
expression engine one these things are
all sort of up in the header which made
things a little bit cramped so this is a
nice solution for them so now you can
just tuck it away and you'll see this
sort of right-hand column reveal
show/hide thing throughout the site so
just make a mental note that it's there
because it's sort of easy to forget
about down and then there's this
obviously this main area they'll give
you a shortcut to sort of manage
different pieces of content I normally
don't even use these because I can just
as easily get to this stuff from here I
feel like so but they give you a quick
way to create a modify and view your
content here there's vs. expression
engine info you go ahead and click on
that it slides down it's a quick link to
their debt your downloads page the
support forum and the user guide and
also tells you what the current version
of expression engine is and the one last
thing and the footer here - want to
point out is there's this bit of text
and this is telling you you know what
version you're on and we're currently on
the current version right and the latest
build this is important when you're
posting in the support forum on
expression engine dot-com because they
every time you will need to know that
the support reps will want to know what
version you're on and a lot of times
this first step to resolving the issue
maybe upgrading to the latest version so
you know what will happen is you'll
write your question you know highlight
this copy and paste it into your to the
end of your post all right so now let's
go let's go through the main menu up
here on the far left what we have is
again the CP homepage if you click on
that it's just going to take you to the
page that we were on right now so that's
useful if you never need to get back to
this page under content this is where
you go to publish new content so
published new content you edit existing
content and also an expression engine -
they've moved file the file manager into
here which is nice and with file manager
this is where you can go if you don't if
you have a user that doesn't really know
how to use an FTP client or they don't
want to you can upload files here and
that could be imaged audio files PDFs
whatever under design this is a really
important area which we will spend a lot
of time going through and this is where
you go to edit the front-end look and
feel of your site so your you know your
templates eventually are gonna be a
mash-up of HTML CSS JavaScript and maybe
some maybe some PHP maybe not though but
certainly expression engine Tad's
under add-ons in expression engine there
are many different types of at add-ons
modules accessories extensions field
types and plugins and previous versions
of expression expression engine one
these were sort of scattered all over
the place and accessories didn't really
exist field types earth was like a third
party thing and so previously it was
modules extensions and plugins and they
have different reasons for separating
these out and once you get a little bit
more familiar with expressions you know
make a little bit more sense but
fortunately for us now they're all can
be managed under one tab the members tab
what we see here that it clicked
activated there is where you would go to
manage the users of your site right now
we only have one registered user and
that's me so I save you all hey there I
am if I needed to add another user this
is where I would go I'd say register
member and fill out the fields members
can have custom fields so you besides
just collecting first-name lastname
maybe want to collect our Twitter handle
and stuff like that you know that's
certainly something that can be done
there's other features in here too that
will
we can dive into later on another video
under the admin menu this is a very
important menu an expression engine and
during the development process during be
spending a lot of time here I mean so it
gets to be split between sort of admin
and design but really when after a site
is launched if you've developed your
site well the content managers are never
having to go into these two tabs there's
hopefully they're spending all their
time going into content you know
publishing that news item publishing
that story publishing that page whatever
it is and hitting save and that's it you
know if you've done your job well then
hopefully there there never happened to
go into this so as you can tell this is
a very important part of the site which
we'll be spending a lot of time in and
there'll be several videos dedicated to
the admin menu and setting up custom
fields and all that type of stuff under
the Tools menu expression engine allows
for quite a bit of functionality out of
the box and one of the sort of items
that I that seems interesting but I have
actually I mean I've worked on many many
expression engine sites but I haven't
had to work on one with such scale where
I've needed to use this functionality
expression engine allows you to send
messages between different members of
the sites so for example say you have
you know five super administrators that
are managing you know different areas of
the site or whatever you can say I want
to send a message to all the super
admins and that's something that you can
do with this under utilities you can
check your PHP info and run about a
couple other functions under data this
is where you'd go to clear cache just
like getting Troopa lor depending on if
you have some third-party and still
plug-ins for WordPress you know you
might be familiar with clearing the
cache that's something that that you
know it's like troubleshooting 101
something's not working well maybe try
clearing try to clear the cache under
logs there's some couple interesting
things here if you have a search box on
your page is always interesting this
like well what are people searching for
and then you can you know maybe you need
to change your information architecture
based on that or you know whatever it is
this is this sort of a cool feature and
also the control panel lock if you have
multiple users you can see here you're
like who's logging in and does some
degree like what are they doing okay and
then there's help
so what help will do is it will launch
they're they're being expression engines
documentation for sort of like whatever
page you're on so from here if I click
help it's gonna bring up their
documentation on members so let's go
ahead and click that so now here we're
seeing stuff about members pretty cool
it's a nice little shortcut and then
we're seeing this Add button so what
this add is you know you you have the
ability to add your own tabs these are
tied to you know on a user basis so if
you have multiple users and you have
different you know functions on the site
maybe one of you is always in here and
another view is sort of like the
front-end developer or something like
that and so maybe you're always working
inside of design what you can do is you
can add you know your own sort of custom
navigation for example and the way that
this one works just sort of very similar
to how help works you go into design and
we'll just say like so you're always in
like template manager over here and you
don't want to go like click and you know
mouse over and all that type of stuff
what you can do is on the page or from
the page that you want to add to the
navigation just select add and that's it
it's added to the navigation it brings
you this your user account screen where
you can and it so actually brings you to
your user account screen and then it
brings you to main menu manager and then
from here you can say you know I want to
call this just yeah I mean template
manager is fine but you know you could
rename it or reorder it if you have more
than one here ok so from here let's go
to the control panel home page
all right well that's it that's our tour
of the control panel homepage thanks a
lot again please subscribe to the
YouTube feed if you have any questions
leave them in the comments and thanks a
lot for watching and please look out for
some new videos real soon things like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
