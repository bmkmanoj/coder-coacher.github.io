of Tut's and today I'm gonna keep our
Android series going and we're gonna
show you a little bit about the Android
virtual device manager or your Android
emulator so it's what you're going to
see on your screen as sort of like a
virtual Android device that you can
actually play around with your app been
test it out and you can build several of
these different emulators if you'd like
for different OS versions or different
phone sizes or whatever just to see your
how your app performs so to get started
we're going to create our first digital
device our first emulator so to do this
we're gonna go to this button right here
it's there's two little Android buttons
in here this one on the left is for
downloading and adding on software it's
the Android SDK manager and here is the
Android virtual device manager it's the
one on the right looks like a little
phone with an android head in it so I'm
gonna click on that and if you'll notice
mine says no APD available so naturally
we're going to want to click new and
here is your a VD name and notice how
you have understanding this level up for
now you can actually set the target for
Android your your target here you can
set the internal storage you can do all
sorts of stuff if the hardware keyboard
is present which hours it will be
because we have an actual keyboard on
the computer however I want to actually
click this device and it's actually
giving us all of these device free
samples we have like a 4-inch phone we
have you know just general sizes all the
way up to like a 10.1 inch tablet the
Nexus One the Nexus S the Galaxy Nexus
in the Nexus 7 since I want this to
emulate my phone I'm gonna pick the
Galaxy Nexus and this is going to be a
copy of sort of what the Galaxy Nexus
layout will be like in the phone
emulated so we're gonna click OK and and
now we have our AVD if we click start
and it's going to give you some launch
options you can have it to scale display
of the real size there just have the
real size is 720 by 1280
small computer monitor or something this
might blow out do you know the size of
your Mountaineer might be way too big so
only check this if you know you your
screen can handle it I'm not even gonna
bother checking it because I don't you
know I don't really care so I'm gonna
click start and this is going to boot up
so as you can see it's gonna take some
time here but this is actually booting
up Android and 4.2 I believe yep it's
using 4.2 and this is going to perform
just like a normal Android device it's
just emulated on your computer so just
sit tight and let it boot up sometimes
it takes a little while so as you can
see here is our device and it's cool
because you have these basic controls
you can turn your volume up or down it's
gonna just it just like it will on the
phone this is actually telling me you
know it's booting up like it's my first
time on the device so it's exactly like
what you would have you know with the
normal Android device you hit the home
screen it's gonna bring in your abs here
and you can see if it's a little slow
it's sometimes your computer has to get
used to it a little bit and a little
speed up but generally when you install
an app on here it's going to just
install it on this home screen and
you'll be able to click it and open it
just like any other app on this Android
phone it's funny because even if you
click on the browser here it's gonna
open up your web browser as if you were
on an Android phone itself and as you
can see it even takes me to Google so
this is functioning just like an Android
device would ok so this is our Android
virtual device and in the next lesson
we're gonna get over we're gonna add
some basic text onto our home screen
we're gonna add a button and then we're
gonna boot it up into this virtual
device and it's gonna be really cool cuz
you're gonna get to play around with it
and it might not do a whole lot right
now but it's still going to be an app so
as always this is Scott with love-love
