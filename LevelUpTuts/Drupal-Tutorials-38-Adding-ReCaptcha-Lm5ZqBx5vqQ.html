up tuts and today we're going to be
adding reCAPTCHA to our drupal seven
site so while you might know recapture
as these annoying sort of entry boxes
that you have to submit so that they
know that you're not a robot or that
you're not trying to just spam through
email boxes or anything the recapture is
actually a really noble web service so
what it's doing is it's providing two
words one of which is randomly generated
the other one is actually from an old
book that they're trying to digitize and
what you're doing is they're using this
massive scale online collaboration to
digitize books in fact I would recommend
going and watching this TED talk it's
actually really great it's really
interesting and it'll make you want to
use reCAPTCHA it does a lot of good
things okay so just like any module
we're going to click to download and
we're going to throw it into our modules
folder okay we're just going to put into
our modules folder like so we'll go back
to our site modules and we're going to
install it
okay and if you see here it's actually
saying it requires CAPTCHA it's another
module here if we come back to here it's
no problem it's just this module CAPTCHA
this allows Dedes recapture a CAPTCHA
pack any of these other modules so we
don't even need those we just want to
use this free CAPTCHA so I'm going to
grab this beta and actually yeah because
it's the sort of latest release for
Drupal 7 or at least the well it's not
the development release it's the latest
release that's not a development so
we'll grab this and again we're just
going to throw it into our modules
folder like before so that we can
install this let's refresh this and we
should see both of them showing up now
under spam control when you go to
CAPTCHA I don't want to capture I want
to use recapture okay cool
so let's save configuration
okay we now have those modules enabled
and it pops up saying we can now
configure they capture module for the
site okay so this is the capture
configuration you can see your default
challenge type is set to math I'm going
to change this to reCAPTCHA and then
we're going to actually need to find out
what our forum ideas so to do that you
can actually because yours is going to
be different I'm just going to go to our
contact page and I actually want to just
inspect this to see if it says so in the
code there's probably different way to
do this but it's just here it's a web
form client form and I'm just going to
copy this and in here in our capture
settings I'm going to go ahead and paste
this in here but the actual ID this is
the ID that's assigned to it the actual
form ID uses underscores here so I'm
going to go ahead and change these
hyphens to underscores like I said your
forms gonna have a different name so
that's the only way I know that you
could just be sure about what it is what
the idea is and we're going to select
our challenge type to just be the
default and this add CAPTCHA
administrative links to form this is
means if you're like an admin will you
see the CAPTCHA or not I'm just gonna
leave that unchecked I don't want to see
the CAPTCHA I just want my users to see
it on any of these other settings
persistence always had a challenge on
omit read the defaults update to omit
challenges in a multi-step preview
workflow yeah okay that's fine and I
don't need to log wrong responses I
don't really care but if you do it'll
throw them in the log and you can see if
like a BOTS trying to fill out your form
100 times or something and it's not the
case insensitive save configuration
let's go to recapture over here and here
you need a private key and a public key
registered at recapture net this is just
so you can jump in and enable everything
I'll just select this I'm not actually
going to use this one so don't don't try
to steal my my public and
at key because yeah I'm not going to
keep this anyway so let's create key
okay I got a public key and a private
key so public paste and private I'll
paste this okay and you can Ajax API
secure connection I'm going to leave
this be safe configuration all right so
let's go to our contact form here and I
don't think we should see this because
I'm pretty sure that yeah we have the
administrative settings on so let's
actually open this up and it count
incognito window so we're not logged in
we're not an admin we're just average
person visiting this website
oops and as you can see the capture
showing up if we wanted to show up on
admin you just check that box that shows
that says that it shows up for
administrators but you know no big deal
I don't need it to so this is working
just like you've seen before and that
way we can help digitize these books and
we can secure your site from spammers
all at the same time cool well that is
how to add reCAPTCHA to your Drupal site
if you wanted to add any of these other
capture modules that's totally cool you
can do that as well it's just as easy
just download the other ones follow the
instructions but I personally like
recapture the best specifically for what
it does like I said check out this
YouTube video this massive scale online
collaboration it's really interesting
good video alright we'll have any
questions or comments hit us up in the
comments notice up a Twitter level of
tuts let me know what you're thinking
we're always like to hear from you just
you know what you want to see and
whatever so as always this is Scott with
LevelUp Tut's and thanks for watching
