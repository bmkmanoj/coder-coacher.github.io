up Tots today we're gonna level up our
expression engine skills this is
tutorial number nine and we are going to
cover expressions in template tags as an
introduction and then the next couple of
videos what is dive deeper and deeper
into that topic before we start when I
encourage everyone to subscribe to our
YouTube channel and I just want to thank
everyone that has already really
appreciate that okay so to start going
into our control panel and we could sort
of do this two ways you can either you
know do it from these shortcuts here but
I'm gonna go under the tab for design
templates and go into the template
manager so in the last video we talked
about global variable snippets
synchronized templates global template
preferences and temper template
preference manager so we're not gonna go
over these again but that's the
shortcuts these buttons but then they're
also just sort of within the menu here
oops
menu right here so just as a convenience
they're in both places okay so in this
area here the left hand column this is
where we would see our template groups
we have none created and then here is
where we'd see the templates that have
been assigned or created within the
group that you have selected here but
before we just like jump in and start
creating groups and templates there's
something really important that you need
to know about expression engine and that
everything is sort of URL structure
based so if we had a group and I'm gonna
do this really quickly called news
and so now that we've created a group
called news it automatically creates an
index file for us we now can actually
what we've done is we can now do this
and this page actually exists so let me
just prove that okay so now if I were
just at the root it's not there but the
reason why it knows to use this template
that I created is because the template
group is the first segment of the URL
segment one that's the first one after
index dot PHP this is something that
we're going to remove later so if you've
already done that it would look like
this but it's the same thing it's just
using htaccess rules to pretty much just
hide that so the way that it works again
is its segment one is the template group
and then segment two is the template so
if I were to create another template
here new template well I don't know
so stay local create and edit local news
update and finish so now local oops that
aired because I don't have my next type
PHP here there we go so the way this
works again segment one is the template
group and segment two is a template
within here now there's no like these
don't have their own groups so to get to
that third and fourth and you know
beyond I think you can have like nine
segments or something like that maybe
more to get beyond it's a little bit
trickier you just you know just take
a little bit more knowledge of
expression engine but depending on what
you're trying to do with your site maybe
that's all you're gonna have but anyway
so that's that's sort of how the base
understanding of how template groups and
template works or they you know how
expression engine works overall using
the structure of the URL this guy James
Smith he actually came up with this
pretty intense URL schematic of how
expression engine works and here you can
see it's like coming through segment one
and it's saying Oh is there a segment
one oh there's not then it's been giving
me the default or give me the homepage
there's no home page oh then give them a
404 so anyway this is a pretty
fascinating schematic that you guys
should check out if you're really
interested in how expression engine
works and I will link to it in the
tutorial in the notes so check it out
that's James James Smith I just recently
saw that but I've seen seen his name in
the forum so he definitely definitely
knows what he's talking about
okay so I'm gonna take a step back I'm
go ahead and delete this group and sort
of start over all right
so I deleted that group and so now I'm
gonna do is started a new group and and
talk you through it okay so template
group name this is something like I just
set mind and news these are very
important
these are search you know these the
names that whatever you choose here
should be search engine front friendly
so if this is a new section that's why I
use news if it's a staff section you
know maybe you type staff in it's your
products you know definitely let people
know that this is a product and then I'm
and then you know and then and in the
URL structure you would imagine you
could imagine that would be like
products and then you
product name or something like that um
I'll just you news though actually know
what I'm gonna create one called site
now site is not very SEO friendly I
guess but the reason why I'm doing that
is this is this is the directory where
I'm going to put my homepage and some
other files so I'm gonna sit at the site
the option we have an option here to say
duplicate an existing template group we
don't have one because I deleted that
other one right so there's no option
here on the second group will have an
option if we go through our settings and
then this is important you make the
index template in this group your site's
homepage so if we look back on James
schematic is segment one so segment one
would be this one here
and so what that schematic says is you
know if there's not then serve the home
page and it's going to do that by the
default template group well I haven't
defined a group yet so this is how we're
gonna do that so we say always go ahead
and check that box hit submit every time
you create a template group you get an
index template for free go ahead and
click into that and then we'll just
we'll just do this I'm going to put in
the global variable for the site name so
now if I just refresh this oops
that's not right
there we go so the global variable which
again is something we talked about that
last video it's a burial variable that's
defined in the system that you can just
use anywhere so I put in site name and
now I'm at my home page because I
checked that box and now we're seeing
the name of the site you know whatever
you can use another couple variable
homepage update and finished we'll say
and now it you know outputted the URL
that I'm both doing this on some
subdomain of my site and so that is the
beginning of while template groups and
templates work in the next video we're
going to look deeper into some of the
fun portions like how to output content
using the expression engine channels tag
if you're interested in knowing more
about this remember
I haven't citizen too many of the videos
just the one of the initial ones from
any page with an expression engine if
you're stuck if you have a question it
doesn't even matter like if you're in
the snippets page for example and you
hit help it hopped me over to expression
engine latest user guide to the page
that uh that I was on so I was on the
snippets page so it brought me here so
that's just a handy thing if you get
stuck or have a question you know this
is just a cool way that they've
implemented that you can learn more so
anyway thanks for watching and again
please subscribe to our YouTube channel
really appreciate it
take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
