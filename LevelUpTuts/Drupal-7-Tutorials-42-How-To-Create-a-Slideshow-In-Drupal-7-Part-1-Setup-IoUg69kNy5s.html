up tuts and today I'm going to show you
how to use J hey what's up this is Scott
with level up Tut's
and today I'm gonna do a three part
series on how to use hey what's up this
is Scott with level up Tut's and today
I'm gonna do a multiple part series on
how to create a slide show in Drupal and
we're going to be using all sorts of
stuff we're gonna be using views we're
gonna be using jQuery cycle we're gonna
be doing a second one with a flex slider
just pretty much all sorts of stuff and
I'll show you how to use the library's
API and would you already got a taste of
before when we used CK editor we headed
libraries folder and whatever so really
we're just gonna go through and we're
gonna do a slideshow and then I'm gonna
show you how to customize it how to
theme it basically how to take control
of it okay
so but before we get started I quickly
wanted to apologize about the time in
between videos here I noticed it's been
a little bit longer since we've done a
tutorial and we've always intended to do
you know maybe six or seven tutorials a
week you know keep it moving but because
this is a side project for us it is in
our free time Ben and I both work
full-time and have freelance jobs it's
it's really sort of it's sometimes hard
to you know find time to do these but we
just wanted you to know that you know we
are still planning on putting them out
at a regular intervals and hopefully
sooner in the future with that said we
actually do accept donations we're gonna
keep the tutorials going free we don't
accept you know or we don't expect you
to donate or anything like that we want
to keep them as free as possible we want
you to not feel like you have to give us
money for these so if you feel like
donating please go ahead if not you know
you're just as well accepted you know
it's it's all good so to get started
here we're going to grab some modules
okay so let's go here and we're going to
go to drupal.org and we're going to type
in views slideshow so we're going to be
using views if you're not familiar with
views that's okay I'll show you the
basics of it just
you watch the first couple of views
tutorials on level up Tut's will show
you exactly how to you know understand
the basics of views but even this if
you're just following along you should
be able to handle this no problem okay
so click view slideshow and this module
is really just an API to allow you to
use different slideshows it also comes
with the cycle jQuery cycle APR the
jQuery cycle module and that doesn't
actually even include the jQuery library
it just includes the interface to be
able to connect to Drupal but what this
does is allows you to download you know
an image flow and a slider or whatever J
carousel any of these other slideshows
can integrate into this view slideshow
module so you're not tied down to one
Pacific specific a slideshow type okay
so we'll just go ahead and download this
okay and I'm gonna throw it into my
site's folder I'm just doing I don't see
my modules folder
okay let's throw this into here oh and
now let's go to our modules and we're
gonna just type in slideshow also if
you're wondering what this is why my
menu our modules screen might look
different than yours I'm using a module
called module filter looks great it's
really easy to find your modules it's
much better than that long giant list
that's and Drupal by default so check
out module filter if you're interested
in having your module screen look like
this okay and so I'm going to check the
slideshow and I'm also going to check
the cycle because this is just the
default one we want to use and it works
perfectly fine if you notice it says
libraries is needs to exist and sort of
see chaos tools canister was also you
know you need for view so you probably
have chaos tools but if you don't have
libraries go grab libraries because
you're gonna need it okay let's save
configuration and after that we're going
to create a basic view and we're gonna
get started so I'm just gonna click
views here if you don't have it in your
shortcuts it's under structure views and
then let's add a new view and then the
view name we'll just call this slideshow
nice and easy and I'm gonna uncheck this
create a page because we don't want that
we want to create a block and our block
title will be slideshow we're gonna 5
out of this on the page and under
display format we're gonna select a
slideshow now because it's an option ok
let's click continue and edit ok so now
that we have this here let's add an
image to our content I think I have an
image and project image that I want to
use ok project image flyouts plays ok I
don't want to label and for image style
let's choose this to be let's just keep
this something small this projects page
1 is really small it can really be
whatever you want and the later lessons
when we go over theming will created a
specific image style for this
so let's go - we're gonna link to
content and apply to all displays okay
so here we have what's supposed to be a
slide show and in our preview even
though it says display five items here
you're only seeing one item that's
because the CSS is already being applied
to it it's supposed to be cycling by now
but if you'll notice it's not cycling
that's specifically because we do not
have the cycle library installed yet
okay so if we actually click settings
here it's gonna warn you about that it's
gonna say you need to install the jQuery
cycle plug-in create a directory in
sites all libraries notice if you don't
have this folder here just create a
folder called libraries in your sites
all and it's going to be you want this
folder to be called jQuery cycle okay
and then you want your contents to just
be the jQuery module it's saying you'll
accept jQuery cycle all min or jQuery
cycle all okay you can find the plugins
here here's a site and you can just
click and download it here I've already
downloaded them slits so let's throw
those into our libraries folder here's
my libraries folder I'm gonna create a
new folder called jQuery cycle and we're
gonna put our cycle library into there
you should let me just free download
this a link goes
okay I'm just going to drop this into
this folder and now if we come back here
we refresh the page go to settings check
it out no more red error here okay we'll
just save this we will save our view
here and let's throw this block on to a
page and we can see it in action so
let's add this block here I'm just gonna
look for there's a slideshow view
slideshow right here I'm just gonna turn
on my content have it be on every page
I'm not worried about it for right now
okay let's just go to our main page and
we're going to see our jQuery slideshow
we wait a second here as you can see
it's changing alright great perfect cool
okay so the night you have a slideshow
if you notice this doesn't have an image
that's because we didn't filter the
content appropriately so let's go ahead
and do that really quickly let's go to
edit view and now we're just going to
filter this we only want in this case to
be projects so we're gonna do content
type I'll just search type I guess type
okay and we want it to be a project cuz
all of these have images okay so now we
should see only images here okay so this
is how to get a basic jQuery slideshow
up and running on your site perfect
in the next lesson I'm going to show you
how to customize it a little bit more
and then in the one after that we're
going to show you use a different
slideshow module something a little bit
more responsive for those of you that
are into responsive web design we're
gonna be using flex slider cool okay so
this is jQuery cycle in a slideshow in
views if you have any questions as
always leave a comment in the video or
hey just up that level of Tubbs at
Twitter dock at Twitter
once again this is Scott with level up
tuts and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
