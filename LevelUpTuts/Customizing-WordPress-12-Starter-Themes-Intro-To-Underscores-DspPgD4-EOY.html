tuts and today I'm going to be talking
about WordPress starter themes now in
the past customizing wordpress videos we
used 2014 as a theme and we made a child
theme out of it well in this video we're
going to be starting with themes that
are meant to be used as starter themes
so if you have noticed over the course
of these series uh this theme exists but
if we want to make it look like anything
other than this theme we're going to
have to change a substantial amount of
that only the CSS but the HTML we're
gonna have to add things just to make it
look correct
well luckily there are lots of excellent
people in the developer community
working on several different themes that
are meant to be either used as starter
themes and extended through child themes
or started themes that are just meant to
be hacked and used without making a
child theme so we're going to be
covering many of these in LevelUp tuts
and the first of one that we're going to
be covering is underscores now this is
underscores Emme I also have bones open
and carrington core these are several
different popular wordpress starter
themes now there are many others like I
said we're going to be going over those
two however for this one we're going to
be just checking out underscores so go
to underscores deme and check out this
site it's actually really nice site
gives you a little bit about this theme
it basically says this is a theme meant
for hacking so they don't want you to
use child themes they just want you to
edit this directly and now that's
different than what we've learned so far
however it doesn't mean it's wrong most
of the time you might find yourself
creating child themes from themes
however this particular example requests
specifically that you use their theme
for hacking so what they want you to do
is it's going to generate this theme for
you at its very most basic we can just
enter our themes name in here and
is going to generate us a theme so we
can say level up WordPress and this is
going to create a theme for us
let's click generate and we have a zip
here that we can unzip now we can
install this just like we've installed
any theme before and wp-content themes
we'll have our you see our previous
child theme here we can actually grab
the folder that's unzipped throw it into
our themes and you can see it's already
been generated with the correct folder
name level up WordPress and if you were
to go into any of these files you would
see that they have the generator has
actually auto completed text in those
files to make it absolutely suitable for
the name level up WordPress will show
you a little bit more that in a second
those come to our WordPress site if we
come to our appearance themes
we will now have level up WordPress
you'll notice that there's no screenshot
that's because it's going to be pretty
blank if we activate this theme
you can see level up WordPress we can
come here and refresh we now see what is
a very very blank WordPress website now
what this is going to be doing is really
just using their bare-bones templates
and like it says on their site it gives
you just enough CSS to get started so it
doesn't look terrible and just enough
stuff that you can build your theme from
scratch
cool so in the next video we're going to
go over some of the folder structure
some of the things that within the theme
that you need to check out and so you
can get started working on your theme
and exactly how you can use a starter
theme like underscores to build your
site so as always this is Scott with
love-love Tut's if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment on
our videos or hit us up at Twitter or
Facebook level up Tut's
let us know what you want to see thanks
for watching and I'll see in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
