of HUD's and today we're going to be
building responsive websites using break
point and Susy so to get started the
first thing we need to do is install
break point now you can do that by
typing in sudo gem install break point
just like that and since I already have
break point installed I don't have to do
this but you're going to need to go
ahead and let that take a second there
to install now after that's installed
we're going to be adding this to a
project that we already have you could
use a command to add this to a project
when you're creating it with a command
with the compass create command however
I think it's important to know how to
modify this config RB and stuff like
that so we're going to come to our
config dot RB where we had require Suzy
before and now we're just going to type
in require and then in quotes we're
going to just type break point so now
that we've required break point and
we've installed break point what we can
then do is restart our compass watch now
if you had your compass watch running
while you did this you're going to want
to restart it so that compass can uh
essentially find break point or else
it's going to say that you know once we
start adding some code it's going to say
that it can't find it
so next we can just say in fact you
should normally have to type sudo here
but I'm getting weird permissions error
and I've heard it might be because of a
new version of compass either way you
just have to do a compass watch as we've
been doing or in my case I know I have
to do pseudo compass watch for the time
being just like that and it's now going
to watch my files and so now that it's
watching I can in fact save and make
sure that it is in fact compiling here
check back to my high term ok it's
waiting for changes cool so now to
actually get to start using break point
we can just type in add import and then
in quotes break point at the
top of our document here before we start
using the mix-ins that break point
provides now if you've watched the
singularity series you're going to be
familiar with breakpoint already out
although Suzi has what's called the
breakpoint toolkit which we'll go over
in a couple videos the breakpoint stuff
if you know it you can just skip because
really this stuff is the exact same so
we're going to be building this site to
be we're going to build it to be let's
say mobile first right so what we want
is to start wrapping our layouts and
things like that in a media query so
that when we first come to our site and
let's come here we don't have this
mushed-up stuff we just have one column
with our main content and then our aside
content below it so to get started um
I'm actually going to delete this wide
layout because we're not using this
anymore I commented out last video and
I'm going to delete this this code as
well right down here and then I'm going
to make this just simple span eight okay
so that sort of resets where we're at
but now I want to wrap these two items
here this includes span eight and
include span four of nine I want to wrap
those in a breakpoint mixin so what
we're doing here is essentially saying
at this breakpoint then snap to the grid
right so we can define our grid settings
right all this stuff exists our
container is still going to be 80% but
nothing exactly happens with our grid
until we're using the span this span
mixin anyways so let's go ahead and type
at include and then we're going to say
break point now let's say we want this
to trigger at 500 pixels and then we can
have these brackets here now inside of
here we can just throw in all this stuff
okay so what's essentially this break
point uh mixin is doing is it's really
just wrapping our things in a media
query what's nice about break point is
it allows for really quick and easy
media queries you don't have to remember
a whole ton of stuff you just have to
remember breakpoint and then you can
assign it a number value most
importantly there are some extra
features which of course will talk about
it and we have talked about in the
singularity video but there's some extra
features just to make your life a little
bit better here and there so now that we
save this let's check out our CSS to see
what was generated so far everything
looks normal and then we just have our
media minimum width of 500 pixels and
then the modifications that happen there
so let's come to our site and refresh
now you'll see that everything's in one
single column and when we widen this out
to 500 pixels we now have these two
columns perfect and just like that we
have a responsive web site so this is a
really bare-bones example we're going
from one column to twelve columns but
really this is all you need to know
about building responsive sites using
breakpoint and Susy well maybe not all
you need to know but this is all you
need to know before you can just start
building a complete responsive site with
breakpoint and Susy essentially you have
your grid that's set up and then at the
breakpoint we're assigning things to
this grid
now that's great but there's going to be
some more complex examples in fact in
the next video what we're going to do is
we're going to change the layout like
Suzy's layout settings we're going to
have some more complex breakpoints and
we're basically just going to take this
example further by making a more
advanced responsive site so as always
this is Scott with level up tuts if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video he just have a Twitter
or Facebook level up touch forum we'd
love to hear from you so thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
