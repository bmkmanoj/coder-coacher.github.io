up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be diving into the timeline now
the timeline is where you're gonna be
spending a lot of time animating between
artboards
and in this case we're gonna be showing
you what you can do exactly within that
timeline and sort of how it all works
so let's sit going right now so as we've
seen here we've built some pretty
standard pretty normal animations in
this particular one I just have a gray
rectangle that's the defaults growing
and shrinking like this now we've talked
about a lot of things but there are
still a ton of key features in principle
that we haven't gone over for instance
the animation timeline so if we select
any of these arrows right from our
interactions from artboard to artboard
you'll notice that we have this view
down here let's go ahead and just bring
this up a bunch so that it's way easier
to see so what this is is if you've ever
used another application video editing
or anything like that you would have had
a timeline with keyframes if you've ever
used After Effects it's very similar you
can think of it as like Photoshop over
time right or or sketch over time here
we have a value for a particular
dimension and over here we have the end
value so in this particular animation if
you select the initial rectangle we're
taking this width as you see as a value
of 44 to a value of 320 and so in that
regard
this initial diamond right here is the
44 and then this diamond is the 320 now
you'll notice if we click and drag this
we can extend the time the default here
looks like it's about a third of a
second or so and as we drag you can see
the value getting larger and larger so
0.86
now one becomes one second now it's
interesting
we just moved the width we have the
width that's now going from the same
value it was so this didn't change any
of the values it's just going to take
more time so what we have here is
essentially this timeline where we can
tweak any of the individual animated
properties over time so now let's go
ahead and what you'll notice is that
when we click this the Y gets really big
but the width takes much longer so
you'll notice we get a skinny and then
it grows out from there now another
thing to notice is that the x value is
now being animated because the width is
taking so much longer the x value sort
of pulls away from the side here so it's
a way we can prevent that from happening
well one thing we can do is let's go
ahead and just click this symbol next to
the X and what you'll notice is that the
x value is now frozen now this is kind
of a problem because when we do our
animation you'll notice it doesn't
actually end up correctly right look at
that it's it's sort of weird here what's
happening is the x value isn't animating
at all although because of the style of
this animation it's not pushing out to
the right the same way needs to be let's
go ahead and unclick this frozen and
let's drag this all the way to zero
let's check this out so now you'll
notice we have this really shocking jump
it jumps to the center and then grows
out again that's not exactly what we're
looking for what happens if we set this
to 1 or one second the exact same as the
width let's go ahead and try this out
now you'll notice you get something
really nice here so let's do this again
what's gonna happen is it grows
vertically and then goes out to the
right so what we're able to do is
successfully tweak individual properties
over time in addition you may have
noticed from this diamond here you may
have noticed this word deep
now the default is the easing so you can
see we have easing patterns that we can
drag these curves to and we can modify
the easing patterns from default to
custom easing patterns now the easing
patterns can change a lot of how the
animation actually takes place but I'm
going to be covering that in the next
video so don't worry too much if you've
never experienced or experimented with
easing so as you can see here we now
have access to individual things in the
timeline and we can modify any of them
for instance if we were to select this
initial Square and change the fill to
red you'll now notice what we have as a
new option for the red layer to animate
let's say we want the red layer to take
two seconds to animate now let's go
ahead and click this you'll notice that
it changes over to seconds so any
individual property that is animated we
have access to right down here as we
change it now if you want to select
another animation all you have to do is
click on the arrow I would click on the
title of the arrow it's going to be
easier to manage but as you can see here
just because one animation one way has
set up an animation when we select this
other animation over here we no longer
have those same type of values our xry
are with they're all at the same value
now if we wanted to modify a bunch of
these at once you can click and drag in
this space here and select a whole bunch
of keyframes here and let's move this
entire animation to 0.7 seconds so as
you can see here to modify a whole bunch
or move the entire animation you're
going to need to select all of your
keyframes so whenever we create a new
interaction we have access to the
animations in the animation timeline
where we can go ahead and tweak the
timing the easing we can freeze we can
do a whole bunch of stuff but either
we have complete access to make this
animation go as quickly or as slowly as
you'd like for instance I know we drew
this out but let's go ahead and make
this animation really tight
now let's do it like 0.1 second as soon
as you can see it's very obvious this
takes two seconds and that takes no time
I mean it's a very different effect that
you're going to get and this is
something that you're gonna want to play
around with a lot in real-life
interactions on the web or in mobile you
want these animations to take place in a
way that feels natural but it's also not
too long or arduous for your users so a
lot of it is going to be experimenting
and feeling it out and potentially
having some people get in there and try
it and just see how it feels
but either way having access to this
timeline gives you complete control over
your interaction animations so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorial and
if you want to get access to a bunch of
videos that aren't going to be released
on YouTube that'll show you how to
create some really popular principle
files then you can purchase this series
at store doubt level up tutorials com or
become a LevelUp pro and get instant
access as always this is Scott thanks so
much for watching and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
