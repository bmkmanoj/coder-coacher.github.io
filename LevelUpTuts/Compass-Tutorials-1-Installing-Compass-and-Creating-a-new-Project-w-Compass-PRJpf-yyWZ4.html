level up tuts and today we're going to
be leveling up our compass skills so for
the first time we're going to be
introducing compass here into the mix so
what we're going to do in this tutorial
is just going to be a brief overview I'm
going to show you to install and create
a project with compass in the next
lesson I'm going to show you how to add
compass to a already made project and
then in the following lessons we're just
going to go over all the awesome
features of compass so as you can see
here it says compass is an open source
CSS authoring framework it adds a ton of
useful useful mix ins to sass it makes
developing a framework really easy it's
chock-full of the web´s best reusable
patterns so um basically people love
compass for a lot of reasons but mostly
it's just really useful so to get into
it we're just going to install and as
you can see on the install page it's
really simple so I'm going to assume
that you have Ruby installed and I'm
going to assume that you have Ruby gems
installed as I did with D SAS if you
need help with that you know let us know
and you know we'll make a tutorial for
installing Ruby or Ruby gems okay so
what we're going to do is we're going to
do sudo gem install compass so ask for
your password and then just give it a
second and it's going to be grabbing and
installing the latest version of compass
okay as you can see everything is
installed you can check here to make
sure by just doing compass and you can
do dash V and I'll give you what version
you're on so we're running compass 0.1
1.7 and Trez it's copyright by Chris
Epstein and it gives you a link where
you can donate to a worthy cause here
which I suggest you check out or at
least you know go to this address and
and read what it's about yeah so so the
first thing we're going to do is go to
the directory want to be it so let's see
where we are let's just go to the
desktop so on the desktop we're just
going to create a test project here just
for this sake of this tutorial and we're
going to do compass create and then
we'll just call it test hit enter as you
can see it has downloaded and created on
your desktop this test folder and this
has the the files that you need to use
compass on your next project alright
well that's it for installing compass in
the next lesson we're going to show you
how to add compass to an already
existing project and then after that
we're going to show you compasses many
useful features as always if you have
any questions or comments you know
