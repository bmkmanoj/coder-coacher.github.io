tux and today i am proud to announce
that this is our 400 video here level up
tons now that's a lot of tutorials and
we've been working really hard to
produce these for free over the past two
years and i couldn't have imagined in
March of 2012 that by January of 2014
that we'd have hit 400 and it's really
crazy to me so to celebrate this I'm
going to announce the level of Tut's
orem which is something that a lot of
people have been asking for and it's
really just a basic web form that allows
you to communicate with the rest of the
level of Tut's community so that
everybody can not only grow and learn
but we can learn from you and you can
learn from us and it's going to be a
really nice tool so that we can not only
make level up tons better for ourselves
but for you and for everybody so now you
can see we have some basic forms that
start just some site announcements
general discussion site suggestions
topic tutorial suggestions and then we
have our tutorial topics down here now
you can post anything you want about any
of these topics or any of these
suggestions so come on and create an
account it's it's nice and easy to get
posting now keep in mind this forum is
in beta like I said with every all of
this I've been creating this stuff in my
free time so I it's always a
give-and-take whether I'm you know
spending time due to create tutorials or
work on the forum so there are going to
be bugs here and there and there might
be some style things that need adjusting
so you'll see it progressively get
better and better just like the rest of
the site so check it out it's the level
of Tut's form so keep watching I'm sure
we're gonna have more than 400 videos in
the future we're going to have well more
than that on and on into the next few
years so we have lots planned for this
year and lots planned for next year so
keep checking us out watch the videos
ask questions and use the form here use
the site thanks for watching this is
Scott bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
