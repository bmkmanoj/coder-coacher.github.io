exploring art boards now art boards are
sort of like its own miniature canvas
within your canvas now the cool thing
about art boards is they offer a lot of
options and they sort of reset the
coordinates for where your items exist
in this canvas for instance if we for to
select this rectangle you notice that
its position coordinates are 468 and
then its y-coordinate is 152 this just
is sort of a global coordinate on this
global canvas for instance if we set
this at 0 for y 0 for X and then we used
our mouse to sort of drag around you can
see that man this is really doesn't
matter where this thing is right there's
an infinite amount of white space and
nothing really changed by us changing
those coordinates but that's not
necessarily the case once we get into
artboards
now let's go ahead and the first thing
we want to do is let's go ahead and
create an artboard I'm actually going to
delete this rectangle for now and I'm
going to click insert now I'm going to
scroll down and see artboard or we could
just simply hit the a key on our
keyboard at any given point it's not
even ctrl a it's just the a key it's
really nice and easy so let's click
artboard and you can see we get some new
information over here on the right we
get a bunch of options for default
artboard sizes for instance iOS devices
responsive web design material design
you can see we have a whole bunch of
different stuff here we have iOS icons
we have Android icons a whole bunch of
great stuff and if we were to click the
heading here it would give us all of
these artboards
so if we were to click material design
it would rate what it looks like 8 or 9
artboards here now for our first
artboard let's actually just come to the
canvas where you can see we have a
crosshair on the canvas we can click and
drag and just like anything that's going
to tell us our dimensions if we were to
hold the shift key it's going to make
sure that this is a regular shape as in
the length in the height or width in the
height are the exact same sizes making
this essentially a square if you let go
we can make it
any sort of rectangular shape that we'd
like let's go ahead and drag it and let
go now you'll ultimately notice that
something has changed about our canvas
here our canvas background is no longer
white now what's up with that well the
white canvas sort of indicates the
drawing surface and when you don't have
any artboards the entire application the
entire canvas here is a drawing surface
however now that we have an artboard
this is our drawing surface this is what
it looks like so if we were to come and
insert another shape rectangle and we
were to draw it over here while we can
see this rectangle while it's selected
and it exists over here it's not
necessarily on any sort of drawing
canvas but you will notice that in our
layers the rectangle isn't a part of
this artboard let's change that let's
actually grab this rectangle let's drop
it onto the airport you'll notice
something has changed our rectangle is
now underneath the artboard now this
doesn't actually work the same way that
layers would this is essentially
indicating that this rectangle is inside
of this artboard and if we were to drag
it half off the canvas look at what's
happening now the only part that is
visible is the part that is on the white
area of the canvas and if we drag it off
you can see it determines that it's no
longer in this out board let's actually
come over here in our layers and let's
drag this underneath our artboard still
now it's interesting here this is a
change that recently happened to sketch
before it would just always exist
outside of the airport like this no
matter what now sketches sort of
determined hey if you're dragging
something entirely off your artboard
maybe you don't want it there but you
can certainly have things off of the
artboard canvas itself and existing
nonvisually like this now there isn't a
ton of use cases for you why you'd want
to do this obviously if we were to
export to this artboard there would be
nothing still because this shape is not
even on it and as you can see we can't
even draw and select it right because it
doesn't exist on the artboard it sort of
just disappeared it does however still
exist and in fact it exists right here
if we were to click this rectangle we
can't come over here to its position
coordinates and we'll set this at zero
and you can see it's now aligned to the
left edge of our artboard now this
brings me to an important point in which
we started when we initially had our
rectangle remember we changed the
position coordinates to zero zero let's
go ahead and actually have this zero
zero once more you'll notice I changed
both the X and the y value right here
now that we have an artboard the zero
zero position coordinate is the top left
of your artboard if we were to have
multiple artboards if we were to have
ten artboards anytime you have a shape
inside of there you could put that shape
onto zero zero and it's always going to
be in the top left of its given artboard
not the canvas itself so by having an
artboard we're essentially setting up
its own setting of coordinates right we
the zero zero is in the top left of this
artboard and not on the global canvas
overall this can make things really
really easy if we know our positioning
let's say we want to make sure that this
is 10 pixels from the top we can come in
here and just say it's 10 from the top
and this is 10 from the left and there
we have it however you cannot do this if
you don't have an artboard and working
with these coordinate values to move
your shapes around would get very very
sloppy very quickly if you're just
drawing a bunch of shapes and having
several different designs on one global
canvas so what artboards allow you to do
is essentially segment your design in to
individual canvases so for instance
let's go ahead and create a new artboard
by just hitting a or selecting artboard
we can click and drag and as you can see
we now have two Art boards okay we can
click on one or the other this is still
set to 0-0 make sure that's there and
let's go ahead and just hit the R key
ours going to allow you to draw a
rectangle let's draw a rectangle within
artboard 2
now let's select the coordinates to be
Oh zero now this is brilliant if these
two things were not on the canvas and
they were both at 0-0 they would be
sitting on top of each other but since
they're in their own canvas they are now
relative to the drawing surface here now
in addition to just making the whole
bunch of canvases we can also name them
for instance let's say this is the
design of the about page we could come
in here and let's see on our layers in
the far left we can double click the
word artboard and we can just say
homepage now for our board to double
click this about page and the brilliant
thing here is that the artboard name up
top is going to indicate that this is
the home page and this is the about page
now let's talk about some layout view
keyboard shortcuts if we do command one
you'll notice it did something let's
head up to view command one has our
canvas centered this is our entire
canvas right this is not any individual
artboard notice how we have the about
page artboard select right now if we
were to do a command - it's going to
zoom in 100% the given selection since
we're select on the about page artboard
right now it's going to zoom in 100% to
that artboard let's go over here and
click the home page in the left layers
and do command - and as you can see it's
now 100% zoomed on that artboard now if
we do command 3 you'll notice there's
been no change
what does command 3 do it actually
centers the selection so if we select
the about page and hit command 3 you'll
notice it's entered the selection it
didn't sumit right our zoom level has
not changed at all in fact the top and
bottom are cut off because it did not
zoom this and if we were to hit command
two you can notice it zooms out now what
is the final option is canvas is command
0 right here let's go ahead and hit
command 0 and as you can see this is the
actual size this is 100% now what's
tough about
100% in sketch is like with any other
vector application sketch is not working
in pixels really or at least you
shouldn't be thinking in pixels because
designs nowadays need to fit a variety
of devices is really nice to be able to
design in the vector space long gone are
the days of opening up Photoshop to do a
web design project it just doesn't make
enough sense anymore to have a new
Photoshop document 1440 pixels wide and
to do everything based on pixels so as
you're working in this design keep in
mind that everything is vector or as in
it doesn't have a pixel basis it's
basically mathematically drawn so that
it's always at full resolution in fact
we could zoom in forever on the square
right here this rectangle and it's never
ever going to get pixelated even though
you do see we have some pixel guidelines
let's zoom out okay so this is just some
quick tips and tricks with artboards now
you can always modify things let's say
if we wanted to let's select this
rectangle here we could drag this over
here and it's going to move it into this
artboard we could do the same thing
simply by dragging it over here like
this so drag and drop tools and sketch
are really good they're very intelligent
if you're dropping in on an artboard
it's going to know you're intending to
put it on that artboard let's go ahead
and create some more artboards i've said
the word artboard about a hundred times
here but i'm sure i'll say it 100 times
more like i said it's one of the most
key components in sketch and you'll be
using them all the time I almost have
never worked on the global canvas and
almost always work on an artboard let's
go ahead and select airport here and now
you can see we have all of these devices
for instance let's say we were designing
for iOS devices or let's just say
responsive web design because responsive
web is going to give us a 1440 a 1024 a
768 and a 320 wide mobile device if we
select this you can see our two giant
artboards here are looking pretty large
let's go
just select all of this you'll notice if
I select all of this and hit the Delete
key it's not going to delete the
artboard itself however I select the
artboards now and hit the Delete key
they're gone it's going to sort of
assume that you want to delete the
contents of an artboard at any given
point before the artboard itself and if
you wanted to delete everything in an
airport including the airport you could
always just come here
select the artboard name and hit delete
okay so you'll now see because we
clicked on mobile responsive design we
now have four artboards created for us
of various sizes now this can be really
great for us because we can start
quickly designing on all of these and
have these artboards all ready for us
right they're not super tall I found
myself making them a lot taller always
and you could do so like this we could
select all of them and we could grow
them that way you could do it
mathematically by selecting an
individual airport and saying hey you
need to be mm tall instead of 10 40 tall
sketch gives you a lot of options and it
makes everything really nice and easy
but it stays out of it out of your way
where it needs to and so as you can see
here we now have four artboards and we
can start designing our same design
across all three of these easy to go and
if you wanted we could zoom out I'm
pinching and zooming on my trackpad but
you could also do command plus and minus
or you could also come up here to the
magnifying glass and we could select all
these artboards you could hit command D
to duplicate and we now have a whole
bunch more artboards now you could also
insert these the same way we inserted
them before by just hitting a and then
selecting the airport it's going to
create them that way like I said sketch
gives you a lot of opportunities to like
I said sketch gives you a lot of
opportunities to do the same thing in
different ways whichever is convenient
for you
okay let's delete these another way of
artboards down we're going to be getting
in to shapes and then we're going to be
exploring modifying shapes transforming
shapes subtracting them and then
sort of stuff and we're going to get
into vector tools how we can make our
own vector shapes and we're then going
to get into some alignment stuff which
is going to come in very handy once we
start doing actual web designs we're
going to then get into grid duplication
and we're going to do a quick
introduction into symbols this is all
just sort of your base foundational
understanding of the tools within Sketch
once we have our base tooling down and
we sort of know how how to do things
then we're going to move on to chapter 2
where we're going to build an actual web
application or basically just a website
design and sketch we're going to do it
across several different screens it's
going to be responsive and we're going
to use a lot of sketches tooling such as
symbols and textiles to make our life
considerably easier and it's even going
to build us a little bit of like a sort
of a kitchen sink page where we have our
resources and stuff like that maybe you
could send it off to the designers and
develop maybe you could send that off to
developers and say hey here look at this
this is the way a button should look
this is how it should function so fire
up the next videos we continue our
foundational exploration of sketch and
we learn about shapes if you would like
to purchase this series and see the rest
of it we're going to be doing three full
chapters of sketch tutorials basically
taking you through everything you need
to know from basic examples and sort of
foundational knowledge to actually
building real world application designs
and using real world techniques that
you'll see in the office so check it out
