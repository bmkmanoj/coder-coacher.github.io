up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna explore using parameters in flow
router now what we can do with that is
take the parameter out of the router and
then use that to get data so what we're
going to be doing is building an
individual recipe page so you can select
a link and it's going to automatically
load the correct recipe so let's get
going on that right now
okay so we now have some things set up
pretty well here we have our template
level subscription we have all of our
recipes here but let's say we wanted to
select one of these recipes and maybe
click a view details button and go to
that recipe based on the ID as a
parameter in the URL we can handle that
simply by let's head to our recipe dot
HTML file let's actually go ahead and
add a read more link so we can just have
a an anchor tag here and now inside of
our path here when we construct our path
we can say forward slash recipe forward
slash and then inside of here we can get
the current ID and we can say view
details and maybe we don't even include
the description on this listing and
maybe we only viewed the description on
the detail list that's sort of something
that's up to you and how you want to
structure this sort of thing so now that
we had our page here let's head out and
we see this view TDS button and when we
click the link you can see we get a URL
path recipe and then an ID so you can
see that there's no route for that so
let's go ahead and create a route right
now we can head to our routes J yes and
let's go ahead and add a route here we
can say flow router I'm just going to
copy this and let's go ahead and add
this just as recipe now we can say
forward slash now here's an interesting
thing we can go ahead and actually have
an ID here
the way we want to specify a parameter
is by simply saying : and then the
parameter name in this case is going to
be just ID now you could have this be
underscore ID to match what the actual
property is but I prefer without the
underscore for this sort of parameter
it's up to you at this point it's really
not anything that's amazing I mean we
could even have this beast and then like
recipe ID now what we want to load is we
don't want to load recipes we don't want
to necessarily load the recipe we could
just say recipe single and make a new
template that way we're not stuck using
the exact same template that we're using
for the listing I know in some instances
you might want to have one single
template for the listing itself and the
individual in this instance we do not I
think it's a new file recipe single dot
HTML let's make a new template name is
equal to what we've been using recipe
single and we can just simply output
recipe dot name okay
now obviously we haven't loaded up any
data here the recipe helper doesn't
exist or anything so let's go ahead and
get started on that while we're at it we
can just actually refresh our page and
we can actually see that we are loading
up a page here so the route is
officially working however let's go
actually go ahead and hit like an h1 or
something here just to say hello to make
sure it is in fact eating this recipe
single dot HTML template cool so we you
can see that our our route is in fact
working okay so now let's go ahead and
wrap this in an h1 and then write our
helper
now we want our new recipes file to be
recipes single so first I'm gonna go
ahead and copy recipes J s because we're
going to use this as sort of a template
here and I make a new file and it's
going to be recipe single dot J s I'm
gonna paste this new stuff in here and
I'm gonna modify it to say a recipe
single that uncreated and recipe single
dot helpers okay so now we want to
change its recipes obviously to recipe
and here we can simply just say find one
now if all of this is correct we still
are using this self subscribe we're
using recipes single we're grabbing a
single recipe using find one so let's go
ahead and check out our HTML page and
you can see we just have a key tune in
here now ahi tuna may or may not align
with this ID we haven't done anything to
necessarily say hey use this ID yet so
let's go ahead and get started on that
right now what we can do actually is we
can make sure that our helper is only
looking for that ID we can get that ID
using a function called flow router dot
get per am so inside of our recipe
single here inside of our function we
can simply save our ID is equal to and
then flow router that get per am now we
can get the Purim and inside of here is
a string of what the parameter am a
string name here is if we had two routes
you can see that it's : ID so it's
everything after the colon so therefore
the per a my D is just ID so because
they get params ID that should be able
to grab us directly from the route
itself this value now we want to use
that value in our find one statement to
find our object so we can say return
pease find one and we can find one with
an underscore ID of : and then ID like
so now what's gonna happen is when it
looks through our recipes it's only
going to find the one with the ID from
the parameter if we head to our page
here and refresh you can see that it is
in fact ahi tuna that's correct
however if we go to salad now you should
see salad and if we go to fish tacos you
could see fish tacos from here we could
add any of the other parameters that we
want to display and we could set up the
default listings page like so so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials thanks for watching and I'll
see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
