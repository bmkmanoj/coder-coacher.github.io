up Tut's and today we are going to teach
you how to keep going with bones using
sass and compass and we're going to be
using sass and compass to compile the
sass files that they have here and we're
going to do a little bit of explaining
about how the the styles are set up in
bones because like I said bones doesn't
assume a ton for you but it does assume
a lot more than some themes right like
with underscores it didn't even assume
that we were going to use sass so what
we could do is build out our own uh you
know structure and everything we can
bring in if we want to use break points
or Suzie to or things like that and you
can do that with bones but it's going to
take a little bit more tweaking because
they have some things set up already for
you that you're going to either have to
take out or or work around in some way
now that could be a negative and that
could push you to underscores or you
could see it as hey they already had
some things like break points set up for
me I'm just going to use what they have
and we can all be good here you know
it's really just you know maybe you see
does it saving you time and it's really
just your own personal preference so to
go through I want to give a basic
introduction to what's going on here in
our our site files now I have bones open
up here in sublime text and we can take
a look at the folder structure now
obviously because this is a starter
theme it's meant to change the name to
whatever your theme is actually going to
be you'd want to change that in the
folder and in the style dot CSS but what
we see here is the things that you
should be rather familiar with we have
basically our header our index our
search are all of these partials that
you've seen in many other themes right
we also have this custom type this
custom template and we're going to go
into more of this stuff soon and this
is going to be mostly about the styles
though now we're used to at the style
that CSS file this is where we would
give our theme name and all of this meta
information up here but if we scroll
down we don't see really anything now it
says do not edit these these are useless
right but they need to be here so that's
ok a feel free to actually read this
entire page because it's actually really
interesting I'm not going to go over all
of this tells you a little bit about
sass and a little bit about how their
CSS is laid out and organized gives you
some recommended reading and things like
that and it gives basically an outline
of basically how to use bones here so
please feel free to read that over and
you know check it out but you'll notice
there's not any real Styles coming into
here well that's ok because all of the
styles are being done through our
satisfies and not the CSS file if we
come up here we see library and in
library we have a CSS folder images JSS
CSS our translations folder we have
bones dat PHP this is all extra bones
stuff so how do we use the sass well if
we open up the CSS folder you'll see we
have these four CSS files these are all
of the CSS files that get compiled from
our sass files if we come back here we
have our s CSS folder and inside of here
we have other folders we have a
breakpoints folder modules partials
admin dot s CSS config dot RB
we have IES CSS log and s CSS style s
CSS now these files are what makes up
our sass in the breakpoints we basically
have these these files that are going to
be run
at whatever size they say so at 10:30
and up these are the styles that are
going to get used at 12:40 and up these
are the styles that are going to get
used at this is for retina this is for
88 and for 81 and up this is 768 and up
and this is our base FCSS so basically
anything that is going to span all of
your device sizes like a background
color or something if your background
color is not changing throughout your
entire site whether it's mobile or
desktop then you put it in base however
uh if you know the width of something
was changing from 480 1 to 6 768 then
you put that change in the 768 in fact
it even gives you some on you know some
some elements here with nothing in it
now
you could like this you could not like
this there's a lot of CSS here I
personally like to start with a bit more
of a blank slate than this however it
does take care of a lot of things for
you rather nicely now in our modules we
have basically different modules of your
code so different like types of your
code right so we have alerts these are
all of the Styles relating to alerts all
of the styles relating to buttons are
going to be in buttons all of the Styles
relating to forms are going to be within
forms like I said in this Styles SDSS
you can read a bit more about their
strategy for this if you're not used to
having your CSS split up into a whole
bunch of sass files it might be
confusing but personally I love it
it really keeps things organized you can
always find what you're looking for
quickly and basically if you're working
on a you know a large project of
multiple people working on it things
like that it just makes it less
confusing than one giant mm line CSS
file
thing okay the next we have is partials
and inside of here we have some like
reusable stuff and just some extra stuff
we have eye functions file which is
going to be SAS functions you can see
this is a white function read about what
these are actually doing they just have
a couple of functions but you would
write your own SAS functions in here to
keep them by themselves likewise we have
our grid stuff so what this is doing is
it's basically writing some grid classes
for us that we can use in our CSS or
that are already being used now we also
have a mix-ins file and this is where
you're going to put your SAS mix-ins if
you are not familiar with SAS like I
said watch the stats videos first and
get a handle on what things like mix-ins
and functions are and normalize that CSS
or s CSS is the the basic normalized
that CSS that you're used to print is
going to be your print styles typography
is going to be for your fonts your
paragraphs your headings that sort of
stuff and variables are going to be your
SAS variables we can see we have some
colors defined already now if you're not
used to these partials you'll notice
that every single one of these files is
prefixed with an underscore what that
means is that they're going to be
imported and then compiled into another
style sheet so style that s CSS right
here you'll notice doesn't contain a
whole lot except for importing partials
so we see import partials normalize and
it's importing this partials variables
partials typography partials functions
so what is does is it basically brings
all of this stuff in in this particular
order you'll notice that our breakpoints
are inside of media queries it brings in
all of these things and then spits out
this style dot CSS file that contains
all of your styles
so the things I personally really like
about this is it has this sass structure
defined and built for you the things I
don't necessarily like are how much
boilerplate code it comes with I could
do with less boilerplate styles and just
the general structure and that might
make me a little happier but if you're
not used to writing all the CSS from
scratch then perhaps you might like this
better and it's - each is own right so
let's get going and let's actually use
this theme right because if we just
modify one of these s CSS files
nothing's going to happen
so I'm most comfortable with terminal if
you have another method method of
compiling your sass with like code kit
or something like that I know there's a
Windows alternative please use that and
check it out any way that you can use
this to compile your compass works
because bones comes with a config dot RB
file which already has the paths of
everything and you don't need to touch
it now what we're not going to do in
this video is install sass and compass
however we need both sass and compass
installed to get this working so while
you're doing this take the time if you
don't have those installed to watch the
how to install stats video and the how
to install compass video on level up
tuts they're brief they're really quick
and you can get going and then we're
going to get started compiling our CSS
or our SAS code so let's come into our
terminal I'm going to change directories
into my site which is insights level up
WordPress now that I'm in my site I'm
going to change directory into
wp-content themes and then the theme
that we're using is bones because we
didn't change the name now you'll notice
in here that our sass and stuff and our
config RB is located within the S CSS
folder within library so let's change
directory into library
scss now if I type ls' I can see that we
are in the director with our config dat
our B file and our style dot CSS so now
from here all I have to type is Compass
watch now the reason we're using compass
is because compass uses this config RB
file so check out the compass videos as
well if you need to install and get
compass setup but basically this
configure our B file is going to tell
sass and compass what to do
so we're saying compass watch enter and
now compass is watching for changes so
now if I come the to our style actually
let's change something in our base so in
breakpoints I'm going to go to base as
CSS and we're going to change this
background and let's pick a variable I'm
going to pick bones pink because it's
going to be obnoxious and we're going to
be able to easily tell that it's
different ok so now I'm saying body be
bones pink I've saved this checked my
term it's saying it's a it's overwritten
the style that's CSS now I refresh and
the background of our body is now this
pink color so that's good compass is now
watching for changes we're able to make
edits to our CSS and we understand the
directory structure of these files so
you are now ready to get theming and CSS
in your site using bones so as always
this is Scott with level of Tut's if you
have any questions or comments please
leave a comment video hit us up at
Facebook or Twitter or on the level of
Tut's forum pretty much anywhere we love
to hear from you so thanks for watching
and I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
