of tutorials and I'm really excited to
start at the intermediate meteor series
today now I love working in meteor I've
been building a lot of projects with it
and intermediate meteor is going to be a
great chance for you to understand how
we can start to build some more
intricate applications than the sort of
simple to-do lists and really something
that's more like a full-featured web
application including things like
routing some optimizations how to add
things that you're used to with every
sort of website like Google Analytics
notifications validating schemas and
just really some tools and techniques
that you need to know about to make your
meteor sites as nice as possible now
this series is going to be a little bit
different than some of the other ones in
the past we're going to be working on a
very specific project we're going to be
building a recipe book of which I'm
going to show you in the next video it's
pretty cool and some nice features that
really just show off some of these
intermediate techniques and meteor and
in addition to that for the first time
ever you're going to be able to actually
purchase this entire video series after
the fact once it's completed with all of
the code examples and maybe a couple of
extra requested videos of course this
will be available for a level of pro
subscribers with no additional cost
so enough introduction let's get started
with intermediate meteor right now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
