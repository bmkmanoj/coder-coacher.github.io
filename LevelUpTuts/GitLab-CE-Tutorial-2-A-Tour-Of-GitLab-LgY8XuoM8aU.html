up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
give you a tour of gitlab cee so let's
get going on that now so basically what
I want to do in this video is just show
you around get lab because it's
different than github it's different
than bitbucket it's probably different
than what you've used before unless you
have used get lab before if we click on
the head up here you can see that this
is the sort of main page right this is
very similar to maybe what you'd see a
github where you have your projects
maybe we have your starred projects
where you can start other people's
projects and you can explore projects so
just like something like github or
bitbucket you have like trending and
most stars and all sorts of stuff like
this now considering this is sort of a
private system right you know you might
be inviting other people to be on and
maybe co-workers maybe you all are
sharing your own projects or your open
source projects within your team or even
your open source projects outside of
your team but as you can see it all just
depends on how much you want to open
this up we already have one repo here we
just named a test and it already has
this little T next to it here so this is
the main screen as just your projects
now next we have to do which is a basic
sort of to-do list where you can attach
things to any individual project any
individual author and this is just a
sort of basic to-do list what you're not
seeing here is a ad to do that's because
these to do sort of come with issues and
if you assign an issue to somebody it's
gonna show up in their to dues so this
is to do's when an issue or merge
request is assigned to you or basically
when you're mentioned in a comment it's
going to add a notice in your to-do list
which you'll be able to just simply mark
done without actually having to comment
on the door you can click to see more
information
so we'll see more with Jews in a minute
activity so next we have the Activity
Feed and this is going to be similar to
like what you would expect with an
activity feed on github where basically
anything that happens whether push
events merge events comments
stuff with your team is all going on
within your projects or any projects
that you may start you will have access
to it in a long list of events now next
we have groups which is where you Balu
that can then have permissions to access
certain repos now under milestones we
can create a new milestone which
essentially be like release release
candidate okay and then you can give
this some information we're gonna give
this a due date of April 30th and click
create milestone so this milestone is
now created and when we head to the next
thing which is issues we can create a
new issue let's just say fix bug and I'm
not going to go to in depth here because
I'll do another video on issue creating
but we can actually assign this to a
milestone click submit issue and if we
head back to milestones you'll notice
that we now have this issue is listed as
an open issue under the current
milestone and the more issues that you
complete under a particular milestone of
this percentage complete will progress
here so this is really nice and powerful
I love using milestones and issues with
gitlab it's really nice to be fully
organized of this stuff now merge
requests like you would expect is gonna
be where any merge request for any of
your projects is going to show up now
one thing you want to be cognizant of is
this left-hand toolbar up here you'll
notice that this is what it looks like
what we're at the root here when we're
actually in a project you'll see there's
some navigation stuff happening that
shows that these same tabs such as
issues merge requests and milestones all
that stuff is for a particular project
this is not one now snippets is going to
be where you could just add snippets you
can add code snippets and they can just
be sort of whatever you want and you can
even add code highlighting for like
naming a file so dot RB will give it
some Ruby code highlighting and now I
mentioned before that this toolbar over
here will change when we're into a
project let's actually select our
administrator test project so as you can
see here just like we had in our
dashboard we have an activity feed we
have some continuous integration tools
and
have milestones we have issues merge
requests we have members which you can
add particular members other members
into your group we have labels where you
can generate and create new labels for
your issues we have wiki where you can
have a get powered wiki here where you
can even have get access as you can see
you can clone your wiki and edit it that
way through get so that's pretty sweet
that the whole wiki is all done through
did as well so you can that you don't
have to be typing in these text box and
markdown the whole time you can do it on
your computer and we also have Forks
okay so this is the project we have the
dashboard now let's check out one more
way that we can view get lab now your
lab is pretty dense in terms of amount
of pages and things to see and do so you
might be wondering well where's all the
administrative tools on the
administrator right well what we're
looking for is this wrench up here which
is admin area we can select this and
it's going to take us to the admin area
you'll notice once again this bar looks
very similar but it's slightly different
personally the fact that this doesn't
change that much as a little confusing
to me personally I'd rather this changed
color or I had some major large
indicator that were in a different sort
of system now or in a different setting
here however as you can see this is the
admin area where we can quickly create a
new project new users we can have a new
group and we can actually see all of our
projects from an administrative
standpoint you could destroy them you
can search for them you can look for
them based on activity you could see all
of the users we have for instance we
just have one admin and you can see we
have some filters here you can filter by
external people that are blocked people
without projects admins or just simply
active users you can even use this
search bar we can add groups and you can
create a new group and manage users that
way I'll be doing a whole video on that
deploy Keys is where you want to have
your public keys runners which is
something we'll go over soon
builds again something we'll go over
soon logs is where you're going
you have your application log your good
hosts log so in any logs that you need
to check out messages is where we're
going to have broadcast messages where
you can broadcast a message for every
single user to see so we could say hey
do this or if you have multiple users to
say new version coming this date or
something or downtime at this point just
to let people know you can even
customize the color to make it a scary
message with red or a peaceful message
with blue or something and we also have
hooks or as you can see system hooks can
be used for binding events when great
get lab creates a user project we have
background jobs we have appearance which
is where you can add your own logo your
own title your own description and this
is for the sign up page and this is for
the navigation bar itself so this is
really nice it gives you a nice little
customization to make this truly yours
in addition we have applications which
is then something we'll be covering and
we also have service templates and we
also have service template we even have
us a slack service templates we can do
things like sending notifications to our
select channel which is something I'll
be covering as well we also have labels
where you can create labels for issues
that get reused and reused and reused on
every project instead of having a per
project label and lastly we have abuse
reports where we can see any sort of
reports our users are having now these
are some of these tools are gonna be
useful or not useful to you depending on
how many people are working within your
own private gitlab if it's just you and
a couple of people then you probably
won't have abuse reports but let's say
you have the set up to be a little bit
larger of a team or maybe people that
you might not even know working and
stuff then abuse reports could
definitely come in handy okay so this is
gitlab this is all of it and you know
this stuff may change because web
development changes frequently but as
you can see this is what it is right now
and if we want to hide this toolbar we
can always push this over here let's say
if you memorize these icons we want to
hover over them to have a little bit
more sleek experience this sort of
standard tool dash bar layout is pretty
common so it shouldn't feel too
weird to you so in the next video what
we're gonna do is add our SSH key to our
count and we're actually gonna push up a
project in here so that we can see
exactly what this looks like when we
have a project in it so as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials if you
