love tutorials and today we're gonna
cover a little bit more of that data
that we had in the last video and this
time using an input instead of binding
to that like we did in the first video
we actually use that input as a search
field and it's going to be able to
directly filter and limit the amount of
data we're outputting in real time so
this is just a basic example of
filtering in fact filtering and angular
is really robust you can write your own
filters you can reuse them you can
include them in all sorts of ways so
this is just scratching the surface of
filtering however it's a good start just
to show you how quickly and powerful
angular can let you have the interactive
search and filtering functionality so
let's check it out right now okay so in
the last video we had a list it just had
Scott and Kourtney in it I'm just gonna
add a couple more names have Ross and
let's say Ross's 31 let's say let's add
another one and let's say we have been
and let's say that is 32 okay so we have
these names here and your refresh and
you'll see our list is going to be
updated now with the four names so now
let's add some live searching to this
now this is going to be so easy and if
you've worked with JavaScript and HTML
and have not been using angular you
might be amazed at just how quickly and
how easily this happens and even cooler
is that once we get into animations and
stuff like that it's gonna be easy to
even animate how all of these things are
happening and it's gonna give your
applications just a way next-level sort
of interaction sort of modern
interaction and that's one of the best
things about angular as a platform is
that it really enables anybody who can
write HTML and it's learn some basic
JavaScript it enables you to learn more
JavaScript in a way that makes
everything exciting and allows you to
create these really really fantastic
interactions okay so with that said
we're just gonna make an input
and an input with a type text now couple
videos ago we showed you ng model where
we could define this as a variable so we
can say ng model and we'll just have
this be search
okay now ng model is going to be
searching over this list so now only
type into this input box that data is
going to go into this variable search
and now what we want to do is we want to
on this ng repeat after the list here
but before the closing quotes and we're
gonna put a pipe here which is just this
vertical line that's the key that's
shift and above your return key and now
we're able to add a filter simply by
saying filter than colon and now we can
use this model so the model was searched
so we can just type search so this
filter is going to be filtering based on
the value of this so without us having
to do any more than that we can come
here let's refresh our page and we have
this input box you'll notice the moment
I type are the only names are left our
Courtney and Ross if I type are oh you
see the only one that remains is Ross
because while Courtney does have an O it
doesn't have an R oh okay just like
Scott SC okay and what about age what if
we want to see everyone who's 29 we can
say 2 9 cool so while this might not be
the most robust searching capabilities
for instance we can't say something like
plus you know 21 or plus 32 it's not
gonna know what that means like Google
would or anything like that this is just
an absolute basic filter it's not really
like a search function right so all
we're simply doing is comparing the data
that exists in saying hey does a 3 exist
anywhere in this data or now hate is a 3
to exist anywhere in this data but as
you can see that it's instantaneous we
don't have to do anything and it updates
right before your eyes so again this is
just some basic groundwork examples that
are going to get you excited about using
angular and show you some basic
directives in the next video
about controllers and now controllers if
you haven't used any sort of MVC or any
sort of JavaScript framework and may
seem like kind of daunting because it's
a word you may not have heard before or
maybe you just don't understand
controllers however we're gonna start
really super basic we're gonna show you
best practices and by the end of it
you're gonna be an absolute pro so keep
watching as always this is Scott would
love love tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video here to set up a Twitter or
Facebook at level up tuts or level up
tutorials we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
