today we're gonna pick up where we left
off a while ago with some expression
engine tutorials thanks for everyone for
being patient when I worked through some
freelance stuff alright so what we're
going to cover in this tutorial is the
matrix module by pixel and tonic
typically this is sort of my workflow
when I first get started on an
expression engine project and that is go
to Ellis lab students download purchase
and download expression engine and then
the next step is to head over to pixel
one tonic and I pick up a couple of
their paid cop add-ons as well and we're
what I'm end up doing is going through
these three at least for now that's the
plan and yeah I haven't actually used
assets yet so I wasn't planning on
getting into that I don't own it so that
was right now the obstacle so anyway
we're gonna go into matrix and I already
have this page up and what matrix
basically allows you to do is to gain a
whole lot of flexibility you know you're
not and with expression engine and
earning it or any content management
system the obstacles always you know how
could I make this site easy to use easy
to operate for not only you know me the
developer also for the end-user and
content manager and matrix really helped
there so with matrix which you can do as
you can see it from this little little
illustration is instead of creating say
like multiple entries for example you
can add rows of information in a row may
include one field or more and so we're
gonna go ahead and set this up
yeah I mean there's a lot of reasons why
you would need this we're gonna go
through an example where we are going to
make a little gallery and so let's go
ahead do that so we're gonna hop over to
a site that I already have running but
we're just gonna use this just because
it's handy cuz it's already up and
already has everything installed so what
I'm gonna do is I'm hop over to the back
end and start setting this out so I
already have it installed I'm not going
to go through that the Installer just
like everything else in the third-party
directory and then come in install after
that we need to go ahead and just create
a field so I am going to tie this to my
pages channel fields because I only have
one now it's just a body someone go
ahead and say create new field channel
field and select matrix and give it a
name this is going to be a gallery so
I'm going to say page gallery you can
add instructions is required yes or no
blah blah blah but let's get down to the
field options this work it's interesting
so by default right away it actually
creates two fields or two cells right
and your matrix
so there's rows and cells and right but
it doesn't have to be it could be you
just have you know one item but
typically what happens is there's more
than one so and what we're going to do
is we're gonna have one that's an image
and so this is gonna be image cuz it's a
gallery remember so I want to say
gallery image and I could say I only
wanted to be an image I can tell where I
wanted to go or this is also like if
you're browsing your uploads you could
say like only looking one or the other
and right so now it's go ahead and look
at this I'm gonna say content now
publish pages we should see two fields
so my test yeah interesting tight and
right now right yeah so I could say yeah
I just want to add an image here and
here we go and now you'll notice is
there's a little plus so we can add
another image JPEG mm-hmm and once
you're hovering over a row you should
see this little triangle and here you
can you know delete you can also turns
it to dental hand you can drag it around
and right so you can just help put this
stuff it'll output it in this order
unless you tell otherwise so okay so
this is nice we can now you know we now
have this this little component let's go
ahead and set this up real quick
simple calorie see if this works
might work partially yeah it actually
did work but I need to add every windows
open I need to add to this template the
ability to print that field so let's go
ahead and do that so I need to hop back
over to my channel field just because I
need to remember what I just called that
really bad at this I always do this so
here we go page gallery go into that and
gallery image so let's go into the
template or just going to page a lot of
stuff in here this is not an empty one
so let's go ahead and look for the body
here we go page body so this is the
output for this entry so let's go and do
this now matrix fields aren't repeatable
further you need you need there's a
tight unit you need a tag pair to repeat
three troe and then gallery image so
let's just see what this does
ain't gonna be pretty
okay so we've outputted this now
obviously it I'll put in the full path
which we probably wouldn't 1 right so
we'll probably want something like this
go ahead and try that again boom alright
two images so that's that's pretty cool
that's matrix but again that was just
you know we only had one cell but what's
great about this is you can have
multiple cells and we'll call this one
caption and this one I'm gonna use the
wig way which we'll do a tutorial on
that so now if I go back to my entry
just to take a look do pages just
gallery now we have right for each row
we have a new column or cell and so now
we can say yeah you know like 2011
indeed
so let's go ahead and edit that template
one more time so we could do that make
sense I don't know
so it's gonna repeat for everything
everything in here so I'm just gonna you
know it's add another break just looking
I'll get pushed down far enough just so
folks can get ideas there you have it so
this this is tied to this this is tied
to that but you know this is sort of
just scraping the surface of what made
what you can do with matrix on my site
I'm doing a whole lot of stuff with not
not matrix per se but I could up I could
have for sure but there's you know with
expressions and it's so flexible there's
a million different ways to do stuff for
example you know right so this is a
musician site and you know this album I
could have done I could have had a
matrix field called tracks and each each
track and all this data that comes along
with it could have been you know its own
row in the in the matrix field but in
this case I actually didn't do it that
way because I wanted these items to be
their own entity because you can play
them on the site and it just sort of
made it easier that way and I'm actually
tracking quite a bit of metadata for
each one so that there would be like
many many cells it would be maybe more
difficult to manage for folks but yeah
okay so that's matrix this is video one
there'll be more and yeah like I said
after matrix probably do Playa which is
a relationship tool or a relationship
module so you can build relationships
between two different types of content
or two different pieces of content and
then after that we'll head on into
wigwam which will just be a quick one
but anyway thanks for watching thanks
for staying interested in level up Tut's
and expression engine ticker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
