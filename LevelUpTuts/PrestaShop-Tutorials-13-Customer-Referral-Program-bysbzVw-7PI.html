love tuts and today we're going to cover
another promotional aspect for your site
that we can enable using a PrestaShop
made module now this is going to be a
referral program module so let's enable
that module now so we can see exactly
what that means and what this module is
capable of doing so we set up our
loyalty and rewards campaign now we want
to actually set up also a referral
campaign and this allows our customers
to refer other customers to the site and
this could be a really nice thing for
your users if they can get a nice little
discount out of it and it could bring in
more people to your store so let's come
to the modules list and again let's just
start searching I'm just going to type
our EF and you can see there's another
module by PrestaShop itself called
referral program now this lets click
install here and just like last time
it's going to install and take us to the
settings screen for our new module so
with this referral program we have the
option of setting the minimum number of
orders a customer must placed to become
a sponsor since it's a set at 1 the
customer that we've already created and
purchased things with should be already
able to be a sponsor and it says
customer count referral program section
so let's actually go ahead and come to
my account and let's scroll down we
should now have this referral program
tab if we have this here it says to
become a sponsor you need to have
completed at least one order so we just
haven't completed an order yet we'll do
that in a second after we finish
configuring this okay so the voucher
type we can offer a voucher on a fixed
amount or a voucher offering a
percentage you'll notice that percentage
here is 5% and the voucher amount is $5
we can obviously change this to be
anything we wanted and if we had
additional currency types it would show
up underneath here now we can say
voucher text text included and voucher
description is going to be a referral
reward so by referring customers to your
store you're going to be getting a real
bored of $5 now there's conditions here
if you want to write your own conditions
for this referral program to let your
customers know exactly what's entailed
within this program and that way nobody
gets any false expectations about what
you're trying to do with this referral
program so let's go ahead and save these
settings and now let's go ahead and
complete an order so for the sake of
actually seeing this in process I'm
actually going to manually set in order
to be complete so let's go to our admin
section and click orders and now let's
just find this first one which is going
to be the order I just placed when you
click on it'll take you here and we can
modify this status now in a whole nother
video I'm going to go over exactly this
order process so don't worry about too
much and here we can change the status
and now I'm going to select this to be
delivered upon updating the status this
order is now complete if I come back
here I can refresh and you now see I
have the options to refer friends and
here you can see you have an option to
refer five friends for $5 each each time
one of those friends makes at least one
order he or she will receive a five
dollar voucher and you will receive your
own $5 voucher so uh that way both
people the referrer and the referee get
paid a little bit and then the store
benefits because it gets a whole nother
order so here you can see that that
number we set to be five we have five
referrals allowed this is to prevent
people from going totally overboard and
referring a hundred people and getting
five hundred dollars off of your store
of course that number is a number for
you to determine for your own store what
you think is appropriate I'm gonna come
back and configure this customer
referral module and now we're going to
say let's invite ten people and let's
not percentage but let's have it be ten
dollars each let's click Save
refreshing my
store you'll now be able to see that we
now have ten slots available and
likewise this says $10 voucher for you
and $10 voucher for them so this is sort
of a complex operation that has never
been this simple to setup on an
e-commerce platform before so check out
how awesome and easy this built-in
PrestaShop module is that you can just
download and install get working and
then wow you have a custom referral
program just like you've seen on so many
other stores as always this is Scott
Olinsky if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video or

to hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
