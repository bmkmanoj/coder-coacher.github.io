level up tutorials and in this what is
Wednesday I'm gonna be covering what is
unit testing or what is a unit test
because there's a little bit of
confusion over testing I haven't
actually covered anything with testing
ever on this channel and that's and
that's got to change because really
testing is such a huge important part of
web development in general so that is
something that you will be seeing more
of on this channel so T get into it I
wanted to talk a little bit about unit
testing specifically because there's a
lot of different types of testing
whether that's integration tests systems
testing stress testing performance
testing all sorts of stuff the one I
want to cover today specifically is unit
testing and a unit testing can be kind
of confusing people see the word thrown
out a lot like what is unit test right
at the end of the day your code is
broken up into units right and you might
think of these units as maybe like a
function or a class or just various
different things in your code that do
stuff and we're gonna actually go over a
specific function in unit tests here in
a second and what a unit test does is it
essentially just confirms that that bit
of code is doing what it's supposed to
be doing and unit tests can certainly
save your butt along with a host of
other styles of testing we will be
talking more about what are the
different types of testings and other
what is Wednesday video so like I
mentioned unit test tests a specific
unit of your code to make sure that it's
working you could think of this in a non
web development or non coding things as
a door right let's say we have a door in
your house and that door has a specific
function it's to open and close or when
you turn the handle the door should open
and you should be able to shut the door
as well right
well unit testing you would write code
that says hey when I pull the handle
and twist the knob the door should be
opening or it should open and when I do
the same thing in the opposite direction
the door should close and then if for
some reason that door ever stopped
working those tests would fail now unit
tests might seem pointless in a vacuum
you might be thinking this is a ton of
extra work just to make something
confirm that it does what it's supposed
to be I mean I write good code my code
will always do what it's supposed to do
and that is not necessarily a great
mindset because what unit tests allow
you to do is allow you to make changes
and updates to your code in all sorts of
areas whether that's the implementation
of that particular unit or that unit
along with other units or whatever it
allows you to make changes to your code
and have a understanding that it's going
to work without having to actually
manually check it like imagine you wrote
a toggle that toggles a navigation on
your menu or on your website right it
just toggles the navigation and I don't
know if this has ever happened to you
but well maybe you changed something
somewhere down the line you move a class
name here there or something like that
or I don't know some code gets modified
and then all of the sudden you go to use
your website and the menus broken you
say oh okay I gotta go fix that menu
right well the unit test you would never
actually have to check any of your site
because if you wrote good tests your
tests would let you know if something
was going to be broken
like I mentioned unit tests are just one
way to test your code such as
integration tests which are also
extremely important we'll go over other
things like that so let's talk a little
bit about some of the libraries that you
might use for unit testing and you would
need a library to test your code now I'm
gonna be speaking on this in the terms
of JavaScript libraries that's primarily
what we do on this channel here is
JavaScript stuff so for a long time
jasmine was the unit testing library and
jasmine is still a great option it's a
nice library it allows you to easily
test your JavaScript
here's a VA I should mention I'm on a
ray gun comm blog post right now ray gun
is a a website that allows you
to sort of catch errors on your website
this is not sponsored by Raygun by the
way I just found this post here I
thought this was a nice little recap of
all of the different modern frameworks
here we have a VA which is minimalistic
testing library I have not used this one
but it allows you to do things like
snapshot testing it looks like it's
trying to be highly opinionated and
minimal okay next we have one called
tape it's also the most minimal of all
the frameworks okay but again I haven't
used this one another option for unit
testing your JavaScript now into the big
boys we have mocha which has been long a
popular library for JavaScript testing
you will see a ton of tutorials that use
mocha and mocha is a great way to get
your code
tested and lastly we have a library from
Facebook called
jest which has become very popular due
to its integrations with react although
just is not just for react testing you
can test it with anything right so these
are some of the options you have and
let's get into like what a test looks
like this is a good example is from
Jeff's website itself and here we have a
function that simply just adds two
numbers a plus B right and then in our
test we're looking at this code and
we're saying okay so we're going to
describe what we're doing it's we're
describing the add function and we're
expecting it to it should add two
numbers together and then so our code
that actually does this test is this
expect line and so we write and expect
we say hey we expect that when we run
our function add with these two numbers
that this is going to be the result okay
so now this is not a tutorial on just
itself or not a tutorial on even writing
unit tests I'm just going to be talking
a little bit about it but as you can see
here when we run this test by hitting
the play button it's going to tell us
how many of our tests have passed you
can see that we have one test where it's
this it should add two numbers this is
the test and the result is hey yeah when
we added one to two we expected the
answer and we got three now there's a
type of development called test-driven
development where you write your tests
first in your code second that also
could be a topic for
what is Wednesday but let's go ahead and
actually see how we can break this test
and then how we can modify our test to
actually have it be a little bit more
useful so in our ad that J s we're
returning a plus B but right now this
test is just expecting the result to be
three so if we return three out of this
function rerun this test you could see
it passes right and let's go ahead and
now write a second expect okay so you
would expect that when you added two and
two together that the answer would be
four now if we've run this you're gonna
see our test fail because the function
is always returning three now that three
passed this one right here but it did
not pass this expect and therefore our
test fails so testing can really open up
how you think about your code in general
okay if I remove this return three if I
remove that return three and hit enter
all of our tests are going to pass nice
and clear our code is working our tests
are passing so as you can see a unit
test is simply describing one unit of
our code in this case a very simple ad
function in other cases it might be a
single react component or may be a
function on your server or anything like
that a unit test is simply going to test
a unit of your code and let you know
that it's working or not so if you're
interested in learning more about
testing in general please let me know
I'm considering doing a series on jest
with reacting graph QL and some of that
sort of stuff or maybe just a general
series on testing considering we haven't
been talking too much about it on this
channel so if you're interested in that
let me know in the comments check out
some of this testing letters I would
even just head if you're new to testing
in general I would head to Facebook that
github do forward slash just and click
on this little or repple it and maybe
just mess around with this function in
this test this is a nice little
environment built here that's nice and
easy for you to you know learn the way
the land a little bit here so this video
is not covering the pros and
cons of testing too much just know that
if you're working on any sort of project
that is going to be public-facing you're
probably going to be want to write tests
for it and cover your code completely
with these tests a lot of people talk
about why it's important and you should
definitely listen to them okay
so as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials in the next what is Wednesday
we're going to be covering more and more
types of testing so we're gonna get over
integration testing which is a different
type of testing by the way I'm also
using a new microphone on this video so
if the audio is not perfect I'm still
you know getting a lay of the land here
with this microphone now if you want to
help support this channel head on over
to level up tutorials dot-com and you
can become a level of pro and get access
to some of these new series that we have
available the latest series on level up
tutorials is pro gatsby where i teach
you all about the static site generator
gatsby this series has been really
well-received of getting a ton of
comments about how everyone is just
really really enjoying it so if you want
to build really really really fast sites
using react
check out pro gatsby it's available for
purchase or available for pro
subscribers there is a 25 videos and it
is excellent so thank you so much for
watching and i'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
