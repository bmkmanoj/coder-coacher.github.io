say a couple of things here I want to
thank anyone who shared a code pen on
the last of the code pens explained I
promise I'm going to get into some of
those I did look at all of them but uh I
will be getting into some of them I just
wanted to do this one really really
quickly now I won't be doing all of them
because I want to kind of keep it into
this realm of things that are look cool
but maybe not as difficult as you'd
expect for now and I'm gonna keep it
pretty CSS in j/s heavy and trying to
stay out of things that use a lot of
external libraries as those are just
guidelines though they're not
necessarily hard rules there so if I do
see something super cool that breaks
those rules I will definitely break that
so I saw this on the CSS tricks Twitter
feed they pushed out this code pen about
this really cool colored underlined now
this code pen is created by William King
you can head to his code pen which is W
King he's got some actually pretty cool
stuff on here so if you want to head to
his you could throw a bunch of Hearts
his way I don't know if he's the
inventor of this technique or something
like that but he certainly does a really
good job with what's happening here it
looks really super nice so this is the
example we're going to be checking out
notice how we have this really awesome
gradient underlined and when we hover
over it goes full height now you'll also
notice that your gradient is probably
different than the way mine looks and
that's because he has some JavaScript in
here that's basically pulling into some
random colors we're gonna totally ignore
the random colors bit because it's not
really essential to what I'm trying to
show you can always just check out his
JavaScript you could even do random
colors with some CSS preprocessor stuff
if you'd like but as you can see just he
has everything commented here anyways so
but that's not what we're going to be
talking about we're gonna be talking
about this underline now one of my
favorite things about this example is
just how clever the solution is and you
could do the same exact thing with the
before and after pseudo elements that
kind of
but he manages to do it with just a span
here and no before or after so if we
look at the HTML it's not really
exciting at all we simply just have an
h2 or an h1 and anytime he wants this
underlined he has a class of underlined
magical me see if I bump this font size
the problem is it bumps up the interface
size - no worries so you can see it's
just a span with the class of underlined
magical so this one is multiple lines
also another cool thing if this
technique works on multiple lines
without you having to do anything now
once I get into the CSS if you don't
have a good idea of how this is working
already your draw might hit the floor
just how simple this solution is if you
haven't seen this before so a perfect
example for this series right stuff
that's really really cool you don't see
often but really not too difficult when
you get under the hood okay so we have
just like I said a span with a class now
let's check out the magic here okay now
move this up and we can pretty much
ignore most of this other stuff right so
the body heading whatever this is just
setting basic font size and font types
and stuff like that font families
nothing here is important what's great
about this code pen is these even
labeled start important part and end in
Porton part which I didn't even see till
I started recording that just now
because this is where this thing
actually becomes super duper interesting
okay so man I'm just so psyched that
this solution is what like five lines of
code plus the hover so let's check it
out let's unbox this thing let's figure
out what's going on first step he's
setting a background image so this whole
thing is accomplished through a
background image which is just simply a
linear gradient in fact if you were to
just add this linear gradient as is I'm
pretty sure would just look like the
hover State or at least close to the
hover State right simply just a
background image on a on an h2 or a span
right if we were to remove this 120
degrees you're gonna hardly notice a
difference actually it just gives it a
little bit more interest
so there's nothing really that crazy
going on now in addition you have some
default colors here like I said it's
doing some JavaScript stuff to grab into
some random colors that's ok but if you
just wanted your standard colors it's
really just a here's your left here's
your right these are your two colors
start from left to right and do ten
angle of 120 degrees next we have these
background-repeat:no-repeat and this
goes without saying you don't want this
background image to be repeated so we
throw a no-repeat down there now here
comes some of the magic the background
size now the background size is a
property that that takes two values
we're going to have the X size and the Y
size so the height and the width now if
we were to say something like 50% here
you can see that our underlying only
spans half of the word so you could
actually use this to your advantage if
you wanted to have this be a little bit
different right maybe like it doesn't
complete the entire thing the end of the
day I think 100% looks better anyways so
as you can see here the hundred-percent
makes this thing the full width of the
span and next we have the height now
he's defined a sort of a relative fixed
height here of point zero two M's you
could also define this in percentage if
you wanted to and yeah that works too
but I like the fixed height because then
you always know how thick your lines
gonna be I mean you could even do it in
a pixel value if you wanted to - just
like an underline or something like that
but as you can see here basically
background size 100% wide and only 0.2%
this is the magic right this is what
makes this thing well a rectangle here
instead of a box around your text now
the second line that's magical is the
background position now the background
position is basically where this thing
is going to set the first principle is
the X so it's going to be at 0 as far
left as possible and then the background
position is going to be 88% from the top
if we were to change this to something
like 2020
percent you can see it jumps all the way
up there and if we were to change it to
8% it's even higher right so the fact
that this is 88% means you could tweak
this as much as you want to position
this underline of where you think it
should go okay this is like definitely
more of a traditional inner line here
and this 88% that it was that is
definitely more of a stylish sort of
style okay
so between the background size the
background position we're basically just
taking what is a standard linear
gradient
we're squishing it down and we're
placing it where we'd like to we're not
using any sort of after before
position:absolute anything it's a really
super nice and we just give it a basic
transition where we're transitioning the
background size for 0.25 seconds with an
ease in and then on hover check it out
all we're doing on hover is saying hey
remember when you were point zero two
M's tall now you are 88% tall again this
just fills it up perfect and nothing
else is being adjusted here so that's
super nice if we were to change this to
a hundred you'll see it probably gets a
little bit outrageously too big but
actually it looks pretty nice but the
reason why this is so awesome to me
personally it was just how little it
takes to get this really great effect
essentially three lines of code if you
ignore the background repeat it gets you
a really super cool underline and even
if you don't have this hover effect it's
really super nice so a big shout out to
CSS tricks for tweeting this out and
thank you William King I'm gonna post
the link to this code pen in the
description feel free to give it a bunch
of hearts and tell William King just how
much you liked it so thanks so much for
watching as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials and I hope you
enjoyed me going behind the scenes of a
technique that maybe you didn't know
about with CSS but is easily
accomplishable and if you're using this
technique anywhere let me know and I'm
gonna check it out thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
