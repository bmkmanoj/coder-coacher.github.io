of Tut's and today we're going to go
more into the layout files in Magento
and how to completely control them so in
the last lesson I showed you just
basically what the layout file look like
we changed one small thing in it and
then we had our popular tags we had that
show up at a different spot than it was
before
so let's actually try something like
that and look at that file again and
just see a little bit more about
understanding these layout files so I'm
going to go to my theme and then layout
the one that we used was tag XML and now
here we have this file opened up and
what we did is we changed the the
default reference name to right okay so
as this comment explains here what the
this default block is is the default
page it's the default layout it's going
to load most of the pages so the reason
it says most is because it's not all
we'll go into that a little bit more
it's not something you need to worry
about right now but this default is
going to load on most of the pages so
when we say the reference name of right
it's referencing another block so what
this is called right here is this is the
handle and the handle tells Magento what
pages to load this stuff on these handle
names are set in stone identifiers that
you won't have to change okay so if
you'll notice customer underscore counts
is one that we have below here customer
count index catalog product view these
are all pages or types of pages that
this stuff's going to get to load on so
in this instance we saw before for
default and it was referenced in right
when we first came to this it was
referenced left so this is referencing
block somewhere else in fact let's
actually see what block that's
referencing we're going to go into our
layout file again and I'm actually going
to go into the default ones that came
with Magento under layout and then I'm
going to grab page
we're right here page of XML I'm going
to copy it into my own project just like
we did before no not like that
kit okay so here I've loaded up page two
XML and this is where this block right
lives so let's scroll down here and
you'll see these block tags and we're
going to find one that says has a name
of right so I'm actually going to search
for right okay so this block right here
is a block type it's a core it's name is
right okay so what this code is doing
this reference code here sorry right up
here it's saying reference the name
block and then load up this block using
this PHP file as a template okay so just
like if we look back at here we could
see that we have other names let's say
here's a block type page footer so let's
copy this and let's change this to
referencing footer I'm going to save
this now let's refresh our page and
let's actually inspect the code here and
we can see that our tags list the same
block that we had before showing up in
the right is actually showing up in the
footer now okay so that should give you
a little bit more of an idea about how
to move these things around so by using
this developers tools that we have
turned down in the previous video we now
know how to find out what XML file our
particular blocks are using and we
know how to manipulate that to change it
to a different block to put it in for
instance we put this tags block inside
of the footer block okay and this might
seem really confusing and I mean Magento
even says this is an easy to learn XML
format and sure uh it may look a little
foreign but once you go through this and
sort of look at some of these examples
you'll get a little bit better of an
idea exactly how things are working here
so let's talk about some of these things
that exist within the block tag so here
we just have a block and it's using a
template it's got a name and it has a
type well the type is the identifier for
the module class that defines the
functionality of this block so basically
you're saying that this is a tag block
of the type popular so it's a popular
tags block the name is basically
whatever the name that this has been
assigned so that other box can make
reference to this block so this is the
tags popular block just like we saw
under page X know we had a block name
right so we're referencing this block
here just like we could reference this
block by using tags underscore popular
the template is physically what template
is going to render when this block needs
to be rendered on the page so let's
scroll down here to see a couple of more
blocks so here we have a block has a
label and an action so this action we're
not going to go too in depth through
these but because what these are is
they're they're used to control
storefront functionalities you can use
them to load specific JavaScript files
and for right now I think it would be
best to just look at different action
types and sort of try to play around
with them and see how it's working on
the front end of the site these are
things we'll go into a little bit
further when we're doing more complex
applications of these layout files and
then you'll also see this as
we have lists before and info too these
are used if you need to call the block
from the PHP there's some PHP that you
can write that basically says the get
child HTML and then it's going to have
the block name so we'll show you an
example of that once we get into more
the PHP but like I said for now you
shouldn't need to know that if you just
want to be customizing what they have
here you should have enough to be able
to come through and if you don't want
something to show up you can delete
these however there's a better way to do
that and in the next video we're going
to be going over the local dot XML file
and we're going to be turning off a ton
of those blocks that we don't want that
come by default with the Magento
installation I'm sure you're aware of
them by now there's things like the
PayPal logo or the back-to-school thing
or the the dog picture there's all these
things that we don't we don't need to
show up on our site so we can go ahead
and turn them off with a local that XML
file that way we don't have to copy and
paste all these XML files just to get
rid of those functionalities built in
okay well I hope this helps these XML
files like I said they're just a little
bit different so it's going to take some
time to just play around with them and
really just try to try to see exactly
what they're doing if you need any
reference just check out the ones that
already exist we'll get into more
advanced applications like writing your
own in just a few tutorials here as
always this is got with level up Tut's
if you have any questions please leave a
comment the video and it's up at Twitter
I left lip Tut's thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
