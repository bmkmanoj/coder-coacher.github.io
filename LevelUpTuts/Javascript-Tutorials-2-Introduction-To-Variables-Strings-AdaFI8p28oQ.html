of Tut's and today let me continue our
JavaScript series by talking about one
of the most basic concepts in JavaScript
and it's something you will be using for
the rest of the time that you do
JavaScript at all it's something that
you're pretty much gonna use on most -
all scripts that you will write pretty
much forever so what is this concept
well this concept is variables and what
is a variable a variable is really just
a piece of data that's being stored by
another name that you can recall later
so you would use maybe variables to you
know maybe you're receiving somebody's
name from an input you'd store that into
a variable named name and then when you
wanted that code to be alerted you could
alert name and so you'd be alerting the
variable instead of the text within this
variable so the reason why you use
variables is because they can be changed
they can be assigned to different
different values right or you could have
constant variables that don't change but
really variables allow for programs to
become dry which is that concept of not
repeating yourself so by using variables
you can create patterns that get reused
and reused and reused storing values as
variables that become manipulated or
used in some way so what's a basic way
we could illustrate a variable well most
basically I can think of is by
recreating our hello world alert using a
variable so let's come to our code and
let's go to our main J's file which if
you watch our last video is just being
referenced at the bottom of our HTML and
right now we're alerting hello world so
what we want to do is we want to store
hello world into a variable so how do we
do that well in JavaScript to declare a
variable all you have to type this bar
to say that hey this is going to be a
variable a new a new variable
and then you have to name it so we're
gonna just call this hello and notice
how I'm using all lowercase here and
we're going to say it's equal to with
one equal sign and it's going to be
equal to and then inside of quotes here
we're gonna say hello world now there's
an important part I need to mention
about these quotes here so this
particular variable is of the type of
the data type of a string so what a
string is is the string is just text
right so anytime you have text that is
to be like output or anything like that
it's a string where if you have a number
it's a number or there's also boolean's
which is true or false and in fact we're
going to go over our data types
individually and how you can use them
but all you need to know about a string
is that its text and we can do cool
stuff with strings we can add text to
them we can remove text from them we can
change them we can I mean what you do
all sorts of stuff with strings so we're
going to say VAR hello is equal to hello
world now in our alert here we can say
hello instead now let's save this and
refresh our page you would see the alert
says hello world alert hello world which
is awesome because that's exactly what
we did before but now we had it like
this so if we want to alert hello hello
world right here we could also change
this variable and we could say hello is
now equal to let's just say goodbye
world right and then now if we want to
alert this again we're gonna notice how
we alert the exact same thing you're
going to notice that the second alert is
going to in fact say
goodbye world now this is because the
variable is created and set as hello
world were alerting it and then we're
resetting this variable as goodbye world
and then alerting it notice how the
program runs from top to bottom and in
fact it runs this then this then this
than this cool so that's that's nice
actually it looks like I forgot a
semicolon here that is bad but so what
happens notice how we didn't put any
quotes around here what happens if we
put quotes around here like this well
now it's gonna see that as not a
variable but a string itself so now it's
outputting alert hello in lowercase so
come back to our code we clearly don't
want that and we don't even want this
goodbye world anymore however we're sort
of sick of this thing popping up and
alerting us all the time and it's it
sort of gets the point where you're like
well if every single type of JavaScript
I write and I want to test or see what
it's doing how can we see these values
to make sure this value is set correctly
without having it output to the screen
or alert it or something well that's
where javascript has this council
so we could say a council dot log and so
instead of alert here we can say Council
dot log and basically this log is a
method of council however we're gonna
get into the specifics of that in the
future it's not important for what you
need to know right now
so by council logging this it's very
similar to alerting this and this
however is going to just show up in our
council so if you're using a WebKit
browser using Safari or Chrome you can
right click on your page and inspect
element now it'll open up this menu here
lines on the Left yours might be on the
bottom it just depends on your settings
and you'll see there's a tab called
so this is for the JavaScript council to
click on it it's given me some issue
about failing to load a resource
whatever it's because I don't have a
Google Analytics account set up for this
but you'll notice our hello world is
output in this council log if i refresh
it's there in fact if I tell this to
Council log you know five more times and
then maybe once I'll put a string in
here that says yo with a lot of oohs you
know we refresh you can see every single
one of those is output to the council
here we're not getting anything
disrupting our page next let's see if I
can make this bigger there we go it's
just big enough
oops back you draw council so this is a
way to test things right so we're gonna
be using council log a lot we're gonna
be using Council and inspect if you're
on Firefox they also have their own
version of that and there's Firebug as
an extension or there's Firefox's on web
inspect tools so that's great we've
learned what a string is we've learned
about a variable you can now set and
change variables and we can log to the
council well in the next video we're
going to talk about numbers and using
numbers as variables and all sorts of
cool stuff so as always this is Scott
with love.load Tut's if you have any
questions or comments please leave a
comment the video or hit us up at
Twitter LevelUp Tut's we're also on
facebook just pretty much anywhere just
let us know what you're thinking as
always this is Scott and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
