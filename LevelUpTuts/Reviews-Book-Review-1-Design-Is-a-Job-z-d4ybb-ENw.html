Tut's and today I'm going to start
something new it's going to be level of
tubs book reviews and these are going to
be books related to what we do in the
community as a a web designer web
developer just a programmer or a hacker
whatever you do with the Europe with
your life and sort of great things
there's there's been some absolutely
phenomenal books published recently and
and along the way and I feel like it
would be a good opportunity to talk
about some of these books and so to
start this I wanted to start it with one
of the best books I've read and probably
in a very very long time and it's a
design as a job of my mic monterio put
out by a book part and the book apart
has well the book apart is a list of
parts bookstore that they have online
it's a book apart com they have a lot of
great books and they're all really
they're all really well made okay so
what's great about this book is it's
just how easy it is to get through and
really how different you sort of feel
once you're done with it the books 131
pages and for the most part it's as you
can see you know it's not super small
print so it's not like it's going to
take you a long time so this is the
seventh book in a book of parts catalog
as you can see they all have like sort
of a color scheme this one is brown they
start off each chapter with sort of a
you know it's normal chapter heading and
you know the the best part about these
books is besides just being great
content they're actually really nice to
have so I always make sure i buy the
both the e-book and the the physical
book just because I really like having
them just I think they're great things
and the money's going to support a
really great group of people all of
these all of these books are extremely
well written and they just they're just
a pleasure to read so let's talk about
design as a job specifically Michael
Ontario the author it says here you know
he's the co-founder of mule design i
would check out their site and mike
monterio if i don't know if you noticed
his web presence or listen to any
his podcasts or follow him on Twitter
but if you do you sort of know what he's
like and he's a really funny guy and he
brings that really well into this book
but what he brings most importantly is
the content of this book well I don't
care whether you're just starting out as
a freelancer you've been doing freelance
you're thinking about doing freelance
you work at a company either way as long
if you do design development any of this
stuff as a job this book is so essential
it teaches you pretty much everything
you need to know about handling clients
handling projects what you should take
on what you should charge any of these
questions that you you would have that
most people would gained through
experience he's gained through all this
great experience and is compiled into
this quick book and it really just you
know hits you really loudly when you
read this book so like I said I would
really recommend design as a job in fact
uh as the very first epic review on
level up Tut's I'm going to say this is
you know one of the best books I've read
in a very very long time so you owe it
to yourself to check it out um looks
like you can get in here from a book
apart they have a bundle paperback and
ebook or it's not an Amazon it's a
little bit more expensive here i don't i
don't know exactly why but you know you
can order directly from a book apart and
and just so you know I have no
affiliation with a book part list apart
Michael Ontario zero affiliation just a
big fan of this this book and for the
most part of book of parts books so
check out design is a job if you think
that you ever want to be you know
running a business of your own or
working as a freelance or anything it
will honestly save your life and since
this is a new series like the other
review series that we're doing if you
have any questions or whatever or if you
just want to leave a comment about this
video you know who'd leave a comment it
is a bit twitter us know what you're
thinking what you want to see more of
what you want to see less of and like i
said i'm going to be bringing more
tutorials really soon none of my
computer's backing up and running so i'm
going to get working on that and
hopefully have some out either later
this week or early next week okay so as
always this is scott with level of Tut's
