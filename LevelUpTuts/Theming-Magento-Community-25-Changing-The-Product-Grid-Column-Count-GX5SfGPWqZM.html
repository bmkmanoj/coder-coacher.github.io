touch and today we're going to fix this
issue where we wanted to have four
columns here and you can see we do but
we did it sort of a cheating way we
change this column count directly just
to the number four and we don't want to
do this because there's other places
they use column count and we want to be
able to do this the right way so we're
going to be doing this through the
layout files so as you can see I've
uncommented that line where it says this
get column count and now if we go to our
page we should be back at three columns
okay well what we need to do is we need
to find the right layout file for this
and that layout file is located in app
and then front end and it's in the base
default and then lay out then lay off
how we want is catalogued out xml so
let's grab hold option and drag this
down if it ever okay and we're going to
drop this into my layout folder for my
theme so just to flip over to sublime
text to make sure it's in there and we
have catalogued xml so what you want to
search for is you want to search for the
word set column count so we're going to
say set column okay cool so we have this
set column count and you can see it has
the number 4 it's an action and this is
whole block method set column count
columns for that's the action this is
inside of right now it's in the product
up cell block so this is saying the up
cell block has a columns of four
products which is cool but that's just
for the upsells so we want to have this
also for the list and the product
listing and they'd yet stuff so let's
check this out and we want to search for
i'm going to do command F and we want to
search for product underscore list and I
don't want product list related I just
want product under
scoreless I'm also going to put a quote
here and you can see it's taking me to
this and the ones we want to find our
the category default layout also known
as cata catalog category default and we
also want to find it in catalog category
layered and we're going to be looking
down here and we want to find this
catalog product list block and we're
going to enter here right underneath
where it says catalog / product list for
the type and name is just a flat-out
product list and we're going to paste
this line in here at set column count to
four oh it's great it's give me a thing
about purchasing sublime text I for the
record I have purchased sublime text I
have a catastrophic issue with my
computer and so my license is a bit a
bit funky ever since then I maybe I just
haven't read put in my license for this
so um okay enough of that I want to
search again for product list because
there's another one so okay these two
and down here this is a category or
catalog category layered and same thing
we want to put this right in here
beautiful beautiful and make sure you
put it inside of this block here or else
you're not going to have it work and
should be good so let's come back to our
page and let's refresh see what happen
we now have four columns again we did
not have to modify that code and let's
really quick fixes clear fix I know I
broke this last time I by adding on our
list phtml i added a columns 12 to this
ul and I realized we really don't need
it so let's go ahead and get rid of it
save it let's come back refresh okay
everything's clear fixing now and
everything's still responsive beautiful
cool so this is how we set the column
count using a layout file and inside of
cattle
xml so that is there for setting the
column count that this is giving this
column count and setting it equal to
this column count variable that this
loop is then using to iterate through
our products well that's pretty cool we
can now change how many products are per
line in our site and it's going to be
you know totally flexible it's exactly
how we want it I mean if we wanted five
products we wanted 10 products in the
list whatever we wanted we can have that
just by changing that column count so
that's perfect all right well this is
