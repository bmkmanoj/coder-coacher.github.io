tutorials and in this first what is
Wednesday of 2018 I'm gonna be tackling
what is Redux now what is Redux is one
that's been requested a lot and actually
I wanted to delay it a little bit so
that it could coincide a little bit with
the release of a new series I have which
is a Redux and react for everyone and if
you want a preview of this series it's
gonna be going up later this week on the
YouTube channel you're gonna get access
to the first five videos or the first
five tutorials that is anyways and in
this series we're gonna be learning
Redux from the ground up as if you had
never even heard of it or knew what it
did and we're gonna be doing that with
react so in the context of react we're
gonna be teaching you everything there
is to know about getting started with
Redux but on to the more important part
of this video which is well what is
Redux because honestly if you're coming
at this and you read Redux is a
predictable state container for
JavaScript act apps yeah I I mean so
that describes it very well but like
there's gonna be some people out there
who look at this predictable state
container for JavaScript apps and think
well why do I need a predictable state
container why do I need a state
container and what is a state container
and how does this all sort of fit into
modern web app development so Redux
itself evolved from the ideas presented
in flux right and flux was a pattern an
architecture if you will for app for
building user interfaces this is created
by Facebook Redux gives you a single
object with every piece of application
state in your entire web application
what might fall into that well whether
or not the navigation on mobile is open
whether or not on the level of tutorial
say whether the shopping cart is open
you could think of the state of the site
also having to do with things like alert
messages whether an alert message has
been triggered right that's all state
but in addition we also have state such
as this data that came in from our API
right the API got the SKU number from
the URL it went and then it grabbed all
of this data and guess where to put it
put it in redux it put it in this giant
object full of stuff okay and actually a
level of tutorials is using redux if you
have the redux dev tools installed here
and we tab over to them you can see all
of the different actions and stuff that
have taken place now I say actions fell
well knowing that you may not have any
idea what that means if I check out my
state here you can see that we have a
full state tree for instance that we can
see if the check out is open or not
right we can see that the is check out
open is set to false we can also see all
of the playlists that have been loaded
all of the products that have been
loaded whether or not there's an active
product or not and as you can see here
this is our entire application and one
of the cool things that Redux offers is
well these dev tools right here so in
addition to be able to see the entire
state of your entire application watch
this let's go actually find the where is
it nav look at nav right here when I
click nav we see that toggle nav has
been triggered and although now shows
itself as false right now that's because
we're at this point in time if I click
down here you'll see that nav is now set
to true so it provides this overall
state tree right your entire application
State it allows you to connect into
these dev tools but at the heart of it
there's sort of a lot more principles
that sort of make redux what it is for
instance this object here that contains
the entire state of your app it never
gets modified and you think well how
could that be because I just saw you
open that nav and this became true well
that's true but if we go back in time by
selecting any of these acts
right any of these things that we did
such as toggling the navigation what
we're getting is the entire state of our
application at that time
so what redux does is instead of
modifying the state
it actually takes the current version of
the state modifies what needs to be
modified and returns a new copy of that
so every time your state changes an
entirely new copy of the state tree is
generated and that's cool because we can
do things like this time travel and go
back in time and we'll see before the
user data was loaded or if we jump right
here we can see when get products was
loaded or we can toggle our navigation
and this makes debugging and
understanding your app way way way
better we can have a much bigger
viewpoint of our app it's also easier to
test it makes a lot more sense for
organizing your app now on to some of
the criticisms of Redux Redux has been
said that it's too complex it's
difficult to learn there's a lot of
jargony things you hear words like
actions reducers store action creators
you know I mean there's a lot of stuff
that can really get people confused for
instance to pull off an action you need
first an action which isn't an function
at all it's actually an object right and
you need to dispatch that action which
in turn hits a reducer and determines
how to modify your state so it's not
simply just a this dot set state like
you typically get in react and therefore
people can feel like it's a lot of extra
code to do something that maybe could be
a little bit more simple now in the
level of tutorial series I definitely
address all of that I talked quite a bit
about the complexities of redux so if
you want to learn all about all that
stuff this series makes it really simple
we make things very very simple in it
however you know at the point is is is I
do feel like personally I do feel like
Redux is more complex than it needs to
be I do feel like it's very boat but
honestly any of the sort of
overly verbose code stuff well it
becomes worth it when you have a large
application or even a medium-sized
application that you need to have this
kind of vision structure and control
over because if you're managing
everything in sort of different ways and
keeping things all in component state
not that you should ever throw out
components de because I actually
strongly believe that if a component it
can manage its own State than it should
and then if other components need to
manage that component state then maybe
it should go into Redux I just think the
benefits of using redux are super huge
on large to medium applications and
outweigh the costs of extra files and in
sort of stuff like that so those are the
criticisms of Redux again that you can
think of it as essentially a system for
dealing with the entire state of your
application whether again that's
navigations open or things loading and
stuff like that
okay so again if you would like to learn
how to use redux and have your
application organized in this kind of
way this series goes into hitting an API
it goes into doing simple toggles it
goes into actually understanding the
concepts behind the jargon in redux so
if you're interested in that check it
out redux and react for everyone now
available also good documentation one of
the things I love about Redux despite
its saying things like it's predictable
state container it like okay some of
this stuff gets in the way of learning
it but this documentation is second well
maybe not to none because there's some
better Doc's out there but this
documentation is great there is some
really excellent examples in here they
get into practical examples and usage
and when you come in here you truly kind
of look at the code but you could
understand what's going on it even gives
you a whole bunch of recipes and best
practices FAQ that sort of stuff these
Doc's are awesome so this is a great
place to go either after you've taken my
course or another course on redux or
while you're taking it and maybe just
get an idea of some of the stuff if you
read the core concepts and motivations
you're gonna understand quite a bit more
why you would want to use it
Redux okay so that's what Redux is and
you don't have to use it with react
that's just the particular flavor that I
have this course on so if you're using
view or angular or any of that stuff
no worries Redux is good for that as
well so yeah Redux AS org learn more
it's a library for working with the
state of your app and that state of your
app is basically all of the data in your
app as well as things are open or closed
any of that sort of stuff okay so check
it out redux is org level of tutorials
icon forward slash doors and then just
check it out the product is redux in
react to everyone it's also available
for subscribers so sign up to become a
LevelUp pro also I actually just dropped
seven new free tutorials last night on
level up tuts calm you can see them
right now in the uploads or in the new
tutorial section on full stack graph QL
with Apollo meteor and react so if you
are looking to learn those technologies
together which are really cool I'm gonna
be doing another video on what is graph
QL but doing it on what is Apollo and
that will be talking quite a bit more
about this stuff which I firmly believe
is the future of data loading in web
applications so check out that series if
you're interested it's up the entire
things gonna be for free seven videos
around now many more coming very super
soon so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
