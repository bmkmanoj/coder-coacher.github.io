loved HUDs and today we're gonna be
talking about something in CSS that is
really important but not quite
syntax E and we're not going to be
showing like a new property or something
but we're going to talk about grouping
selectors nesting selectors and the sort
of dry approach to writing code and
which is the dry approaches this don't
repeat yourself it's an acronym and
people often use it to say you know is
your code dry or something like that but
it is really just means why write the
same line of code twice when you don't
have to and CSS is really awesome at
providing some useful tools to allow you
to write really nice dry CSS okay
so one of those we're going to get into
is the grouping selectors and nesting
selectors so you'll see an example right
now so let's go to our code here from
what we had before we have some of the
stuff let's say we had let's say the h1
and for the fun of it let's just add an
h2 they're always going to h1 at the h2
and the paragraph the color is always
going to be blue so we can write this
color blue ok color blue so as you can
see here
yeah sure enough when i refresh the page
the color is going to be blue for all
three of these items but what I had to
do is I had to write this three times so
let's refresh and sure enough they're
all blue but there's a better approach
to writing something like this and you
don't always want to take this as far as
you can but in an example where it makes
sense like this where we have three
things that they all have the color blue
the only thing that differs is this has
a specified font size of 14 and this has
a specified font size of 30 but there's
nothing really in here well we can do is
we can use commas to separate those and
write them on one line the way we would
do that is to be age 1 comma space and
then H 2 comma space and then paragraph
and then here we can have our brackets
and we
we're gonna do is we're gonna copy this
color blue or cut it out throw it in
here now I'm going to delete the color
blue I'm actually gonna delete this h2
tag altogether because that's the only
property it had and so now if you look
at this it's saying our h1 h2 and
paragraphs have a color of blue where
the h1 font size is 30 pixels the
paragraph font size is 14 pixels so
let's refresh this and nothing changes
it gets those properties the exact same
way as if we were to write them
individually so this is really great
because we didn't have to write all that
code it saves you some time but more
importantly it keeps the mortgage keeps
things organized and lets say you know
we don't want the paragraphs to be blue
after all we want them to be green well
it's really not that difficult we can
just say you know color green and not
only if we leave it like this sure this
will overwrite it but I mean you might
as well just take this paragraph out of
here to save it but really it's not that
it's not like a pattern that you're
stuck in you can just you could change
it and use it how you want but it works
really well at keeping your code nice
and organized
another thing you may have noticed is
that if we want to drill down and to get
something let's say we want them anchor
inside of a wrapper all you have to do
is the class space and then the object
or you could you know let's say there's
more classes within classes within the
classes you could always just do class
you know class space class space class
or if there was an object that had two
classes applied to it let's actually do
an example on our index on the wrapper
I'm gonna add another class of main to
this and let's say we wanted to target
the wrapper that is main you could say
wrapper and then look out a space main
save it we refresh your page you'll
notice nothing has changed so if you
have this dot immediately following your
class or the ID immediately following
your ID or whatever it's going to attach
it it's gonna say the wrapper that also
has a class of main but if we put the
space here it's going to say
the item with the class of main inside
of the wrapper class okay so there's
that distinction right there also and
another quick thing to keep your code
dry I'm going to show you a nice
technique let's say everything that's a
warning on the site is going to have a
red background in white text so we can
make a class called warning or could
spell it correctly okay so we have a
class called warning and it's going to
have a color white it's gonna have a
background of red which is super bright
of course we have nothing on our page
right now that has the class of warning
let's say we wanted this h1 to be a
warning class will just say class
warning and then let's say this
paragraph down here is also a warning
paragraph so we'll give it a class of
warning so I should mention that you're
only going to want to do this with
classes IDs an ID identifies an element
so you're not gonna want to have the
same ID all over your your document here
but it using classes is a good way to
style things that look similar even
though they may not be in the same you
know this h1 has what like a font size
of 36 pixels or something this has a
font size of 14 pixels so these aren't
the same things but they're both of the
same class they're both warnings so
let's check this out and see what
happened so of course these have both
turned color white background red
without affecting the other properties
so these are some tools to give you to
write some dry code and you're gonna
want to practice writing dry code you
might not always see the patterns when
you're writing your CSS but it's
something that you can always look at
and you can maybe get better at and you
can see how you can write code and less
lines and keep it more organized so it
keeping your code dry and writing better
CSS izella lifelong journey you'll
you'll get better and better the more
CSS you write so I really did just
select suggest trying to see how you
different ways you can write your code
and but as long as it's readable by you
and it's not
you know making your life more difficult
okay so keep it dry keep it simple and
try out these new ways of using CSS to
style your stuff as always if you have
any questions leave a comment in the
video has a bit Twitter love up Tut's
listeners you're thinking once again
this is Scott and thanks for watching
