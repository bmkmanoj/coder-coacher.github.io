level of Tut's and today we're going to
continue talking about the backend of
WordPress and now we went over the first
few options here our dashboard post
media pages and comments and now we're
going to talk about appearance plugins
users tools and settings now many of
these things will have more in-depth
tutorials later on specifically about
what you can do with the entire power of
them but right now we're just going to
talk about generally what you can find
in these sections so let's go ahead and
click appearance here now you'll notice
there's a lot of things under appearance
we can change our theme notice how the
one we have is 2014 there's also 2013 we
can activate just by clicking on this
activate or see a preview with this live
preview button you also see the 2012
theme down here or there's a big add new
theme button notice how we can also get
to this add new theme button right here
or we can search through our installed
themes customize allows you to change
components of your theme
now not all themes will have a ton of
customization options but themes with
this option will have these options here
you can see the title and tagline you
can modify here although there's other
places you can modify that as well the
colors you could select a title color if
you saw one and two now we have a red
title we could also select a background
color we could have a background image
if you'd like or you can upload a new
one under static front page you could
set to be your latest post which is the
default or you can select an actual page
selecting an actual page lets you choose
the page you want so we have sample page
here and then you would then pick
another page for your posts page since
we only have one we wouldn't want to do
this quite yet now featured content is a
way to say what your layout is you could
have it be a slideshow or grid and this
is content with the featured tag now we
don't have any posts with the feature
tag quite yet so we're just going to go
over exactly what you can do with that
later and keep in mind this is specific
to this thing
now I'm going to click cancel cuz I
don't want to actually keep those
changes we also have widgets which are
things that are built into WordPress or
that you could have as plugins that you
could drag and drop into places of your
site notice how we have a sidebar a
Content sidebar in a footer area and
these areas are built into the theme of
your site now when you download new
themes they might have different widget
areas and if you're building themes you
can bring your own widget areas now if
we wanted to have a calendar or maybe
categories or pages listing or a tag
cloud all we have to do is drag and drop
these into one of these widget areas we
can give it a title and we can check
some options also we could click delete
you know just remove it from this widget
area and then it's back here we'll go
over more about these widgets in the
future menus is a listing of our menus
notice how we don't have any menus right
now the menus area is quite large and
there's a lot to go over here so we're
going to talk about this more in greater
detail later but just know that you can
create new menus and add pages to menus
here the header section allows you to
select an image for your logo change
some header text showing you what the
header text will look like and allows
you to change the text color again this
is based on your theme and if you are
familiar with CSS or any of those
styling front-end coding languages or
anything like that you might want to do
all your styling through CSS rather than
the appearance settings in your theme
again with background this is some of
the same things we saw with customize
where it allows you to upload a
background or change the background
color and editor is where you can
actually edit the text files for your
theme if you have PHP experience you can
go ahead and modify the PHP files here
directly or you can modify the physical
file on your own and your own text
editor a different way and we'll go over
that process later but if you maybe want
to make a quick edit or something you
come in here and do that here now next
up we have plugins this is where you can
see what plugins come with a
press which is hello deli it's not a
plug-in that just symbolizes hope and
enthusiasm entire generation summed up
in two words so basically it just exists
it's an example plug-in it puts Hello
Dolly a lyric from Hello Dolly in the
upper right hand corner of the admin
screen if you wanted and to activate a
plug-in you just click to activate like
this and then now we have well Hello
Dolly up top here deactivated again we
can click the activate in the remove we
can just click delete we could also find
new plugins by clicking add new here and
we can search or use the tech club to
find types of plugins we want to find
for instance if we wanted something that
brought in a facebook like like button
or something that we could click
Facebook and we see we have a Facebook
wall integration social integration that
sort of thing and you could click
Install Now to install those widgets
again we have editor which allows you to
edit your various plugins now this is
only for people who have experience with
PHP or CSS or JavaScript if you come in
here and start editing your PHP files
chances are you might break them
especially if you don't know the code so
next we have users and this is all the
users on your site just like content or
posts or ethic that we have a listing
where you can have bulk actions you can
change the roles or you can edit your
users oh and you can add new users right
now we just have one and it's at an
administrator if we click add new down
here or up top here we're going to get
to a forum which allows you to add a new
user and they can be a subscriber
contributor author editor or
administrator and now these roles out of
the box all have different implications
and we'll go over what those
implications are you can even change
what access these users all have now
your profile is really just talking
about your personal profile you can
change the color scheme so right now the
editor admin color scheme is this if you
wanted to change the color you could
have it be any of these I personally
like a lot of these so I'm going to
change mine to midnight because I like
the way this looks and now we can scroll
down here and just click update profile
now my admin theme is going to be using
this orange
from now on next we have tools now tools
is just some stuff that can help you out
we have this press this drag-and-drop
bookmarklet that you can use to actually
post content from other pages from
anywhere you're browsing something and
you want you see something you want to
grab so you can use this bookmarklet to
use we also have a categories and tags
converter that's if you wanted to
convert the two across each other
there's also import tools so we can
install something that allows you to
import your live journal or your blogger
so that you could come from something
like tumblr and move to WordPress
there's also export where you can export
all of your content into an XML file
which you can then use to upload
somewhere else or do whatever you like
with it next is we have settings and
settings is really just your site
settings in appearance I mentioned that
you would have somewhere else where you
could change the site title and tagline
and this is most likely where you'd be
doing that not within your appearance
customize so if you want to edit
something like the name of the site or
the tagline so we could have this be
free tutorials for everyone like that
now that's our new tagline you could
also change the administrator's email
address or the site's
email address I suppose but it is the
admin administrative email address of
the site you can change the membership
status whether or not anybody can
register or not you can change date
format basically a lot of stuff here now
if we click Save it's going to say your
settings have been saved next we have
writing now these are your writing
settings so these settings will be
anything that has to do with your posts
it gives you another access to this
press this bookmarklet you can set a
default post category a default post
format you can post via email here's
some settings here and we'll go over how
to do that in later tutorials
reading has to do with how your content
is displayed now again we in the
appearance customize we were able to
change things like
this front page display where you could
have your posts not be the home page and
the home page could be a page that you
create through pages here now you could
also do that here and again this is most
likely where you'll be updating that now
blog pages will show at most ten pages
we could up this to anything we want
syndication feeds show the most recent
ten posts and these things are all
pretty standard unless you have needs
for otherwise you can change them at
your discretion now you can say for each
article in a feed show the full text or
just a summary now if you didn't want a
search engine to see your site you could
click this check box and it's going to
discourage engines from indexing but you
probably want search engines to index
your site anyway so it's better just
leave that unchecked now discussion now
discussion these are essentially your
commenting settings now you can go over
these at great length but these allow
you to control exactly how comments are
made or post on your site it actually
allows you to 2d choose default avatars
as well if you'd like and it's pretty
cool basically it allows you a lot of
flexibility and it's really easy so go
ahead and look through these commenting
sections or settings and make sure that
the right people are allowed to make
comments on your site and they are set
to be the right things
now media is how media is going to be
handled you can choose your thumbnail
size medium size and large size you can
also organize you can also check if you
want your files organized for you and we
can save these changes here permalinks
is how the urls are going to display in
your site right now our URLs are going
to display as slash question mark P
equals and then the ID of the content so
let's go to the front page of the site
if we were to go to a blog post right
here you'll see since this is the first
blog post our URL is question mark P
equals one now it's common to not have
these these queried URLs and you want to
have nicer looking URL so you could pick
which one you want you can even choose a
custom struck
sure which will be going over later and
for now I'm just going to have post name
that way we have a nice URL with the
title of the post now there's some
optional stuff here but we're going to
go over URLs in a bit more detail later
so let's click Save now when we come to
our front page click on our post you'll
notice our you are actually says hello
world now instead of P equals one which
is quite a bit nicer now keep in mind if
you you know want to focus on your
content editing you can always click
this collapse menu and it makes this
nice small menu what's really great
about this WordPress theme is that it
makes it really nice and friendly to
mobile notice how when this gets shrunk
down here we can click on this menu here
to access the menu go to our post or
something all posts and this is a nice
interface for modifying than your phone
if you have to so WordPress really
excels in the user experience especially
on the administrative section of the
site so this is the tour of the backend
as always there's a quick access menu
here if in case you want to add new
media post pages or users and there's
some additional stuff here and there
that we'll go over in due time so as
always if you have any questions this is
