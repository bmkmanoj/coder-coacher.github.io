running we have a project let's get
going and let's talk about some of the
awesome features in vs code for instance
that we basically have access to any of
the things that we would normally have
in any of our other tech scissors if you
want to go to a particular file you can
always hit command P and then we can
just start typing now what I like about
this is it has your most recently open
files right here so if we were to type a
letter you can see it's giving us a
whole bunch of this stuff from the
meteor build folder I can exclude all
that stuff easily enough and we'll show
you that however it's nice because it
gives you the stuff that's most
important on top and then the stuff
that's less important as you go now we
can see here just you hit enter to open
a file now a common issue that you might
run into and using vs code is that
you'll notice when we open a file its
name is italicized right up top here now
this is a standard feature for mini text
editors so it may not be an issue for
you or you may be used to it just
opening the file straight up now if it's
at Alice eyes that means this file is
not open it means it's just a quick peek
now if we were to select another file
let's just select this app you can see
it actually replaces it it doesn't open
a new tab and we can select between
these and it never opens a new tab well
how can we get this to open a new tab
well if we click in it you can see
certainly not doing anything however if
we hit enter we get this so it's no
longer italicized and even if I undo
that change it's no longer italicized
and this file is completely open now
does that mean that this is the way you
have to always open a file now if we
double click on one of these instead of
just single clicking it you'll notice it
opens it up as well if we single click
on another file it opens a new tab and
if we head to the tab itself we could
double click on the tab and actually
keep it open
command W will close your tab and
command option with the arrow key left
and right will change your tab now if
you're used to atom
or sublime command and a number such as
command one is not going to change your
tab
so you'll find yourself or at least I do
because my fingers are so programmed to
do command one two three sort of thing
and you hit command one and you're going
to be a little annoyed but if you do
just command option and go left to right
that will still work for you so as you
can see here we have the sort of
differentiation between sort of peeking
in files and opening them entirely and
if you get confused always just look at
the tab bar itself and the italicized
text will tell you whether or not you're
peeking or you're editing a file at any
point you actually start editing a file
that you're peeking into right then it
instantly becomes a file that will stay
open until you close it so there is a
bit of differentiation there between
open files and peeking in files in case
you're just looking at the code now you
may be noticed if we hit command T it
starts with this pound sign if we were
to start typing you can see here what
this is searching for is a symbols so in
fact I started typing the word item and
you can see in this file there is an
item class so that comes up if we were
to select this and this were a long file
it would scroll you to this item class
however we also have items and imports
the API items and we have item 1 item 2
in these other things so it's looking
for various functions and classes with
the name that we're searching for this
can come in extremely handy carve I
noticed in larger projects it is quite a
bit slower and I usually just prefer to
jump right to a file however let's say
we wanted to go to the add items method
here wherever this is we could select
this and it jumps us and highlights that
line directly that's a really nice way
to get around your code if you know the
names to your methods and you're looking
for a specific function method class or
whatever it's going to help you jump
right to it
so like command P for files command T
for symbols and if we were to do command
shift P you'll get all of our
Frank commands now this is going to be
stuff that you're used to with sublime
text for instance and sublime text you
pretty much have to do everything
through this command menu in vs code
it's not necessarily like that we can
extol ins
extensions and do good stuff through
this toolbar do find and replace stuff
through there but we do have options to
add cursor above it below a line comment
debug we have two we have developer
options you can see we have Emmet
we have extensions we have files focus
full level get we can do anything you
would want to in vs code through here
and you might want to come in here and
do some stuff and you might almost never
open this to be honest I don't find a
ton of reason to come into the command
window here like this when you have
options over here or you get keyboard
shortcuts memorized but one thing I do
love is that the keyboard shortcuts are
right here if you need to know how to
clear your terminal it's right here now
if I'm in this file here on a hip
command back slash it opens it up both
here and here so it splits the window
keeping it open in both places a lot of
times I'll have like my styles over here
and my main code over here and I'll just
go back and forth now one thing you'll
notice is that we mentioned before that
command the 1 2 does not change between
tabs but it does change between windows
so if I'm in this left window here and I
hit command 2 you can see I'm now active
in the right window bad one sends me
right back and that will work if you
break this up anymore so come in 1 2 3
will change between all three of these
if you have a nice wide monitor this
gets really nice let's close this and
what's really cool here is that
sometimes I split open and have the same
file open just to sort of see code
elsewhere right let's say I wanted to
check out my container here while I'm
working up top here I can keep the same
file open and if I were to make any
changes it would happen in real time
over here obviously uh you know that's
important because because this is the
same file right you don't obviously want
to be and he's sort of different there
but either way this is a split window
now what else do we have up top here we
have these three icons this icon is the
split window which you can see is just
command back slash like we saw before
inside of here we have show opened
editors or closed all and right here is
something really nice if we click this
this is the show changed so what's the
difference between these well this is
essentially the difference what's
changed since your last commit and this
is where the file is now you can see
it's showing that we delete this space
and it doesn't have a line number that's
really nice about that is our line
numbers stay intact then we could come
in here and you could see this in real
time if we hit enter here you can see
that we've added a line here and just
like that we can see the differences
between what we've changed really
quickly if you're working on files a lot
of times you know you're working really
closely with git you'll want to know
exactly where your files are in the sort
of commit well how do we get out of this
view well we can click this icon right
here and that switches us back to our
editor view so in addition to the
changes view there's a lot of nice built
in git tools of which we're going to go
over in later videos so this is the
general interface for vs code this is
how you get around your files and sort
of how you use it really so in the next
few videos are going to be talking about
just some of the nice features and vs
code we're going to be talking about
some extensions themes whatever anything
that you want to see as always the Scott
would level up tutorials thanks so much
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
