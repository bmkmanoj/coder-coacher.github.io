up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to install WAMP server on your
Windows computer so that you can get
Magento up and running on your local
machine in fact you can use the same
video to get WIMP server set up to
install other web applications like
WordPress or Drupal or any of that stuff
that would be typically running on a
patchy based server so come in and check
this out we're going to go to WAMP
server comm and that's /en the /gn is to
get the english version of the site and
it looks like this if you're here you're
in the right place and we could click
download right here or we could click
start using web server either way it's
going to take us to this download
section now you're going to want to grab
whichever version is right for your
computer with these top two being recent
version of lamp at the time of this
video and we just have the 32-bit and
64-bit since I have a 32-bit I'm going
to click this one if you don't know you
should find out you can check that in
your system settings or something in
your system information I believe and
now in here it's going to tell you need
to download some things it's giving you
some warnings or whatever if you have
wimp a5 or something like that if you
don't I mean if you have that you PI
already know about this um don't worry
about it if you don't have if you don't
know about it then you probably don't
have it you don't need to worry about it
now we need to first download this
service pack which is Visual C++ 2010
service pack again get the top one for
32 bottom 4 64 I have a 32-bit I'm going
to grab the top one and then after that
you're going to going to go ahead and
click this download a directly button
here and this is going to take you to
the SourceForge page where you can
download your WAMP application your
webserver
and now the one says downloads it's just
going to you know
we'll have to just run this Exe so after
this is done downloading go ahead and
click on this Exe to run it and install
wimp and once that's done I will show
you exactly what we do next
okay so we have wimp downloaded and
installed and you'll notice that it's
running right now and it's running and
we have this logo down here it's a
screen W that means our servers are
online if your server if this little
icon is orange or red you need to take
your servers online so you can go ahead
and click this and do start all services
likewise we can click stop all services
to turn it off or restart all services
if we need to restart them now if you're
getting hung up and this is being stuck
in orange chances are maybe something's
using your port 80 I know people have
mentioned that Skype is a problem with
port 80 so you can actually come here
and click on this go to Apache and then
go to service and then test port 80 now
it's going to tell you what's running on
port 80 now this is telling me Apache is
running on and it's course it is because
our web server is green but if yours is
orange it might have something else
that's running here and because I can't
be sure what anybody else's systems like
I can't necessarily tell you what kind
of problems you'll have so if you have
something running on port 80 here go
ahead and Google it and I'm most
definitely positive there will be people
telling you how to get that to stop
running on port 80 so you can free that
up for your webserver okay so let's
close out of that we have our ramp it's
green it's running and so what do we
have here we have basically we have my
sequel with PHP and Apache right and you
can stop any of these services or
restart them just by going to their
folders here and clicking stop service
restart service and that's pretty darn
awesome we also have a if we go to
localhost here this is a quick link to
just your localhost page which is going
to tell you a little bit about your
configuration
it's going to tell you what extensions
are being loaded and you can go directly
to phpinfo here to see your server and
for your PHP information and if we come
back we can also go to PHP myadmin from
here you can also get that PHP myadmin
from clicking on the W and then clicking
on PHP myadmin now with PHP my MN in
wimp your root username is root and your
password is blank
so if I click go here it's going to just
allow us to login so now we have access
to PHP myadmin
our servers running and we should be all
set up so in the next video we're going
to download Magento we're going to set
up our server space and we're going to
get it all installed so that we have
Magento set up on a Windows computer so
as always if you have any questions
please leave a comment on the video or
hit us up at Twitter level up tuts
let's know what you're thinking we love
to hear from you thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
