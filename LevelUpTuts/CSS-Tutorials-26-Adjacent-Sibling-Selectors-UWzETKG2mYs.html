up Tut's and today we're gonna be
talking about adjacent and sibling CSS
selectors and you may or may not be
aware that these even exist or you may
use them and you may not know their full
power but really I think they're
excellent and the adjacent selector in
particular I use all the time in fact
the adjacent selector and the the
sibling selector are both compatible
with IE 7 and up Firefox Chrome Safari
and opera so you shouldn't really have
any trouble using them on your projects
unless of course you need to for some
reason to support ie6 but I don't think
people are really supporting ie6 anymore
so to get into it we're actually gonna
first do the adjacent selector now what
the adjacent selector does is it style
something or it applies the styles to
something immediately following
something else so for this example if
let's say we have this we have an
unordered list here and then a couple of
paragraphs than a div then another
paragraph let's say if we wanted to have
this very first paragraph after an order
or list so the paragraph just preceding
an unordered list to be styled we could
use the adjacent selector by saying ul
plus P now here we could give this some
styles by perhaps saying font weight we
could say bold and color blue now if you
look down here at the CSS or at the HTML
the rendered version of the code here we
now see we have this honored list which
already I'm floating the list items in
case you're wondering but the only thing
that's getting those styles is the
paragraph that's directly next to this
in the code and you can see it's on the
same level so this selector is going to
say
alright I'm a ul is the next item a
paragraph yeah okay then style it but
it's not going to do is say hey I'm
another paragraph directly after that
because it's going to look at the
element that precedes it which is not a
ul of course and it's not going to style
this now also it's not going to style
anything inside of something so if you
put a paragraph inside of a div and then
you were to say div P notice how it's
this this bottom text here that's
getting the styling and not of course
the paragraph within the div now what is
some ways you could use this well I used
to solve the time in let's say I have a
navigation and I want the list items to
be spaced apart now you've probably done
this before and maybe on your list items
you could have just said margin right 20
pixels or something here and now of
course they they each have a margin
right of 20 pixels but what's weird
about that is this last item it's still
gonna have a margin right of 20 pixels
and if you need this to fit inside of an
area or something it's just sort of
weird like you shouldn't actually have
this extra space at the end of here so
one way I really like to use the
selector I'm gonna go ahead and get rid
of this is to say li plus li and then
right here we can say margin left and
now we can say 20 pixels so what's going
on here is that it's going to look for
any Li that immediately follows an Li
and give it a margin left to 20 pixels
what that's doing is it's saying okay
first list item
are you following an Li no second list
item you following it ah yes
third you following an LA yes all right
give you a margin lip so this way we can
evenly spaced out our list items without
having to have any extra spacing and
without
maybe give it a class of last and then
say hey last item you know you don't
actually have any margin right so this
is saving you some code here and it's a
pretty darn cool thing that I use all
the time perhaps you can find even
better more awesome uses for the
adjacent selector okay so next up is the
sibling selector now the sibling
selector is really similar to the
adjacent selector however with this the
however what the sibling selector does
is actually broader it looks for every
paragraph that's after a ul on the same
level so check this out if we had the
same sort of code we had before and we
said a ul and then the sibling selector
is the tilde so on it's the key that's
next to the number one if you do shift
and then we say paragraph right and we
did font-weight:bold and color blue like
that right so now you'll notice that
every single paragraph because it's on
the same level as this ul and
immediately followed well aunt not
immediately and following it is going to
be blue now let's actually name this one
in the side and what I'm going to do is
put this paragraph inside of the div now
what's funny here is that even though
this is a paragraph tag after a ul it
does not count for this because it's not
on the same level it's not a sibling of
it it's a child of a sibling so now it's
important to notice that while this is
broad while it doesn't do is it doesn't
go backwards so if we were to say any
paragraph that is after a div
essentially you'll notice that only this
bottom paragraph Cukor
gets styling because this isn't just
looking for any paragraph or something
like that and needs of course to be
preceded by a div so this is the sibling
selector it allows you to select
siblings and this is the adjacent
sibling selector and it allows you to
select the adjacent siblings so try
these out experiment with them by all
means use them they're supported so
check it out and see exactly how they
can help you today so as always this is
