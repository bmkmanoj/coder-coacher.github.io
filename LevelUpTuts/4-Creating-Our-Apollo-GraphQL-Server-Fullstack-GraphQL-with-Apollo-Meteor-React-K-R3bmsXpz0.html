up tutorials and in this video we
install Apollo into our site and we get
to create our first Apollo server so in
this video we're going to be simply just
installing all the stuff we need to
install and we're going to be creating
an Apollo server okay before I get
started here if you want to help support
level of tutorials head on over to level
of tutorials comport slash store and you
can purchase any of the series I have
available I have an excellent new series
on CSS grid many more coming if you want
access to every series I've created you
can sign up to become a level up Pro for
19 bucks a month and get access to all
of the series vote on new series and
every time a new one comes out each
month you'll get that new series as well
okay
so yep just that quick note a little
small self-promotion there and weirdin
we left off we had a basic reactor
alright so we did a little bit of
configuration here and all we're doing
is rendering an app component into our
ID this app component looks just like
this absolutely zero fancy stuff
whatsoever and if you're just joining us
by downloading the repo and getting
started right now this is it this is all
we got going and it's not too mad we
basically we set up a blank meteor app
and just got started here so what we
want to do in this video is get Apollo
installed and we're going to get an
Apollo server up and running now this is
going to do absolutely nothing for us in
the front facing version of the app
right now I'll show you just how easy it
is to get Apollo up and running inside
of a meteor project okay so what we're
gonna be doing is installing a whole
bunch of stuff now I'll make this
available to you but basically it's NPM
install - - save and we're gonna be
grabbing Apollo client graph QL Server
Express Express graph QL graph QL tools
and body parser now like I said I'll
make this available in the description
of the repo or something so that way you
could just copy
paste this this a whole list of stuff is
also available on the Apollo
documentation recipes meteor page that's
pretty much it
we just need all this stuff that might
be the hardest part about this tutorial
to be honest as typing all those
expenses or finding that list okay so we
have those new things added next we want
to add a new package to our meteor
packages so if we go to dot meteor we
want to go to packages we want to simply
add a package called Apollo now if
you're wondering if you already have a
meteor site up and running like can you
just start adding this stuff yeah
actually that's how I implemented in
LevelUp tutorials I was using Redux and
I was using tracker and I threw an
Apollo and you can get started with the
stuff incrementally if you want as well
okay so don't feel like you have to
start a project fresh for this so we now
have Apollo in here and let's check our
item we can make sure that everything
loaded you can see it grabbed the Apollo
package right here sorry I terms all
funky right now but in addition that
says meteor server restarted okay so our
servers restarted and if we head to our
app refresh refresh and nothing is
broken
okay now the next thing we want to do is
actually set up our initialization code
you'll remember in the second video what
we did inside of meteor import start up
dot client we created an index file now
inside of imports dot start up dot
server we're also going to create a
index file so index dot JSON tree point
to our app or at least the entry point
from the automatically compiled file
inside of server so in the root server
folder we're going to create another new
file which is just an it is this file
gets run when the app is initialized so
we can go ahead and simply just import
and we're going to just import from dot
imports start up and just server since
it's named index.js we don't need to
actually
reference the file here okay now to make
sure this index that J s file is
actually working
let's council lug hi and we should see
no log on the client side and on the
server side we should see a high okay so
that's the way you know that your file
is actually being loaded I mean there's
other ways to know but like this is
simple quick and dirty way okay
now let's actually talk about getting
started with our server because our
Apollo server is the thing that actually
allows Apollo and graph QL to work
together and eventually be available on
the client side as an API so so we've
gotten quite a bit of difference without
distance without talking a little bit
about graph QL and Apollo but what
Apollo does is it's going to replace
several things in your media or Express
project it's going to replace the API
part and we also are going to have
things called mutations which are going
to replace your server-side stuff your
server-side routes or in the meteors
case your meteor methods so well we're
gonna have some server-side code that's
going to be able to do all of our
grabbing data from the database and
choosing how to make it available to
Apollo or graph QL on the client side
and then once we have it all set up it's
going to be as simple as writing a data
container that has a query that pulls
what data you want if you've ever used
mini Mongo within meteor you'll know
that it's really really fun and handy to
be able to just query the database
directly from your client now I'm going
to hit an API and wait for that data to
come back and Apollo sort of expands on
that idea in a way that is much much
much better okay so what we want to do
here inside of our index that server
file is we're going to import two things
both of which are hard to spell we're
going to import and one is create Apollo
server I guess that's not hard to spell
it's just long and it's going to be from
meteor forward slash Apollo nice and
easy
next we want to import and this one we
aren't even going to use in this video
but we're going to want to have it handy
which is make
executable schema so SCH e/m a k from
and this is going to be from graph QL
tools okay so one is from meteor apollo
and the other one is from graphic u all
tools when you're first learning the
stuff if it's meteor apollo or graph QL
it's hard to sort of know what's graph
QL what's apollo and how it all works
together and you'll certainly understand
some of that quite a bit as we go here
but as you can see makes x could be make
executable schema is a package called a
graph QL tools palo server create apollo
server comes from meteor apollo now all
we need to do in here is run this
function we can say create apollo server
and we can pass it in an empty object
like that and check out your command
line make sure there is no errors on
your server i have no errors on my
server it started it loaded up fine and
if i head to my app everything works and
though this hasn't really done us a
whole lot what it's done is it's
actually set up an Apollo server for us
inside of our meteor app and and while
it's not connected the client to that
Apollo app just yet as in we're not
gonna be able to do client-side queries
just yet until we do some more things
all it's done is basically set us up
inside of this empty object is going to
be where we place things called
resolvers and type definitions resolvers
are you could think of a resolver in its
most basic sense this is not always the
case but you could think of resolver as
the thing that hits the database and
gets the data that's not necessarily
what it always does
but in our examples that's primarily
what we're gonna be using resolvers for
they're gonna be where you do your
database queries and then type
definitions or where you define your
schemas now we're gonna be going all of
these quite a bit depth what it sort of
means and how to use them in greater
lengths but type def s-- your schema
resolvers hit your database mutations
are what does things like updates
deletes and inserts okay so that's the
sort of the jargony stuff we have a
creative palo server nothing in
yet and the next episode we're gonna
change that with some hello world stuff
because who doesn't love hello world
stuff we're gonna actually kick things
off using our very first sort of Apollo
stuff or graph QL stuff by defining a
schema and have it be a hello world one
and then after that we're gonna quickly
sort of abandon that and actually hit
some real live database collection stuff
and use the second real full stack app
so check it out in the next video when
you get start where the first resolver
our first type definition and get this
going so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials thank you so much for
watching again if you want to help
support head on over to level up
tutorials calm and purchase something or
become a subscriber I would definitely
love that so thank you so much and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
