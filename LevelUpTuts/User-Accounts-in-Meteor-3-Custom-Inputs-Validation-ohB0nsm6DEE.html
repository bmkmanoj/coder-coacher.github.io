up tutorials in this video we're going
to be configuring our login system even
more by adding additional fields we're
gonna be adding select fields we're
going to be adding text fields I'm not
sure you how you can do all sorts of
stuff from custom validation to custom
labels placeholders and things like that
there's a lot here so let's get started
now okay so more than just overriding a
template we have access to a whole ton
of configuration to the meteor user
accounts package so in the official
meteor guide if we scroll down we can
see a line that says further
customization and under this it says the
user accounts guide to learn about the
other options if we click that link it's
gonna take us to meteor - user accounts
forward slash core on github and this is
a tremendous resource for figuring out
exactly what you can do here and you may
not have been aware that you have this
many options for actually configuring
the user accounts flow so let's go ahead
and talk about some of these things that
we can do so first off I want to go
ahead and say well we have email we have
password I want name in here - I want
somebody's name like your first name
last name so what we can do is we can
head to our code let's go ahead and make
a new JavaScript file I'm just going to
have this be accounts j/s and this is
just going to be for basic account
configuration in here and now what we do
is we have access to an object called
accounts templates and accounts
templates has some methods for instance
we can say accounts templates dot add
fields and this is going to be a
function that accepts an array now
inside of this array is going to be an
object or objects obviously because it's
an array now these are going to be the
actual fields we want to add here so for
instance we want to add a field that's
first-name so we can say ID
and then in a string first name this is
going to be the ID of the field itself
then we can go ahead and have a type the
type is going to be text because it's a
first name and we're going to have the
display name name be first name
okay so you can see how simple this is
we basically just have this function
head fields it's passing in an array of
objects instead of here we just have a
single object but we only are giving it
three properties ID type display name
and now if we come to our page and let's
refresh things you can see on the
sign-in page we don't have anything but
if we go to register we now have a first
name and it's even showing you that it's
set to optional so right now adding your
first name is totally optional but let's
say we are really demanding that this
first name exists so we want this first
name to exist let's go ahead and check
out this page here and if we scroll down
let's actually just search for this
research on this page for add fields you
can see that there's an ADD field or add
fields and we have access to a whole ton
of stuff if we want this to be required
all we have to do is say comma required
true an addition if we want to add our
own custom validation we can do so and
we even have access to an error string
so as you can see here at least one
digit one lower case one upper case and
we're using this re
which we have a regex pattern here
actually let's go ahead and copy these
two lines I know this doesn't make a ton
of sense for a first name but we can
make it make sense so if we can say the
error string must be at least one lower
case and one upper case letter required
and so now we just have lower case and
upper case letter required let's go
ahead and modify this regex pattern here
and I just get rid of this section here
where it's looking for a digit in these
parentheses I'm also going to be getting
rid of this six n period here okay let's
go ahead and try this out I'm going to
come to my site here it looks like it's
already refreshed when I click register
first name I'm gonna have like I'll just
lowercase letters let's go ahead and
enter a password and I think I already
have an account with this email so you
can do it level up tuts com okay now
let's click register and as you can see
we're getting proper error text that
says first name one lowercase one
uppercase letter required in addition if
we try to submit this form you can see
that first name is a required field
so we now have custom fields we have
custom validation we have required
fields and this is all with using the
the actual meteor user accounts package
so as I said you can do a really ton
amount of stuff without having to write
this from scratch and if you head to
this guide page you should be able to
see you couldn't have access to the
placeholder minimum length and we can
even run a function in here to validate
so you can see that this example runs
this through it is valid phone number
and we'll return if it's not a valid
phone number or not and so at this point
we now have our own custom field in our
accounts template with its own custom
error its own custom validation and
we're able to say if it's required or
not what's great about this is if we
only have one field itself this doesn't
have to be an array here we could have
this just be AB field you could get rid
of these brackets here and we're all
done we're just passing the Senate
object so AB field will add one field if
we check this out register you can see
it all still works
but add fields allows you to add
multiple fields all at once so I'm gonna
add this stuff back in not that and what
we can do is add a common here and let's
check out something else that we can add
I want to add a new field and this field
is going to be
the actual select list so let's go ahead
and check out the guide here and as you
can see if we scroll down you can see we
have access to checkboxes selects radios
and hidden fields I mean we have access
to anything that you would want here
it's just really super easy to be able
to have all of these things so let's go
ahead and if we wanted to go ahead and
have a new field where we could just ask
what type of user this was so we could
say ID and maybe ask profession so maybe
this is a web development site here and
we want to say this is a type of select
the display name is going to go ahead
and just say display name profession and
let's say we know our audience here so
we can say select a select is going to
have give us the option to have an array
of objects so we can simply just say
something like text and the text is
going to be what's displayed the text
will be developer and we also have
access to the value which will just be a
lowercase version of this we could even
have it short-handed if we wanted to for
some reason but either way we have text
developer value developer now let's go
ahead and have another one text designer
value designer because obviously not
everyone that signs up for your site
will be a designer developer so you can
just put those people under other so we
can now say value obviously if you knew
what your audience was like you'd want
to have as many options as possible here
for your own interests so as you can see
we have a selector takes an array we
have a value developer developer
designer okay cool so let's go ahead and
come in here and let's check out our
page now if we click register you can
see we have a select lists thrown in
here and says profession developer
designer other cool so this is just
really as nice as it gets here I mean we
didn't have to do anything we didn't
have to write any code other than just
some configuration text so you might be
surprised at just how many options you
have available here to totally customize
this login experience
cool so this is just adding templates
there's a lot more that you can do to
customize your fields and the next video
we're going to talk about some of the
configuration options we have along with
overriding text labels and things like
that so as always this is Scott with
