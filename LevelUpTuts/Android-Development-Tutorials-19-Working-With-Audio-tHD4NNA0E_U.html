of Tut's and in our last video we had
this cheer I mean this mp3 that started
playing the moment that we loaded our
amp or app up and now we're going to do
a little bit more of this so we only
want this audio clip to play when the a
button has been clicked so let's just go
ahead and cut this right out of here and
I'm going to throw it immediately on the
after the unclick so right after this
button has been clicked once it's on
click function is run we're gonna get
this cheer start it's giving me this
underline wanted me to change it to
final sure okay so here we are and let's
run our app I'm gonna bring my emulator
up front here then once our app loads
we're gonna get pushing this button and
we're gonna see what happens so I push
it and it's telling me to guess but the
same time it's cheering what happens if
I wanted to start playing again I'm
gonna click it I'm gonna click it I'm
still clicking it and you can see it's
not playing well that's because the
audio stream doesn't recognize the start
function or the start method here if
it's currently playing if your audio is
playing it's not start doesn't mean
anything to it because it's already
started so sure you could have it maybe
stop and then start but I think what's a
better way to do this is to check to see
if it is playing and if it's already
playing then we're going to set the
audio position time to be zero so that
way if we have this button we push it we
want to push it again to get the
cheering we're gonna check to make sure
it's not already playing and if it is
we're just gonna start it over at the
beginning so what we need to do here is
write a conditional and so let's space
down here I'm gonna write if
and then in parentheses I'm going to say
cheer dot and you can see some of your
options here is looping is playing well
we actually want to see is plank if
cheer is playing so if it's playing
so if cheer is playing if it is this is
going to spit out true so if it spits
out true we want it to do something we
want to say cheer dot seek 2 and 0 so
the 0 means it's gonna seek to the
beginning of the song so or they track
the audio file here so if the audio file
is currently playing go to the beginning
and then we'll add an ending else and
then right in here just have this over
just like that
so if it's playing then if it's already
playing then go to the beginning
otherwise start it so let's save this
and let's try to run this
okay so I'm going to click and every
single time I click this it's gonna
start the audio sample over perfect so
that's some way that you can make sure
that your audio files not playing let's
say you have an app that was triggering
like a drum drum hit or something you
wanted when they pushed a button that
was shaped like a drum or anything it
would make a drum sound well you would
want to check this because you would of
course want them to be able to keep
hitting it as fast as they wanted to so
the audio would keep coming as fast as
you could click it so this is just a
particular instance that this might be
useful to you so sure in this app
pushing a button to get cheering doesn't
really work so let's do something here
and let's grab this whole big chunk here
and we're gonna throw it right under
this if statement and so now if the user
users guess is the same as randos has
got it right it's gonna check to see if
it's off the cheer is already playing
and if it is it's gonna go at the
beginning otherwise it's going to start
playing our cheer so let's fire up our
app here and let's check it out make
sure it works
cool so now now now well not only do I
get the gratification of getting this
you got it right but I also get this
thunderous applause for my efforts so
cool we have an app that now does
something with their audio and it's
useful and it makes sense and and we're
learning a lot you know we can start
audio and if you guessed that if you
want to stop audio your command is cheer
dot stop then you would be right so
you've learned all sorts about audio and
getting it to work and interact with
your app as always if you have any
questions leave a comment the video
below hit us up at Twitter at local up
tuts you can have on Facebook we're on
Google+ a little bit I you know all
these things there's so many things to
check and this isn't our full-time job
so we're gonna check these as much as we
can we're gonna reply to you in an can
but as always you know we get a little
overwhelmed but please leave a comment
if we can't get to it hopefully one of
our viewers will who has the same
problem or has seen this problem so as
always thanks for watching this is Scott
and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
