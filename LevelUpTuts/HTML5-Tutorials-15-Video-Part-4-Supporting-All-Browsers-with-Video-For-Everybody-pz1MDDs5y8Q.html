up tuts and today I'm gonna show you a
neat little site called video for
everybody and video for everybody what
it does is it provides a flash fallback
for your html5 video and it's really
nice and easy there's even a generator
created for it right here and you can
see they have their specific example in
here already but we just want to take
our video file and throw it in here so
I'm gonna go to our code
I'm gonna grab just the path to our
video right here and I'm just gonna
paste it in for mp4 pasted it or not oh
gee oh GG because we don't have an OGG
version however I'm gonna paste it in
here for WebM and I'll just change the
extension for WebM and I don't have a
poster image I'm going to get rid of
that default that title will just be
welcome to level
tuts and we need to grab the dimensions
of this video so I'm just gonna go to
finder here grab my video and if you do
a command-i and give it information on
this video it's 480 by 270 so I'm just
gonna have this before 80 by 270 I want
to embed this as html5 Plus flesh we're
gonna be using the flow player just
because that's the default it works fine
and we don't want autoplay so everything
looks pretty darn good so now you'll
notice it spit out this code down here
what you can hide it whatever we only
want to grab the stuff in the video
convinient egg because that's really all
that we need the other things are just
links to download the video so let's
come back to our code and let's replace
this video tag with our new one and now
I'm just gonna punish it over here just
like this and we shouldn't really have
to modify anything because if you notice
it's pretty much the same we have our
controls equals controls which is just a
longer way of typing controls we have
our width 480 our height of 270 and we
have our source which is an mp4 which is
supported by Safari newer versions of ie
and
Chrome we have our web em so looks like
I this type this it says web for so web
em I'm going to change that down here as
well so web em and notice that we have
this object right here and this is a
flash object it's grabbing this
shockwave file from this address so I
mean in the event that they removed this
shockwave flyer file from availability
on this site you would probably be
screwed so you might want to host this
file yourself and change these addresses
however this works fine for this
particular example and you'll notice
that there's a value in here with our
video URL for our mp4 looks the flash
fallback is gonna be using our mp4 and
then we have a span that says no video
playback capabilities please download
video below we're actually just gonna go
ahead and mix that out because we don't
have that option at all and now you're
gonna see not a whole Lots changed if we
come to our page here and refresh it
still looks the exact same on Chrome and
let's pull it up on Firefox it still
looks the exact same on Firefox
that's because video for everybody is
going to first check to see if it
supports mp4 and if it does then it's
gonna use the mp4 and then it's gonna
check to see if it's sports WebM I mean
if it doesn't support them before then
it's gonna check to see if it supports
WebM if it doesn't support WebM it's
gonna go to the flesh and it's called a
flash fallback for a reason because
you're only using flash when you have to
it's an absolute last resort you're
using mp4 first and foremost and WebM
when you have to and then flash when you
absolutely have to
this covers newer browsers and older
browsers alike and your video should be
working across platform if now great so
this is how you can use html5 video on
any browser new or old so as always this
cover level up types if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video hit us up at Twitter level
