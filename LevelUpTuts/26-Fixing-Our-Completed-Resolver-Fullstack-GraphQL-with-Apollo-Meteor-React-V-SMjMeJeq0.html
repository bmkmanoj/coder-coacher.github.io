we're gonna take care of some problems
and some interesting things if you're
wondering about some features that maybe
aren't covered in the series don't worry
I'll cover that at the end of this video
so one of these things that we're
running into is this issue where well
every single new resolution that we add
if it has no goals is crossed out and
that seems like sort of a weird thing
right because if you make a new
resolution you don't automatically want
it to be cancelled so in our approach to
marking whether or not these were
completed we simply just said hey give
me all of the goals that were completed
right or we're not completed if there's
one or more then go ahead and give us a
false here or true so basically what we
want to be doing here is looking at this
completed resolver this is in the
resolution resolvers and what we want to
be doing is taking a bit different of an
approach well we could actually say hey
give me all of the resolutions or Oliver
I'm sorry all of the goals that are
completed and then compare the two but
the problem with that is really just
that it's that's to database calls and
database calls aren't the most cheap
thing in the entire world and if you can
avoid an extra database call why not so
one thing that we can do is simply omit
this completed is equal to false
entirely from our find and what we're
gonna be left with is well an array of
goals regardless if they're completed or
not and you can see that doesn't really
change the thinking for us yet because
they still have no goals
notice how I'm actually in the logged
out version of the site you have
remembering the logged in version I did
have some goals on some of these fact
let me just do that and just say maybe
one or two just so we can have some nice
test data to work with we can have one
that has a couple one that has and we
can get this one crossed out you'll
notice the whole thing is totally broken
now now at this point if we have a
no matter what the parent resolution is
not crossed out
okay so let's actually head back to our
function and what we want to do is we
want to filter out the completed goals
so we're gonna say Const completed goals
is equal to and then we're going to take
our current goals array and do a dot
filter okay if you don't know about if
you don't know about dot filter it's
essentially an array method here that's
going to go through each item in this
array and we'll have access to each
individual goal inside of a callback
function here and what we want to do is
return anytime simply a goal dot
completed so in this array we're simply
going to have all of the completed goals
and in this array we're going to have
all of our goals now at this point what
we want to do is simply compare whether
or not all of our goals is equal to all
of our completed goals so we could do
goals dot length is equal to completed
goals dot length okay as in if our
completed goals if there's five
completed goals and five goals overall
then this whole thing is going to be
marked as completed now let me linger on
this code for a second so you can see it
but let's head back to our application
and see why this still is failing it's
failing simply because for the same
reasons that it was failing before let
me actually go ahead and refresh this
you can see that when I make this work
out or this hello yeah work out gets
crossed out and again when I check
what's up test res does not get but when
I check hello so this aspect of it's
working great however these empty
resolutions are still crossed out and we
can accomplish this very easily we can
do so immediately after finding our
goals with this new method we can say if
goals dot length is equal to zero return
false
aka if there's nothing in the array
itself then hey this thing is going to
be false as and it's not completed we
head back here let's give this page a
refresh
so reruns are queries here and you can
see that now anything that we don't have
inside of it is no longer marked as
completed I can say new goal on this
resolution hit submit
check it off and now they're both
checked off so this certainly solves
that issue and you can see when I
uncheck these goals the parent is
unchecked as well so that definitely was
an issue with the previous
implementation and stuff like this is
gonna again show you that you have more
control inside of your resolvers than
you might think but always keep in mind
what kind of stuff you're doing like I
said we could have done a second
database call and that would have been
way more expensive than doing a simple
array filter here so check it out in
this code we are simply just again
checking to make sure there are any
goals and then if there are we're going
to filter out the completed ones then
we're going to compare the completed
ones versus the uncompleted ones
incomplete not uncomplete okay so this
is how we can make this resolved are a
little bit more bullet proof now in the
next couple of videos we're gonna be
talking about security stuff for
instance hey I'm not logged in but I can
still come in here and make an
unauthorized resolution okay like we
don't want people to just be able to
come in here without an account and add
to this global unidentified list of
resolution so we're going to change that
so in the next couple of videos we're
going to talk a little bit about
security stuff and how we can maybe
protect our API with both server side
and client side so as always this is
Scott with level of tutorials if you
want to learn more about graph QL I've
released a new series level to react
native with graph QL that teaches you
graph QL and Apollo inside of the
context of react native as well as
there's going to be a new pro series
called pro gatsby that's coming out this
this month for all level up pros or if
you want to learn about CSS I have a
modern CSS layouts course they you
is flexbox and CSS grid so as always
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
in the next one as we continue this
application and start seeing it end oh
and before I go I did mention at the
beginning this video I'm going to talk
about the finalization of this series
because this is sort of an impromptu
series this wasn't necessarily fully
planned out I do want to make it come to
an end so we're not at like 40 videos in
this thing and what I'm gonna be doing
instead of that is if you want to see
specific things like I know people are
asking for subscriptions or other sort
of stuff if you want to see specific
things in Apollo and graph QL please
leave a comment and gonna be doing mini
series that are maybe like 2 to 4 videos
long that all of the code is going to
come with the video then we can work
through it there'll be a better starting
off point that sort of thing or maybe
we're even gonna continue on from this
app or or do all sorts of stuff that
maybe isn't meteor specific to graph QL
and Apollo so let me know what you want
to see that stuff is all in the pipeline
as always this discovery little of
tutorials thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
