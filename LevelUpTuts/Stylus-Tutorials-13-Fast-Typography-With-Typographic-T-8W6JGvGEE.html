tutorials and today we're going to be
talking about typographic for stylus now
this is a really great package that
allows for some really great presets for
your font sizes you can essentially drop
in some sort of an interval and that's
going to set the font sizes for your
entire site so that they're guaranteed
to look good so check it out we're going
to get going on that right now so to get
typographic we just have to come to the
github page and as you can see there's
some more examples and things like that
on a quarry Simmons page here and we're
going to go over a couple of core
Simmons stylist packages and other
videos she does great work so this type
of graphic is a really interesting
stylist package that I happen to use all
the time especially when I'm throwing
together a quick mock-up or i'm working
on a side project and i don't want to
spend a ton of time designing this
allows you to design and browser really
easily by basically setting your font
sizes for you and it's going to make
sure that they have vertical rhythm it's
just going to be a nice a nice way to
set your font sizes so what we can do
here is we can first install typographic
and now again I probably wouldn't be
installing typographic globally on my
system because I'm probably usually
going to be using some sort of build
process like gulp or grunt or something
like that or even the code kit can like
take care of these things for you but
for this example let's do a pseudo NPM
install and then the package if we come
to Chrome here is just typographic and
I'm going to stall this globally so I
can use it on this project if you have a
node package and everything all set up
for your current project you can just do
NPM install typographic now we're going
to do is run the same command we've been
running except for instead of you noob
you rupture it's going to be you nib you
rupture and then we're going to do you
typo graphic as
well just like that okay so now it's
going to add on type of graphic as to
something else we're using okay now
let's head back to our project you can
see is that the first thing we need to
do is place this ad import type of
graphic at the top we didn't need to do
that for rupture but we did need to have
to do it for nib so we're used to this
at this point let's go ahead and just
paste this in here okay so we're now
using typographic now what this
essentially does is it allows you do
quickly use some fonts Tex and it
quickly loves you too quickly use some
presets and ratios to get some really
great typography so we have it installed
let's go ahead and see what sort of
presets there are do you have this like
T headers T presets there's this demo
here that you can check out but more
importantly let's come to what we have
the font stacks we have the presets a
ratios I'm just going to open these up
in tab so we can sort of see what exists
so you can see we have typographic font
sex and in here there's several serif
and sans serif so if we wanted a health
Attica fonts deck we could just drop
that in there likewise a future one so
I'm going to drop this future of fonts
back in here so how do we go about doing
that well since this is just a hate
variable all we really have to do is
come in here let's do inside of our body
we can just say font family and then
paste in futura we save this and with
just that variable we know not just have
futura but we have futura I've never
known how to say this font i will so now
i'm going to try arial sans-serif and we
have all those fonts just by simply
using this feature up variable okay so
that's fonts tax it's essentially just a
variable of fonts tax there's also this
T headers mixin which you can use to
pass it in a a font stack and it's going
to make your header and body font stacks
differ the T headers mixin allows you to
change
all of the headers so essentially h1
through h6 and have those same fonts so
if we wanted to do that we could just
simply throw this in here and just say T
header headers and then paste in future
up we can save that now what you'll see
is that we have h1 through h 6 i'll set
to font family futura likewise we can
modify that to say Helvetica and it's
going to use the different fonts deck
instead we have Helvetica new have
etiquette arial sans-serif okay so this
is just setting your headers so now
let's actually check out some this T
presets mixin which is actually going to
be the meat and bone sort of why you
would use typographic if we come in here
at the very top of our document actually
let's do it below this normalized mixin
we can simply just say T presets and
let's just throw the number because we
can give it all sorts of presets you can
give them by name or number we don't
really know what this preset one is but
just to see what happens so when I save
this you can see we have some things
that have happened here we have h1 to h6
have been giving a martyr margin bottom
and top well then with some font sizes
and line-heights so 22 rims with the to
REM line height 175 with a 175 line
height now what happens if we change
this preset we can hit save you'll now
see that each one has a font size of 4
and a line height of 4 35 35 now what
are these presets we opened up a while
ago one of these tabs that was these
ratios and the ratios include our
various presets so to take a look at
this mix in what it's doing is
essentially taking our ratio and it's
scaling our font size based on whatever
ratio we're passing it now Cory was
awesome enough to include this ratios
sty L which is essentially some really
great ratios what we
here is a minor second major second
minor third major third so as you can
see these are all based off of musical
sort of intervals what we can do is
simply grab one of these let's say
perfect fourth which is a 1.33 three
ratio and we can drop it in here under
our presets and just a perfect fourth
now we're given every single font size
is the base size x I believe it was one
point three three three yeah so we got
two point six six six and this is going
to completely change your document
paragraphs list block quotes pretty much
anything text based so if you come here
you can see that this is sort of an
example of what you get what I recommend
is if you're designing in browser I like
to essentially throw this mixin in here
just try different presets out until it
really feels like what I'm looking for
out of a hierarchy of font sizes and
it's over I find it to be very
successful and getting up and running
really quickly now you can always
override things as you wish but really
it is a nice way to set up your document
with great font sizes now if we want it
to be responsive all we really have to
do is change the base font size and in
their example here they've shown that
they have the font size originally set
at 12 and then at various breakpoints
they're just changing the HTML base font
size by changing that font size since
everything's using rems here it's going
to responsibly modify those font values
based on your break point so 1.5 996
REMS at a base font size of 10 pixels is
going to be different than the same REM
value at a different base font size so
check out typographic it's really one of
my most used stylist packages it allows
some really great easy functionality and
hardly any configuration you essentially
just use this and if I may not use the
font stacks presets that often because
I'm usually using whatever fonts
I would like for this project I almost
always use this presets to design and
browser and sort of figure out what a
good flow for my font sizes are great so
in the next video we're going to be
talking about jeet which is my favorite
grid system for stylus it's very very
nice so as always this got with level up
tutorials if you have any questions hit
us up at level up Tut's at Facebook or
Twitter or leave a comment in the video
pretty much anything we love to hear
from you thanks for watching and we'll
see you in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
