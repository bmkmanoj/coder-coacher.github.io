up tutorials and welcome to media react
for everyone and this series I'm going
to be showing you how to create
lightning fast modern web applications
using both meteor and react along with a
whole bunch of other packages and tools
so let's check out what will be building
in this series so let's check out what
we're going to be building through the
course of this series you'll be able to
create a resolutions page where we have
multiple routes animations between our
routes we have a nice animations in
between let's say we delete something
here and we get nice animations when
something's coming on so throughout
these videos you'll be able to create
this website using react and meteor now
there are some additional videos
available on stored at level up
tutorials com if you purchase this
series you not only get all of the
videos before they're available on
YouTube but you also get access to check
it out if I do command option you this
page is fully server-side rendered with
custom page titles for every single page
so great for SEO we actually have a
server-side rendered content and I'll
show you those techniques to getting
this set up with server-side rendering
if you purchase the premium video in
addition I'm also going to be showing
you how to use react router if you'd
like to use that however a server-side
rendering is not included there due to
restrictions of versioning right now
however so many other additional topics
that you get to learn if you purchase
this series now to download is as you'll
notice I have this up and running on a
couple of actual domains here the red
one here is running on a digitalocean
droplet now in the video showing you
this I create the droplet I point the
DNS I set up everything in deploy so you
can see it we even run through a bunch
of potential issues along the way so if
you follow that video exactly you'll
have a working meteor website on a
digitalocean droplet now I also have
this running in the standard purple
version on meteors own galaxy developers
hosting platform which is a great
solution and is way way way easier and
less painful than getting set up with
hosting on
Oshin or any other cloud VPS server so
this is what we're going to be building
head to the next video and let's get
started right now if you want to have
access to all those extra videos head to
store that level up tutorials comm and
purchase this series for digital
download
you also get code examples for every
single video as always thanks for
watching and I'll see in the next one
