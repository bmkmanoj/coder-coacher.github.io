up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be talking about HTTP requests in your
website and what you can be doing to
minimize the amount of requests so let's
get going on that right now okay so now
that we've talked about compressing
images let's talk about another easy
thing you can do to do reduce the amount
of initial page load now to illustrate
this I'm going to click this disable
cache I'm gonna reload this page using
the network tab this is just the home
page of level up tutorials and what you
can see here is that we have a whole
bunch of get statements right we're
essentially going to get a whole bunch
of things so we're getting a font we're
getting some more CSS we're getting a
couple of files here we're getting some
JavaScript files and we're getting some
images including a background logo some
of these images are larger than others
as you can see from this listing
starting right here at moderniser
going all the way down to this other
javascript file is quite a bit of time
spent loading javascript files but if
you look a lot of this time isn't
actually loading the file if you click
on this you can see that the blue part
is the amount of time it took to
actually download the file which was
four point nine five milliseconds so
downloading these of the JavaScript
files that are only thirteen kilobytes
or so it took no time at all in this 33
second 33 kilobyte file this one
actually took sixty point to six
milliseconds to download however every
single time you have a new JavaScript
file or new CSS file or a new image or
anything the browser actually has to
make an HTTP request to go get it so the
browser is basically reading your HTML
and saying hey we have this reference we
need you to go get the CSS file and then
it goes and gets it brings it back and
then loads it into your site now this is
totally awesome if you have all of your
JavaScript in a completely different
JavaScript file let's say you're working
on a wordpress site and you've just
a bunch of widgets right and each one of
those widgets is doing its own
JavaScript thing and has its own
JavaScript file and you're not adding
those files or concatenating them
together every single time it wants to
load one of those files it has to go and
get it and that process takes time so a
great way to performance optimize your
site is to reduce the amount of HTTP
requests overall now this doesn't mean
you have to get crazy and put absolutely
everything in one file right you don't
have to load all of your JavaScript in
one file in fact sometimes it might be
better for you to have a couple of files
if there's your JavaScript that's
changing a lot then you might want to
have that separate from a javascript
file that you're maybe never ever going
to touch and maybe you combine all of
those jobs per files that you're never
going to touch so that they can get
cached correctly and then you keep your
JavaScript file that you're modifying
frequently totally separate what I'm
saying is don't get crazy and it really
just forced all of your JavaScript files
into one however if you're going from
something like ten HTTP requests for
JavaScript alone down to four or down to
five that's a huge improvement and if
you go down to three that's an even
bigger improvement so you should be
attempting to reduce the amount of
requests overall so how can you
accomplish this well most CMS's actually
provide if not a built-in way of
aggregating your JavaScript and CSS
there's usually a plugin that will do it
so going whatever CMS package you're
looking for and look for the most
popular aggregation plug-in for
JavaScript and CSS in addition if you're
using a build process like gulp or grunt
or broccoli or any of those you can
actually have your build process
concatenate your files together and then
minify them while you're at it so
instead of having four separate CSS
files like we're seeing here you would
have one CSS file so what are some other
things that take up an HTTP request we
mentioned that images are also grabbed
via these requests and on this page we
only have a couple
of images if we were on a page it had an
icon set right and you had a whole bunch
of icons like we covered in the last
video you can exactly see why why having
an image sprite actually would do you
some good
like I said with the emergence of icon
fonts and stuff like that
CSS image sprites have gotten less
popular however the technique is
certainly still viable to reduce the
amount of image loads to reduce the
amount of image requests for instance if
you look at the sprite generator website
that I showed in the last video and if
you were using these icons without a
sprite the browser would have to go
fetch each of these six images totally
separately it says okay you got this one
go get it okay you got this one we go
get it and that whole process takes more
time than saying alright here's an image
that contains all six images go get that
one image that contains all six images
so reducing HTTP request can be
accomplished for your images via sprites
but that technique is mostly useful for
things like icons small images and maybe
not large things like this background
image maybe something like an a logo or
if these icons weren't an icon font to
these icons so when you run PageSpeed
like we did before you will see make
fewer HTTP requests as being one of the
main items in fact it's mad at me
because I have seven external javascript
and four external stylesheets and that
is too many on this site it's one of the
reasons I'm happy I'm going to be
launching a new site very soon and even
though my javascript is served up
through an aggregation plug-in in Drupal
and they're served from a CDN I'm still
getting hit on that from PageSpeed so
like I said you don't have to be crazy
about it this site this site still loads
really quickly it's all about taking
what you have and reducing the amount of
requests not totally eliminating the
amount of requests so as always this is
Scott with LevelUp tutorials if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment the video or hit me up at
Twitter or Facebook if you want to help
support level of tutorials head over to
the store level up tutorials and check
out some of our products we got a couple
of t-shirts men's and ladies we have
stickers and very soon we're going to
have
premium content on there to purchase and
download and watch a really cool
tutorial series that I'm working on
right now that I'm not quite ready to
enough so keep your ears open for that
as always thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
