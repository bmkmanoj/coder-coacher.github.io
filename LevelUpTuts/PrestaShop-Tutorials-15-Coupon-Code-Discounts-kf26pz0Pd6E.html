love huts and today we're gonna show you
how to set up a coupon based price rule
in your PrestaShop store so what you can
do is set up a complex coupon that maybe
only works for one user one time or one
user many times or that kind of thing
and maybe this coupon is limited to what
types of products are in their cart so
let's check it out we're gonna get going
by creating a coupon based price rule so
in the last video we saw that we could
create catalog parcels and cart price
rules well now we're going to get into
creating a coupon based price rules now
for the coupon codes those are going to
be carton rules so let's go to price
rules and then under cart rules let's go
ahead and create a new cart rule now
coupons can be as specific or
nonspecific as you'd like so you could
have a coupon that takes ten percent off
our entire order and that would be
really similar to what we did in the
last video except for we would enter a
code here instead of leaving it blank
since we've already done that let's go
ahead and make a bit more complex of a
coupon code so we're gonna say that this
coupon is valid once per use per user
and we'll get you five dollars off any
order of shoes so let's go say the name
of this is going to be five dollar shoe
sale and we get to say five dollars off
shoes with coupon now the coupon can be
whatever you'd like you could have it
even generate a coupon by clicking this
generate button and then it's something
that maybe people won't guess or try if
you want it to be a secret hidden thing
that you're sending it out via email
since we want this to be publicized we
can just say shoes with a Z like that
and that's going to be our coupon code
now we're gonna leave highlight at no
again because if a customer's not using
this coupon code we're not going to
necessarily make them aware that they're
not using it and partial use we're going
to set this to be no even though we
don't have any shoes that are going to
be cheaper than
five dollars we still don't want anybody
to possibly take advantage of this five
dollars off since it's not a percentage
based rule okay and we're gonna leave
status at a yes so next we need to go to
conditions now conditions limit to a
single customer we're not going to limit
this to any individual customer so we're
gonna leave that blank
the asserting time I'll start yesterday
and end it next Thursday the minimum
amount we're not going to put a minimum
amount because anybody with any order
can get this discount as long as they
have the coupon and four total available
we're gonna set this to a to a high
number so let's just say ten thousand
that way that will never use all of
those unless we of course get them any
orders then we want this to be higher so
that we could accommodate for our
customers however total available for
each user we're going to leave it one
that way that a user can only use this
coupon once off of one order now we want
to add some restrictions in here and so
we have some options carrier selection
customer group selection compatibility
with other curt rules or product
selection we're gonna select product
selection now we're going to hit this
plus button right here and it says the
cart must contain at least one of the
following rules and so let's add a rule
conditioning a rule concerning
categories so we want this to be
products and then let's click Add so now
we have the ability to say the products
that are matching one of these
categories are going to be allowed to
use this coupon so we can access those
categories by clicking this choose
button from here we can see our
categories let's scroll down and I just
realize we don't have any shoes in this
store so I'm actually going to changes
to a blouse sale so this is going to be
a five-dollar blouse sale so I've
selected the blouse category and I'm
clicking add so as you can see here the
only one in our selected is blouses and
let's click this big X
so now we can say categories allow it
our blouses now I'm actually going to go
back to information and change us to
five-dollar blouse sale and so there's
no confusion here and the coupon code
will be Bluffs is with the Z again okay
so now we have conditions are that the
category is a blouse each user can only
use it once and they have no minimum
amount next we have to go to actions
which we've seen already which is going
to be this time we're applying the
discount at a fixed amount the fix did
not being $5 and we're going to apply
the discount to the entire order so it's
gonna be $5 off your order if you buy a
blouse so let's come down here and click
Save great so let's check this out now
if we come to our store and we check out
in our cart okay you'll see that we do
have some we have two blouses in our
cart so we should be able to add this
coupon code so I'm pasting in our coupon
code which is under vouchers and the
coupon code is blouses with a Z okay so
let's go ahead and click OK
and if you scroll down you can now see
the attend of the five-dollar blouse
sale is now been applied and we have
five dollars off our entire order
because we've created this coupon code
and we have two blouses in our cart well
what happens if we remove these from our
cart let's go ahead and click the trash
icon here and get rid of both of these
so we just have these stickers in our
cart as you can see our voucher is no
longer applicable and if we try to apply
it again it tells us you can I use this
voucher with these products so a really
helpful error message for your customers
they know that their coupon code is
invalid great so we've now added a more
complex coupon base price code as always
if you have any questions or comments
that come in the
hit us up at Twitter or Facebook at
level up huts we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
