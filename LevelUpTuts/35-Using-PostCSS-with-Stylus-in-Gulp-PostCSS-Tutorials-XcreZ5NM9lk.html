of tutorials and in this video we're
gonna show you how you can add post CSS
to your stylist workflow and we're gonna
be using gulp for this example but it's
really just gonna be able to show you
how you can just easily chain on post
CSS at the end after you're processing
your stylist so this is gonna be a quick
one let's get started right now so in
this video we're gonna just be showing
you how to quickly get up and running
with gulp stylist and using post CSS so
that way we can have our stylist compile
and quick and have our post CSS then
then compiling afterwards that way we
can take advantage of features from both
of these such as some of the great
packages that are available for post to
CSS and now what I really like about
this is if you already use a stylist or
you already use sass you can still take
advantage of these features without
having to abandon your current workflow
in your current process that you're
already using so we can go ahead and
install this gulp styler simply just by
NPM install - - save dev space gulp -
stylist it's going to install gulp
stylus into our project okay now after
that's done we can go ahead and require
gulp stylist like so let's head to our
gulp file now in the last video I had
added gulp sass and since we don't want
the stylist ancestor I'm gonna go ahead
and just delete all of these sass lines
for us and let's come here and now we
can say var stylist is equal to require
gulp - stylist now this one's going to
be really quick I'm telling you so we're
just essentially changing this pipe in
statement here so before post CSS we
want to run our stylist processing so we
can do stylist like so now that we are
running our stylist processing we want
to change our styles to sty L okay and
we'll want to change that here as well
as Tyl when we're watching for files and
mitts make go ahead and head to our sass
file here let's rename this to styles as
CSS - st yl
now let's go ahead and take advantage of
some of the stylus stuff here and let's
set the background to green so as you
saw before what it did is it converted
our sass to CSS and then it used post
CSS to minify our CSS so let's go ahead
and see exactly how that's working for
stylus as well what we can do is come to
our terminal and run our gulp styles
command gulp styles and as you can see
when we head back to our Styles dot CSS
we now have the body background of green
so as you can see it converted our
stylists into CSS and then used post CSS
on that CSS so the past two videos have
just been showing you how to use your
favorite preprocessor with post CSS now
from here on out we're actually just
going to be using plain old CSS with
post CSS so no more pre-processors
although I should know in my personal
workflow I am using a preprocessor in
addition to post CSS now that's not
something you have to do but I have
certain workflows and things that I like
with my pre-processors already and I'm
really happy that post CSS doesn't mean
I have to give those up as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments if it
come in the video or hit us up at
Twitter or Facebook at level up tuts
we'd love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
