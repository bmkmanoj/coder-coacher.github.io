to see this email come into my inbox
where it's a welcome to galaxy developer
edition which is meteors own hosting
platform and when first released people
were thinking it was a little too
expensive for your average developer
however with the developer edition it's
way more affordable and at this point
it's invite only so I was really excited
to see that I got an invite so I'm going
to click this accept this invitation and
what I'm going to do is kind of what you
do with an unbox i'm looking at this for
the first time so this is going to be my
initial impressions and give you just a
quick look at what's going on with the
galaxy developer edition now if you'll
see it's priced at point three five
cents per gigabyte an hour billed
monthly what's nice about that is it's
sort of a pay-as-you-go you can push
button upscaling so that you can add
more containers to your account zero
downtime code pushes it includes SSL
support which is really nice no more
messing with an ssl certificate on your
own server and some basic performance
metrics so i'm not going to want to
share on this video so what i'm going to
do is fill this form out and then it
come back after I've filled these items
out so thank you for signing up it says
I'll soon be able to effortlessly deploy
and scale your meteor apps you'll
receive an email shortly from our team
that contains login and onboarding
instructions so once again I'm going to
take a break until I get this email
after i get this email will pick up from
there so in my welcome email i was given
four links one of which is status where
you can check meteors status so you can
see sort of you know maybe issues if
there's a bages or anything sort of like
that you can make sure that everything's
running as smoothly as possible now
here's a link to composed at i/o which
is a really nice database hosting
website this is actually where I already
hosts my databases but what's nice is if
you're subscribing to this meteor
developers edition account you get a 60
day trial period where you won't be
charged anything and it's actually
really really easy to database on
compose and to me personally I've said
have my databases on composed just so I
don't have to worry about security as
much right I don't want to have to worry
about hosting those databases on my own
server where they could potentially be
accessed where somebody like composed
iOS was taking care of all that stuff
for you and then you can just to set an
environment variable in your application
and have a look at this database so i
would highly recommend using compose if
you're hosting your databases somewhere
it's just easy setup now this one's for
configuring your dns which requires you
to login which is fine because i need to
login just to check this out anyways now
keep in mind this is my first time
logging in so we're going to see how
this works now already interface is nice
I you know that's one thing that always
sort of stands out is a nice interface
we have the menu over here or you can
get help in support I believe this will
prolly just take me to the current page
i'm on and then we have the status
report which is probably just going to
open up this page so you'll notice that
we have get started settings under
settings it tells you that your plan is
the developer you're currently using
zero of five containers and you can
contact them to update or purchase
additional containers now i'm sure a lot
of this stuff is going to be evolving
this is like I said a first look n and
as far as i know i don't believe a ton
of people have access to this just yet
so what we can do is check out what it
takes to deploy a nap so if we click
deploy your app it's going to give you
some nice tips here so we can check this
out a little bit here i'm just going to
open these in a new tab i like to do
that have the stuff open so you'll
notice that it basically tells you to
set up your environment variables so
that we could have something like our
Mongo URL and stuff like that along with
our root URL and it says to do it like
this use galaxy meteor calm because
that's where galaxy is going to be
looking for these values so if you want
specific values for your database or
maybe your composed address and stuff
like that you would have it in your
settings file as galaxy meteor calm env
and then we would have our root URL our
Mongo URL that sort of stuff
now this isn't going to be an in-depth
how to get your site going on galaxy or
anything like that so I'm not going to
go too much in depth here but what I am
going to do is try to throw up a site on
two galaxies and just check it out and
then in addition over here we have some
configuring your MongoDB and since this
platform is built on meteor you'll
notice I didn't have to re login over
here which is nice but we have here is
basically telling you where to point
your dns settings so i'm going to go and
try to push a site to galaxy and then
after that's up i'll head back here and
check out and check out what my
dashboard looks like then so i just
deployed a nap i deployed it four
minutes ago and as you can see we have
bboy tools com now this is one of the
first meteor apps i even made so there
are probably a lot of optimizations to
be made here so it's not exactly
something I'm working on so keep that in
mind when watching this however what you
can see here is after deploying which
the process was really easy one command
basically the same type of process you
use for deploying to meteors free
servers however you use some environment
variables and stuff like that I just
followed the documentation and it worked
correctly so if we select this you can
now see some activity about overall for
bboy tools com that's actually head to
the site here so luckily my dns
propagated really quick in the site's up
and running this is a site i made to
help me remember my dance moves for when
I'm practicing and stuff like that also
gives me some tools for when I'm
practicing like a clock that sounds an
airhorn every 30 seconds so as you can
see everything's running really smoothly
and if we head over to galaxy you could
see that it's using up thirty one
percent of the memory got two people on
it let's check this out you can see you
have nice access to your CPU your memory
how many clients are on the site and
this is for the past five minutes now
you could probably check out the hour
one day but it says that you need to
update your plan to get those additional
metrics either way this view gives you a
nice snapshot of where your app is right
now we can head over to containers you
can see that i'm using one container and
one is running
available if I wanted to use two
containers I could hit this up and I'm
now using two containers so you'll
notice it's scaling these containers up
and it's sort of setting itself up so
I'm just going to let it do that you'll
see you have some indicators here we
have an updating you can head to see
your logs which is really nice we can
see all or just errors if we'd like I
don't have any errors right now which is
great and humble I would click settings
however contains your settings that JSON
file which actually contains my database
information so i don't really want to
make that public allows you to turn on
an ssl or just start or stop your
application so you can see I now have
looks like the second container is up
and going but as you can see the
developer edition of galaxy I mean the
tools in interface here is really nice
if you were hosting this on your own
server like I am for a lot of my apps
you don't necessarily get a lot of this
performance information or anything like
and it's nice to have all your logs and
everything here I mean this just feels
like more of a legit hosting platform
then trying to roll everything yourself
maybe and this is just an easier hosting
platform than necessarily trying to set
everything up yourself I've set up a
couple of digital ocean servers myself
in law I love digital ocean and use it
for just about everything this was way
easier for setting up a meteor
application and as you can see here this
site is really cruising so let me know
what you thought of galaxies developer
edition I'm excited to play around more
with it I'm going to throw a couple of
other sites up on here and I might even
do some optimization to bboy tools com
because I'm sure there's a lot of work
there so as always this is scott with a
love tutorial so if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video hit me up at twitter or
facebook i love love tutorials i love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
