Tut's and today we're going to continue
our knowledge of the expression engine
channel entries tag in this tutorial
what we're gonna cover is listing a
single post on a page so this is
something that's a little bit advanced
but um I think it's obviously something
that you're going to need to know for
your site so thus far what we've covered
is outputting a list of multiple posts
but say you want to list a specific post
on a page well I mean you might think
well I can just you know set the limit
to one whoops goes one an update to get
an update in my favor if I'm sure that's
one but say the story that you wanted to
show was the third story well the way
that we're gonna go about this is we're
actually gonna want these posts just
show up on a specific template so maybe
that temple it so maybe on on this
template we we're gonna output just all
of the posts and then we're gonna link
them to sort of like a detail page so
what we do here is we use a parameter
which is called the title permalink it's
actually not a parameter so much as it
is a single variable tag so the way that
this works is you pass it or you can
pass it a template group and template so
this is exactly what we're going to do
so um I like this so I can save a couple
characters and I'm gonna say
aah ref I'm gonna put this inside of a
curly bracket that's very important and
I'm going to say that I want to use the
sight detail template now this detailed
template doesn't actually exist yet I'm
so we're gonna get to that in just a
second here so we're gonna say sight
detail this close and then um this is
closing that part of the anchor and
closing the edgar as a whole so i'll go
ahead and hit update refresh we should
see a list of all three one two three
and they're hyperlinks so if i were to
click through here um it's actually just
loading the home page but you notice
that the URL is now sort of being just
index dot PHP its site detail and then a
template so now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna create this template so um i
grab this code just i don't want to
retype it i'm gonna go to the template
manager and now within the site template
group because that's what i specified
inside of that index template i'm gonna
create a new template
I call it detail here actually I could
have said I'll just do this copy the
index I'm gonna create and then edit so
how much creates it and leaves it open
and now what I can do is on this page
we'll get rid of the oh wow it's really
gonna list one thing here so therefore
we're also gonna get rid of the Li let's
go ahead just play the body
and let's see here yeah that's it I'm I
can even mess with the limit so and
maybe also on this page we don't need
the anchor tag so we're just gonna have
the title in the body so we hit update
now I go back hit refresh here we go so
now it's using the site this is the
template group detailed template and
it's passing it this thing here and this
is that URL title so that item um see if
I click on the right one here yeah
sample story so if I go back to edit
this entry you'll see the URL title
right here sample - news - story same
thing right here um expression engine
one of the expression engine channel
entries parameters is called dynamic and
it has by default it's on but the other
value that it accepts is no and actually
it also accepts off but no it was
actually the correct setting if you
wanted to turn something off and so
basically what's happening here
um it's not quite using that is
expression engine if you remember one of
my earlier tutorials where I talked
about the URL structure and of the vital
role that it plays an expression engine
so what it's doing is um it's looking at
the URL and it's saying hey this is a
URL title so because the dynamic Ram
parameter is set to on it it's just
pulling this story often times what will
happen is pre very first or even later
your expression engine sites is you'll
for to forget about that parameter and
it'll output something on a page and
you'll be sort of confused I can put up
output story three
and if that was the case you know maybe
um you know you you you accidentally
turned it on or turn it off or whatever
um so what you could do is this isn't
really a great example but now what I'm
gonna do down here is I'm gonna say like
no homepage host H for other stories for
example with um if I were to say like
you know in here honest and I want to
hope at all like some just some other
stories it doesn't matter um these page
fives why not
and so what we're gonna see is um a
dynamic on in effect so I said other
stories and then you gave me the same
story yet because it's still looking at
the URL so what we need to do is go in
and set this one to dynamic being oops
equal to no hit update
so what it's gonna do is gonna say hey
expression engine ignore all that
special stuff that all that magic that
you that you're gaining through the URL
it's going to honor it here but and turn
it off here so here we go so we're
seeing it being respected and then here
we're turning it off so that is the
basics of from one how to show a single
entry on a page and then also the powers
of the dynamic parameter thanks again
for watching all these videos there's
gonna be more coming soon so hang tight
and we'll just keep posting and thanks
