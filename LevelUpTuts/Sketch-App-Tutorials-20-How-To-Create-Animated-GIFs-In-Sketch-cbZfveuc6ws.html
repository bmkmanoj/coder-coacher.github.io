up tutorials and today I'm going to show
you how you can make animated gifs in
sketch so it's really easy essentially
we're going to create some artboards and
then using a plug-in for sketch we're
going to be able to convert those
artboards into an animated jiff or gif
depending on the way you like to say it
so let's get going on that right now so
to get this plugin I'm going to be using
the sketch toolbox app because really
it's the best way to give plug-ins for
sketch so what we're going to be looking
for is just Jeff if we can search gif we
will get and generate jiff also in just
a fair warning I will be continuing to
pronounce it as jiff rather than gif for
the rest of the video just uh be
forewarned if that is a trigger for you
or something so we can come here and
click install and now it's going to
download and add this plugin to sketch
so just like that it's already done we
come to our sketch app here and if we
select plugins you'll notice that we do
have generated jiff here and looks like
we have a whole bunch of options we have
loop 100 milliseconds 200 milliseconds
500 milliseconds loop with no delay and
then once with no delay once with a 1000
milliseconds so we have some options
here right so let's go ahead and
actually try to make something so what
we want to do is get working on creating
some artboards so let's go to insert and
let's insert a new artboard
or you can just hit a if you'd like and
let's make this something not too huge
let's just - 200 by 200 pixels make sure
that is 200 by 200 and now for the
naming we actually have to give these
two specific names so we can have this
be frame with a capital F oh one just
like that now what we want to do is we
want to create another one of these so
if you hold option click and drag it's
going to give you the ability to just
duplicate this or you can just simply do
command
now we have frame one and this one needs
to be named frame two so we can come
here if you click on the layer here you
can click rename and if we had the
option to rename you can just say frame
zero to notice that you can also rename
it simply by clicking on the name here
and then rename let's go ahead and
create more of those I hit command D and
we have one that's actually given us
frame three which is kind of close but
really not what we need we need one that
is named frame zero three so let's go
ahead just like that now if you're
wondering if there is a quicker way to
do this there actually is we can use
something called make grid which is one
of the options up here so if we select
our frame three let's go ahead and click
this make grid icon at the top and we
can say we want what fro of five columns
and that looks like a ten pixel margin
in between them that's all we really
have to do and just click make grid
you'll notice it's actually giving us a
whole bunch more of our artboards here
and it's displaying them nice and even
10 pixels apart so it's much more
efficient than sort of clicking and
dragging and duplicating so we can do it
this way instead from now on so let's go
ahead and get to renaming these instead
of having it be O three like this one
says or just three right now we want to
have this actually be O four so frame o
four okay so I'm going to go ahead and
name all these one through seven okay so
now that I have these frames 0 1 through
0 7 let's get actually working animating
something so just as a simple proof of
concept let's simply create a rectangle
here so I'm gonna hit R hold shift and
just make a square on this square is
going to be right here just like that
and I'm going to get rid of the border
give this a fill of just this Pleasant
blue color okay so now that we have our
rectangle here we can
made this rectangle sort of all around
now if you're wondering how we can get
the same rectangle into frame two we can
select this rectangle here or the
contents of frame 1 and we do command C
now the great part is if we click frame
2 and click paste it's going to paste it
with the exact same position coordinates
so from here we can actually move it we
can make it grow just a little bit so
let's actually take this Square and make
it grow okay I'm going to copy this and
now I'm going to paste it into frame 3
which we have here and now it's going to
grow a little bit more and I copy it
frame for now it's going to take up the
entire frame so let's just go ahead and
do that okay now that we have it here
I'm going to copy it once more now that
we have been pasted into the frame 5 I'm
going to go ahead and grab this and
start shrinking it down from the left
side copy it here paste into frame 6
continue to do that as we just make this
smaller this is going to be probably one
of the lamest animations you'll ever see
but it's going to be obvious what's
going on here so here we have our square
it's going to go from one corner sort of
to the next and that should be just fine
so we have frames 0 1 through 0 7 now
what's great about this is that we can
come to plugins generate jiff and then
we can say we want this to loop over 500
milliseconds that seems probably fine
and if we select this it's going to ask
where to save it so I'm just going to go
ahead and save it to my desktop here and
we're just going to call this square
jiff okay now that's on our export
complete message comes up we can come to
my desktop I'm going to go ahead and
click this and I'm going to open it up
in this preview and as you can see we
have this rather jumpy seven frame
animated jiff and it looks like it's
animating just fine now this animation
in particular might certainly benefit
from a higher speed let's come back to
sketch also I'm going to make some of
the changes
these may be a little bit more drastic
here so we have a more of a change so
just like that okay now let's go ahead
and generate a another one we can simply
come to plugins generate jiff and let's
loop it over 100 milliseconds once again
I'm going to just output it to my
desktop I'm going to overwrite this
square that jiff this time export select
replace okay now let's take a look at
our new masterful work of art we created
this jiff in seven frames
it's absolutely super easy to do it
couldn't be any easier and this actually
is a pretty cool thing maybe perhaps you
don't know CSS and you want to show what
you had in mind for the animating of a
particular UI element or maybe you have
a SVG icon you want to animate or just
any sort of user element you want to
animate well you can do this simply with
these artboards duplicating it and
making your animations this way by doing
your frames and being able to help put
an animated gif at the speed of your
choosing so this was nice and easy in
upcoming videos we're going to dive more
into various sketch plugins that are
available to check out generate jiff and
get started animating your own gifs
right now with sketch 3 thanks for
watching as always this is Scott Olinsky
with LevelUp tutorials you can reach us
on Facebook or Twitter pretty much
anywhere we love doing hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
