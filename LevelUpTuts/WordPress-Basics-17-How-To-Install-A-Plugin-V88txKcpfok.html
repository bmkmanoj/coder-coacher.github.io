up Tut's and today I'm gonna show you
how to install a plugin through the
WordPress admin interface and we're
gonna actually show you how to find and
install them and then we're gonna go
ahead and get using a plugin that we've
downloaded installed so the first thing
we need to do is go to the admin section
of our site now once we're here we can
go to plugins directly or we can go to
add new since we want to add a new one
we can go ahead and click add new now I
know what I want I want a google
analytics plugin so I'm just gonna type
in analytics analytics okay great and
now that I've searched for that it's no
surprise that the second one right up
here says google analytics dashboard for
WordPress there's also analytics looks
like there's a whole lot of different
google analytics and so what's great
about this interface is that you can not
only see you know what version they're
on at things like that but you can
actually get some more details about
this by clicking on it see how many
times this particular plugin has been
downloaded this one that's been
downloaded five million times so if it's
down been downloaded a five million
times and it has a star rating of four
and a half you can pretty much bet that
this is going to be a good one to use so
to install this we're gonna go ahead and
click install now that's gonna ask if
are you sure and now if you don't have
proper permissions for your site in your
file directory it might ask you for your
FTP information and of course you're
just gonna want to give your site your
FTP information at that point so that I
can download and install the plug-in now
we downloaded and installed the plugin
it's asking us if we want to activate it
well if we come to uh we could actually
just click activate plug-in right here
but I want to show you the plugins
interface so if we come to the plugins
page you're gonna see all of your
plugins including the two that come with
WordPress that are pretty much well that
the
um Akismet III believe that's how you
say it I've never heard anybody say it
so I don't really know how to pronounce
it you know this one is fine at this
Hello Dolly is pretty much worthless so
we can just ignore that one and here we
have our Google Analytics for WordPress
and so let's go ahead and click activate
all right so basically we now have
Google Analytics installed and they
wanted to know if they can track your
usage of the plugin so that they can
make it better I mean honestly I don't
see a problem with this but if you're
maybe doing a client site and the client
doesn't give you permission of mine I
want to add tracking but if it's your
own site and you don't mind go ahead
click allow tracking okay so now that we
have the the plug-in installed different
plugins sort of add-on to WordPress in
different ways so it's it's not always
super obvious however this one has a
settings link right in here as the most
of them well so if we click settings
you're taken to this Google Analytics
configuration page and now all of these
configuration pages might look a little
bit different based on what exactly
you're doing
however it's gonna ask you to click here
to authenticate with Google you of
course can do that and then it will add
your tracking code so sure I'll allow
access to this plug-in and it's asking
me to select a profile so now I have a
whole bunch of profiles here if you've
already created your profile you'd want
to select it and then you would have a
Google Analytics you can even tell it
where to go or insert the tracking code
manually if you'd like so just like that
we've installed and got up and running
and even configured a little bit of a
plug-in and no time
of course it's saying it's not active
because we didn't select a profile I
didn't create a profile for this test
site but of course you would if you had
your real site
so as always this is Scott with love lo
Tut's if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment the
video or hits up at Twitter or Facebook
let us know what you're thinking we also
have the level of Tut's forum and in the
next video we're gonna show you how to
install a plugin that you've downloaded
from maybe somewhere else right let's
say there's a wordpress site repository
of plugins and you've just installed
that plugin or downloaded it or maybe
somebody gave it to you so here we're
going to show you how to do that in the
next video so thanks for watching I'll
see you in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
