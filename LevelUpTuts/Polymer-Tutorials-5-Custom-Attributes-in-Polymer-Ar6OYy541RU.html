Tut's and today we're going to show you
how you can add attributes to your
custom elements and have those
attributes get pushed into the elements
and allow you to do all sorts of cool
stuff so we can use those elements then
within our JavaScript or our CSS or even
just the HTML within our custom element
so check it out we're going to get going
on that now okay so in the last video we
set our color to be red for this h1 and
override I'm going to go ahead and get
rid of that and we're actually going to
still override it but just make it
something a little bit more pleasant
this uh
3-3-3 is nice little gray here and I'm
going to get rid of the standard header
that we put in here for our previous
example now let's go ahead and be able
to pass a custom attribute into this
element that we can then use inside of
our hello world so for our basic example
in hello world dot HTML I want this to
say hello world if we don't pass it
anything however if I want to pass it a
name I wanted to say that person's name
so let's say we were to pass it the name
attribute and name were two equals Scott
it would say hello Scott and that's the
the premise of this hello world custom
element so let's get started by doing
that the first thing we need to do is we
need to let polymer know that we're
going to be having an attribute so we
can say attributes and that's a plural
here so attributes and then it's going
to equal and this is going to be the
name of the attribute we're going to
give our attribute the name of simply
name if we had multiples
you'd have a space and then your second
attribute perhaps it could be a last
name or something so this is how we have
our initial attributes set up and now we
can actually use these attributes inside
of our document here so I'm going to get
rid of hello world and I'm going to do
two double curly brackets here and
inside of here I'm going to write the
name of our attribute which is simply
so as you can see here it's going to say
polymer element hello world attributes
name it's going to pull in the name
attribute and then insert it into name
food it check out our page right now
we'd simply just get hello because we're
not passing anything so let's go ahead
and pass in a name here into our hello
world now to do that you can simply add
in an attribute like you would maybe a
data attribute or any sort of HTML that
you would be used to so we can say name
equals and then what name I'm going to
pass it in this case I'm passing it
Scott so hello Scott is what it should
say now you can see that upon refresh it
says hello Scott now if we were to
change this as some Z's in here Scott's
so pretty much whatever you put in here
is going to get output but in the
instance that we don't have this name
attribute it sort of fails it just says
hello we want it to be able to say hello
world on default so how can we do that
well we want to do is add a script into
our element so to do that we actually
want to get rid of this no script in the
hello world HTML let's get rid of this
no script because now we're going to be
having a script and inside of our
polymer element tag here but outside of
our template tag we're going to have a
script now we're going to use this
polymer function here and it's just
capital polymer so polymer like that
then we're going to have parentheses and
then brackets and for this we're going
to pass in the properties as a
JavaScript object so we're going to say
name is the key and the value is going
to be world and since this is the only
item in this is object we don't have to
have a comma or anything like that we're
simply saying that this name attribute
is world by default
okay now let's refresh our page here
and as you can see we're back to hello
world we don't have anything past in
there and now if we do add something
name we could say hello Ben save this
refresh hello Ben so you'll notice that
it's completely overriding it is just
setting as a default but this is a great
way to be able to add some sort of
customization into your elements
consider this you have as we said before
a Google Maps element that grabs the
Google Maps API and whatever well in
that instance you would have an
attribute such as longitude or latitude
and you could paste that in there or
type it in every single time you want a
map you could say the longitude is this
the latitude is this and then the
polymer element will be able to actually
take those attributes from your element
tag and then do something with them and
output a Google map with that longitude
and latitude so although this example is
extremely basic we're just outputting
the text it has large implications for
what you can do with polymer so you now
have the ability to modify your elements
and they're not just going to be the
same every single time you output them
now we're just getting started with
polymer there's a lot more great things
you can do with polymer and we're going
to get into all of that we're going to
be writing some really cool JavaScript
we're going to be doing some data
binding and stuff like that but
basically you're going to be able to
make some really great custom elements
and get sharing those elements so as
always this is Scott with LevelUp Tut's
