up tutorials in this video we're gonna
dive a little bit into blaze now for
this we're going to be writing our first
helpers we're going to be communicating
with our templates and we're going to be
understanding how the template in blaze
interact through events okay so we left
off with this really basic example where
we have this test template it's out of
our normal template here let's go ahead
and actually just straight-up delete
this because we will be making lots of
templates as we go so let's just go
ahead and delete test instead of trying
to rename it or something like that and
as you can see saving everything it's
all good we're gonna head to body J s
and delete this import statement as well
but we're going to actually remain in
here for a little bit and this is where
we want to start talking about our
JavaScript code now the first thing we
need to do is import the template object
here from meteor so we can do that with
import and then inside of brackets we
can say template from and then we could
have a string then we're going to say
meteor forward slash temp letting okay
wrap this up with a semicolon now I'm
going to actually have my inspect open
I'm gonna pull this wide just like that
just so we can make sure there's no
errors in our Council as we go if you
aren't sure how to access this if you're
using Chrome you can right click inspect
and then you can either click on this
council tab or from the elements tab you
can hit the Escape key and the council
will pop up down here if you're
wondering why mine is not white and it
says this dark blue background it's
because I'm using a Chrome extension
called dev tools author I also have a
video on that under level up tips and
that playlist as well so check that out
if you're interested in having it your
inspect look a little bit cooler if not
don't worry about it so as you can see
here we have
our import template from meteor
templating now I'm actually gonna hide
my sidebar here just to give this text
some more room here so we can see this a
little bit better so now that we have
imported a template from meteor template
Inge we now have access to this template
object now this import statement may
have been confusing right we have
brackets template brackets I'm gonna be
explaining a lot more why we use these
brackets here when to use them and when
not to
right now just know that when we're
importing something like this that's an
individual thing like we did meteor or
whatever from a package it's larger
stuff you'll want to use these brackets
I'll be explicit about that right now
but when we start exporting things I'll
tell you why so we can say import
template from meteor that template ting
and as long as everything spelled good
and we are all good to go and here we
can now start our first helper now our
helper is really just something that
we'll have access to in our HTML it can
be things that are processed by
JavaScript it can be items that are
grabbed from the database we can do all
sorts of stuff so let's type template
dot body now body isn't something
special here it's the name of the
template for instance if we were in
modifying the test template this would
be template dot test so in this case
template dot body got helpers now this
is essentially just a function here or a
method and inside of this method it's
going to accept an object now inside of
this object we're going to have a
property this property will just be
hello okay now just like in any other
JavaScript object you have to have a
property and a value this can just be a
string that says hi world instead of
hello world because it's different okay
now what's interesting here is that we
now have access to this template helper
named hello inside of our document so
let's see this in action here basically
it's just a string hi world we can come
to body dot H
tl no and let's underneath our header
here let's have a main section and we
can have an h2 and this can just be
bracket bracket and this will now be the
name the property of our upper so our
helper was hello we have access to hello
with hello and now we see on our code
over here on our front end that we have
hi world is now output now why is this
important why would you ever use this
well if you're pulling things from the
database you have data that you're
working with maybe you're iterating over
something basically every time you
needed to grab something manipulate it
do anything and output it you're going
to be using a helper and a helper is
basically something that's going to take
JavaScript or data and then put it into
language that your template can
understand now let's go ahead and talk
about events I'm gonna come here and
let's go ahead and simply just add a
button and we can say click mean and
this button is going to have a class
equal to and this class is simply just
going to be click and this class is just
simply going to be let's just have this
be test again I'm not going to keep this
this is just so we can get used to
working with events so you've seen a
helper know and a helper looks like this
now let's check out an event so just
like helpers we declare events by saying
template dot and then the name of the
template which is body that events now
the events is also just a method that
accepts an object so we have a method
with an object inside of here with these
curly brackets and with our first
property is going to be a string so our
properties are always going to be
strings here for this and I'm going to
show you why because this string
contains the two things it contains the
event that we're looking for and then it
contains the item that we're looking for
for that event to take place on for
instance we want to click this but
then just simply counsel log something
so we can say a click event on the dot
test and that's going to be the property
of this object now the value of this
object is going to be a function now we
could do it this way and say function
event and have it like this inside of
here let's go ahead and just simply say
console dot log hello
okay sorry for using hello and hi and
testing all this stuff it's important to
get a nice little foundation about how
this stuff looks before we're going to
anything important so now that we have
this event let's go ahead and click me
and you'll see that we get hello output
down here in our console let's bump this
up so you can see it a little bit better
hello right there click it every time I
click it this number goes up saying I've
clicked it now 17 times cool so let's go
over this again we're saying we have
events on the template body when you
click the class of test run this
function this function simply just
council logs hello now let's talk about
how we can clean this up a little bit
now we could use something like an arrow
function which is in the es2015 syntax
which allows us to preserve this more
about that as it actually matters it
doesn't really matter here but we can
say arrow like that and notice how we
have our parentheses arrow bracket other
than that it's the same I'm gonna have
an annual refresh on this just so you
can clear the council click me you can
see it still works but in addition that
we also have a different way of defining
a function within something like this
with the new syntax what we can do is
simply get rid of this colon here and
move this over here and get rid of this
arrow like this ok and now what we're
saying is the click test
method hearing is just going to pass
this event and counsel that lug hello so
this is just a shorthand way of saying
this now we can click this and as you
can see as we click it it's still
working okay so this is a helper and
this is an event primarily these are
going to be the things that you're going
to be working with within an individual
helper you're going to be pulling data
and displaying it with helpers you're
going to be submitting forms doing click
events updating content all sorts of
stuff with events and what kind of stuff
might you ask well in the next video
were to be talking about collections now
a collection is essentially way use you
can store your information into a
database and access it modify it updated
deleted all that stuff in real time it's
really super cool and collections are
saved in a Mongo DB database or a Mongo
database do people say that I'm not sure
but either way it's a MongoDB database
and we'll be able to actually save some
persisting data into our meteor app
you're gonna see one of the key
strengths of meteor front-and-center in
the very next video so as always this is
