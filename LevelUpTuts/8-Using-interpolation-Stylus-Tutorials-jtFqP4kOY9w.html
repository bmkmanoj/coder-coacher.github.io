tutorials and today we're going to talk
about interpolation and stylist i'm
going to give you a couple of quick
examples about how you can use
interpolation to take perhaps an
operation on some strings or some values
and use them within your CSS property so
check it out we're going to get going on
that now so let's take a look at this
mix and we'd created before which
generated our border radius with a
WebKit prefix this is actually a perfect
example of when you can use something
like interpolation so here we have this
border radius mixin that that's
essentially looking for just a radius
and it's grabbing that radius and
throwing as WebKit border radius and
then just border radius well let's say
we have another CSS property that also
has WebKit mozilla things like that
prefixed well we're going to be creating
another mixin that looks just like this
with a different CSS property having
those multiple prefixes so using
interpolation is a great way to sort of
cut down on some of this repetitive code
that you end up writing over and over
again and what we can do is actually
create a mixin that adds vendor prefixes
two things so let's go ahead and add
that before this border radius and we
can just call this vendor and in here we
can give this two arguments we wanted to
give it a property and we want to look
for an argument so we need to say art so
now what we can do is actually output
the text from that property using these
curly brackets so for instance if we
wanted to remake this border radius we
could actually just have our property
variable in here just like this and then
right here we could have our standard
arguments here which is going to be our
value so what this is going to be doing
is essentially outputting our property
that we pass in and then our arguments
now what I want to do is actually
rid of these properties that we have
within this mix it already and we're
going to call our other mix and we're
going to call the vendor mixin so we can
say vendor and then we can pass this a
couple of things we can pass in the
actual property name that we want to
give it so that's going to be
border-radius okay and let's actually
pass this the radius that we're going to
be passing into this mix in already so
we can say radius hair like that okay so
now what you should notice is that our
compiled CSS has now changed from just
saying border radius and maz border
radius it's actually just outputting
border radius 20 if we look back at our
stylish sheet you'll see that we're
passing 20 into the border radius right
here just like this and in our mixin
it's giving that radius and passing it
into the vendor mixin using border
radius passing it into this mix and
right here it's outputting a border
radius as the property and that's
interpolated as a string and then it's
outputting the argument which is radius
okay so you may be wondering well this
is now more code and we've got less out
of it so how can we make this more
efficient well we can do things by
adding our vendor prefixes here so we
can say hyphen WebKit and then
immediately after that we can then use
these curly brackets with the property
again so let's do WebKit hyphen property
and then argh upon saving this you can
see that our now output value is now
WebKit hyphen border radius so this is
really cool because we can just simply
copy this line and then change this
WebKit tomoz and mosey just like that
and now anytime we're using border
radius it's also giving us the Moz
border radius and the WebKit border
radius but let's say we wanted to expand
upon this even further
move into something else right so
another css3 property that could perhaps
have vendor prefixes for older browsers
so let's say we wanted to use a
transition mixin so we can say
transition right and then we're going to
pass in some arguments which is just
going to be ours and the output of that
is going to be vendor and then we can
use this as transition again comma args
because these are going to be arguments
and let's say that we should now have a
a transition mixin that's going to be
using the same vendor mixin and without
having to do anything extra it's going
to be adding in our vendor prefixes
without us really having to do a whole
lot extra I mean if you think about
using something like compass write it in
us using SAS companies takes care of
these vendor prefixes for you and there
are things with stylus that can do that
as well however this is the ability to
build your own version of that very
easily like this could not be any easier
so now let's go ahead and add a mixin
where we're saying transition I've
spelled it correctly transition we're
going to pass the value of all 0.2
seconds and then ease just like that now
if you'll notice when we save this one
it's really only getting the all
property here so we can't use the
transparent mixin in this case so we can
basically wrap this in parenthesis like
this now it's accepting all of these
values as one argument and now you can
see that the output is transition all
0.2 seconds ease WebKit transitional 0.2
seconds ease and mozz so with this one
little mix in that we built right here
to add vendor prefixes it's now going to
be able to add vendor prefixes to any
sort of mixin that we throw it so now
that we've seen interpolation you might
be wondering well what's the strength of
this why don't we just have the word
property here instead of our variable
itself because if we do that
you'll see that the output is actually
outputting the text property because
it's the first part of a declaration and
it's not the value stylus is basically
sitting this is straight text by
wrapping this text in these curly
brackets and selling stylus hey this is
an actual text it's a variable so you
should be outputting that variable as a
string as it's the CSS property and the
arc here doesn't really need that
because it's the value already so this
is just a quick example of how you can
use interpolation within your stylus
documents now you can do this to create
all sorts of helpful mix-ins that can
then be used with another mix-ins or
perhaps it's just something that takes
some values and is outputting that for
you pretty much the boundaries of what
you can create with this stuff is really
just up to your own imagination and like
I said with a lot of this stuff it's
really worth your time to go explore
other people's stylist packages and see
what they've created to get some
examples in some ideas to create some
cool things for yourself as always this
is Scott would level up tutorials any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video hit us up at Twitter or
Facebook I level up tons we love to hear
from you thanks for watching and we'll
see you in the next one I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
