of tutorials and in this video we're
gonna set up our router and our page
layout so that we can actually render
our page within a layout and then be
able to reuse that layout for other
pages so let's get going on that right
now
okay so remember when in the last video
when I said to make sure that code runs
on the client side we need to throw it
in the client folder so what that means
is in our root directory of our project
we can create a new folder which is
client and now anything that we put in
that folder is automatically going to
run a client side automatically and we
don't need to use this is client now the
reason that's important is because we're
going to be using a router that by
default is only client side now we can
make this router render server side
however that video will not be on
YouTube if you want to have access to
server side rendering it's going to be
an extra that's included with the
downloadable version of this series or
available for LevelUp pros so we have
basically this code here in our app KS X
if we're gonna leave this here because
eventually we're just going to delete
this all no need to move it to our
client and rewrite it what we can do is
inside of our client let's make a new
file and it's just going to be routes
JSX now instead of routes JSX the first
thing we're going to need to do is
import react so import react from and
then in a string react so this is really
going to be a theme we're gonna be using
import react a lot now next thing we
need is flow router installed from
atmosphere now if you don't know what
atmosphere is if we go to atmosphere Jas
calm this is meteor zone package library
now what's cool about this is that a lot
of these packages are really great for
meteor they do really awesome things the
only bummer that was before is that to
use any sort of NPM stuff you had to
have like a wrapper package through
atmosphere j/s so with the addition of
NPM it doesn't mean that we're never
going to use atmosphere j/s again it
just means that we now have access to
NPM packages so if we come into Explorer
meteor packages let's type in flow and
as you'll see the very most number one
is flow router so we can click flow
router and you can see we can add it
with this meteor AB command so if you
haven't added a package before make sure
you're in the root of your project and
we can have me
your ad and then the package name which
is Khedira : Flo - router now when we
hit enter this is going to add this
package to our project here
so as this ads I'll show you something
really cool one way that we can add
packages that's not through this meteor
add command is simply by heading to our
code and inside of this dot meteor
folder you'll see a packages file inside
of here if we scroll down you can see
that once we add this package you can
see that after this gets done adding
this file is gonna be automatically
updated for us with that package name no
it's cool about this is you can edit
this package directly by pasting in here
it is actually so if we were to paste in
Khedira FlowRider here meteor would
still know to go grab this package we
wouldn't have to run that meteor add
command and 90% of the time if I'm
adding a package I usually come to
packages and just paste in the package
name rather than running a meteor add
command that way you don't have to leave
your code while adding packages so we
now have flow router which is the router
of choice for this series so if we come
now to our routes dot JSX we should now
have access to flow router and we can
say flow router and camelcase with the
uppercase f route and we can pass this
in parenthesis and inside of here we
have a string now the string is going to
be the actual route for instance for our
home page we could just have a forward
slash and we're going to have a comma
and brackets now instead of here we need
an action this is what's going to happen
when you hit this route so we could say
action and then parenthesis now we can
have brackets and instead of here allows
us to actually have a particular
component being rendered now at this
point we need to add another package
this package is going to be react
mounter now react mounter is going to
allow you to use layouts now this is
going to be a really super nice package
so we can say from our command line
we can say npm install' - - save react -
mounter now keep in mind that this is
being installed from NPM and not
atmosphere so we could say NPM install -
I can save react mounter and that's
going to add react mounter to our
project so you can see it says unmet
peer dependency so we also need to add
react Dom which is one of the things
that was complaining about in the last
video so I can say npm install it's - -
save react - down now react Dom is just
going to be allow us to have our render
allows to work with the Dom and we might
actually be using it in our components
themselves okay so we now have react Dom
and we have react mounter we are now
able to import and what we want to do is
have two brackets here and say mount now
the reason why we have these brackets
here will become more clear once you
learn a little bit about importing and
exporting so now we can say from and
then we can say react mounter don't
worry too much about those brackets just
yet so we're now importing mount from
react mount ER and we now have access to
the mount function so instead of our
action we can mount and what we're gonna
pass in here is our layout so we don't
have a layout right now all we have is
app dot JSX so first thing we need to do
is create a layout so this layout is
going to get built upon and we're going
to reuse it and it's going to be
essentially allowing us to throw other
components inside of it based on a
different route so inside of our client
folder let's create a new folder and I'm
gonna call it layouts now inside of
layouts let's create a new file and the
new file is just going to be main layout
note the camel case with all capitals
instead of a lowercase first and we
could say JSX
so from our main layout we need to do
first import react from react although
we may not be using react in this
component what we can do now is say
Const so Const is a new variable type in
es2015 that allows us to be a constant
and unchanging variable so we could say
Const main layout is equal to now this
is going to be a little bit interesting
but what we need to do here is have
brackets and say content and we're going
to have an arrow function so it's equals
greater than sign and then parenthesis
so this is really the only time we're
gonna be seeing this syntax here is when
creating our layout so when you create a
layout we're creating a constant
variable with the name of that and then
we're passing in some content and now we
can have a div now this div will need a
class name so in react you need class
name instead of class because in
JavaScript the word class means
something else so we say main - layout
and if you're like so okay now instead
of here let's just simply throw in some
brackets as say content so what this is
going to do is it's going to create this
essentially a component here main layout
it's going to allow us to pass in
content and then it's just going to drop
the content directly in to our page now
what is this content you asked well
we're gonna be passing it in our mount
function in a second
so we have constant main layout that's
super cool however there's no way for
routes to have access to main layout
without exporting this so from here we
can export like this so we can export
the constant variable main layout now we
can import it into our routes JSX so
from here we can import and again we'll
need to use the brackets and say main
layout from and
we need to actually pass this in the
direct path to our main layout file
you'll notice that we're in routes which
is in our client folder so we need to
say this current folder which can be
said by dot forward slash then layouts
forward slash and then now we want to
pass this in main layout dot JSX
so now at this point our router is
importing the main layout from this file
we now have access to that in our mount
I mean it's a main layout so use the
main layout as the layout comma curly
brackets let's actually make this up on
the line here okay and say content so
this is just an object and we're passing
in the the content of parentheses and
now we can say app forward slash like
that okay
so we just did a whole lot there we
created this layout we wrote a lot of
code in our our routes here but we need
to do before this is going to work is we
need to remove this whole thing right
here we're no longer going to be
importing this into our body and if we
come to index.html we can also delete
the body tag entirely boom like that
okay so our index now just contains our
head and our title our app now just
contains everything about the app
component which is really just this h1
our routes is bringing in react mounter
and it's bringing in main layout we're
then using that by saying to find a new
route which is just forward slash the
action is going to be to mount the new
layout and pass an app as content we
then have app being passed in as content
and then we're able to use the Epis
content here so let's say we didn't mess
anything up throughout this whole thing
and as you can see of course I did mess
something up it says routes JSX line 9
column number 21 you will be seeing
stuff like this a lot but these errors
are really helpful as always if you get
an error something like this always go
to where it shows you and sure enough
when you hit there you're going to see
like a dummy I have a semicolon in this
object here this is an object semicolons
obviously do not go at the end of
properties an object so if you have the
semicolon in yours
delete it so it's always good to have
nice error messages so upon saving that
we should be able to head to our page
refresh check it out and we're getting
some more issues so now it's telling us
that app isn't defined which if again
you had a keen eye you would have
noticed
so we imported main layout and we used
it here but we used app here without
importing it so again let's go ahead and
now import we want to import app from
main layout however this time I'm not
going to use the brackets here I'll show
you why in a second so we can say let's
import app from and since app lives a
folder below us we could say dot dot and
then app JSX so this path is relative to
from where we are we're currently in the
client folder we need to go back one
folder to app JSX now again this won't
work because we're not exporting app
just yet we exported at the main layout
with export constant main layout now
this time since we don't want to use
these brackets I'll show you something
here we can export this as export
default app extends so by having this
default here this is saying that app is
the sort of default that we're exporting
here so we don't need to specify which
package itself like we did with this
main layout so if we're importing app
without the brackets you need to be
using export default or else you're
gonna get a whole bunch of errors if you
want to read up more than this there's a
lot of great posts on importing and
exporting in es6 but it's beyond sort of
the scope of this video and now that you
can see I've tapped back I've resolved
all my errors and I'm greeted with hello
world so this was a nice long process
getting our routes going here as you can
see we wrote a bunch of code and some of
it may be looking a little confusing to
you especially if you've used maybe flow
router
floo router layouts or just in general
from working in meteor before it's a bit
different however this is going to be
really nice and you're gonna use to it
and you're gonna start to really have a
good handle of your entire project so
just like that we have routes going and
although we only have one route it's
clearly working because the contents on
the screen in the next video we're
actually must get start working on data
by adding an insert form into our
application and while we're not actually
going to be getting that data displayed
or anything yet we're still gonna have a
form that inputs data into our database
and that's pretty awesome so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
you want the rest of these videos before
the released on youtube head to store
that level up tutorials comm and
purchase this package along with an
extra video on server-side routing or
become a level of pro and stream the
videos as well so as always thanks for
watching if you have any questions or
comments that become in the video write
me up at twitter or facebook at level up
tutorials love to hear from you thanks
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
