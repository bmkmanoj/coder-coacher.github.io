up Tut's and today I'm gonna give you a
quick level up tip about a terminal
replacement for OSX now Apple their
operating system comes with the terminal
app in fact you can see it open here
it's nothing fancy you can do multiple
tabs multiple panes and some basic theme
stuff but it's it's pretty bare-bones
right well I turned to is a free
terminal emulator and I use this pretty
much exclusively as my terminal app for
OSX in fact you can see I have it right
here it just says I term although this
is in fact I term 2 now what's great
about I term 2 is that instead of just
having the bare-bones features there's
almost more features than you can
possibly handle so if you come to their
website in fact we can't even cover all
of them here but you can go in here and
click through and exactly see all of
these awesome features most importantly
it's just really configurable so it
offers things like profiles so if we
come in here to I term preferences we
can set up a profile by clicking the
plus down here now this profile let's
say this is always going to be into my
downloads folder for some reason so
let's say I have stuff in my downloads
folder and I always want a window to
open up into my downloads folder and I
want it to look a certain way so I can
give it a shortcut key now this is going
to just be D for downloads now on Mac
well of course is a Mac app it's command
ctrl D so we can go ahead and give it a
command when it first launches or you
can give it a working directory what
this is really useful for is that I have
profile setup for my server for test
servers and things like that
so when I open up a new profile
it automatically can SSH into my server
for me by running an SSH command now I
could also say users scott downloads if
i could type downloads now another great
thing is you could give this profile a
perhaps a different background color so
i have my different servers color-coded
based on what server i'm on if i'm on my
work server my level up ted server or
something like that let's just say i
want to make the background of this
development server or my downloads
folder green i can do that you can even
do things like changing the text give
making the box transparent and as you
can see there's all sorts of stuff and
actually let's make this something else
let's just make this a because it's my
first one so we're going to do out of
here i'm going to do command option a
now you can see that it's opened up a
new window here our new tab actually and
it's already in our downloads folder and
the background is green so we know that
this is our downloads now you can setup
all sorts of different ones in fact I
have so many different profiles that
take me exactly where I need to be that
it's ridiculous so I can be basically by
holding command and hitting one of the
left or right arrows you can go through
your tabs but I can be doing anything
and just instantly do control command a
and know exactly where I am now
now of course I'm in my downloads folder
because of this profile I setup now you
see we have different tabs but we can
also open up a new tab within this same
profile so if your association to your
server and you want to open a new tab in
your server all you have to do is do
command D and it opens up a new vertical
pane and notice how it remains in the
same profile that we were using before
and I can just keep opening these up
just like if I was in this and I did
command E it's going to just leave me
where I am because
I'm in the default profile now there is
really too many options to go in you
know I could even give this tab a color
of green so I know that that's my
downloads folder tab when I'm looking at
this like I said this app is just it's
the terminal app for OS X so if you are
using terminal all the time what changes
are you building websites you're using
terminal all the time and if you're not
you're probably using it more and more
so check out I turn - trust me it's the
terminal app to use so as always this is
Scott with level of Tut's if you have
any questions or comments please leave a
comment the video head up at Twitter or
Facebook or the level up Hut's form let
us know what you think we'd love to hear
from you thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
