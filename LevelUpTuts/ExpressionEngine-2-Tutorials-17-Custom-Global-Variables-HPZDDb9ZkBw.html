tuts today we're going to go ahead and
cover the global variables global
variables snippets and then the next
video we're going to cover embedded
templates all have something in common
and that really is that the goal is to
extract pieces of content pieces of your
code so that I when you are ready to
update them you're not having to update
every single template so in the last
video we covered a snippet and what we
did if you remember as we pulled what
was the header into a snippet and again
you want to use a snippet when something
contains PHP and expression code you
want to use a global variable from
static cond or mostly static content the
reason why you want to do that is
because global variables are parsed
really at the very end of one expression
engine is building on a page snippets
are parsed very early there's sort of on
opposite ends of the spectrum so what
you really want to do is use global
variables for things like the footer you
know copyright information and you know
stuff similar to that and that's exactly
what we're going to do I'm going to pull
just this little piece of content here
into a global variable and also just um
just to be clear with expression engine
you actually get a standard list of
global variables um for example we were
using one called site name like this is
actually a standard global variable and
there's a whole list of them let me see
well certainly you can bring up your
documentation but so I'm going to go
design templates global variables I
think maybe if I click help here it will
bring up now
bring up their our standard standard
global variables so there's quite a few
you know in bed in code gzip it's all
you know goes on and on and here's the
one that we were using site name and so
you know this is a predefined list but
with expression engine you can create
your own custom global variables and
that's what we're doing in fact it looks
like I already have this one creating
irma go ahead and delete it though and
i'll create a new one doing the same
thing so copyright and so all I'm
outputting year is um a little copyright
symbol the year and level up let update
and go back to the template that home
page template and just like the header
we're going to replace this content with
the word copyright and i will hit update
and finished and what we should see here
is no change except for i guess that use
going to be up uppercase now and there
you go so right it's very similar to
snip it I mean you really just like a
snippet when we're looking at global
variables you're just filling out you
know the name and then the content but
again there's we're not putting PHP in
here or not encouraging putting page
premiere or expression engine tags or
any of that type of stuff because again
this stuff is just parse too late so
again what you want to put in here is
static content so there you go that's
globe that's how you create a global
variable and apply it to your template
like I said in the next video we're
going to cover embedded templates and so
right well thanks for watching thanks
for listening and stay tuned for the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
