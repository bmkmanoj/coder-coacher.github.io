Tut's and today we're going to be going
over image styles so if you remember in
a couple lessons ago we made this my
first project and we had this image here
so if you'll notice on this page it
looks like this this image is really
small and it just sort of generates this
size if you recall we'll go into content
types and under projects we're going to
go to actually we're gonna go to manage
display and we set the image style to be
medium well at the time we do
necessarily know what that was going to
output and this is in fact what it
outputs so but if you know the image
style you want is not one of these
defaults whatever they may be you can
actually set up your own and they're
actually very configurable so we're
going to go to configuration we're gonna
go to image styles under media and then
here are all the image styles available
so let's just add a new one just so you
can see the process so the style name is
we're going to call this well we already
have one that I made earlier for
projects so let's just call this well
we'll call it project test just so I
know which one is the test I can get rid
of it later if I don't plan on using it
okay so this is the image style creation
screen or this is just when you edit
this is what it looks like so it's gonna
say your original these are the
dimensions and the your image style
these are the dimensions and of course
this is not actual size it's giving you
scaled so that it fits on the screen and
it's saying the project test by default
is nothing affected to it and it's going
to say 600 by 800 okay if this one
originally was 600 by 800 so down here
you can see there's a list of effects
and you can have different effects in
different operations you can see you can
crop desaturate resize rotate scale
scale and crop so let's say we want it
to be
exactly will heaven say 500 by 500
square we're gonna select scale and crop
and click Add and when I say we want
this to be 500 pixels by 500 pixels
perfect square you recall this project
this image is in not a perfect square
okay
style has effect has been successfully
applied we'll click update style just to
be sure sometimes I like to wreak lick
things okay so let's go back to content
types
manage display for our projects and then
this image style where it's at medium
before we should now see an option for
project test which is the one we just
created so let's select that click
update save okay now if we refresh this
page we're going to see a 500 pixel by
500 pixel square image let's verify that
and you can see here it's 500 pixels by
500 pixels so that is creating an image
style so if you'll notice however this
just sort of crops it wherever it wants
this is sort of cropping right in the
middle what if you wanted to say start
in top left and then crop from there or
even just they start in the top and crop
from there luckily we can do that with a
little bit more configuration so let's
go to configuration I'm gonna keep this
open in a new tab image styles again and
then progress project test
okay let's delete this scale and crop
because the scaling crop is just it's
great for getting things done quickly
but it's not it's configurable so what
we want to do is we want to scale this
first so let's click add and we're gonna
want to scale this to being 500 pixels
wide and we're not gonna touch the
height yet because what this is going to
actually I'll take that back because
these images are wider than they are
tall so we're going to set the height to
be 500 pixels and not touch the width
this is going to basically the width
will now actually if we click update
style you can see
will refresh this and so now we have an
image that's the same proportions as it
was but it's five hundred pixels tall
well that's great but we wanted this to
be a square and we wanted to start from
the top left okay well now we can then
add a crop and in the crop we can anchor
it to the top left and then this we can
say make sure the width is five honored
make sure the height is 500 and the fact
okay
and now let's refresh this we now have
500 by 500 anchored to the top left and
for fun just to show you something else
you can do we can desaturate it and then
we can rotate it let's rotate this 180
degrees and then click add effect okay
so now this is gonna be upside down
black-and-white awesome I mean this is
not super practical here but there are
some things you could use this for and
simply having these tools at your
fingertips allows you to utilize image
styles to create cached images in all
sorts of ways so that's how you create
your image styles to output images at
the size and and quality and everything
that you want them to be this is very
useful so you don't have to resize your
images with CSS or anything it's loading
cached versions of these images that are
going to load faster than the full sized
images and they're going to functionally
act better in your site as always if you
have any questions or comments please
feel free to leave a comment on the
video or hit us up at Twitter I love a
lot tuts once again my name is Scott and
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
