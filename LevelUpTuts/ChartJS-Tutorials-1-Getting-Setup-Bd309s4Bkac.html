up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna get started by essentially just
adding chart j/s to our project and just
generally getting set up so let's get
going on that now ok so to get started I
have really an apt it's just downloaded
from html5 boilerplate now html5
boilerplate is something that has been
used for a long time to just quickly get
up and running you don't need any sort
of generators or anything like that you
just download html5 boilerplate in the
end here all that really matters is that
you have something to get going now if
you want to get this code directly you
can become a LevelUp pro and have access
to the code there but really like I said
it's just html5 boilerplate now I'm
going to get this up and running with a
simple node server now to do this you
need to have node J s installed really
you can bypass this step if you don't
need a server or you can use the simple
Python server you just Google simple
Python server if you're on OS X but
we're going to use NPM install - G and
then we're going to install HTTP -
server this is going to just globally
install this really simple HTTP server
that's a node server now from here
notice I'm in the chart j/s directory
that's the same directory as this
project here I'm simply just going to
type HTTP - server that's it and if
you'll notice we now have access to this
at this localhost port 8080 so let's go
ahead and we can head to our browser and
paste this in and you'll notice we get
the hello world which is our HTML up
right here now I'm going to prune this a
little bit I got rid of the Google
Analytics I'm going to get rid of some
of these commented stuff I don't need a
favicon I don't need any of this stuff
really because I mean honestly we're
just going
be showing chart J s in this okay but
normalize all that stuff's pretty good
to have now there's lots of ways that
you could go about adding chart J s to
your application if you click a getting
started going to take you to the github
page where you can see how you can
install it with Bower or with node now
because I just want to get going as
simple as possible you can use NPM or
Bao or any of these other methods I'm
just going to grab the CDN version
you'll notice if you click on this link
it's a hosted version of this file you
can copy this path indirectly just paste
it in here as the script that you're
loading so in our footer here we can
just come down here so at the bottom of
our body we can just come down here and
add a script and we can add a source and
that source is just going to simply be
equal to the path so nothing fancy here
and since this is html5 we don't need to
do type JavaScript or anything like that
okay but as you see I'm loading this
CloudFlare I'm loading this chart j/s
directly from this and you might be
wondering well do I need do I need
jQuery or any of that stuff well we
don't so we can come in here see you
later jQuery okay see you later all this
stuff and we can leave this main j/s
file that's inside of our j/s folder
right here because it's just a blank
javascript file and that way we can
write our code directly in there but as
you can see here we're now loading what
is this CDN file and we just have a
standard javascript file really all that
matters is that you load this and you
have some place to write javascript that
is going to be recognized by this HTML
document now cool okay let's head back
to the browser from chart.js org you're
going to see that we have documentation
before we check out documentation you
can see that we have some cool cool
stuff in chart j s we have mixed chart
types where you can have bar charts on
top of whatever line charts this R and
we have things like different chart axes
where you can move the
access to be you know inverse or
something like that and you can animate
everything now what's awesome about this
is that this is HTML this is responsive
it's using canvas there are eight
different chart types and it's totally
open-source so I can't imagine a reason
why you wouldn't want to use this
project over some other charting
solutions now there are things like d3
and d3 is an amazing amazing package and
ecosystem
however d3 is going to be overkill if
you need a simple chart like one of
these and it starts aren't even that
simple to be honest but if you need a
chart you know learning d3 is great but
if you need advanced visualizations than
d3 is probably going to be more up your
alley but if you're just doing beautiful
charts check out chart j/s it's awesome
ok so let's head to documentation here
and as you can see we have some pretty
sweet docs we have a line chart bar
chart and if you select the heading of
any of these it gives you and not only
just like an example but a working
example you could see just how beautiful
these charts are and I mean honestly you
can make them more beautiful if you hate
them so we have this radar chart which
is something you might see to describe
attributes we have a polar area chart
which is sort of like a pie chart but it
adds an extra dimension where you can
have this branching out here now we also
have pie and donut charts now a donut
chart is just a sort of hipper way of
showing a pie chart at this point I mean
it's it's showing the exact same data
but you see these used all over the
place like mint.com uses them and stuff
like that and here we have scales which
is allows you to like fully scale data
whether it's things like logarithmically
and stuff like that but as you can see
here these are some of the best Doc's
around so you can head to chart J s org
slash
Docs and just head in here and just see
what's available get inspired and in the
next video we're going to create our
very first line chart right up top
here and I'm going to talk a little bit
about chart Jas while we go along so the
other charts are a little easier once we
get into them cool so this is chart Jas
I hope you're excited we're going to be
building some really cool stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
