tutorials and in this video we're going
to be talking all about view j/s
templating as then what it means to
actually use the template language in
view and we're gonna get started and
writing some view code so in the last
video we wrote our first little bit of
view code and well you might have had
some questions about this stuff up top
here in the HTML like what's going on
here if you haven't used anything like
handlebars or in meteor there's
something called space bars or mustache
or any of these other JavaScript
templating languages this set of some
text might be a little bit confusing so
in this video we're going to talk a
little bit about the templating language
within view now it's based off of the
mustache style syntax again if you
haven't used mustache then that probably
means nothing to you however those of
you who have will feel right at home
with this syntax in which we have double
brackets to be able to output variables
and in this case stuff that's in our
data and in future cases it's going to
be stuff that is not just in our data
I'll get into what that means again in
several other videos but just like we
had hello output in here we could also
have some text Scott says and then in
quotes right here you can see this now
says Scott says hello world let me
actually just add a CSS rule and just
say body we're gonna say font size is
equal to 24 pixels just to get this a
little bit bigger
hey actually let's say this 36 pixels
here that way we can see it nice and big
that's the last we're gonna do with CSS
or stylist or anything okay so as you
can see here Scott says hello okay and
the cool thing is even though we have
quotes here everything that's inside of
these double brackets is gonna get
parsed sort of like JavaScript and I
mean sort of because we can't do a ton
of JavaScript in these brackets and
expect it to work
we'll go over a little bit more about
what that means exactly now you can see
it's just simply outputting the string
because that's all we have here in our
data okay so far so good now now I said
we could use a little bit of kind of
JavaScript inside of here as in we're
not going to be able to write statements
as in we cannot define variables we
cannot do full-on if statements that
sort of stuff but we can't run is
expressions so for instance we have this
variable hello and you could use a
method like a string method onto this it
actually affected for instance if we
wanted to output the length of the
string rather than the string itself we
could access the property dot lang on
this and actually have an output Scott
says 11 right because it's the length of
the string hello world so we do have
access to methods and properties you can
even do ternary expressions as an if
this than that using the question mark
and colon inside of these in fact let's
see something like that in action we're
gonna go on our new data and define a
new property we're just going to say is
true okay and the answer to that is
going to be true okay is it true sure
it's true now inside of our template
here we can say hey what we want to do
if is true question mark then we're
going to output hello otherwise we're
going to output and in this case we can
actually have a string inside of our
brackets we can say no okay so check
this out if Scott says if is true then
I'll put the hello world you can see it
does say hello world if we were to
change this variable to false in our Jas
this would now say Scott says no because
this is evaluating this expression so as
you can see here we can use a little bit
of JavaScript inside of here but what we
can't do is full-on statements we cannot
do assignments that we cannot do flow
control we cannot do any of that stuff
so don't expect to be able to throw a
couple of brackets in here and do
full-on
a script now you see now that our data
has come in from two places it's coming
from our data property hello and our
data property is true now there's a
couple of other things that get added to
this syntax as being evaluating in view
we could also have a method which is
simply just a function on your view
instance that can run and do all sorts
of stuff and then how put as a variable
without actually having to be a data
variable you could also have something
called a computed property which is
going to be able to take data variables
or all sorts of things and compute new
versions of them again outputting
directly as a variable in your code here
now again nothing is explicitly defined
inside of our HTML we're not importing
is true we're not doing all of that
simply because it's in the data element
we have access to it okay so this is a
little bit into the templating syntax
the brackets the mustache style syntax
and that's pretty much it for the
templating syntax and why I say
templating syntax I'm mostly just
referring to the handlebars type of
stuff we're essentially able to output
variables and anything within these two
brackets is going to be ran as a
JavaScript expression so when I made
that clarifying statement about this
handling this mustache style templating
there's a whole second bit of templating
syntax in view and if you come from
angular land this is going to feel very
very comfortable and if you come from
exclusively react land you are going to
feel very uncomfortable and if you've
never used a JavaScript framework at all
then you might just find them very very
exciting and may be confusing at the
same time but we're going to be going
over in the next view or the type of
properties we can add to our HTML
elements to do various things now we're
not going to be doing all of these info
on example because some of these require
their own videos such as conditionals
loops sort of the user input that sort
of stuff but we're gonna sort of dive in
a little bit to these syntax here and
talk about what this kind of stuff is so
that once we're ready to start using it
for real it's going to feel very
comfortable
so as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you'd like to purchase this
entire series head on over to the level
of tutorials com4 slash store and
purchase it view for everyone or you can
become a level up pro and get access to
not only view for everyone but a ton of
other premium tutorial series such as
pro gatsby or modern CSS layouts as
always thank you so much for watching
and i'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
