up Tut's and today we're going to be
going over some URL path aliases so if
we go to our about page one thing you
might have noticed is that our URLs not
looking so hot it says uh you know our
ST is where sites located but after that
it says slash node slash one and you
know that's a okay but it's not really
great and I personally would never put
up a site with a URL that looked like
that so what we're going to show you how
to do is how to change those and then
how to set up patterns so that any new
piece of content that you make will
follow those patterns and this is a
great thing to do set up when your sites
just starting so you only have to do it
once or twice and set it and forget it
so one thing I'm going to show you is
how to adjust a piece of contents URL
alias itself so if we go to our about
and this is kick click edit here in the
Edit screen we can actually go through
and under URL path settings we can we
can specify our own path for this we can
just say it's about actually let's just
make this something funny because I'm
going to change it later so let's just
say it's Scott - slash about click save
this page is now located at st slash
Scott Scott slash about but if we were
to create another page let's say
actually let's create another page add
content basic page and we're going to
create a projects page and I'm not going
to bother anything except for putting a
menu link in our main menu having it be
third the comments are off let's not
worry about URL pets comments are closed
okay okay okay save okay so now projects
about now this one now we notice has st
node slash for this because we have to
tell Drupal what sort of rules to follow
anytime you're making a new page or a
new piece of content what that URL is
going to be so if we go to configuration
up here in your menu bar
and then we're going to go down here to
URL aliases under search in metadata
you'll notice you can see our Scot about
is an alias that we've made to point to
node - one because as far as Drupal is
concerned that piece of content is still
no - one we're just pointing Scot slash
about - no - one and displaying Scott
slash about so let's say we wanted to
set up a pattern so that every time we
make a new piece of content it follows
the same Scott slash about or just even
slash about or
slash whatever the content title is well
for that we're actually going have to
install a module so in the next lesson
I'm going to show you how to install a
module called URL path aliases and with
that we're going to make our patterns
okay
well see you next time once again this
is Scott with level up tuts and thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
