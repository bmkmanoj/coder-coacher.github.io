of HUD's and today I'm going to show you
how to install an extension with Magento
connect and this will open up your world
a little bit with Magento because not
only does Magento have the great
functionality that it has out of the box
it also has the ability to install all
these community-made extensions for
either free or for you know some sort of
expense but you know some range to be
very expensive and some are very cheap
and it all depends on which extension
you're looking for but if you go to
Magento commerce com slash Magento -
connect you'll get to the Magento
connect extension marketplace and I'm
going to say you're going to want to hit
go ahead and make an account because you
can't get anything installed without an
account so go ahead and make an account
take your time come back and we'll pick
up after you have an account already
made this is the Magento connect if you
come here and you look for maybe
utilities and you can then sort you can
say I want the most popular ones that
are using Magento community and since
we're in version 1.7 you're going to
want to make sure that you find an
extension that's compatible with 1.7 so
you can see all these extensions there's
tons and tons and tons of stuff and you
might be thinking you know you could get
lost looking for all these extensions
extensions so look through all of them
and see what you can find and by all
means
you know go crazy because you know the
extensions can do a lot of cool things
one extension that I found here is easy
template path hints you can find it
under utilities developer tools and it's
called easy template path hints I sort
of picked this one just because I liked
the way it looked it maybe has some nice
functionality but coincidentally I have
not actually used this before so I am
going to install this in fact if we come
here and we're logged in already we're
going to make sure our platform selected
be community we click install now and
we're using Magento connect 2.0 with
version the gentle 1.7 so make sure you
click this and select - and I
agree to the licensing and you notice it
gives you this URL don't go to this URL
because it's not going to take you
anywhere just copy this and we're going
to save this for a little bit so let's
come back to our Magento site here and
under our admin if we come down to
Magento connect and let's go to connect
manager here it's going to ask you to
well it usually asks you to enter your
username and password for your admin
again since I've been here recently
within this session it's not asking me
but it's going to probably ask you and
one thing you might want to make sure of
is sometimes up top here it can give you
a warning saying your permissions are
not set correctly and I would go ahead
and Google that error and try the things
that people are suggesting when I had
that error here locally it was editing
something in I'm using MAMP currently
even though we start off the series with
the zamp is um thing in my httpd.conf
file and it was just making sure that
you know the right group and user was
owning the folder that I was editing so
if you're getting this error by all
means google it and attempt to problem
solve there's a lot of different
permissions things that can go wrong so
unfortunately I can't make a video
troubleshooting those however I would
say there is lots of help if you're
getting those errors so here we are and
what's cool is that you have access to
check for updates and stuff like that
but here we're just really going to
install this extension so it says to
look for them modules in a Magento
connect and paste the extension key here
this is what we copied a moment ago and
I'm going to go ahead and click this
magic install button you see please wait
and it finds a stable version says it's
ready to install click proceed and
you'll get this terminal says it's
installed and it's clearing my cache
cache cleared successfully and that's
it as long as your permissions are set
correctly this is as easy as installing
an extension for Magento community gets
so let's come back to our admin and it's
going to make me log in again because it
cleared the cache on the side I think or
it's not so let's check this out
let's go to system configuration and
let's see if these new tools are here
anywhere I'm actually going to check
this extension just to see convince okay
so system configuration mage psycho
extensions so let's just scroll down and
you'll see mage psycho extensions and we
have this easy template path intimate
info if I click info it's going to show
me a little bit info about this who the
contact are you know maybe some help
stuff so each one of these extensions is
probably be a little bit different you
can see I've already installed this
catalog extensions right here so this
one already showed up in a different
spot but easily template path hints
shows up right here and looks like it's
set to yes and this gives you an access
code of Magento so all you have to do is
enter this query string right here at
the end of your URL and where code is
equal to the code it's here so our code
is Magento let's come to a page I'm
going to paste this in here and maybe
slash and Magento cool so looks if we
didn't have to go into the admin and
turn on anything all we did was add this
query string to the end of our URL and
we have these template path ends and
what's great about this is we don't have
to come into configuration settings
developer turn on path heads and you
know have that go live to everybody on
the site even though you could block you
could you know filter that with IP or
whatever their settings to do that
however this is just nice it's really
quick all you have to add is this little
bit of code here and sure enough flavor
template a template hints on we go to
any page and it's gone we want it back
just paste this right at the end here
again
you could just have this I use an
application called the clip menu that
stores the last like 20 different things
I've copied and pasted so you can come
in here if you had something like this
you could just copy it leave it in your
you know your history of your clipboard
and then paste it whenever you wanted so
that's really awesome this is how we
installed an extension in the next video
I'm gonna show you how to install an
extension using dot mage which is the
utility that we went over before we're
in command line so as always this kind
with a little Tut's if you have any
questions please leave a comment of the
video if you're having problems with
permissions please you know google
around for it there's tons and tons of
help out there you know I know lots
people are have had issues because the
permissions in Magento can sometimes be
a little finicky so check it out let me
know what you think you know a Twitter
Facebook anything this is Scott with
level up tuts and thanks for watching
