up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna get started by installing and
opening up principle let's get going on
that now so over the course this series
we're gonna be learning principle and
you may have seen principle around and
you may have not now one thing that
separates principle from other
applications is the ability to easily
add animated and interactive user
interfaces and another great thing is
that it pairs really nicely with sketch
so if you use sketch which I know many
of you have then principle will not only
import directly from sketch but it will
feel nice at home because the app has a
lot of very similar concepts now you
might be wondering well what is
principle why do I need it you know
how good is this well if you just look
at some of their basic examples I mean
this sort of tinder esque swiping you
have multiple screens you have these
types of animations like this action the
floating action button style animation
and you can create all of these
animations
inside of principle now these aren't
going to be translated to the web in any
way right you can't export these into a
website but if you need to mock up
various interactions and maybe you're a
designer and you want to pass off your
ideas for animating to your developers
principle is a great way that they make
not only see the animation but they can
feel it and interact with it and just
look at the list of the design teams
using principle I mean the it's it's
pretty darn amazing there's a lot of
great stuff here now in addition you
have a 14-day trial or it's 99 bucks I
am not getting paid for this series or
anything like that they're not a sponsor
of mine or anything but I would
recommend purchasing this app for 99
dollars it's well worth it and I use it
all the time but if you're not convinced
you have 14 days to try it and it should
be enough time to go through these
videos and just really learn a lot about
principle and see if it's good and it
works well for you so let's go ahead and
click download the
free-trial get this downloaded what it's
going to do is essentially just give you
a zip file here you'll see I already
have it downloaded and when that's done
you can just unzip it let's go ahead and
do that and inside of the zip is really
just this app which you'll just drag and
drop into your applications from there
it'll be in your applications and you
can put it in your dock or something if
you want to open it up but that's the
installation process right there now
before we get started I want to just
show you the principle group on Facebook
if you just search for principal you'll
be able to see some stuff that people
have made and they'll often post links
where you can download their projects
this is one of the single best places to
learn things about principal I mean look
at this animation right here this whole
thing is beautiful this was made with
principle and in this animation was
exported there what you can do is you
can come through here and just see these
are beautiful amazing interfaces that
these really talented people have done I
mean just look at some of this stuff is
just super cool and not only is it super
cool it's extremely inspiring like I
look at this and I want to learn how to
build this I want to learn how to build
it on the web I want to learn how to
build it in principle I just want to
learn how to do this so principle is a
great way and comes into the Facebook
principal page is a great way to learn a
lot about how to use principal but just
to get inspired of some really awesome
UX stuff now I'm sure you could head to
dribble and check out some stuff on
dribble as well but the facebook group
is great because there's a lot of
communication a lot of people asking
questions again I have no affiliation
with this I just this is a tool that I
use all the time I'm pretty much
constantly on this page so check it out
head to Facebook check out the principal
if you don't use Facebook don't worry
we're gonna be creating a lot of super
cool stuff I'm going to be showing you
the interface basics I'm going to be
showing you how to use principal and if
you purchase this series on store that
level up tutorials calm or you subscribe
and become a level up Pro either of
those options you get
a whole bunch of extra videos showing
you how to make like replications of
some of my favorite inspired principal
designs that other people have made I'm
just going to be selecting a bunch of
ones that I really like we're gonna be
going through exactly how they made them
so that interest you at a store dot
level up tutorials common either
purchase a subscription or purchase this
series from the store and check out all
of those videos as always this is Scott
