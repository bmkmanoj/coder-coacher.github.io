of Tut's and today we're gonna talk
about collections and so you have seen
at the top of your count commerce
kick-starts site we have this menu here
to carry to drink to geek out to wear
and all products so what what's going on
here what's going on with this menu well
it turns out that this menu is being
created through a module called taxonomy
menu and it's being auto generated by a
taxonomy and so you might go through
these menus here and look for something
called collections and you might not
even know it's called collections unless
you look at a particular product but we
can find that under advanced settings
and then structure just to give you a
quick idea under to Kari it's actually a
listing of these various types of
products that have been labeled as to
Kari
and there's even like a little menu here
and if you wonder how this is all
credits all created through a view which
we can pop through more later when we
want to talk about modifying it but this
view is of course accepting an argument
which is of course the taxonomy term
which is then listing those products
that are associated with that well so
you don't have to know the complexities
behind that to just get this going as is
and of course that's a more advanced
topic so in the future we're going to
talk about modifying this and changing
how it works but right now we just want
to get these products showing up and we
want a category for our glasses to go
under so we just want that category to
be to see with I mean because we have to
drink with and to wear so we can have to
see with so let's not go under site
settings and then structure and then we
can find taxonomy down here at the
bottom now we're gonna look for
collection which is right here and let's
list terms we can click Add term
directly but just to show you here we
have to drink with to geek out to where
all that good stuff so let's go ahead
and add a term and this is going to be
to see
with okay great and we could even add an
image here and it's gonna have that
image at the top of the page if we do I
don't have an image ready and you don't
have to have one so I'm just not going
to have an image and under relations
it's going to be related to the root and
that's all we have to do let's click
Save okay so we have our categories here
our collections I'm sorry not categories
and you can see we still have to carry
to drink with to geek out to where and
all products well to get this to extra
show up we're gonna have to put
something in that category first so
let's go to products manage products and
let's find those aviators that we
created we can go to edit and where do
we select collection well we need to add
collection to this content type
so let's come back to our content
content types
and now let's find sunglasses alright I
think it's just glasses let's go to
manage fields and we need to add a new
field but it's an existing one and the
existing field is going to be term
reference field collection and this is
going to be a select list and let's just
click Save and now we should be seeing
this collection we should be seeing this
on our glasses
content types so once again go to manage
products now let's go to our aviators
let's go to edit and we now see
collection as an option let's go and
click to see with I just notice that all
of them are in lower case but this it's
okay we can fix it with CSS let's click
Save and we're gonna have our new menu
item here to see what to carry to drink
with to geek out to where all products
okay and we click on to see what you see
we still don't see anything that's
because this is grouping things by
categories and not collections
categories and now while we did create a
category for glasses
and this might get confusing but under
categories which is really just some
taxonomy stuff we actually have a
category called category and this is
actually more for a product category if
you go to your listing of terms it's
really what do you describe this as and
this is more general than a content type
or I mean more direct than a content
type as the content type is describing
sort of what fields it has but this is
more describing like what physical type
of product this is so we have these
options here I mean you could see tote
bags is it different from a messenger
bag but they both be of the content type
bags so while we had our you know
glasses style you know that's a
possibility here you can add glasses
style but we just want to lump all of
our glasses together and maybe even have
two different categories one for glasses
and one for sunglasses maybe so let's
click Add term and we can actually just
write glasses okay and now I'm gonna
write another term and it's going to be
sunglasses so let's save this one and
now we'll say Sun glasses and now these
are our categories that we're going to
work with but again we also have to add
this to our content type so content
content types and let's come back to
glasses here manage fields and we're
going to add another existing field this
one of course is category that it's
another term reference now we save this
once again we come to our product manage
products we come to our aviators and we
should have that option now where we can
select if this is sunglasses or glasses
and we're going to say category
sunglasses save and now when we click on
this to see with you're gonna see a
category here sunglasses with our
aviators so perfect just like any of
these other options you'll notice have
these all have images we now have this
category sunglasses
being displayed with this collection to
see with and this is really how these
views and themes are made and it seems
like it might be a little complex
because it's a little different than
some of the other systems but it is
really easy and it handles a lot of
stuff for you it really takes care of a
lot of the associations so you can have
your users really understand maybe the
layout of your site a bit more and keep
in mind this is Drupal so if you don't
like the way any of these menu systems
are put together you can just build your
own and if you need to know how to do
that
please refer to our Drupal series this
is Drupal 7 anything that you can do in
Drupal 7 you can do in Drupal commerce
kickstart so feel free to just pause the
possibilities are pretty much endless
and this is how you create this category
menu right okay so in the next couple of
lessons we're gonna start going over how
you can actually use your store so we're
going to be doing like a tax we're gonna
be doing shipping and that sort of stuff
and there's a lot to see there so keep
watching I promise more videos are gonna
be coming soon there's not going to be
such a large delay this time so great as
always this is Scott with level up tuts
and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
