up Hut's and today we're gonna be
talking about file permission basics now
file permissions can sometimes get in
the way of something you're trying to do
maybe you don't have particular access
to modify all the file that you're
trying to access and maybe you just
don't understand the file permissions I
know when I first started with web
development and some systems people
would say oh you just need to modify the
file permissions to get this to work and
as a new user that was confusing right
because you never really had to touch
file permissions before and there are a
series of numbers right you may say like
six six six six or seven five five or
four six six or people might say things
like that we're going to make this way
less confusing and explain it in a way
that you can understand so the first
thing I want to do is I'm going to just
LS where I am just to see the files that
my current working directory now I'm
gonna go into my sites folder then level
up okay and let's go into our test
folder that we created okay I can
actually hit command K and I term and I
think it's that way in terminal 2 to
just clear but I'm gonna stay in the
same spot that I was and from here let's
type LS space hyphen L now this is just
going to give us a bit more information
about this working directory now what we
see here is a whole bunch of information
you saw a little bit this before in one
of our other videos but what we're gonna
focus on is this section the very first
things that show up here now this might
look a little funky it's a bunch of you
know characters but if you look a little
bit closer you'll notice there's some
sort of pattern here in fact the first
character okay it's a dash or a D but
then we have an RW and then it looks
like it's a repeating pattern right so
our WX our - X R - X where these could
maybe be replaced
by a w perhaps and so what do these mean
well luckily they're pretty they're
pretty reasonable about their they're
like what these stand for right so what
we have here is we have the hello.txt
and the public directory so the - stands
for a file and D stands for a directory
so we have a file here and we have a
directory now next up we have an our W
and X the R stands for read the W stands
for write and the X stands for execute
so and we have it repeated three times
when there's a - that means that that
particular grouping does not have access
to do that so the reason why there's
three of them is because we have three
levels of access we have the user which
is the first level of access so for this
directory the user Scott which is myself
can read write and execute this
directory okay now next we have the
group and the group is the group of
users and so every single user within
the group of staff has access to write
and execute this directory or I'm sorry
read and execute this directory they
don't have X's to write it but since I
even though I'm a part of the group
staff my user Scott has access here now
the last one is the global so this is
pretty much everyone else now
this everyone else has access to just
read and just execute now if we look at
our file I have access to read and write
this file but not execute it I have
access our staff the group has access to
just read and everyone has access to
just read
now what does this really mean in some
in your web applications right
you want some files to only be able to
be read by the web server right and the
server is going to maybe be in the group
and that the server can read write and
execute these files but you don't want a
user coming in off of the internet to be
able to you know access or execute some
files so basically you're not going to
want to have read write and execute
available for everyone on all your files
in fact most Vile's you're not going to
want to have them available to read
write and execute on now what happens
with the numbers right so you may see in
some applications or people saying you
want your permissions to be seven seven
seven so what does that mean well if the
user has access to rewrite and execute
something that is equal to seven so if
someone were to have permissions of
seven seven seven then the user the
group and the world would be able to
execute they would be able to read write
and execute now the other combinations
are basically it's a if it's a six that
means that they can read and write if
it's a five that means they can read and
execute and if it's a four that means
they can just read so now if you see
those permission numbers like a six four
four that means the user can read and
write and everybody else can only read
it now those are probably some of the
more common ones like 644 or 755 in fact
if we go through any sort of Magento or
a lot of other content management
systems or anything like that pretty
much any application but
a lot of times you'll go into the the
forums of Magento and since people
aren't familiar with file permissions
there and be like well why is this
working not like this
and then people asked well what are your
permissions and they say they're this
you know they're all you know four four
four okay well that's why because nobody
can read execute or write this stuff and
like some files like PHP files need to
be executed by the server and a
permission of only being able to read
them is not going to allow that okay so
this is an introduction to file
permissions it's by no means like the
complete understanding of file
permissions or anything but if you
haven't had a whole lot of experience
modifying file permissions this is a
good place to start in the next video
we're gonna be talking about how to
modify file permissions so we can
actually change these to actually you
know seven seven seven five five five
without having to use another
application we can do it directly in
terminal so as always this is Scott with
LevelUp Tut's if you have any questions
or comments leave a comment the video or
hits up at Twitter or Facebook I level
up tons we'd love to hear from you
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
