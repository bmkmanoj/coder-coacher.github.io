up tutorials and in this video I'm going
to be showing you how you can install a
linter into your project now Adam offers
a great way to easily and quickly
install a whole bunch of different
linters based on the way you want to
actually lend your various types of code
and it actually works really really well
within the Adam interface itself so
let's get going on that right now
now if you view sublime text to one of
the pain points you know is occasionally
linters now I've had a lot of issues
with either winter is not working
reliably or just sort of being a pain to
install now linting is one area where I
feel like Adam really got it right there
is the Adam linter sort of grouping of
packages where you can simply type in
linter - and then whatever type of
linter you're looking for for instance
if you're using PHP you could search for
winter - PHP and at the top you'll see
linter - PHP is by Adam linter linting
PHP and we can select this and see that
all you really need to do is install
this and maybe there is a little bit of
setup but for the most part they're
really easy so let's go ahead and
install one of my favorite lenders which
is at JSC s JSC s and after this
searches it should find that linting JSC
s now JSC s is a type of JavaScript
linting if you select this the title
here now if you select the title it's
going to open up the github page for JSC
s linter and it's basically a code style
checker JSC s is a very particular cut
style of coded checking and one that I
happen to like well if we come back to
Adam we can just click the install
button
and you'll see that it is in fact
installing our Adam linter and now as
you see uninstall disabled aren't there
so our new plugin has been installed now
if I open up just a standard sort of
JavaScript file here this is actually a
meteor blaze file if I save this you can
see instantly upon saving without having
to refresh or restart the application
we're already getting linting
information down here at the bottom it
says I have 26 issues now it's nice is
that first it tells you which linter
found at the error and whether that's
like an error or maybe just like an
issue or something so J SCS found the
error if we had like j s int in here as
well it would say j s hint next to it in
addition so you could actually
distinguish which linter is actually
giving you the error now it also
underlines at and when we select that
line it tells us that one space is
required after the if keyword okay so
obviously this is an issue causing code
to work correctly this is an issue of
style when I hit a space there
you can see that the underline is now
gone in addition it wants a space
underneath this and it wants to get rid
of that white space so as you can see
here we can certainly come through here
and to correct these issues as we find
them so it looks like we're missing a
and as you can go you can see we can
just go through and change these little
J s CS things that it likes to see CS
linter is happy now in addition let's go
ahead and just add another JavaScript
linter I'm just going to type in linter
- J s and see what sort of comes up now
I typed in - hint because I'm looking
for J s hint in here it is
J s hint let's go ahead and add that J s
hint linter and you'll notice there's
linters for sass there's linters for
Jade
there's linters for all kinds of things
and it's really nice to just have these
in here because they just sort of work
right and so we have the settings here
and we can modify some settings if we
need to but let's just go ahead and save
our file once more and see if we have
any issues and see if we have any issues
coming up now J s hint is going to do
more of looking for actual errors in our
thing it's not just going to be looking
for stylistic things like JSC s is and
you'll notice that when I deleted this
bracket we're now getting some yellow
errors down here and what's great about
this is that we have these red and this
JSC s label here but next to this it
tells us that it's J is Hindu that way
you know is for coming here as
something's not right it's expected this
will allow to be expecting that oh well
we must be missing something here and
now we say this it's going to have error
still because it added double brackets
but when we get rid of that you can see
all those yellow issues going away and
it also adds sort of a yellow or red or
just different sort of marker here in
the gutter
so as you can see you could run multiple
Hin tours and linters at once and you
can run all sorts of different linters
for your different technologies as well
but as you can see it just has this
little window down here if we were to
clean all of these up
now another nice thing is you can jump
to an issue by clicking on its line
number right here or if you just click
this 22 issues it's going to go to the
next issue down on the list so really
this linting system is really as good as
it gets for this kind of text editor
without getting into more of like an IDE
or something like that but linting in
Adam is super nice so check it out go to
your plugins and just really search for
anything you want so as you can see this
couldn't be any easier if you want to
have access to the rest of these Adam
videos before they're released you can
always have to store that level up
tutorial comm and purchase them or sign
up to be a level up Pro and have access
to the full catalog of the Adam videos
before they drop on YouTube so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
you have any questions or comments
becoming the video hurt me up at twitter
or facebook at level up tutorials I'd
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
