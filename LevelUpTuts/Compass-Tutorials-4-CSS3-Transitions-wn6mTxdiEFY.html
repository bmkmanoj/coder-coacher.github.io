up Tut's today we're gonna be talking
about css3 transitions using compass and
I mentioned last time that compass makes
it really nice and easy to use these
css3 properties with all of their vendor
prefixes well we're going to show you
one more of those right now and that's
going to be transitions so to start off
if you'll notice these anchors here
these links don't have any hover state
they don't have any anything so when
we're first going to do is we're going
to just give them a hover State so using
the parent selector that we learned in
sass we're gonna do ampersand colon and
then hover and our brackets we'll just
get this background of white just so
it's nice and noticeable I'm not going
for any design Awards here so we saved
this out go to terminal okay refresh
this alright okay
cool it's your pretty standard hover
State you'd like you're used to
okay so now we want to add a transition
to this hover state if you don't know
about css3 transitions you have to add
the transition to the original state of
the object so if we're going to have
this anchor tag change on hover we're
going to add the transition to the
anchor tag itself okay so if you go to
the compass documentation here
let's see you'll see that it has you
declare each of the properties for
transition individually so there's all
sorts of stuff you can declare with
transition you can say okay let's
transition its width over a couple
seconds you can give an easing function
you can give it how how long it takes
for the transition to complete or what's
what the transition encompasses you
could say all or just the width because
I mean we only have one property on this
changing if the background but because
we want to you know include any other
property changes that we might have
we're gonna give this a property or
transition property of all so I'm just
actually gonna grab this include right
here from the example alright and then
we're gonna give this at all
and then we're actually going to say
it's going to do two seconds and it's
going to be eased we like this easin
okay so this mix and works it really
like many of the other mix ins that we
went over including like border-radius
except for this you have to pass at the
properties are the different the
different transition properties so
transition property all transition
duration the timing function you have to
do all that separate so now hopefully
save this out we check our CSS here is
all of our brendor a browser prefixes
everything's all in order let's go back
to our project refreshes file all right
nice and easy we got an eased fade in
and it's gonna take a long time to fade
out it actually it's pretty funny it I
selected two seconds there I sort of
meant to select two milliseconds but
this basically how I copied it from
their and their documents so that is a
nice long fade in but let's see it at
two milliseconds so it's a little bit
more normal looking so yeah it's a nice
little effect here it looks a little bit
nicer than just a normal hover on okay
well that's the css3 transition mixin
for compass feel free to let us know
what you're thinking if you have any
questions comments about compass s or
any of our other videos or other series
we have a drupal series going on right
now and an expression engine series
we're also going to be starting a
wordpress series really soon all sorts
of stuff so if there's anything you want
to learn in particular hit us up let us
know follow us at level up Tut's lots
more stuff coming very soon thanks a lot
