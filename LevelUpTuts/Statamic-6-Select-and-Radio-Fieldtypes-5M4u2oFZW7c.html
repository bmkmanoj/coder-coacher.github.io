tuts in this tutorial we are going to
dig deeper into field sets and i'm going
to introduce the select and radio field
types the last tutorial if you remember
we created our own custom field by
editing the field the file in the field
set directory for page so if you still
have that up great if not go ahead and
fetch it it's if you remember it's in
the config and field sets so we're going
to do is we're going to create a new
field and this is the only way you can
do this again you cannot do this in the
control panel so what I'm going to do is
first to create a select list so I'm
going to create a new field called
playlist and the first thing I'm going
to do is tell it that it's a type of
select and I'm going to give it a
display name playlist I'm gonna give it
some instructions now choose what
playlist this post
belongs to and then let's go ahead and
give it the options there's two ways to
do this if you can just list them out
like so and go ahead and hit save check
it out over here on the bottom or oh
noes right here playlist so here we go
drupal questions dynamic honor so that
was pretty easy the other way we can do
this is by I'm going to go ahead and
copy and paste this a second per copy it
the only thing we can do is we can
implement a value label method so we can
do something like this so where the
value is on the left and the labels on
the right
and what we should see here actually I
don't let's go ahead and inspect this
see if we can see them so previously the
value and the label were the same the
reason why you might want to do it this
way is you know so you can have better
control over it you know if there was
spaces then that could you know mess
things up over here so i always do it
this way so anyway go ahead and say it
save now let's refresh and take a look
at that again and now notice that you
know instead of expression engine we
have ecms everything else is lower to
match that so that is how you do a
select if you want a radio which is sort
of the same thing right it's like this
in this case you can't select multiple
you can only select ones just like a
radio so this may not be too shocking
but in this case
um oops that was the display video we
just changed the type now it's us it's a
the radio buttons so let's go ahead and
inspect on this
so there we go so here's the value lower
case the label and then the value again
so there you go that is your
introduction to how to create a radio
and select menu its data make thanks a
lot for watching and be sure to follow
us on youtube and on Twitter at level of
tots thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
