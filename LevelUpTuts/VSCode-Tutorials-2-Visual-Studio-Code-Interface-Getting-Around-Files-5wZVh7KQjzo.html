comments that the resolution was a bit
of an issue in the past couple of videos
so I wanted to take an opportunity to
rerecord a couple of these before we get
any further within this series so let's
talk about the interface here you can
see mine's going to be looking quite a
bit larger than yours that's because
I've bumped it up a bit I didn't
increase the resolution but vs code has
a way of coming into view and then you
can zoom in and out so hopefully this is
big enough hopefully this makes things a
little bit easier to see you'll notice
that when I do some actions everything
is just larger overall so it's not just
font size or anything like that it's the
whole the whole thing so here we have
the interface for vyas code and sure
enough I dropped in a project here now I
loaded this up simply by dropping a
folder onto the vs code icon but you
could also load a project by coming in
to file open open recent anything like
that here and what we have here is just
an actual react native application that
the code here doesn't really matter
we're going to mostly talking about sort
of the interface and how to get around
now vs code is a little bit different
than let's say Adam or sublime text and
Adam gives you a little bit more sort of
like visual fluff ride the interfaces a
little bit nicer you're not editing JSON
files constantly for settings and stuff
like that
what vias code gives you is a little bit
more feature-rich out of the box and
what we can see here instantly is that
we have our standard sort of file tree
that you're used to seeing in any other
text editor but we also have this column
over here on the left and this is going
to include several things such as
extensions which we're going to get over
in another video we have a debug panel
which is really interesting because it's
sort of borders on an IDE territory here
and then we have some get things where
we can actually commit directly from our
repository in here let me make this
bigger overall here we can change
branches we can do a whole bunch of
really incredible good stuff which will
be going over and we have a more
dedicated search find and replace now
let me tell you one thing
I love about the search find and replace
compared to these other two a demand
sublime
this thing is super super fast it find
over your entire project it takes no
time at all compared to atom which you
know could overload your memory in no
time trying to find something in a large
project and lastly at the very top we
have our files panel which is already
open now our final panel by default
shows us our open editors or the entire
project from here we have some icons
such as create a new file create a new
folder want to refresh in case maybe
there are some changes that haven't been
seen I've never used the refresh button
but I can imagine that if you're not
noticing a file tree update or something
like that it could be useful and then we
also have just collapse all which is
going to collapse every single folder so
let's say we dive into all of these
folders here and all of a sudden want to
get out
claps off get this out so this is really
nice it's a nice way to take control
over your files and if we were to open a
file like this app digest you can see it
shows up in our open editors where we
actually have some icons if we hover
over the open editors such as horizontal
editor group layout okay so this is the
file panel again we have search finally
replaced we have our kit we have our
debug tools and we have our extensions
now let's check out some of the other
stuff we have I'm going to zoom this
over or was really nice here we can
collapse this entirely simply just by
clicking this and it's gone now what
else do we have here at the bottom we
have this toolbar which formerly has
never been Thema belen the past however
a new version of vias code just came out
and you could actually if the theme
supports it this doesn't have to be blue
finely anymore but we're going to see
down here is we're going to see stuff
from our debug council if we're having
issues you're going to have stuff down
here if you're having like EES lint bugs
maybe your linting your code you have
your sort of what line in particular
you're on if you click this it gives you
the option to even just jump to a line
okay so this is really more
informational I don't know if I've ever
clicked this to change what line I'm on
we also have the ability to change our
indentation right now I'm you
two spaces but we could use tab spaces
whatever I am NOT going to judge you on
your tabs or spaces that is up to you
next we have what sort of typing coding
I've never changed this from utf-8 but
then again I've never had a reason to
and then we have this LF now this is the
Select end of line sequence which
actually the L F stands for line feed or
C RL F stands for carriage return and
this has to do with how the application
handles line breaks I'm not one to
change this if you do need to change
this then obviously you would know but
it's not something that most people are
going to go in here and change and the
next we have this JavaScript where it's
detecting what language you're using and
obviously we can extend this with
various different languages and
different extensions will be going over
extensions in the next video and then we
have our linting which is telling us
that our output down here the es lint
server is running although it is
obviously missing a config file so it's
not doing anything for us right now but
what's really nice is this will give us
a little bit of output one of the things
I really love about vs code is just how
friendly it is with linting and that's
something that sublime text is never
done really well Adam got it right but
for some reason vias code has been way
more reliable all the way around and
lastly we have the smiley face which is
really just tell us about your feedback
you know the cool thing about the vs
code is is a labor of love so this team
really puts a lot of effort into making
this thing really well you're going to
have a lot of people who have different
needs and wants so it's always nice to
give them your experience ok if we close
that out last thing we have in this
interface is up top right now this was
not here when we had a no file open but
now that we have a file open we can do a
couple of things here for instance if we
want to split the editor it's going to
split this you notice how it's splitting
it vertically or it's cutting it in half
vertically that has to do with up top
here where we had this icon this icon
right here that we click now and you'll
notice now when we split a page it's
going to split it vertically or
is going to split it down the middle we
have to now vertical panes can notice
how it's the same file I've never quite
understood that exactly you would think
maybe you want to put a different file
in here but it works and let's close
this now one really cool thing is if we
were to actually have this project being
a get tracked if we were to click open
changes it would show us our changes
we're going to talk a little bit more
about good stuff in another video and
then I have these dot dot dot which is
just show open others it's anything else
and they're really just going to give us
an option to jump between auditors and
don't use this button much I can't
imagine needing it now one of the things
I wanted to talk about was getting
around files now in sublime text and
atom we had things that command T and
you'll notice if we hit command T this
is going to allow us to search for
symbols for instance if we start typing
an app what it's going to find is the
app class inside of apt is if we click
that it takes us right to the line word
defines app now let's do command T and
search for lowercase and you can see I
type in s and it's already found styles
which is our styles that were created
from the style sheet create and it's
going to jump directly to that line so
go to symbol is for finding bits of code
now what happens if you wanted you to
jump to a particular file you can do
command P and now command P allows you
to basically go to any file what's
brilliant here is that you have recently
opened already here and we have a split
window button so if we wanted to open
our app Jason in a split panel we can
click this icon right here and it's now
opened up Jason in a split panel for us
so the two keyboard shortcuts I use the
most command T to find a symbol or
command P to start searching for a file
and obviously if you start typing it's
going to find you that file okay so this
is how we get around and this is the
interface of vs code it's quickly become
my favorite text editor and I really
can't imagine using anything else right
now
so check it out in the next video we're
going to go over how you can extend
guess code with some extensions because
really at Exeter is only as good as the
extension library it has an vs code has
a great extension library so fire up the
next video and learn a little bit about
vs code extensions as always this is
