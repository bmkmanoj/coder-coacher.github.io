up tuts and today we're going to be
making our drupal commerce experience a
little bit better with a contributed
module for drupal commerce now many
sites that you go to when you go to put
something in your cart you click the Add
to Cart button and it gives you a nice
ageac solution that doesn't refresh the
page that says you know product pizzetta
to the car and maybe shows you a display
window with Drupal commerce it just
gives you a Drupal set message which
isn't really pretty it's not pretty I
mean these drupal sent messages
obviously you'd be theming them
differently you could maybe have them
overlay or something like that but it's
really it doesn't look right and it's
not the best solution luckily there is
contributed modules like commerce Ajax
cart so its commerce underscore Ajax
underscore cart I'm gonna put the link
in the description and you can download
it from there so go ahead and download
the latest and install it into your
modules directory
I've already installed into my modules
directory and it shows up under the
commerce can trip modules so we can go
ahead and save this you'll notice that
the latest version at the time of the
video is beta 3 so if you're on
something different than that they could
look different I mean chances are won't
look too different but just keep that in
mind now I'm gonna save this and we
should have this module enabled now in a
lot of sites you might be used to be
going to configuration than to start
modifying things or checking settings
for modules
however with Drupal commerce modules
they pretty much go under store so if we
click store then under configuration
this is our store specific configuration
you'll notice that our commerce Ajax
card settings are right here second from
the top now you can say the positioning
of the cart here the cart preview that
is so there's some documentation you can
read by going to this link it's actually
jQuery UI so this is just jQuery UI
documentation but we want this to be in
the right top so we can say right
my right top at left bottom sure okay
if you need more information about that
like I said check out this this readme
right here and just this empty card text
down here we can go ahead and click Save
now you'll notice there's not a whole
lot to configure that is if we come into
our site here and let's refresh now
that's all we have to do now when we
come down here and click Add to Cart
you'll notice we don't get a page
refresh and this Drupal set message is
still here but we didn't have to go
through a page request to get it which
is totally excellent because you know we
obviously don't want the page to refresh
if we're going to be a Jacke seeing
something like that however where is our
other information well we need to turn
on a block to get the cart information
to show up
so let's come to structure blocks and
we're going to add the generic shopping
cart block where are we here the
shopping cart block I'm just going to
throw this into the header and save this
block now coming down into our page we
can refresh and we see this show cart
link which would take you to the the
cart page however when we click Add to
Cart you'll notice that the show to cart
actually gets filled out with our
information no obviously in there little
picture of it working here they show it
up top here and nice however this is the
same thing we have view cart checkout
links we have the total and we have our
items in here what we just really need
to do would be to add some CSS to
position this at the top or of course
use a Drupal commerce theme like the
commerce kickstart theme that they're
using here now for some of you if you
don't have the CSS skills and things
like that it might be a huge burden but
that's just really where Drupal Commerce
is at in Drupal in general as a
different as opposed to other
shopping cart solutions the pluses are
that Drupal Commerce lets you pretty
much configure anything you want the
downsides are is that you have to
configure pretty much everything to get
it working or looking nice and you
definitely are going to have to know
some CSS unless you're using a Drupal
commerce specific theme so we have Ajax
product adding to cart and while it may
not seem glorious or anything it's nice
that we don't have to have a separate
page refresh when we're now adding
products to the cart so as always this
is Scott with level of Tut's if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment the video or hit us up at
Facebook or Twitter or whatever we love
to hear from you there's tons more
Drupal commerce videos we're going to be
adding a more contribs
we're going to be customizing this we're
going to be doing more complex product
types and going through the whole
ordering process so more to come lots
more to come
also level up Tut's offers a paid
service called level up Tut's it's
called level up Pro and it's $8.99 a
month or 95 dollars a year and it gives
you access to some features like
downloadable videos a special course
sass mastery that I created for the
Tut's Plus Network that's no longer
available and you get no ads on the site
and there's code examples coming soon
the best part about level of Pro though
is not just the features it's that
you're supporting level up Tut's and
we're going to keep the tutorials free
for you and to do that we need help and
we need support so if you feel like
supporting level up Tut's sign up for
level up row for a couple months sign up
for a month I don't care whatever and
you'll be helping support keeping our
videos free so as always this is Scott
level of HUD's and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
