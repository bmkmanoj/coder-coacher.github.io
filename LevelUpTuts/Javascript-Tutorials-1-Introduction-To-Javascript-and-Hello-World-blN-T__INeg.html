of Tut's and today we're going to start
a new series and the series is going to
be on JavaScript and there's a lot of
resources for learning JavaScript online
which is a great thing however I just
feel like this series concern at the
very basics and approach JavaScript from
how you're going to use it in a web
development context rather than just
here's JavaScript here's you know how
you do an if statement here's I use it a
variant whatever this is going to be
talking about how we use it in our
websites at the same time you're going
to start at the very basics and so if
you know JavaScript already these first
videos are going to be boring but if you
don't know JavaScript or you want to
learn JavaScript this is the perfect
place to learn because we're gonna start
at the very basics we're going to go
slow and we're going to teach it like
how it's useful to you and hey you know
in the future well once we get a little
bit ways in the JavaScript we'll be
starting a jQuery series and know jQuery
is is essentially a library that makes
some tasks that are done entirely in
JavaScript just a little bit easier and
just take care of a lot of like
inconsistencies for you so we're going
to do JavaScript then we're going to do
jQuery and then we're going to move on
to some sort of advanced JavaScript and
advanced jQuery sort of stuff where it's
a little bit more we're using javascript
in maybe different contexts and we're
using plugins and and that sort of thing
and maybe we're going to be writing our
own plugins so it's going to be really
cool we're going to learn lots and it's
going to go from the very basics to
advanced so in this first video I just
really want to explain what exactly Java
scripts going to do for you as a web
developer so we're familiar with HTML
right so here's our basic HTML 5 site
you recognize this shell from our HTML 5
series and the HTML 5 and HTML is really
just your structure of your site right
it's the content and structure here
we've built our our site that's just a
sample it's got a title link and some
some blog posts here nothing fancy and
you'll notice it's not really styled but
it has a little bit of styling so we
have cut
which is our HTML and then we have
styling we have visuals which is our CSS
so those two work together to create
nice-looking websites and
well-structured websites but if you've
been on the internet for any period of
time you'll know the web's now is just
about static content and nice-looking
websites there is a level of
interactivity in modern-day websites and
that interactivity comes with JavaScript
so JavaScript brings the interactivity
to your websites so there's all sorts of
ways you can use javascript in fact if
you just want to try some of these
things out you don't have some working
code if you go to something like jsbin
it allows you to have a code here that
you could run notice how there's CSS and
HTML all this stuff but you can turn off
so you just see javascript council and
output and you can start writing
javascript in here and you know follow
along with these videos so if you don't
have a site or an HTML file that you're
working with feel free to check out
jsbin there's also jsfiddle I feel like
there's a bunch of these sites now but
any of them will do anywhere where you
can write JavaScript so we have this
html5 site and the first thing that
we're going to do is we're going to add
a JavaScript to our page so let's come
to our page and you'll notice that in
our HTML we have a script tag right here
that's adding a JavaScript called
moderniser that does feature detection
we're just going to ignore that now just
know it's adding moderniser which is a
JavaScript file we've downloaded you
also see the script tag that's adding
jQuery from Google APs this is all just
parts of html5 boilerplate if you've
seen any of the html5 videos you will
have seen that these things exist in our
code here but we don't need to worry
about them for right now cuz all we want
to do is add JavaScript at its most
basic and to do that we just need to
have a tag that says script and in html5
you don't need this type text/javascript
however you're not working with html5
you will need type equals text
slash JavaScript I'm just going to go
ahead and remove it just because we
don't need it and inside of the script
tag
you can actually start writing your
JavaScript so at its very most basic we
don't have to do anything and we can use
some basic JavaScript to just alert
hello world so we can say alert and then
inside of parenthesis and then inside of
quotations we're just going to type
hello well hello world and then you're
going to end it all with the semicolon
just like that and now if we save this
once our page loads it's just going to
run this well and once it gets to the
bottom of our page here loading here
it's going to run this command there's
two alerts hello world
so let's come to our page here and
refresh you'll notice that even before
the page is done loading it alerts us
this JavaScript alert hello world so
that's something that you often do when
you're learning a new programming
language is just get it to output hello
world and that's just the very most
basic thing you can do so we refresh our
page it says hello world with this alert
and it's you might see this sometimes
where you have script in your HTML and
that's alright but it's better practice
to have your script located outside of
your HTML and keep things separate right
so we want to have our javascript file
and outside of our HTML so how do we do
that well let's actually go ahead and
copy this we'll cut out this hello world
line so we can put it into our script
whatever and instead of having anything
in here I'm going to but these up like
here just like we have and I'm going to
add an SRC
just like we're used to so this is your
source and I actually have a J's file
that I'm calling main dot J s it's just
completely blank here and it's inside of
my JavaScript folder so in my index file
I can type in J s slash well not KS j s
slash main J s and you could really call
this file whatever you want you know I'm
calling it main dad
because that's what it is in html5
boilerplate although if I'm working on
my own I often called this script a s or
if it's related to a particular function
of the site I might name it differently
so here we can but that up here and now
let's go to our script file our main DJ
s because we don't have the alert in
right now if we refresh this page
nothing's going to happen but just
simply by pasting this alert hello world
into our main J s coming to this page
and refreshing we get the hello world so
having your Java Script in another
folder or another file like this does
not change how it acts I mean we could
have put it within those script tags
that did the exact same thing okay so
this is your first JavaScript video
we're really going over the basics like
I said take it slow let me know what you
want to see more of we're going to use
this to all sorts of things and then we
can enter weave it into the html5 series
and some of our other videos and the
jquery series and all sorts of stuff and
create web interactivity and awesomeness
so as always if you have any questions
or comments please leave a comment the
video or hit us up at Twitter level of
tuts let us know what you're thinking
we'd love to hear from you and thanks
