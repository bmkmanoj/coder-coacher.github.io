tutorials and in this video we're going
to start talking about flex items now
the children of a flexbox are considered
flex items and they have all sorts of
interesting properties on them so let's
take one video and check out all of the
new properties on flex items okay so in
the last video we talked all about the
flexbox container we went over all these
great properties like justify content we
had a line items
align the content I'm gonna get rid of
some of this stuff here to clean up our
code and let's remove that line height
as well in this video I'm going to
specifically be talking about the
children of a Flex container now before
all of the properties we added were onto
the container itself and now we're gonna
be talking about stuff that you can add
on to well the children or the divs in
this case that contain our numbers 1
through 4 so what kind of properties can
you add on them well we have this end
child here and it's height is a hundred
and fifty pixels and what we want to now
say is well number two we actually want
you to appear to be the first item in
the list so what we could say is order
and then negative one now number two is
now the first item in the list now this
might instantly be confusing where
you're wondering wait- why no why not
order of one you could see if we put an
order of one our item now is the last
item in the list now when you're first
starting out this might be totally
confusing right why the heck would
number one be the end of the list and
negative one be the front of the list
well the answer lies because really this
is just one single item that's ordered
if we say enth child 3 and given to
child an order of two you can see that 3
now appears after to that problem lies
within
number one and number four not having
any sort of order because these don't
have an order there by default set to
well zero so if you said something
one it's going to come after zero and
obviously two is after one we could swap
these like so and you can see now three
is coming before two what's wild about
all of this is the ginn the Dom layout
is not changing right number three and
number two when all of these are in
there one two three order within the Dom
however visually we're seeing one four
three two which is totally bananas and
if you've ever used CSS with floats or
anything like that this is something yet
you could never ever accomplish without
doing some position:absolute magic so as
you can see here flex item order is
immediately important because well
sometimes the dumb structure is more
important than the display structure for
instance if we want something that's
more important right maybe it's a
heading or something like that
and we want this to be first in the dom
we could position that but it needs to
be second visually we could position
things wherever we want while
maintaining that Dom structure now a
nice semantic HTML structure is one of
those things that you are always going
to want to maintain so this certainly
helps with being able to place things
wherever you'd like okay so an addition
to order we also have the property of
flex grow now flex grow is an
interesting one and it's gonna be a
difficult to wrap your head around a
little bit but what flex grow does is
defines basically how much an item can
grow so on our item number two let's go
ahead I'm gonna remove the order just so
we can have these in a nice order once
again let's go ahead and for number two
let's go ahead and give this a Flex grow
and then we'll say one now something
crazy happened here and to illustrate
this let's just you put a border on each
of our dibs we can do a border:solid 1px
'l and just have this be red okay I like
to use red it's easy to see and you can
see here yeah so
well one three and four all have the
same width and now two is well filling
up all the remainder of the space and
what flex grow does is by applying flex
grow to any of these well it's saying
hey feel free to take up that space even
though we've given you an explicit with
if you have a flex go property it's
going to grow into that width now it's
interesting here is we also have the
ability to control flex grow for
instance if we were to give item number
three a flex grow of two and item number
two a flex growth one you'll see
something very interesting here we have
a certain ratio taking place where if
you consider all of the open space
that's left let's ignore one in four
this is taking up space at a growth rate
two times that of this right so as we
increase this you'll see that they're
both increasing in size but the three is
increasing considerably larger and in
fact if we were to changes to three that
disparity is only going to get larger
you can see here as we grow yeah
so what flex grow does is it allows your
children of your Flex container to grow
to fill any available space and you
might be thinking what happened to that
width I assigned well that width it just
becomes merely a suggestion right number
one and four have that width applied
however two and three are now being
calculated to fill that space and in
addition to flex grow we also have a
property called flex shrink which is
essentially just the opposite of that
now next we have something called flex
basis now flex basis is something that
determines essentially the default size
of an element and by default the Flex
basis is set to auto and what Auto does
is it says what is the current in this
case width well the current width is 100
so my Flex basis the default width is
going to be 100 pixels but if I give
this a Flex basis of 200 pixel
you can see by default this item is now
200 pixels and as I shrink it it's sure
it's going to try to base this on the
Flex grow property however it's going to
use the initial base size to be this 200
before it starts to shrink and grow okay
so a lot of these properties here they
come up occasionally but things like
this flex basis they don't come up a ton
what's happening here is you're trying
to define really tight sort of
requirements for your flexible grid and
that's one of the things that flex box
can occasionally become troublesome with
is when you're trying to get things to
do exactly the way you want them and
typically if you have very strict
guidelines it's may be better off to go
with a grid rather than a flex container
and we also have a flex property which
allows you to set the Flex Gro flex
shrink and flex basis all in one line of
code so by default your Flex items if we
were to just give this a property of
flex would be zero for Flex grow and a
one for flex a shrink and an auto 4 flex
basis as and we're going to look at the
initial width in this case we're not
going to allow this to necessarily grow
at all you can see set to zero and we're
not growing with number two and the one
is basically allowing this to shrink at
the same rate as all of these other ones
and if we were to turn our Flex RepRap
by commenting this out you can see that
with Flex shrinks up to 1 you can see
that they're all shrinking but the
moment I set Flex shrink to 0 it's not
going to allow to to shrink and so just
like that
- now becomes the largest because it's
not being allowed to shrink okay so
check it out this flex is just a
shorthand like I said zero one Auto is
the standard it means you can it means
that you won't grow it means that you
can shrink and that it means that you
will always look to the initial width
set here
so hope that makes sense flex is
definitely one of the more confusing
ones that you're gonna want to spend a
little bit of time with but again you
don't necessarily use it a crazy ton but
at the end of the day it's all just more
control so next we have aligned self and
we've had our align properties like a
line items and align content and justify
content that deals with the entire group
but let's say we have one rogue number
three here that decides well hey I need
to be at the top of this container we
could do a line self and give this a
property of flex start and you can see
it shoots up to the top again we could
give this a property of flex and and it
falls to the bottom the properties for
this our auto flex start flex and center
baseline and stretch all of which are
the exact same as well aligned items so
it's super nice here is that a lot of
the stuff while we do have a bunch of
new properties and a bunch of new values
for CSS a lot of the stuff mirrors each
other and well if you're going to guess
what something is for the most part
you're always going to get it right
except for of course justify content
sort of stands out to me as one being
that's a little bit different however
once you get used to writing justify
content a whole bunch it becomes second
nature
so we've now covered all of the flexbox
properties and two videos here we've
covered all the container properties in
all of the children properties which
means that you should have some
understanding about how flexbox works
now there's a whole bunch of different
resources for learning flexbox but at
the end of the day you have to
understand that what we have here is a
flexible container that allows things to
be placed into it in all sorts of new
and exciting ways with much greater
control over alignment in position what
this is not is it's not any sort of type
of rigid grid if you're used to working
with grid systems such as bootstrap or
lost grid or Susy or any of those you
might be wondering well how the heck do
I make a grid system out of this and the
answer is it's not a great idea
because we now have something called CSS
grid which
is going to be more up your alley for
actually creating or having a grid
system whereas flexbox works better for
little micro instances things of which
we're going to show you as we go on with
our layouts so the general rule of thumb
here about when to use flexbox or when
to use grid is to use flexbox for well
aligning ends positioning a small little
chunks of your design let's say you want
to have three evenly spaced columns that
all sort of align themselves distributed
amongst their container no flex box is
perfect for that
if you want to do sort of the standard
left sidebar aligned and main content
area layout whatever even like the the
golden layout or whatever they used to
call it then flex box I would not use it
for that for that we're going to get
into CSS grid if we're doing actual
major layouts so in the next video we're
gonna be covering a CSS grid now CSS
grid is a bit more involved in Flex box
and in addition to coming along with a
lot of view properties there's also some
new units and functions and really
interesting things that have never been
in CSS before and you're gonna instantly
see it just about how amazing and how
powerful CSS grid can be with grid
layouts as always this is scott with
