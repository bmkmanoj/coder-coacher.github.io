up Tut's and today I'm going to be going
over some static blocks and some widgets
so if we come to the dashboard here and
we go to CMS we went over pages last
time you'll see that there's these other
things called static blocks or widgets
just take a look if you might have
noticed in the last tutorial when I went
down here at my footer in these links
here you saw this word test well this
isn't going to be on your installed
because I had done this some other time
where that is is actually into the CMS
static blocks and then footer links so
if we go to footer links here you can
see it's a list of all your footer links
and if you remember when we changed the
URL of about us we changed it to just
about - us that link didn't actually
change in the footer
so if you're changing a URL key of a
page like that you're going to have to
come in here where it's linking and
we're going to have to change that I'm
just going to click on show/hide
atatürk so you can see the source if
you'll notice here I change the URL to
be about us so now it's going to be
linking correctly we'll notice if we
click this it's taking us to the right
side the right URL key here but if you
change that and your footer link is now
not working that's why you have to come
into the static block and change it
let's take a look at what other static
blocks are built into the sample data
you'll have this electronics landing and
cell phones landing let's go to the
electronics page I've replaced this with
test let's go to the sanger cell phone
yeah no that's not right yeah cell
phones landing let's check this one out
so this is just really this image if we
show this it's a Sony Ericsson image so
if we click back here you'll see that
this right here this in particular is
the cell phone landing static block so a
static block is really just a chunk of
code that's not going to change that you
can say show up if you're used to using
something like Drupal that features
blocks of code as well you know you're
also might be familiar with that this is
very similar so static block is just a
block of code but by default you know if
you create a static block
not going to show up anywhere okay so
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a static block and then using
widgets we're going to tell it where to
show up
okay so let's create a static block I'm
going to add a new block it's up here in
the top right and I'm going to just call
this test block and you know the
identifier will just keep this as test
and then we want this available for all
store views and it's going to be enabled
and all I'd really want is just some
code to make sure this were so test
whatever you can use the WYSIWYG editor
here to have this looking like how you
want adding images or whatever so let's
click Save block okay so now our blocks
here but it's not going to show up
anywhere we can go all over the site and
you'll never see it so what we need to
do now is create a widget let's go to
widgets here it's under CMS and we're
going to click add new widget instance
and this is going to be the type so if
you'll notice here there's CMS page link
so it's going to be a link to anything
seem a static block which of course is
what we just made and what we're going
to want but you can also have category
list new product list any of these
options that are built in here orders
and returns whatever but we want to show
our static block so what a widget is is
it's really just a chunk of code and
you're saying where to display it on the
website through this widgets instance so
the design package theme this is
important you want to make sure this is
the theme that you're using for your
site if you select the wrong one it will
not show up we're using default default
so I'm going to pick that number click
continue okay the instance title and
this is just be test because it's just a
test right now the sort order is how you
know high up it's going to display if
the you know the sort of other widget
instances in the same block so if you
have a bunch of widgets in the same
block this owner is going to matter in
which order they're showing up so now
down here we need to add a layout update
this is actually where you're telling
the static block to show up so I'm going
to click add layout update and we're
going to display this on let's go to a
specified page if you notice you can see
our product types Inc your categories in
this stuff but we're going to do
specified page and we want this to show
up
on so look at all these options you have
here you can you know do all sorts of
stuff but we want this to show up on all
CMS pages so any pages created like a
CMS like yeah the you know the home page
or the customer service page any of
those where the block reference is going
to be the actual position let's put this
in the left column you'll notice here
there's main content navigation bar or
page footer or any of that stuff but we
just want this in the left column and
then under widget options here on the
left is where you actually select which
block is up until now we haven't told it
which block we want to use so let's
click select Bok block and if you notice
we can even put these footer links
anywhere but let's click test block
that's the one we want and let's save
this oh it looks like I didn't click all
store views okay so let's save this and
okay so widget instance has been saved
although you may be getting this warning
up here it says one or more tight cache
types are invalidated so basically your
cache site is now different than what
the content that you're showing is so we
want to clear this cache so that we see
what we expect to see you can just click
on this cache management it's going to
take you to this page right here and
we're going to click flush Magento cache
if you let me refresh this so it can be
more like what you're seeing now you'll
see it says invalidated block HTML
because we changed a block
general general cache layout so let's
flush these just this red button here
okay so Magento caches everything should
say enabled and let's go to the customer
service page okay we go here and you
look down here in the left column it
says test test test test test okay
so this is our static block right here
if you were to put any sort of HTML or
in the image or whatever it would show
up here as well notice how you have
great control over that you can put that
wherever you want we could put it in the
main you could put it anywhere that's
great let's go to our home page because
it's supposed to be in the left column
there too okay you might notice that
it's not here this is actually because
this page is using a custom XML layout
if we were go to go
to go here under CMS pages and we go to
the home page when you click design
you'll notice that it's using a two
column with a right bar which is not
really what we see this been a chunk of
code here is actually adding this custom
left bar if you were to go through and
delete this stuff you would see all
sorts of changes but let's go to three
columns and let's get rid of this
actually let me copy this okay
now let's save this page and now let's
refresh our home page and we should be
seeing something a little different
sure enough there is our test test test
test code of course this is all sort of
messed up because it was using some sort
of like special code before and now it's
not so you're going to want to be
adjusting your your your content and
your your CSS to sort of you know figure
out what's going on here but this is why
this would've shown up if your pages are
using a custom layout type it may not
show up because the custom layout type
was not including a left column okay so
that is how you create a static block
and how you get it to show using a
widget if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment in the
video it is up at Twitter at LevelUp
tuts let us know what you think and let
us know what you want to see pretty much
anything we love getting comments so
thanks for watching once again this is
