up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna do a couple of things we're gonna
create a contact component and we're
going to turn our object into an array
of objects and then we're going to
iterate over that array and we're gonna
output each of that data into our
individual contact so this is going on
there right now okay so the last video
is nice and easy but in this one we're
going to be getting into a little bit
more here where we're actually going to
be iterating over an array so let's go
ahead and actually make this into an
array first by adding the correct
bracket here and now let's go ahead and
add some more values into this array so
I'm gonna copy this object have a comma
and I'm gonna have Courtney here and
she's going to have a different phone
number but very fake as well and let's
add another one we can add Tim and let's
have one more for good measure we can
add Jeff and again once again totally
fake obviously different number so we
can have them tell them apart so as you
can see we now have this array of
contacts so now that we have this array
what you're first going to notice is
that our application is going to be
completely broken we're not going to
have any contacts here and that's
because this is obviously looking for a
single contact and object it's not going
to find any sort of name property on an
array of objects so what we're gonna
need to do now is iterate over this list
but before we do that let's actually
create a new individual contact and now
what I'm going to do is I'm actually
just gonna copy this entire contacts
list component and I'm going to create a
new file that is just going to be
contact dot Jas so this is just contact
and I'm going to paste this in here
we're still gonna be importing react
from react but contacts list is now
going to be
contact and the export contacts list is
just going to be contact now in addition
I'm going to get rid of this unordered
list and I'm going to get rid of that
starting unordered list as well now I
can make this a little bit prettier you
could say okay so we now have we're
importing react from react we have class
contact extends rect components and
basically we're going to be outputting
this props contacts that name now this
whole sections gonna be not totally
right if you think about it we have an
individual contact we're not going to be
wanting our props to be named this
particular problem we don't want this to
be named contacts because it implies
that there's more than one so let's get
rid of that s there and say this the
props dot contact that name and this dot
props that contact dot phone so this is
nice now because what we're essentially
saying here is that this component all
it contains is a list item with this
type props a contact name okay cool so
we have an individual component here and
now what we need to do is pass in that
information into this component and we
need to do so for every single item in
our array let's hit to contacts list
now if you'll remember from previous
videos to use a component now with this
import syntax let's head back to a pious
you notice we had to import contacts
list from contacts list let's copy this
line and head to contacts list J s
because we're gonna be wanting to use
our new contact component we need to do
something very similar and since this
isn't the exact same folder we can just
use the same pattern that say import
contact from the same folder so we're
now going to be importing our contact
component from the same folder in the
contact file so this is all great now
what we don't need is we don't need this
entire line right here because we have
that now listed actually in our contact
jas but we can't simply just say contact
like so and expect to have this working
especially if we do something like
contact is equal to and then a value
here because we have an array of objects
and actually if we get rid of that
contact equals you'll see oh we get some
errors it says cannot read property name
of undefined
obviously it's looking for inside of
here it's looking for name but there's
no such thing as the stop props dot
contact so obviously it's not going to
have anything there so let's get around
this if you remember we still have
available to us in this contact list
with available to us we have this dot
prop stock contacts and what we can do
is we can map over that so inside of our
unordered list here let's have some
curly brackets now let's type this dot
props dot contacts with an S dot and now
we're going to use the map method here
and what we're going to do is we're
actually going to have a function here
what we can do is actually use an arrow
function so we can just say parentheses
like so and we can say contact now what
this map does is essentially goes
through each of this objects in the
array here and will make each individual
array item available to us as contact
now we can have equals and then the
greater than sign for our arrow function
now this is where it gets kind of fun
we're gonna have a set of curly brackets
here like so and inside of here we need
to return now for this return statement
I'm going to put in our contact so we're
gonna drop in our contact component and
we're going to set the prop value of
contact is going to be equal to and you
might guess it it's going to be this
contact right here
so not to confuse this one with this one
this contact right here is going to be
referred to inside of contact component
as this dot props contact so the
individual contact data is going to be
equal to then we have the curly brackets
and it's actually passed in this data
right here which is going to be the
individual item from this array right
here so this is why this is fun here
because now what we have is we have a so
many open and curly brackets it might
get sort of confusing but we have to
close it off curly and then parentheses
and then curly bracket so there's the
sort of a weird pattern here but as you
can see we're passing in each individual
contact into our contact component now
if we save this let's let the site
rebuild itself you can see it's
interesting here we now have all of our
contact information output exactly as we
wanted it to be now we are getting a
warning saying that we need a unique key
now this is something that react uses to
identify individual items here so what
we want to do is head to app dot j s and
let's add an ID to each of these now
this ID is going to be a unique ID
however since there's just these four
items I'm simply just going to count up
to four here as soon as you can see they
now all have a property of ID and in our
contacts list we're going to head to our
contact component and in here we can say
key and key is going to be equal to
contact dot I D so the key is going to
be referencing each individual contacts
ID which is essentially just one through
four here now you'll see we refresh we
don't get any sort of warnings and if
you inspect any of these let's go and
inspect Tim right here you can even see
that ID being used with this dollar sign
and
we have no errors so as you can see we
now have three components we're passing
that data and all three of them and
we're mapping over an array to get all
this content output I'm gonna put that
code up on the screen once again four
contacts list is this this part can get
a little bit tricky if you mess
something up so make sure yours looks
just like this and it'll work just fine
so as always this is Scot with level up
