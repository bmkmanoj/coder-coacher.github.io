up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you how you can get get labs
EE going with a digital ocean droplet in
no time at all and then we're going to
log in you're gonna get a little bit of
what get lab is like right off the bat
so let's get started now okay so in
honor of github going down today I know
that a lot of people are having some
issues with their repos and I was just
thinking how fortunate I was to have my
own get lab community Edition set up on
its own private server so I figured I
would take a video to show you the
easiest fastest way to have your own
gitlab Community Edition set up on a
digitalocean droplet now this isn't
going to necessarily be the most
economic version of having a private
gitlab for instance we're gonna have to
pay $10 a month for our droplet but to
be totally honest I would rather pay a
host just for the server space that I
can actually use for other things as
well than to just pay github would get
lab or bitbucket to store my code there
so now you might be wondering what get
lab is well get lab is an open source
version control management system here
like github bitbucket or even get labs
own hosted versions it allows you to do
things like issue queuing you can have
groups and private accounts it's a whole
big old system now the reason why I
really like having my own private gitlab
is that I can create as many user
accounts as I want for anybody who wants
to work on my sites as well as have
private groups set up my own permissions
set up my own issue tracking and have to
be completely customizable to my needs
and it can grow in team members without
expecting a cost bump later on by having
to jump to another plan or another tier
so let's go ahead and head to digital
ocean comm where I'm going to log in and
this is like I said going to be the path
of least resistance to getting your own
private and get lab going okay so I have
some of the stuff blurred out so you
can't see all of my droplets but what
we're going to do here is we're going to
click on it create droplet and from
create droplet
we're going to leave boon to selected we
actually want to change the size so
we're going to select the $10 a month
one gigabyte size now you could select
this $5 one however you won't be able to
use this one click install which is
really the easiest least resistance way
to get gitlab up and running so $10 a
month gives you a one gigabyte CPU a 32
gigabyte worth of disk space and 2
terabytes of transfer speed honestly it
depends on how much you have going on
this if this is a giant project you can
always scale your server up as you need
it but for me this is just my own stuff
so $10 a month is perfect however what
we want to do now is scroll up and we
have one-click apps now one-click apps
is a way to get going quickly with a new
droplet and you'll notice that we have
get lab eight point six point zero on
Ubuntu 14.04 which is exactly what we
want so let's click get lab here now you
can see the size is still selected the
data center region I can stay with New
York 3 and I'm going to make sure I
select backups it adds 20 percent to the
droplet cost but if it's your get
information obviously having a backup
for it would be really nice now I don't
actually have an SSH key so I'm going to
not use an SSH key here and I'm going to
leave this as like so and I'll just
leave the strop Linnane however you can
choose your own hostname or droplet name
if you'd like now upon clicking create
we're actually going to have our droplet
being created for us you can see we have
this droplet spinning up and once it's
done we're going to get an email with
credentials that we can use to log in
now at this point you can see we have a
new IP address keep in mind I'm going to
be completely deleting this droplet
after this video so don't you know try
to use any of these logins now let's go
ahead and copy this IP address here and
head to our terminal ok so from our
command line we can type ssh route at
and then we're going to want to paste in
our IP address and this is going to be
the one that it just created for a
second hit enter now we should have got
an email that had our root password in
it and so what you're going to do is
paste in that root password here and
then it's going to ask you once again
for that password as well as a new
password to change it with so the
current password is the one you just
entered and then the new password here
and enter it again and as you can see
I'm now SSH to into a new droplet now
let's go ahead and set this up with a
domain I'm going to head to digital
ocean that networking and I'm going to
post a new domain and it's going to be
and it's just going to be lab that level
up tuts comm ok so just a little sub
domain of level up Hut's here I'm going
to point it to my new IP and let's click
create record this is going to make it
so we have our DNS pointing to the right
IP for this domain and that's really all
we should have to do on digitalocean
site now that we have this up and
running so let's head back to our
command line and you'll notice we have
here our root username and password
right here so this is actually forget
lab these are our get lab credentials
like it says you can head to the IP
address itself and you should be able to
log in with these credentials so as you
can see here I don't even need a domain
if you just want to keep this as a
straight IP then go right ahead
now what we can do is say root and then
this crazy password that is generated
for you so let's sign in using root as
well as this new password that is
generated and let's click sign in and as
you can see I'm now in my brand-new
gitlab now this is really super cool but
we're not done yet because I want this
to be at lab dot level up Tut's calm so
let's go ahead and make that happen we
can head back to our command line now
I'm going to open up in vim a ruby file
it's going to be them and then we could
say /e TC forward slash gitlab forward
slash get lab dot RB
this is a file that should exist and
you'll notice we have some things
commented out you can hit I to get
insert mode external URL we can delete
actually I'm going to leave this HTTP
part and just retype the lab that level
of Tut's comm okay so this is our new
external URL you can see we can now set
things like the emails where they're
coming from the support we can also
enable SMTP we can redirect to HTTP - I
don't actually have an SSL certificate
going here so I don't need to mess with
these certificate settings but this is
something you're really serious about
this is where you're going to be sending
your SSL settings so now to save and
quit this file we can hit escape and
then we can do :
write quit so WQ hit enter and now we
can just run a single command which is
get lab forward slash - CTL and then
reconfigure
you
now basically this is just going to go
through and make sure
is good you can see it's restarting our
services and we now have get lab
reconfigured if we head back you can see
that we can still access get lab and
we're still actually signed in through
this IP address let's head to lab dot
level up tuts comm and as you can see
it's taken me to the same get lab we can
once again type into route and paste in
our password here let's make sure I have
it in my clipboard still looks like I do
we can save this and now from here we
have get lab fully setup you could
always come into your profile settings
and we could change some information
about our profile we could come into
account and update our username but just
from that video alone we have gitlab up
and running you can create a new project
like that and give it a name and then it
will give you a let's just say test here
we can click create project and just
like that we have our get address that
we can actually push to you'll notice
that we won't actually be able to push
or pull until we add an SSH key but
that's the same way with github or
bitbucket or any of these so that's
something you should be used to I'll go
over that in the next video so as you
can see here git lab up and running we
now have our own private get system here
where we can manage all of our
repositories manage our issue queues
manager groups have a bunch of people
working on it set milestones manage pull
requests just all sorts of really cool
stuff I really love get lab so far and
I'm really liking having my own private
git repository like I said there going
to be other cheaper options for just
simply having a private repo however get
lab offers a ton of flexibility and if
you have it all in your own controlled
system then you can do whatever you want
with it and I personally really like
that so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment on
the video or hit me up at twitter or
facebook at level up tutorials I'd love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
