of touch and today I'm going to show you
how to modify the slideshow module now
on the homepage of your website you'll
notice there's a slideshow and the
images that come with the theme and the
slider aren't gonna be appropriate for
your store so we're going to show you
how to completely change the content
within that slideshow so let's get into
it now
so you have your store going and it
everything's going well we're adding
products but you have this main feature
here and then if these images quite
represent your store right I mean it's
lorem ipsum text for one they're sort of
nonsense headings they all link to the
PrestaShop com basically you want to
customize this slideshow and the content
within it now how can we do that so to
get here we need to go into modules like
we were before and we need to find the
slideshow module so we can use these
search functionality here and we can
just type in slide and you'll notice
that we have one here that seems like
it's a likely candidate the image slider
for your homepage
says right there in the title you pretty
much can mistake it so let's go ahead
and click configure now from here you
can set up things like the minimum image
with the speed in which the transition
happens between the two slides you can
even choose how long the slides stay
there in milliseconds and you can choose
whether it's autoplay or not now if we
scroll down you can see we have options
for these slides and we have an image
and and next them here you can click and
drag and reorder so you can set up
different ones to be the first second or
third you can also enable or disable
particular slides so how do we change
these well there's an edit button right
here we're just gonna go ahead and click
that now we have our image we can choose
to upload a new image here now I have a
image saved on my desktop I'm gonna use
so I'm going to choose file and this is
just an image of a fence you can give
this a slide title so we're just gonna
say this is a fence image it's not
really anything in particular but let's
actually link this to one of our product
pages so let's come to this store and
under men t-shirts I believe we had this
sticker here so let's copy this link and
we're gonna paste this in here under
target URL now if you wanted this to be
a relative URL you could also do it like
this just or you can leave it as the
full path and here we have in the
description box the text that's going to
be on top of our image what's nice about
this is it gives you access to the
WYSIWYG editor so you can not only
change the text but you can modify these
this button style or this paragraph
style you can make things bold or just
change it generally how you want now
let's go ahead and save this slide these
save buttons at the bottom right here
and let's check it out on the front page
of our store here it is we have this
image here and as you can see the image
has white text over the top of it so
with these images they're using darker
patterns with the white text and this is
something you could change with your CSS
however for right now you might just
want to pick darker images if you know
that your images are going to be of us
of a certain background now you also
want to notice that the slideshow adapts
to the height of the largest image since
this image is taller than these other
images you're gonna get something weird
here where you have a different height
discrepancy so if you want your
slideshow to look nice you're gonna want
to make sure that you crop all of these
images to be the same size but other
than that we now have the ability to
completely modify this slideshow we can
change the text on top of it we can
change all the functions and when you
click it it's going to take you
somewhere and we change that as well so
you now know how to completely manage
the slideshow item on the home page of
your PrestaShop store as always this is
Scott with a lot of Tut's if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment in the video or hit us up at
Twitter or Facebook at level up Tut's we
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
