tutorials and i'm super excited to
announce that this is my 700 video now
it's hard to imagine in 2012 that i
would have gotten to 700 videos so soon
although it's obvious now that the next
hundred videos will be coming sooner and
more frequently than the last hundred
videos did because already in September
I've been able to put out more videos
this month then the entirety of any
other month this year and that number is
only going to keep going up I hope to
beat that number consecutively every
single month until I'm just putting out
the maximum amount of quality videos
that I can in one month so a huge
announcement for my 700 video is the
opening of the level up store so store
level up tutorials com will be a link in
this video description or you can find
it in the annotation right here is now
online now this is a custom-made store
by me using meteor and react and a bunch
of cool technologies and I'm going to
dive into the code a little bit
eventually in the future so you can
check out exactly what's going on in
this site but it's pretty super cool in
the back end and there's lots to check
out right now the only products that are
available on the level of tutorial store
are two t-shirts and 1 10 pack of
stickers now the t-shirts come in two
different varieties so we have the sort
of standard cut very soft black shirt
here it's actually sort of a pretty dark
gray with the level up logo and then
there's a purple shirt which you can see
on the site that is a deep v-neck and
it's a ladies cut T so we have both of
those t-shirts now available hun stored
out level up tutorials com and if you
want to enter for an opportunity to win
a free t-shirt I'm actually running a
survey right now where you can find the
link in the description of this video
you can fill out that survey I'm going
to be randomly selecting a user from
that survey to get a free t-shirt sent
to them so check out the new level up
tutorials store and check out the shirts
and see if there's anything you're
interested there and since this was a
totally custom site it's going to only
be getting better over time
there's going to be a lot of really cool
features being at it and some nice
little design things here and there so
check out frequently as new products and
new ways to support level up tutorials
stop by the level up tutorial store also
in the next month or so I'm going to be
continuing some series I'm going to be
finishing up some series and I'm gonna
be starting some new ones most of which
I've already talked about in previous
level updates however we're actually
going to be starting that SEO series
we're going to be starting the web
performance series and how to make your
websites a lot faster and how you can
troubleshoot through that and find new
ways to help yourself with that we're
going to be continuing the polymer and
angular series we're going to be
wrapping up the post CSS series we're
going to be continuing the how to build
your first website series and I'm
actually going to be starting the
intermediate media series this month and
by this month I mean from right now to
this point in October but I have the
plans for it I'm going to be unveiling
what we're going to be making very soon
and you'll actually get to see it ahead
of time you know we're going to making
this that way you can have something to
look forward to and sort of know what
will be working through and this
intermediate meteor series is going to
go over everything you need to know
about beeler packages that are being
used about routing about performance SEO
any sort of questions that you might
have about intermediate meteor features
now like I said the level up store is
actually built on meteor and react now
there also will be a react series coming
in the future as well as a meteor and
react sort of hybrid series because to
be honest that's sort of my dream stack
right now pretty much any project I've
been starting is been meteor and react
and I've been really super excited with
it so I can assure you that there will
be some sort of meteor and react series
as well I don't really know a ton of the
specifics just yet I'm sort of working
that out also you may or may not have
noticed that the video position location
in these intros keep changing a little
bit i'm actually working out sort of the
best sort of setup in my new workspace
my new office here so you might even see
it change in a few more times over time
i'm working things out and finding
what's the really the best configuration
also you may have noticed in the
creasing the audio quality i have a new
microphone my last one was doing great
but due to an unfortunate accident it
met its untimely end so i hope you
noticed an increased audio quality over
the past few videos maybe like that past
five or six videos but it's only going
to keep getting better because as i know
the space more as i know this microphone
more i'm going to be able to increase
the quality of the production every
single video every single time I'm doing
these recordings so that's really the
goal let me know if there's any
suggestions that you have to boost up
the the quality or things that you want
to see in these videos just to make them
better and better as much as possible
cool so as always there's going to be
way more exciting stuff to announce next
month I'm trying to keep these
announcements exciting and have some new
stuff every single time so I have some
things in the works now some really
exciting things that I'm not quite ready
to reveal yet I know I keep saying that
I feel like every single time there's
just more things so keep your eyes open
check out the level up store if you want
to help support pick up a t-shirt I'd
really appreciate it so as always this
is scott with level up tutorials thanks
for watching and I'll see in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
