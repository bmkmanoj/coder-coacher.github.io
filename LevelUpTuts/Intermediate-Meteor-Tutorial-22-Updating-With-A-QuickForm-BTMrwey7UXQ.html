up tutorials and in this intermediate
Meteor tutorial we're going to be adding
our edit form using quick form so we're
going to take what we learned before
with quick form however this time
instead of an insert form it's going to
be an update and you're gonna learn how
to attach a particular item to that
update form so that when we update it
everything works as expected so let's
get going on that right now okay so in
the last video we determined that we
need some extra features here we need
the ability to edit these and we need
the ability to delete one for instance
this ie tuna does not have ingredients
and therefore when we add it to our menu
there are no ingredients being added to
our shopping list so we would ideally
want to head back in here and modify
this however we don't have any sort of
way of doing that at the moment so since
we're using auto form this can get
really easy so let's head to our text
editor here and we want to go to the
individual recipe page on the recipe
page we have our article here including
our recipe and we have all of our stuff
however we want to go ahead and have an
update form here that we can toggle on
and off okay so now we actually want to
use a quick form again so we can just
have this form completely generated for
us now and you can even have a auto form
that's not using this quick form helper
where you can define the each of the
inputs and things like that but for this
particular example we don't need to
really do that if you need to see the
documentation on that it's available in
meteor - auto form on the github page
but for this instance just like we've
been doing we're going to use the double
brackets and then greater than sign for
the quick form helper and we can say the
collection just like we had before is
going to be equal to recipes so we can
do that as just capital our recipes like
so and then we need an ID which we can
just give this an ID of update recipe
and we need to give this a type the type
is going to be equal to update if you
remember before we had insert this is
going to be an update form
so that Otto forum knows how to handle
this correctly and lastly we need a doc
now the doc refers to what data you're
passing into this forum since we're
looping over in this article this
article includes name description name
amount basically we're looping over a
recipe we have access to this and this
is going to refer to this particular
recipe okay so all should be good right
well if we go to our page we're going to
notice a small problem once our forms is
generated you'll notice that we have
fish tacos as being the filled in values
for every single one and if you had
quick eyes you may have seen where the
issue was now if we come here you'll
notice we defined an ID now IDs should
always be unique in this particular case
all of these forms are getting the same
ID therefore the data is getting
overridden every single time and until
the last one has been written so what we
want to do is we actually want to make
this a helper so we can say update
recipe ID and now this is just a
variable because there's no quotes here
but we have no helpers for this function
yet so let's come to recipe J s and
let's go ahead and I'm just gonna grab
this template recipe helpers from here
paste it in and we can change get rid of
the s here so we know if template recipe
helper we want the helper to be like we
had here update recipe ID so that's
going to be the helper here now what we
really need to do is simply just return
some sort of a value here and we need to
make this sort of unique you could do
this any type of way but an easy way to
make this unique is to actually use the
individual recipes ID now before we use
this arrow function which is going to
mess up the behavior of this so we need
to actually have a normal function here
and then we want to reach
learn what we can then return is this
dot underscore ID this is going to
return the current recipes ID because
this is being called from within this
loop it's going to say this this refers
to this current recipe and then it's
going to grab the ID and it's going to
set the ID to the forms idea itself
because of that we now have unique form
IDs and if we head back to our page you
will see that we have
ahi tuna where we have the description
everything correct salad salad grilled
cheese awesome so let's go ahead and fix
this for the ahi tuna we'll want some
tuna one pound again and we're going to
need like some sesame seeds one
container totally scientific okay and so
now you'll see we have this form here
and we click Submit instantly our
ingredients have been added if we add
this to the menu we now have sesame
seeds one container and tuna one pound
cool so we now have an update form
totally working within our component
here it works really well we're able to
generate unique IDs through a helper and
we're able to do this all automatically
with quick form and it was really super
painless and if we wanted to come to any
of these other ones let's say grilled
cheese actually we needed butter for
grilled cheese so let's add a new we can
just have like one container if we're
using like spread butters and I'm not
going to get too crazy with this okay
but as you can see it updated no problem
and it's out of two slices now we want
one loaf okay so you'll notice each time
we're hitting this submit button it's
adding the new items but what if there
was an easier way where we didn't
necessarily have to come down here and
click Submit all the time in fact maybe
we want to just open this update form
and when we're done we just want to
close it right maybe we don't want to
submit a form we just want to say I'm
done editing okay so what's a good way
we can do that well we can actually add
a nice property onto this auto form to
have it autosave no we can actually come
here and do is we can say in our quick
form here we can say auto save is equal
to true okay so now that all this saves
equal to true once we get a refresh here
let's actually come here we have fish
tacos let's go and just change this to
fish taco you'll notice nothing gets
updated yet but when I hit the enter key
it does now again look in the
description I'm gonna change this to
fish taco once more and it's updating
when I'm hitting the tab key again we
can actually come in here and we can say
watch mangoes right here while I type
mangoes so there's no s I click off the
field it updates so autosave is going to
autosave once this field loses focus
right so once any of these fields lose
focus it's going to autosave okay so now
we now have an update formats working
its auto saving really super cool in the
next video we're actually going to
tackle just adding a nice little delete
here and what we're going to do is add a
toggle for this editing so we don't have
this edit form here all the time getting
in the way making these recipes gigantic
