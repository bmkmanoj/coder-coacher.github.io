up tutorials in this video is going to
focus on the interface of atom and some
nice little tips and tricks so let's get
going on that right now so to show off a
little bit of the interface here I
figured I would just drag a couple of
these files in to our atom editor and
what you're going to see is that if you
drag a couple of files in it actually
decides that you want the entire folder
that those files are maintained it and
that's actually kind of a great thing
because you don't have to drag in the
folder itself you can say maybe I want
this file and maybe later you want to
edit other files and your they all are
waiting for you now you'll notice when
you click a file in the Left bar it
immediately opens so it immediately
creates a new tab for it here now we can
close these on Mac with command W and
windows on ctrl W so we have these files
you'll notice when you select them the
current one you get a little hover when
you hover over the name you get a path
to where the file is saved which is nice
if you have a couple of files with a
similar title you can see exactly which
one you're loading up now in addition we
can drag these tabs around to be in any
particular order that we would like them
to be now one cool thing here is if we
want to create a new file you could
always right click on your folder and
say new file however if you just want a
new file in the root of the directory or
maybe you want to be able to just save
it wherever you'd like in this project
what you can do is double click in this
blank space you now have an untitled new
file when we go to save it here's the
interface that allows you to say hey I
want this to be and maybe the client
folder or something like that so that's
a nice way to quickly and easily create
a new file you can just double click
over here now in addition we can
actually have multiple panes up at once
so we can come here to view and let's go
ahead and select panes now we can say
either split up split down split left or
split right
if we split right
that intermediate Jas is now opened over
here on the right in addition we can
make this as big or as small as we want
it to if you don't want this side by
here all the time you can simply just
toggle the tree view
or the easy way which is command back
slash
if you're on Windows that should be
controlled backslash so as you can see
you can quickly and easily hide your
project tree if you don't need your
files so we now have a couple of paints
here let's actually split this once more
we can save you pains split down and you
can see once again we have a new pane
and you can drag any of these tabs into
any of these panes and you can really
configure this in any sort of particular
way like you would want and split these
panes as it works for you
okay so what's another easy way that we
can traverse our files now if we do
command T which is something that you
probably are very familiar with if you
have used sublime text here we have all
of the files in our project we can say
styles enter and you can see it opens
the Styles file again if we hear it hit
command T we can enter settings file
index you can really find anything here
that's in your project simply by doing
command or ctrl T based on what
operating system you're on this is one
of the handiest ways you can get around
your files using something like atom
that way your hands never have to leave
the keyboard you have to go grab your
mouse and click on the file command T
settings JSON boom you're in it
brilliant so this is the atom interface
throughout the course this series I'll
be giving a little additional tips on
interface tips and tricks here things
that you can do like the command T to
make your experience a little bit better
