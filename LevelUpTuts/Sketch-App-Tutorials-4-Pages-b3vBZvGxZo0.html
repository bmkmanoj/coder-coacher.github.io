up tuts and today we're going to be
talking about pages in sketch three in
the last video we talked about artboards
as a way of separating your canvas into
several different working environments
here so we now have these four artboards
right but let's say we wanted to
separate it even further but we wanted
to maintain things within the same
project now what we could do is of
course you could just keep creating more
artboards and this will become more
cluttered with various artboards and
canvases and that's alright
however sketch allows us to have another
form of organizational structure to our
projects by having completely separate
canvases called pages so if we come to
the top left you'll see that we hover
over page and we can click this where it
says page 1 and you'll notice we have a
box that shows us a picture of page 1
but just underneath that is a plus if we
click that plus it creates us a new
canvas entirely with completely new
layers and everything if we want to jump
back to page 1 we can always just click
back to page 1 so now that we have a new
page we can get started creating our own
artboards just like that and then we can
go ahead and let's say create a shape
here let's just do something to add to
this artboard let's just have a rounded
rectangle cool so now if we click
export' you'll notice that we don't just
have the options from this particular
page in fact we don't even have this
artboard yet I'll get into that a second
but we have the options from the entire
document so you can have all of your
things and separate pages if that's how
you prefer to do it and maybe even have
one artboard per page if if for some
reason you'd like to do it like that it
just depends on how you'd like to
structure your document right so we can
even export things from our other
pages inside of any of the pages right
so it doesn't it doesn't matter because
they're all contained in this document
so as long as we have our slices created
our our artboards can be exported no
matter what so if we click on this our
board one thing you'll notice is down
here in the bottom corner there is a
make exportable button we need to click
that and now we are allowed to export
this so if we do
once again export you can do command
shift E and that's going to bring this
open you'll notice that not only do we
have access to the first page but we
also have the second page now the reason
why we had this collision is because our
board 1 and artboard 1 on page 2 have
the same name now it doesn't like that
because it's going to be using that name
to create an image so we can click
cancel and right here on this our board
let's go ahead and rename it so we can
just say this is demo2
so what's great about these artboards is
not only are they used for
organizational visually and exporting
wise but also the way you name them is
going to be able to basically work like
layer groups in photoshop and you're
going to want to rename your artboards
so that they make sense
because of course if anybody's ever
getting into your sketch file and using
it other than yourself the last thing
they want to see is a bunch of unnamed
artboards and all just things everywhere
just having a nice and organized project
is the best way for everybody to be on
the same page now you also notice that
the name is right here in the top left
of the artboard so that's also great too
when you're showing your work to
somebody else you can easily explain
what everything is because everything is
going to be nice and labeled for you so
we created a page but what other tools
can we use with pages well if you right
click here you can right click on a page
and you can rename a page from page one
page two to whatever you'd like or you
can duplicate a page crew completely
duplicating it or you can go ahead and
delete a page now duplicating a page
might be useful if you had created a
version of a project and let's say you
wanted to take that idea and go in a
completely new direction and not have to
worry about messing things up bided by
duplicating the entire page you have all
of your assets from the previous page
that you can then modify to this new
direction you're taking so pages are
great for that and they just keep things
really clean so use pages use artboards
organize your sketch and you will be
very happy so as always this is Scott
with LevelUp tuts let us know if you
have any questions or comments we'd love
to hear questions or comments about
sketch or pretty much anything also it
should be noted that I create these
videos in my nights and weekends if you
would like to support LevelUp tuts and
our quest for free tutorials on the
internet you can sign up for level up
pro for $8.99 a month and that's just
really going to the the money is just
really going to help us be able to
produce more videos for a longer period
of time and it gives you some extra
features in the process so you can check
that out and see what sort of features
come by with that and you know just sign
up for a month for a year sign up for
whatever or don't sign up at all it's
all right because the tutorials are
going to be free no matter what but we
could always use the help and support so
as always thanks for watching and I'll
