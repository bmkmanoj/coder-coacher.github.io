today we're gonna be talking about toast
messages and a toast message is really
just
simple notification pop-up message and
it's only gonna display for a certain
amount of time and then fades away so
test messages can be used as maybe just
a really simple sort of you know test to
make sure something's working or that
you could just find all sorts of
situations in which they'd be useful and
you want to check out something so let's
say we want to you know this button
isn't giving us it's not doing anything
when we press it and we want to make
sure that the button is even you know
registering a press so one thing we can
do is down here in our unclick method we
can first thing we can add a toast dot
make text and we're gonna let this
autocomplete here so the context is
going to be get application context okay
and this is going to get the
applications context and use that and
then text in here is going to be the
text we want in our hire button so we're
just gonna say it works or maybe we'll
say button click works just to be a
little bit more description on it this
duration could be longer short so we
want this to be toast dot length and
then let it fill in the rest for us link
long just so we have it display long for
us and then after this parenthesis here
we're just going to say dot show
parentheses and then semicolon to finish
it off so this is going to run the make
text method of toast and it's going to
do that and display this button click
works once this button has been clicked
so let's run up our application here and
we can see that in action okay so here's
our app now when I click this press me
we should see this button click works
and this is just a notification it just
comes up for a brief period of time and
then leaves us click
again you know every time we click it's
going to tell us that this button click
worked and so you can even use these to
let your users know you know maybe
something happen
I wouldn't overdo it with them maybe
you'll see them occasionally Android if
you're a user of Android but it's nice
to know that you can output something on
the screen you're testing and then
future lessons we're gonna go over other
debugging tools like you know log
notifications and stuff like that so
that's nothing crazy but keep in mind
you can also put in your variables as
long as their strings into this string
spot right here and it's going to output
them in your toast message so feel free
to use those and let me know of all the
creative ways that you're using your
toast messages but you'll just notice
that you're using them all the time so
check it out
this is a toast and as always if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video or hit us up in the
comments we could try to get to them as
much as we can and as always thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
