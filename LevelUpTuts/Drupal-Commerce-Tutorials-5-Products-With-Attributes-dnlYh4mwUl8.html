up Hudson in the last video we showed
you the inline entity to be able to add
products really easily to our product
display so this is great but how many
websites do you go to that just have a
select list with two options and the
price and you know just the product name
well not too many right so we need to
add a little bit more to make our
products seem more like a store so
typically products have images and since
these are two separate products we're
gonna have two separate images that
change just like the price and we're
gonna have a description that changes as
well describing the individual price or
the individual products and then we're
going to have a global description
that's on the product display itself so
let's concert' it by adding some fields
to our product so we're going to go to
store and then products and we're going
to go to product types and we're gonna
click manage fields on our product
product type keep in mind that if you
were building this store out you'd
probably want to have this be something
different right like a product type is
something maybe like a t-shirt or a
computer or something that's going to
have these fields since we're using the
default product that came that you know
that came a basic product type just to
show it's called product for now but the
product type is where you actually have
your product types similar to in Magento
when you have attributes sets and
attributes set is essentially a product
type if you're not familiar with Magento
just think about product categories that
have unique options for them so we can
click manage fields and we're gonna add
a field that is
and this is going to be description it's
just going to be a text area so a long
text and we're gonna tuck this up above
the title here and let's click Save save
this field okay I don't need to any
descriptions and let's add an image
field and that we're going to add an
existing field that is field image and
we're just gonna call it image if you
don't have an existing image field to
add a new one and have the field type be
image I'm gonna slide that up here just
to make the order seem a little bit
better and I don't need to modify
anything here but if you're familiar
with Drupal then that should all look
from you know normal if you're not
familiar with Drupal go back and watch
some of our Drupal 7 videos they explain
a lot just about the general
philosophies around Drupal and that's
actually the best part about Drupal
commerce is if you know Drupal really
well you can get it to do pretty much
anything you want and and it's it does
the hard stuff for you while giving you
the possibility to you know totally
customize it so okay so now that we have
these things let's add these options to
our products now we can actually do this
from our product display because if you
remember we have this inline entity
field so we can click Edit and now if we
scroll down you will see if we click
Edit on any of these products we can now
add the description and the image
directly from our product display it is
so incredibly handy in such a nice way
of making and editing products that way
you don't have to go make a product and
then go make a product display and link
them up you can just do it all from one
window so we can just say I should grab
some some lorem ipsum text or something
just to dump in here okay I grabbed a
very short paragraph here and I'm gonna
choose an image I have something
probably on my desktop that I stole from
Google Images and since this is going to
be our level of t-shirt I just have this
white t-shirt that I got from who knows
where and I'm going to update the
product now I'm going to edit this
long T and I'm going to give it another
description but I'm gonna make the
description obviously different so that
we can tell that it's been edited and
I'm gonna choose the long-sleeved
t-shirt image that I have also gotten
from Google Images and let's click
update product cool so we now have our
product with our fields and you'll
notice this inline it to even add the
image here but not the long text
description and how cool is that we
didn't have to do anything to tell it to
do that okay let's click Save okay so we
now have our product display here's a
big ol image and we click that and it
changes to this other t-shirt just like
that
okay so let's come into our product
display and modify the display styles
for some of this stuff so we can come to
structure and then content types
find our product display and click
manage display now from here we can drag
things around we would obviously want
the description to come underneath the
product and to give it any more
formatting other than that we have to
modify the settings under product type
manage display that's fine and now we
also have this body text with a hidden
label and this is going to be our global
description so actually I'm going to put
this above the product description so
our global description then our
individual product description then the
price and and then the Add to Cart
buttons actually I'm gonna put the image
at the very top and again we just have
the option of visible or hidden and it's
asking us to modify these in the manage
display for the product type so let's go
ahead and save that now that we have
them in the right order let's come back
to store then products and then product
types up here in the top right and now
for our product type we can click manage
display and now we have more options
right so we can have labels obviously we
don't want a label that says image
because that just seems really weird and
we can actually give this image an image
style here by
clicking the gear on the right and now
I'm just going to use this large 480 by
480 image style I'm not going to have a
link to anything I'm gonna click update
if you want to learn more about image
styles we have a video on that for
LevelUp Tut so that you can go and learn
about how to make your own image styles
and for description we can say whether
we want this to have a label or not I
think it might be nice for it to have a
label we could change that that what
that label is in the actual product and
we will just want this to be default so
let's click Save
let's go to manage fields and edit that
description label so up here we can
click Edit for description and it's
asking us for this label and description
seems okay but we could just call this
we could maybe just say product
description description just seems a
little blunt for some reason I'm not
sure why I would probably look at other
stores and see how their labeling
something like that okay so we've added
some things we've modified the display
for the product display and we've
modified the display for the product
itself so let's click out of this and
refresh now when i refresh you'll see we
have the image up top here we have a
product description we have the price
and we have the product label which we
should get rid of too and then when we
change this it not only changes our
description but it changes our image as
well and that's happening because you've
added these these attributes to the
product itself now if you would add
attributes to the product display they
wouldn't change because there's only one
product display here so that's where a
Drupal makes that distinction and it
allows for some really custom
customizable products now I'm just gonna
turn this product select thing off here
it's under the product display or yeah
the product display manage display and
it's just this label above I'm gonna set
to hidden and click Save just because I
don't like it
refresh and it's gone also these images
are two different sizes this one is 480
like we told it to be how
ever the other one is 200 in something
and that's not cool because it's not
going to fit the box so let's change the
image style from large 42 to 20 let's
save that save again refresh alright now
we have a little bit better of a looking
store here it looks a little bit more
realistic now let's add the long
description for the product that's going
to be above the product short
description so let's go ahead and click
Edit here and in our body I'm actually
going to put like two paragraphs and
just paste this in here and yeah
filtered HTML sharp and let's save this
cool so we now have this long
description we have an image we have a
product description and when I change
this our image and our short description
changes as well as the price but the
long description does not so cool we've
just made a configured product using
Drupal commerce and you can tell that if
you were to just now use some CSS or add
some JavaScript plugins to make this
look a little bit more like a store that
you're used to you could get pretty far
with these skills alone in creating your
products so as always this is Scott with
a little Tut's if you have any questions
or comments leave a comment the video or
hit us up at Twitter Facebook or
anywhere
level up Tut's thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
