of tutorials and in this video we're
going to be talking about how we can
move our angular UI router partials into
their own files so instead of just using
the template property that we used in
the object before we're going to be
using something called template URL and
storing those partials in their own
files so let's get going on that right
now so in the last video we had a really
basic implementation of some routing
here and we just said template use this
sort of age 1 and this sort of age 1
here and basically we were outputting
just these these titles here and it's
not really a true template right in fact
we even commented a bunch of this stuff
out because we wanted to edit back in
later and we weren't even using a
controller or anything on our new sort
of routing template so now in this video
we're actually going to be breaking
these routes out in two separate
templates and get this working okay so
let's get started right now by first
creating some new template files inside
of our directory we can create a new
file that one of them can just be home
HTML and another one can be let's make a
new file save this about dot HTML okay
and for simplicity's sake we are just
going to drop in these eighth ones in
here and actually let's change it up
let's have to say about us just so we
can verify that this route is in fact
using this template instead of just this
about text here and we'll change this
hello to home page okay home page like
so okay so we now have two new templates
we have dot HTML files in here yet we
need some way to go ahead and reference
them in our state provider so now
instead of saying template here what we
can actually say is template and then in
camel case URL so now instead of passing
it a string
that's going to be an actual template
we're going to be passing in a string
that's a location to a template so we
can simply just say home dot HTML and
now the reason why we're not putting any
sort of path here is just because I in
this example essentially just through
all these in our root directory now once
with skits a little bit more elaborate
we'll put these into partials directly
get them out directory get them out of
the way and then not have to worry about
it that way so let's go ahead and modify
this one to about that HTML as well and
we can change this to template URL save
that now let's go ahead and check out
our site cool so I loaded up our page
here as you can see our homepage has
homepage and now if we come to slash
about you can see it does say about us
so in fact these routes are now using
external templates which is super cool
one thing we can do now is actually take
our this whole directory lists we can
cut this out of here and now I'm just
going to throw it into the home page
page here i'm going to uncomment it out
now I'm actually going to throw a
wrapper around it with this
ng-controller so we can just have a div
here and it doesn't even need a class
because I'm not going to do any styling
on it or anything and we could just
simply put this directory controller
wrapping around this code so now you can
see let me get rid of this entirely too
okay so now you can see our index page
is really just this UI view now the UI
view is hitting the route and it's going
to be rendering this once it hits this
ng-controller knows to use the directory
controller as der list and so let's come
to our home page once more and we should
be able to see this totally working just
like it was before so it looks like we
have all of our names coming in
correctly showing hi names all the stuff
still working looks like one of these
images is currently not correct but I
just checked in it turns out it's a
source problem it's not a problem with
the controller here so i'll go ahead and
update that in the code but other than
that this seems to all be working just
like we'd expect so as always this is
scoured level of tutorials in the next
video we're going to be showing you how
you can do things like defining your
controller in the router state and we're
going to be making this a little bit
cleaner by moving some things out into
their own directories and stuff so as
always this has got with level of
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment a video or hit
us up at Twitter or Facebook at level up
tutorials we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
