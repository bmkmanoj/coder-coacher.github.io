of tutorials and in this video we're
going to do more than just an individual
chart option but we're gonna be able to
set global defaults for all of our
charts let's say you have an entire site
full of charts and you want them all to
either look or function or feel the same
you could set global defaults so that
all of your charts have the same
settings without having to reset these
settings on the options for each
individual chart so that's it going on
that now so we've gone over a bit about
configuration already we've set the
bottom ticks to zero we've changed some
of the colors and just sort of the
configuration elements in our chart
already but let's see we have another
chart and we don't want to have to have
these options in every single chart now
it's greatest that chart j/s allows us
to have some global configuration
options and these global configuration
options can change a lot of stuff for
instance let's head to Adam here and we
can just start up here above our get
element by ID and let's go ahead and
have a new declaration we're simply just
going to say chart and that chart is the
same chart as this function right so we
know we don't have to have this defined
anywhere because we're bringing this in
with this library here and we could say
chart dot defaults dot global let's
check out one particular option we can
say responsive and we can set this as
equal to false by default responsive is
equal to true and therefore our chart as
we know right now is responsive check it
out it's already responsive right let's
go ahead and actually do a command-i on
this and refresh and what we have now is
our chart isn't responsive and you'll
remember when we set the width and
height well that's what it's using so
basically whatever you use here in your
canvas is whatever this is going to take
and your charts not going to move from
this size now I can't 100% recommend not
having your chart be responsive I mean
maybe you'll want to have the
Taner changing at different sizes but I
think the option of having your chart
resized to the parent container has
definitely gonna come in handy more
often now let's go ahead and come to the
Chart JSA organic configuration options
we even have so under documentation
global chart configuration you could see
there is a ton of stuff so for instance
responsive animation maintain aspect
ratio events hover on hover on click
right now it does nothing but let's say
we want to have something happen when we
click default font color default color
all sorts of great stuff here and this
is all just within the global charts now
inside of global charts there's also
global charts that title and you can
assign all sorts of things like display
whether we want the title to display or
not whether this is full width font
color all sorts of stuff then we have
charts global legend which is going to
be the legend itself which we can see
right now just uses these two different
items we could change anything from the
label to the font color of the label and
you can access any of these just by
drilling down within this object chart
default global agenda labels dot font
color that's going to get you to change
the font color and there's just a ton of
stuff here so you can really get in here
and really modify so many of these
defaults that you know I mean here we
can change our tooltips for the entire
project in case we have more than one
graph on a page or even in a project and
we just want to keep these defaults
where they're at now again there are ton
of options here so I'm an office so we
can't show all of these but it's gonna
be great for you too detected this
documentation and just see all the
different things you can change globally
now for instance right now we have our
chart animating when we refresh it does
this little animate up and you can see
we have the default ease as ease out
quartz you could always change that to a
different easing function if you'd like
we can have a function go on progress in
or uncomplete so once his animation is
completed
meaning you could have a function in
here simply by grabbing this entire
thing let's say chart on animation nod
okay all this stuff let's grab it I'm
gonna make this responsive again and
we're using charts defaults global
animation and we can grab the on
complete and and we can set this equal
to a function now this could be equal to
a function that's are you to find or you
could simply I'm using an arrow function
here by the way I'm using the es2015 or
es6 syntax for all of this stuff all you
need to know that this is equivalent to
the word function before this right here
I mean this could very well be it could
very well be like this the reason like
the arrow function is because of its the
reason I like the arrow function is
because of how it preserves this okay if
you want to learn more about that check
out there's all sorts of great
documentation on the es2015 syntax keep
in mind this is only gonna work in newer
browsers so if you don't have a newer
browser up and running or you're not
using something like babel then you're
gonna want to go ahead and use var
instead of a constant let and obviously
a function into the vero but i want to
keep this as modern as possible now
inside of here we can just simply say
console dot log and let's say finished
okay so this function is going to fire
whenever the animation is complete and
we should see council dot log finished
when it is it's going to open up our
council so we can see that happen let's
come here and refresh it and as you can
see after that animation is completed we
do have finished being an output to our
council log you can see it again
in action boom just like that super cool
so a lot of the stuff is really useful I
mean maybe you want this function to run
and do something to your page once the
charts finish loading so that you you
just have you have that knowledge of
when it's finished loading you can also
change the duration of the animation
let's say 1000 milliseconds is too long
we could come in here and change this to
its changes to a number now so the
previous value is 1000
and let's go ahead and have this be
something like 200 this is going to be a
really super quick animation now and we
can come back and refresh whoop and
there we go we got that nice quick
animation super cool so these are global
configuration options as you can see
there is a ton of stuff like you can
even set the global line border color to
change the default border color for your
entire project if you'd like but as you
can see it's a simply just a matter of
drilling down into these objects and
setting these values to what you want
them to be super cool so this is global
chart configuration chart j/s as you
could see there is a ton ton and ton of
options to change here so get into it if
you want to make sure that you can keep
your charts fully unified and either
their appearance or just their function
you can set all your things in global
variables and that way you don't have to
come in here to your individual chart
and set things like the border color if
every single one of your charts is going
to have the same border color cool so
this is global chart configuration now
in the next video we're going to dive
into a bar chart but this we're gonna
write from hand and we're gonna do it a
little bit differently so I challenge
you to create a bar chart and we're
gonna go ahead and do so maybe perhaps
try without even looking see see if you
can come close to what the actual syntax
is and then after you've either failed
or succeeded with your bar chart head to
the documentation and check out their
examples because they're really super
good as always this is Scott with level
