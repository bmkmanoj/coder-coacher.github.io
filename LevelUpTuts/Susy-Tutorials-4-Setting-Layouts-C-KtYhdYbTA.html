up tuts and today we're going to expand
our Susy knowledge by learning about the
layout mixin now there's also a layout
function and it's just a little bit
different we're going to go over that in
a little bit as well but today we're
just going to be talking about the
layout mix in itself
now what this mix and does is it
actually sets these same things that we
said in the last video for our default
settings right so it's essentially going
to reset our grid settings now you might
be wondering why would you want to do
this if we already have a grid settings
well this allows for things like
dynamically changing grids you could
change your grid based on breakpoints or
something like that and there's even a
width layout mixin that allows you to
temporarily set some of your grid
settings now how do we use this layout
well let's say for example we have our
Suzy grid here this is what our page
looks like it's a 12 column it's where
we left it off and we just uh we defined
these grid settings by putting in this
map we had these settings right here now
let's say we wanted to have some
different settings then that changed at
a certain point well so what I'm going
to do is I just copied this map and now
I'm going to make a new one but I'm
going to give it a new name now let's
just call this a ah wide layout right so
wide layout isn't going to be 12 columns
anymore but 24 columns now if we come
back to our page and refresh you'll
notice absolutely nothing has changed of
course that's because Susy is looking
for this map of Susy for the default
settings and not wide laid out or
whatever you told it right in fact if we
were to actually change this name to be
Susy and have this override this you
could see this is now using 24 columns
but of course that's not what we want to
do we want to set this using this new
mixin so we have our wide layout it's
refreshed back to normal
and so the sites just sort of ignoring
the
map so how do we tell Suzy to use this
map for its settings well we can do that
by saying add include and then the mixin
is just layout and now this accepts a
couple of things it accepts a shorthand
syntax which we'll get into in the next
video but it also accepts a map just
like the one we just created so we can
type in a wide layout and now when we
come back to our site you'll notice the
site is no longer using the Susi
defaults but it's now in fact using this
new layout that we just created so here
we have include layout wired layout now
let's say you wanted just temporarily to
have you know have something be set to
maybe a different type of grid well okay
so this might be confusing here so what
we have is first we have our default set
then we have our wide layout overriding
that with this layout mixin and now
we're actually going to wrap everything
here in another mixin and that's
actually going to once again change it
so let's say we wanted this entire block
of code to now use a 12 column layout
this is something you probably just use
temporary to wrap around a little thing
but to illustrate our point I'm going to
wrap all of our code in it so we can say
@include and then with - layout and now
we just want to say 12 and we can put an
opening bracket now I'm just going to
select all of my code here tab it over
and then close that bracket so now when
we refresh our page we should be seeing
this 12 column layout once again so we
have some several different options for
changing our layout this with layout is
obviously just for basically a quick
change or something like that a small
section that you maybe need to
temporarily reset the defaults because
if we pulled anything out of this like
we pulled these two things out of this
this area right here and put them down
here put them down here let's get rid of
the spacing so it's correct save this
now when we come back and refresh it's
using this twelve column layout again
because these span four of nine and
whatever are outside of the width layout
wrapper so the layout that it's getting
is the wide layout and of course if we
were to comment out this line it would
be once again using these Susi defaults
so these are some of the options you
have for changing the layout in the next
video we're gonna go over the shorthand
syntax and how can be really powerful
for quickly changing your settings and
things like that and then after that
we're going to get into building
responsive sites and then these lay out
these layout mix ins are going to become
a lot more interesting because we'll be
able to change them at breakpoints and
stuff like that so as always sis Scott
