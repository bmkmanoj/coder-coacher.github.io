up Tut's and today we're going to show
you how to create a custom menu and now
you might be wondering what can I do
with the custom menu right well maybe
you want some pages that you don't want
in this top menu maybe an aside or a
footer menu some like off the side
things or maybe you just don't want all
of your pages to show up in this main
menu so right now if we were to create a
new page let's say we wanted a donations
page if we actually come in here and we
create a new page and we call it
donations and it doesn't matter what's
actually in the content here if we
publish this page no matter what it's
going to let's refresh our page here
it's going to put in this main
navigation by default right pretty much
every page you create is just going to
go up here and if you have things like a
donations or a privacy policy or
something your menus going to get filled
up with a bunch of stuff that you might
actually not consider to be primary
level navigation so what we're going to
do in this video is we're going to
recreate this top menu using only the
menu items we want to do and we're going
to do that by creating a custom menu now
to get there we just need to go to
appearance and then menus now in menus
we don't have any menus created so we
can type in a menu here and we can just
call this main nav and now let's click
create menu now you can actually check
to see if you want automatically add new
top-level pages to this menu now that
might be useful for some navigations
however this particular one we want to
only pick the pages we want to be in
that main navigation now we also have
the option of saying where to show up
you can it show up in the top primary
menu or the secondary menu in the left
sidebar well we want this to take the
place of the top primary menu so we can
select that now we just need to pick our
pages
notice how when you click view all or
most recent or search you can find your
pages that way so we can click home and
about us because those are the only two
pages we want in this main menu now
we're going to click Add
menu and we now have them here if they
were in the wrong order we could move
them by just clicking and dragging like
that okay now let's save this menu and
now let's come back to our front page
and refresh our main menu has now been
replaced by the custom menu that we
created and we now have home and about
us now if we were to wanting to move
this now that we've already created sure
we could just check this bar another way
you could come here is come to manage
locations and we could say which menu is
which now you might be wondering well we
only have a top primary menu and a
secondary menu and these are the menus
that are built into the theme there's
other ways to add a menu and there's
ways to add menu areas to your theme so
in more advanced videos we're going to
show you how to add menu areas and in
the very next video we're going to show
you how to add a menu with a widget so
I'm just going to click Save here now we
have our official menu with home and
about us and it's just what we want
there so as always this is Scott with
LevelUp Tut's if you have any questions
or comments leave a come in the video is
up on Facebook Twitter check out the
level up forum anything you want so as
always I'll see you in the next one
fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
