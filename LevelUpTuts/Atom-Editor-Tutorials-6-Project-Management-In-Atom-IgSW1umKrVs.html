up tutorials in this video we're going
to be showing you how you can manage
your projects with an atom so it started
on that right now
so you might be wondering about project
management in atom and many other text
editors and IDs and things like that
you basically have project configuration
files as well as maybe a project file
itself opening that project file will
then open up the correct files needed in
your text editor
well Adam doesn't really have that with
the exception of IDs that really need
those settings and a text editor or
something really basic here I find
myself just dragging a folder into the
text editor and opening it
so project managing in Adam is very
similar to that sort of process we have
our folder we have our tree of files
here and the files that show up are
basically the ones that aren't being
told to be hidden by default in your
preferences now we can modify and edit
any of our files in here just simply by
clicking them and you can see when we
quit close Adam when we reopen it
it opens the last projects we had
available now if we were to take a
folder from our finder or your my
computer or something and we were to
simply just drag it into the application
let's say we wanted to just take another
folder here I'm going to click and drag
this into atom you can see what it does
is opens up entirely in a new window
which is nice because we now have these
two separate projects however what if we
wanted both of these folders in one
project could you do that another way we
can come about this is by clicking add
project folder
we could then find a folder in here like
sites okay let's click this one we can
click open and now what you see is that
we do have to root level folders open in
here so to do that we need to simply
come to file add a project folder and
it's going to add another folder to this
project now again if we were to quit
Adam reopen it you can see it treats us
as a project now any single file if we
were to do command T and say styles dot
you can see that it's pulling files from
intermediate Meteor complete and
intermediate so both of those folders
are going to be looked for when you
search for files so another way we could
do this is simply just by opening up a
new window entirely you could do that
with a keyboard command command shift N
or you could just simply say a new
window from here we can add a project to
the folder now this is if you don't
necessarily like dragging and things
like that I have just selected open on
the folder that I was currently and as
you can see it loaded up all these files
here now one another interesting feature
that I really like about Adam if I do
command shift end to have another new
window is if I drag a file let's
my finder once more if I drag a file
from this let's say the index.html file
I drag this into the editor
automatically knows this as part of a
project that I already have open and it
reopens the particular file here within
that project let's actually go ahead and
close this window entirely I'm just
going to exit out of it and now let's
try the same thing when I drag index dot
HTML over it does a nice thing it opens
up all of the rest of the files in that
folder as well so it looks for the root
folder of index we'll see that it's this
folder and then it's going to pull in
that entire folder so Adams minimalist
approach to project management is really
nice and convenient and it mostly works
in your favor so as you can see there
are no hard core tools for working with
individual projects but personally I
think that's just fine if you'd like to
get the rest of these Adam videos before
they are published on YouTube head over
to store that level of tutorials com or
subscribe to a level up Pro subscription
