up thoughts thanks for coming back
before we start as always want to
encourage you guys to please subscribe
to our youtube channel follow us on
twitter and you can also follow me on
twitter hat and shaft alright so in this
video I'm going to wrap up wig wam which
is a WYSIWYG editor by pixel and tonic
in the last video we did a basic
configuration and talk through why you'd
be wanting it was WYSIWYG editor in the
first place in this video we're going to
go through some of the advanced features
so let's do this if you recall add-ons
modules scroll down to the bottom wig
wam go over actually we'll start right
here so file browser this is something I
intentionally breezed over last time
didn't really want to explain it but now
here we go so what this means is when
like I says here this is the file
browser that you're going to use when if
you're for example uploading an image or
something like that and so I normally
leave it on e file manager pixel and
tonic as developed another one called
assets I don't own that one would love
to try it out look super sexy as usual
but I don't own it so I can't show you
but I will show you you know what this
one looks like so imma leave this here
if you had assets installed you'd
selected here otherwise you can use ck
finder which is sort of part of the
ckeditor open source project so i'm
going to leave as is go over to editor
configuration and i'm actually going to
go into my basic one which I've sort of
customized a bit but you didn't see
because I didn't scroll down so the top
half of the screen is
especially this tops it maybe third we
discussed right giving it a name here
are the buttons that you're turning on
and off and the tool toolbar here the
ones that are on this upper set the ones
that are off or those lower set in this
darker grey box and then we're going to
talk about the bottom here so height by
default right now it's set to 200 pixels
hall at all and is resizable meaning
that you can sort of dragged down the
box the textarea box so if you have for
example oh really a body content which
is probably always going to be longer
than just 200 pixels what you can do
from the onset when you're setting up
that wig wam field is you know set this
something to something greater now it is
like i said the boxes check so it's
resizable but you know what happens is
the content manager will want to see the
entire or the body in its entirety and
not just 200 pixels at a time so what
you do is you just change this to 6 and
now it's 600 and we've no tripled the
size CSS file what this is referring to
is the styles that get attached to the
WYSIWYG editor now if you recall in the
last video wysiwyg stands for what you
see is what you get so what this field
does it gives you the ability there the
functionality to hook up your or maybe a
small part of your CSS file so that the
body tags and headers and Link colors
are all the same size and line height
and all that type of stuff very handy
I'm not going to bother with it right
now then upload directory I gave the
example of just a moment ago as if
you're uploading an image we know we're
going to use that
expression engines default file manager
and it's going to go into this upload
directory which I have to which I don't
know if i define this one or business
automatically set up this way but this
is it pulls from a preference under
design or actually wears it under sorry
under content files oh my gosh content
files and then you have these like your
file manager and upland file upload
preferences where you can create more
directories but I just have mine going
into the primary uploads area and then
down below this is where it gets
interesting we have these advanced
settings so let's look at another window
real quick I'm gonna leave this one open
but open a new tab at you guys know i'ma
do dick it's a tab hall Oh anyway and so
if we were to create a new field this is
just empty bright this is the advanced
settings are not set but what you'll see
here is once i click on one of these
we're going to be able to see all of the
ckeditor configurations that are
available through this very tight
integration between the ckeditor open
source project and pixel and tonics wig
wam editor so you may be looking at this
list and saying like holy this is a
lot of stuff what am I supposed to know
I this is confusing I don't know what
these things are well fret not right you
can select one of these and once you
select it you get sort of the summary
and then you have the option and then
also you see the default value this
paste from word remove styles that is
referring to this button and by default
it removes the styles when pasting from
some
frequently what happens to someone will
copy and pasting from Microsoft Word and
it has a bunch of crap styles that will
look really nasty on the web and
fortunately there's a button and on some
additional function that will help clean
that up but if you select something that
you're not familiar with or maybe
something that's more foreign to you
what you can do is you can click on the
more in the new tap it brings you right
over to a for a more detailed
description and with more links that you
can sort of dig deeper into and figure
out you know this is the function you
want or not it's what you'll find is
this is a very complete WYSIWYG editor
if you are you know playing with
something that's not quite working the
way that you would expect and it's an
advanced feature which you might want to
do and that I've had to do this numerous
times where I wasn't sure if it was an
issue with wig wam or pose an issue with
ck editor like for example if I was
trying to do something and i would first
check wig wam that's pixel and tonics
support for him I couldn't find somebody
that was having the same issue there I'd
head over to ck editor and several times
I found my answer on that board instead
of pixel and tonic support board so just
keep that in mind but let's do this I'm
going to go back over let's go ahead and
close this tab now go back to that
previous one which was my basic which is
pretty advanced and just show you a
couple of these things so there's one
called body class and body ID and what
those things are referring to those
that's this referring to the class and
the body ID of the I framed in document
for the editor this is all done with
JavaScript and I frames and all that
type of sort of fun stuff your if you
were wondering it's not flash or
anything like that
ignore empty paragraphs when you first
enter a wig wam field when you're
creating new content it automatically
creates paragraphs paragraph tags which
is helpful in some cases but maybe it
could be a hindrance and others this is
something that you can easily turn on
and off and then we've gone through some
of these other ones what you do is when
you want to add another one you would
find the item that you want oh actually
this is the auto product a paragraph I
was referring to the wrong wrong thing
here anyway I think I'll figure this out
by reading these little paragraphs and
then that's it you just sort of select
it it automatically adds it if you
didn't want to do that I don't want auto
grow on startup I can just turn some of
these things off and then once I hit
update it saves I can go back and look
at the content so I just want to show
you one of these things real quick to
miss advanced features so this was the
basic so what I'm gonna do I can't right
click say like inside of here because
using javascript it's sort of rewriting
what the right click functionality is
I'm saying for up here doesn't do
anything and that's you know probably a
benefit for your sort of average content
manager but a hindrance to a web
developer that's trying to show you this
very specific thing so anyway we'll deal
with it for now I'm going to just
inspect and show you something when I'm
trying to get at so let's go into this
field set yours wig wam I'll go into the
span and just keep drilling down
trickling down we've got a table that's
going to have some rows we want the
middle row the top row is referring to
those buttons
chilling down here's that high frame
it's pulling in the document and here's
the HTML and here's the body and here's
the ID and here's the class so what I
was trying to say it's a you have some
paragraphs here and you want them to
look like the paragraphs on your full
site larger different font you may need
an additional class or ID I was just
showing you both but you know obviously
wouldn't need both you may need an
additional class or ID so that you can
effectively target these items instead
of you know targeting things around it
or whatever the case is so anyway those
are just some of the features of some of
the advanced features of wig wam oops
wrong screen and you know obviously
there's there's many more and again
which I'm sure will happen is you're
going to run into a little you know one
little thing and you're going to be sort
of reading these through one at a time
trying to figure out is this the thing
that you want remember you know Google's
your friend pixel and tonic are your
friend I'm your friend you have some
resources out there if you have any
questions about wig wam you can either a
send it to send us a message on Twitter
