up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
show you how you can update your gitlab
so you can stay on top of the latest
releases and make sure everything is
nice and secure let's get going on that
now okay so if you ever noticed in the
update section you'll notice there's
update or update available and in this
case we have a bright-red update ASAP as
in this version is having an issue
that's going to be a security update
that's urgent and something we need to
definitely update now if these are files
that only exist on your get lab here as
in turn sirs there's no backup anywhere
else you're gonna want to go ahead and
completely backup your database
beforehand now I'm not going to go into
the process of that
however it's definitely a good idea
before running any sort of major update
now I personally haven't any issues but
obviously if you're updating any
software that's modifying the database
updating your database creating a backup
of your database is certainly something
that is a good idea well how can we go
about updating gitlab considering we
installed it based on considering we
installed it directly when we installed
the server well let's go ahead and login
ssh in to our server i'm just gonna hope
it on my terminal and we can type ssh
and we can have root at and then if you
guessed it we want to go ahead and use
the IP in this case it's 159 203 103 195
again don't try to log into my server
it's not going to work okay then as you
can see I'm now logged in and you can
see it's still giving my get lab
credentials right here now let's go
ahead and hit command cake right up just
so we have a better view here and let's
go ahead and first run sudo apt - get
update ok this is going to update the
software
then we want to run the specific apt-get
update Ford gitlab itself we can type
sudo apt-get install and then run git
lab c/e and you could see one of the
following packages we'll be upgrading
gitlab - see which is obviously what
we're intending to update here so
perfect now let's go ahead and actually
head back to our application notice it
says if your git lab server is
misbehaving try to run this we're gonna
go ahead and see if it's misbehaving
first before we do I'm just gonna simply
refresh this page and as you can see we
are up to date we now have the nice
green up to date notice and it we click
around it looks like everything's
working just fine
cool so this is how you update get lab
you have to do it through the apt or
apt-get updating your packages through
the operating system itself cool so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment this video or
hit me up at Twitter or Facebook a level
up tutorials love to hear from you
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
