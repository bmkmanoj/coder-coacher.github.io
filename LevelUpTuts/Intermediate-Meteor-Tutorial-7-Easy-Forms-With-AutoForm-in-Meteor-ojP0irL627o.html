up tutorials and in this video we are
going to create our auto forum so we're
going to create some new templates we're
going to show you a one-liner of HTML
blaze code that allows you to completely
generate your template based on your
schema so let's get going on that right
now okay so now we want to generate our
auto form now to do that we're going to
go ahead and have to head to our routing
code first and what we're going to do is
just completely modify this test route
before we do that actually let's go
ahead and just delete this test template
out of our main layout just so we don't
forget to do that now let's go ahead and
delete the path for test here and have
this be something different we want this
to be a recipe book this is going to be
the main page that a recipes are on and
you don't have to worry about actually
navigating to this because after we set
up some rules essentially when you login
to this site it will auto direct you to
recipe book
okay so we have recipe book here recipe
book now we want to render a specific
layout into our main area now the
template we want to use is going to be
named recipes okay let's copy this now
let's head to our recipes folder that we
created a long time ago in our client
folder I'm going to make a new file I'm
going to say this as recipes HTML now
inside of here I'm going to make a new
template with a name of recipes now to
verify that everything's working here we
can just go ahead and say test here
let's head to our route recipe - book
you can see we are getting that test so
the routes working or on the correct
page let's go back to our code here and
we're going to be including another
template now the reason why we're having
another template within here is because
there's going to be a lot more stuff on
this recipes template here and this is
just going to be the form for adding a
new recipe I'm going to have the greater
than sign and now we're just going to
say to use the template new recipe okay
so new recipe is going to be looking for
a template called new recipe so now it's
going to be time to create one in our
recipes folder we can click a new file
once more new recipes HTML create a
template with the name of new recipe so
now before we get our form going let's
go ahead and has have a div and we're
going to have this be a container and
it's just going to say new recipe
container now if you're wondering how
I'm doing this auto-completion it's
being used through Emmet if you're not
using Emmet it's a really nice way to
write HTML really fast so so the
downside to here we're going to have
another template tag with a greater than
sign and we're going to use the word
quick form and now quick form allows us
to completely generate a form form our
collection it's part of the Otto form
package which you should have installed
if you've been following along so now
let's go ahead and say collection is
equal to and then inside of quotes we're
going to say recipes so this is
attaching it to our collection now we're
going to give this an ID the ID is
simply just going to be insert recipe
form nothing too crazy the type is going
to be we're going to give this a type
it's going to be that of insert this is
going to be different from when we have
things like update of course those are
things we'll go over later and now we
can say class is also equal to new
recipe
- form okay like so now when we head
back to our page we should see that the
form has been completely auto-generated
for us based on our schema so let's head
back and you can see we have name
description author created at date so
this is amazing because we now have a
form and we didn't have to do anything
but there are a couple of problems with
it we have author and created at which
are two things we wanted to autofill so
to change that let's head back to our
schema which was recipes Jas inside of
our collections folder so let's head
down to the author field first and what
we're going to do is add some auto form
specific values so to do that we can
type auto form and it's going to have an
object inside of this we can say type
and the type we want to give this form
field is hidden now this is going to
make this field completely hidden from
view let's go ahead and paste it also in
for created at we could head back to our
page and when it refreshes here as
meteor does you will see that we no
longer have the created at and we no
longer have the author fields yet we do
have name and description still okay so
this is how you use quick form for auto
form now it doesn't give you the most
control over any sort of auto form
generation and that's why quick form
isn't the only way to automatically
generate form fields you can actually
add each field individually if you would
like as well in a custom form however
since we wanted to just get going
quickly a quick form is the way to go
for that and it is super easy if you
don't have anything too complex going on
now that but now this is by no means the
end of quick form or collection - as
we've been as we need to learn them so
in the next video we are going to go
through the process of getting our
recipes to show up and then we're going
to keep submitting this form until we
can essentially get it working there are
several things that you have to know
about especially because we're no longer
using the auto publishing in secure
packages so thank you for watching as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video I hit
me up at Twitter or Facebook at level up
Tut's love to hear from you thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
