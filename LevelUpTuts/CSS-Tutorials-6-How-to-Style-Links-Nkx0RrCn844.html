of touch and today I'm going to show you
how to style links using CSS they have
something that's called a state so let's
actually make a link and then we can
sort of talk about what the state is
let's go to my HTML here and this I'm
just going to have some text and I'm
going to have an HR F here and I'm going
to have this just be a pound and it's
just going to be these first few
characters and by default links get
styled let's go to Chrome here they get
styled blue and underlined this is the
browser default if you have like a CSS
reset or something it may be different
but this is you you're pretty standard
right so let me click on this you'll
notice a few thing happens it was blue
but now that we've clicked on it it's
purple okay so the blue state is just
the link state it's just a normal
unvisited link this purple state that we
now see is the visited state this is
what shows after somebody has clicked to
link this can help your users know where
they've been on your site so that is the
visited and then when we click on it
it's going to be red so I'm holding down
the mouse button and that's why this is
staying red this is the active state and
then there's also the hover state when
your mouse hovers over this something
happens however since we don't by
default there's no hover state
you're not seeing anything so let's do
something with this link and let's go to
my page here and I'm going to I'm going
to use I'm going to attach the style to
all links that are within the wrapper so
down here I'm going to write that
wrapper because it's in the class
wrapper and then it's going to be all of
the anchor tags but they're only the
ones that are within the wrapper so you
do dot wrapper space eh okay so the way
that we attach something to it is by
having after the anchor tag
for your normal class that rapper
space-a we're going to have a colon and
then what state it is so let's say we
want to on the hover state we want it to
be background of red so now if you look
rapper anchor and then your colon and
then the word hover which is the state
let's refresh this page here and now
when we hover over it's going to be a
red background okay and now again let's
copy and paste this and it's changed up
just a little bit into the hover we're
going to say active if I can spell it
right active and we're getting you this
a background of blue save this come here
now it's red blue red blue red blue red
blue and if you do this enough times
you'll have a seizure but this is your
link here active state so you can do all
great things some people do a technique
where they have the top move down by one
pixel and it actually feels more like
you're clicking a button or something
and we'll get over that once we get into
position and position relative position
episode all that stuff and this is just
normal CSS that you're putting into that
the state so you can attach really any
CSS property to the state and have a
change of via whatever action you're
doing on this link
another technique real quick that people
might use is to say for their let's make
them do one of these in do rapper anchor
for the normal link we're going to have
a text decoration of none so it's not
going to be underlined like it is now
but we want on hover we want a text
decoration of underlined so now the link
is going to be underlined only when you
hover over it let's check it out so now
you can see the link is differentiated
by its active or by its visited state or
its normal link color but then when you
hover over it it's not only getting this
color it's getting this underlined let's
actually get rid of that color just so
you can see this a little bit better
okay so now it's getting this underlined
so your your letting people know that
this text is colored for a reason it's a
link
okay and that's how you style links
using CSS if you have any questions or
comments please leave a come in the
video intercept a Twitter level up tuts
let's know what you're thinking once
again says Scott and thanks for watching
