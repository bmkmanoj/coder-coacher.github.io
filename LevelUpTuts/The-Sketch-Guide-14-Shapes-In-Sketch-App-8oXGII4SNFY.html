which are drawing canvas let's go ahead
and talk about actually drawing using
shapes so what we can do is first let's
insert in our board you could come up
and just hit insert artboard or you can
take advantage of sketches great
keyboard shortcuts and simply just hit
the a key and you'll notice we now get
our crosshair where we can draw our
artboard now we don't particularly need
an artboard for this but it's nice to
get in the process of making an artboard
let's go ahead now and let's create a
rectangle we can do so you'll want to
click anywhere because by default after
you draw the artboard it's going to
select the name here to be allow you to
name this if we click off it gets rid of
that now we can hit our and you'll
notice we get the cursor again and
you'll notice we get two crosshair again
and we can click and draw a shape okay
now here's our rectangle and this is
just an absolute basic rectangle if you
want to maintain a regular rectangle you
would just hold shift like normal now if
we're resizing this and you want to keep
the dimensions intact for instance let's
go ahead and have this be a vertical
rectangle like this and we were to hold
the shift key now you'll notice it
doesn't make it a square or a regular
rectangle it actually keeps the current
dimensions so holding shift can be
useful if you're not only for creating
regular shapes but for actually creating
shapes that maintain their size okay so
we have a rectangle now how do we turn
this into an oval well we actually have
the radius slider right here where we
can just grab this and turn it all the
way up to 100 the illness doesn't turn
this into an oval at all and in fact the
border radius here is going by pixels so
at a hundred pixels and the shape being
giant is you can notice it's 2000 pixels
tall 100 pixels is nothing this sort of
looks like just an absolute 5 pixel
border radius let's go ahead and make
this shape considerably smaller I'm
going to go ahead and have
with B let's just say 100 and the height
can be 300 now we'll want to zoom in on
this we can do so by selecting the shape
and then we can hit command to okay
you'll notice what we still don't have
is we still don't have an oval this is a
pill shape now how do we make an oval
well one thing we can do is head to
insert shape and you'll notice we have
an option for an oval which is just oh
let's go ahead and select B oval and
you'll notice we can get working and
drawing a circle here now again if we
hold shift it's going to keep this as a
regular shape or a perfect circle if we
let go it's going to allow us to get
some oval shapes so as you can see here
even with border radius and a small item
we're still not able to get the same
sort of shape out of a rectangle as we
would just be able with the oval tool
now you'll use probably the oval tool
most often for making perfect circles
this is used a lot in terms of maybe
avatar heads or something like that but
you use circles quite a bit in design
and typically they're perfect circles
okay so now we have an oval we have this
pill shape and we have a circle let's go
ahead and actually turn this pill shape
back into a square by turning down the
border radius to zero okay what's next
well we can also create a few more
shapes and what's the difference between
a rounded square and a square as you can
see I'm drawing the rounded square it's
nothing in fact it's simply just a
square with a border radius predefined
and if we were to drag that down what
are we left with
well we're left with a rectangle so as
you can see the border rounded square is
really just a square now why would you
use that well perhaps you just want a
quick default rounded square I
personally don't see myself using the
rounded rectangle very often now in
addition we also have some more complex
shapes like stars polygons and triangles
now I actually end up using triangles
most for creating arrows despite there
being an arrow shape and I'll show you
why in a second
let's get into star because star
actually has a few more options than
most shapes let's actually make a
perfect star cast ours don't look so
good
when they are not regular shapes okay so
we have the star and you'll notice
instead of just radius we get radius and
points we can make this as many pointers
well up to 50 here but it is you know
considerably a lot of points here we're
creating some sort of a Sun type shape
and we can tune up the radius which
actually makes this less of a Sun and
more of maybe like a badge or something
like that and we can bring it all the
way in to get something really extreme
but as you can see here these are the
tools that you're probably used to from
something like illustrator when working
with shapes especially shapes like stars
or something like that you expect this
stuff to be here and it exists within
this shape just as well and you'll
notice here that if we turn this points
down to like five and have a huge border
radius it's less of a star and more of a
Pentagon and if we go extreme with it it
actually comes to I don't know how many
faces there on this one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten this is a
dodeca gun or deca gun I'm not quite
sure of the name to be honest too the
shape but it's something like that so we
have our shapes here so we have our star
here which is highly customizable to
give us some polygonal shapes or we can
simply just actually create a polygon
let's go ahead and create a polygon here
click and drag I'm going to hold shift
again to get a regular shape and you'll
notice we don't have the same options so
when we had pointed radius and we were
able to create some polygons it's sort
of maybe a hacky way of creating a
polygon if you wanted a straight-up
Pentagon you would simply just need to
create a polygon the default is a
Pentagon we can change that we can make
this be six sides hexagon here okay and
you can see we can just go all the way
up to ten no can we go past ten well
let's type into this box 20 and you'll
notice the slider range is sort of the
default right this is where you're
probably going to go with it anywhere
from 4 to 10 but let's say you need more
than
that you can certainly type it in
yourself okay
so with the left with our shapes what we
also have the ability to create a
triangle like I said I use a lot for
making arrows we can come here and
select triangle and again let's go ahead
and make this shape again I'm going to
hold shift create a regular triangle and
as you can see there's no additional
things here we simply just have a
triangle now a triangle is like I said
used really nicely with a rectangle to
create an arrow we can take two shapes
and create one I'm going to be showing
you how to do that with ink using some
of the transformation tools that we have
available to us within sketch now if we
come to insert come to shape and select
arrow this time notice how I'm jumping
back up to some of these we can go ahead
and create an arrow and as you can see
here we have this arrow it doesn't make
it a lot of sense to be honest because
it's one it's pretty small we have in
this additional shape at the end here it
doesn't really make a lot of sense to
use this effort I don't quite sure when
you would end up using this you can see
that we can change the border thickness
and have it be quite a bit larger but
even as you do so the line border ends
up filling in to this the triangle here
and if we were to do maybe like a fill
instead of a large giant border it's
only going to be filling in the
arrowhead like I said using this arrow
shape I'm not quite sure when you use it
unless you're doing just maybe like a
simple graph or something like there are
a simple chart where you're pointing
things either way the arrow shape is not
your most use shape in this toolbar now
the next thing we have is a line which
you can get to simply by hitting the L
key
if you'll notice only four of these
shapes have quick keyboard commands LR
onu now I'm not quite sure about the
round au keyboard shortcut but it's
there if you need it you can probably
guess at the most-used our line
rectangular rectangle and oval began
well for line or just click that you can
see we can hold shift we as you can see
we can draw a line of any distance
between two points and if we were to
hold shift it's going to pin it to
45-degree angle
so we can have a straight line here
that's completely horizontal and you'll
notice up top in our inspector instead
of getting a size and coordinates we
have from x1 to x2 from y1 to y2 so we
get just the length of it by updating
the x2 and you could change this number
to let's say three thousand and you can
see our line has become quite a bit
longer now if you want to make this line
thicker what we can do is come to our
borders and weaken up the thickness now
you'll notice I'm tapping here to make
this thicker and if you were to hold
shift it will jump up by 10 now we have
a 20 pixel thick line and we could
change this color simply by clicking on
in the color for the border here and now
we have a black line so this is how you
create all kinds of shapes in sketch I
know this is getting into basic
territory here but we want to make sure
we have a good foundation for when we
start building so when I say we hit our
to build a rectangle whatever you know
exactly what's going on now in addition
to this we also have a vector tool we
have all sorts of shape tools and
customization options so in the next
video we're going to be getting into
some of the things we can do as shapes
to transform customize them and combine
them so keep watching
fire up the next video as we actually
make our usage of shapes a little bit
more interesting here if you would like
to purchase this series and see the rest
of it we're going to be doing three full
chapters of sketch tutorials basically
taking you through everything you need
to know from basic examples and sort of
foundational knowledge to actually
building real world application designs
