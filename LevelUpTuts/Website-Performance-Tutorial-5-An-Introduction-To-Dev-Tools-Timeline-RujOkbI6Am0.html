of tutorials and in this video I'm
really showing you how to use the
timeline tab in dev tools for Chrome now
timeline allows you to get a really
in-depth look about how your site is
running the constant frames per second
output screenshots and just what sort of
functions are taking a long time and
what sort of scripts might be causing
potential janky Nisour staggering in the
display when maybe you're scrolling or
something like that so let's check it
out right now
so the last video we dove into the
network's tab now we're gonna want to
check out the timeline tab which is
another great way to understand how your
website is loading from a performance
pect if it may be a little bit different
way so if we click inspect I'm using
this in a new window and just like the
network tab we're gonna want to go ahead
and reload the page after we select the
timeline so you'll notice that first off
we have the ability to capture the
JavaScript profile of memory paint and
screenshots let's go ahead and at least
get screenshots and let's get memory too
for that matter
I'm gonna leave paint off for right now
and let's go ahead and just click
refresh so after the page is refreshed
you'll see we get a lot of information
here now this might be overwhelming but
what's really super great is that they
added these screenshots really recently
in here so now you can see at any given
time what your website is looking like
so at 500 milliseconds 1000 milliseconds
then at 1500 milliseconds and then at
2,000 milliseconds you can see that all
the images at this point have fully
loaded and then at this point we can
just keep scrolling and and you can see
at this point that the site is loaded
now I actually wanna I'm gonna command Z
to zoom out a little bit because this is
taking up a lot of room but what we can
see here in the main thread here is this
javascript profile so this really allows
us to dive into our loading and see
what's potentially causing some issues
so you'll notice here we have this red
marker now this red marker essentially
means that there's an area where we
could potentially have some jenkki Ness
in our loading so you can
this warning long frame times are
usually an indication of Genk or poor
rendering performance for instance if we
scroll over here you can see that the
Google Analytics dot J S is causing
quite a bit of time here and maybe one
of the reasons for this Jiang but since
this is a page load it shouldn't
necessarily be something we have to
worry about too much now in addition you
can really just get a great idea of
what's going on in your site in terms of
memory and performance here just by
simply diving down into any of these
functions and you can see all of which
the stuff that it's actually doing here
because this is a compiled meteor site
let's actually see what this is looking
like on the level up tutorials normal
web site here let's come here and I'm
gonna inspect now let's head to the
timeline once again I'm gonna refresh
the page and you can see that it's going
to be loaded up in the timeline now now
we can see that the timing again we have
some red indicators of jank and poor
performance potentially so let's
actually zoom into one of these we can
click on this one and let's scroll into
it and you can see that this whole time
is the parsing of the HTML the Dom
contents being loaded it's then calling
jQuery and it's taking a long time to
load jQuery and it's not necessarily a
long time in the scheme of things but
it's taking up the majority of this this
event here so if we scroll over here you
can see another event that's taking up
some time is analytics we can come over
here and we can see some more things so
what the Timeline view is really good
for giving you a view about how things
are being loaded for instance we saw in
the network tab that that shattered
image that we're using as the background
here it does take some time to load so
for the most the time we get all the
stuff loading here and then the image
comes in what's one way that this could
look better before that image comes in
well simply having a purple background
instead of having a white background
here would make
this loading process looked quite a bit
better while this image still loads now
we have this sort of view here but if we
select this view and let's uncheck this
one up top under our views we can now
see this and sort of like the timeline
where you can see how your site's
loading in scripts and what sort of
scripts and evaluations are taking a
long time and in addition if we were
debugging something that potentially had
a Java Script line that was causing a
lot of problems it would be very obvious
through our timeline profile that this
particular javascript file was taking
too long or maybe was stuck in some sort
of Perpetual loop or something like that
that was causing some slowness on our
site so the timeline tab is really one
you want to spend a lot of time in not
just for really understanding your
website but understanding what all is
available here because this timeline tab
is really one of the most important
tools to understanding general
performance on your website and that's
in terms of not loading time necessarily
but actual run time so how the site's
performing in terms of frames per second
how it feels to your users
Genki nough sand stuff like that in
addition if we ever want to record maybe
like a page transition or something
let's come over back to our level of
tutorials store I'll show you this if we
inspect this and instead of just
refreshing the page on timeline we can
actually click this record circle right
here and now it's going to start
collecting events so we can trigger this
change we can trigger this change we can
trigger this change and if we notice -
any weirdness or Jenkin eseni of this
stuff now if we come back here press the
record button again it's gonna retrieve
our events right so it captured all of
that information it captured all of
those clicks and what's really great is
that we can see these issues these areas
where our frames per second rate is
dropping so over here in the top right
you see we have 30fps and 60fps and you
want to get most of your events to be
below this s 60 FPS line now a lot of
times like right here when we selected
an entirely new
Paige you know that maybe that's not
going to happen because it's changing
pages but we do want to keep make sure
that that is in the forefront of our
ideas when we're sort of looking at this
to try to find what exactly is taking a
long time so here we can see that things
are sort of taking a little we're
recalculating Styles updating layer
recalculating Styles ok nothing sort of
crazy but then we have this event this
mouse click right and this event is
looks like it's taking up a little bit
of time and it's time or nothing is
going on here so we have all this sort
of empty time and then function calls
are happening so what is going on here
well if we actually click this it opens
it down a little bit we can make this a
little bit larger here so what this
click is doing is this essentially
loading all of this information so now
that we've opened up this event click we
now have access to all the things that's
happening inside of this event click
including loading an entirely new page
so this click was triggering a new page
load which is primarily where most this
time is being taken up and then we have
to recalculate the styles with the new
styles redo the layout update the layer
tree repaint the site so these clicks
are in fact new page loads and like I
said made it below 60 frames per second
so that's good that a lot of these other
things like let's say if we click on
this bar right here you can see this
page click opens up a new page so you're
recalculating a lot of styles doing the
new layout stuff but what's really nice
about this is like I said if you had a
particular function or a particular
thing that you were doing in your site
and it was causing a lot of performance
issues
it would make itself very apparent here
by taking up a lot of time clearly
dipping your frames per second way below
that 30 frames per second you're
probably seeing a function call here
that's taking way longer than you would
expect in future videos I'm going to
purposefully sabotage them code so that
we can actually see exactly what you'd
be seeing inside of this Timeline view
but for now just now that this Timeline
view offers you an in-depth look about
the actual performance of your website
that's running as it's being rendered by
the browser and then the network tab is
giving you a lot of information about
how your files are being loaded so
between these two tabs you should be
able to
have a lot of tools to really sort of
figure out if there's issues in your
code or in your assets that are causing
your site to be slow so like I said
we're going to dive into a lot of these
things a bit more as we start to tear
apart our code we start to make
improvements and we start to take care
of bugs that are the most common in
terms of causing performance issues on
your site so as always this is Scott
level of tutorials if you have any
questions or comments I become in the
video or hit us up at Twitter or
Facebook at level up tutorials I'd love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
