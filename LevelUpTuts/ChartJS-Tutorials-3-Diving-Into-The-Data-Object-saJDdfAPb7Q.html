up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be diving a bit more into that
data object that we had in the last
video we're gonna do some customization
options and we're gonna show you how you
can do all sorts of little cool things
with your data okay so let's go ahead
and get rid of this console log we had
up there we obviously don't need it at
this point
know what I want to do is head to our
graph here as you could see it's
instantly responsive now the first thing
I want to do is make a point here what I
want to do is I want to head to my HTML
and let's just go ahead and throw a div
in here now this is maybe going to seem
a little obvious to some but it might be
necessary so let's go ahead and just
have a div here and now in here I'm just
going to add some inline Styles just to
say width is going to be equal to 400
pixels okay now I'm just wrapping this
this canvas and a div and you'll notice
when i refresh we do get the chart
acting responsive so this chart is going
to even though we're giving it a width
and a height here it's going to respond
directly to the width of its container
so let's say if we have this width be
something like 90% then you can see when
we shrink this the chart shrinks I mean
this is great because out of the box
it's responsive and we don't have to do
anything to make it responsive so it's
one of the best features of chart j/s is
that you don't really have to think
about it all you need to know is that
it's going to respond to the container
with itself super cool
so let's actually take a look at our
data you'll remember in our main j/s we
had our line type we had our data which
was an object and then inside of that we
had labels and data sets now you might
be wondering what's up with this why
data sets
well data sets allows you to have more
than one set of data and in addition we
can control the visual look of each of
those sets of data so if we were to
let's say copy this object here this
entire object
and let's go ahead down here at a comma
and then paste it in obviously the the
indentation is off here we could just
say my second data set we can give this
a fill of true we can give this a line
tension of zero which we'll see in a
moment what that does and you'll notice
we can have some background color values
let's go ahead and give this background
color we have our GPA let's change just
one 92 to another 75 here I can't
predict essentially what color this is
gonna be but as you can see it's a nice
purple so if we go ahead and do that 72
72 72 just like that super cool so we
now have two different colors now in
addition we can change a whole ton of
different stuff so let's go ahead down
here to our data what you'll notice is
the each plotted point in our data and
let's just go ahead and modify these
values so we can very clearly see
exactly what's going on here and we can
leave one of these that's the same
perfect okay so let's check this out in
our browser now and as you can see some
initial things are very different one we
have a fill where we said hey up top in
the first one when we said fill false
even though we had a background color in
here like if we were to say fill true
for this one we would we would see this
transparent teal background color
overlaid but you know we can simply just
say false here and get rid of that so we
can get rid of that color entirely
because we're not using it okay
refresh and as you can see we don't need
it nothing changes here and another
thing you'll notice is this line tension
we have these very sharp points here
even though we're going from 80 or 100
to 20 and back up to 60 down to 20 you
know we
we have these sharp here where here
these are nice and curved now that
derived from this line in tension now
you'll notice it's at 0 and 0.1 let's
see if we set this to something like 0.5
for the purple second data set you can
see it's even more curvy than this one
so if you want just like a nice little
edge off so it's not as sharp as
possible you can go ahead and say 0.1
and you'll get something a little bit
more like this if you do obviously want
something that is nice and sharp then
you're going to want to keep that
setting at zero okay so let's go ahead
and get rid of this line tension
entirely you'll notice when it's set to
zero we have these really sharp ones if
we get it line if we get rid of line
tension you can see it's curvy so if we
want something that's not totally curvy
we're gonna want to go ahead and make
sure we have that tension in there so if
you'll notice when we're editing these
things with the colors or with the lines
the unless everything is a border color
or border cap or border - and you might
be wondering well what's up with the
border like this is a line not
necessarily a border however ticket more
of an understanding of this you have to
understand that these are essentially
shapes being drawn on here right and
this line is the border here so anytime
you see a border in this data property
it's going to refer to well the border
of the shape and in this case of a line
graph the border is the line so even
though we're doing a line graph you're
not going to be seeing line a - line
joint style that sort of stuff now
there's a ton of options here and most
of these are totally self explanatory
but let's take a look at what happens if
we add another data point here so we can
add a 50 onto the end of the first data
set and we can refresh this now what we
get here is well we have January
February March April May June July and
it goes off it you can see it goes up
you can see there's more data there so
how can we increase this set well if you
scroll up you'll notice we have all of
these labels and we end up July
we can go into now and add an August
Kent and let's go ahead and refresh and
you'll notice that upon adding this it
doesn't fact instead extend our graph
further so the length of our labels here
is going to define essentially the
length of our data which is visible
let's say we get rid of all the way down
from let's go to March here no we only
have three visible let's go ahead and
refresh and you'll notice we only have
three data points visible so your labels
here are gonna be determining that
length and that's important to know if
you're ever trying to figure out why
things aren't showing up the way you'd
expect them to but as you can see here
we have our data object it contains the
data labels and data sets now fix this
indentation on screen there's no use in
watching me do that but as you can see
here we've now Dovan to a little bit of
these options and you should have a good
understanding about what all this stuff
is now what are all of the different
options you have well under every single
chart in the documentation if we select
this the first thing you'll see is data
structure now data structure isn't
referring to the data itself as in the
values but it's referring to everything
from the label to the Access ID the line
attention the background color the
border style all that sort of stuff so
everything is every one of these options
falls under the data structure section
of the documentation here so you have
access to change any of these things and
there's a nice little description about
what they are in case you need to know
and what they accept so as we dive into
more and more different styles of charts
you're gonna be able to see yourself
customizing this more and more but as
you can see with the very minimum we've
done already I mean if you pass us the
data numbers in an array and you pass it
some labels you need some values here
you have a really beautiful looking
chart without doing anything and the
rest at this point is being set through
these sort of data options here cool so
this is the data
set object in charge is you can see this
is wearing Neary spending a lot of time
customizing how your chart looks cool so
in the next video we're going to be
exploring the options that the charts
has in this particular chart is the line
chart so we're gonna be exploring the
line at chart options now as a challenge
to you I'm going to see if you can get
this chart to go down to zero right now
it's extending from 20 to 100 because
that's where our data is going but how
can we get this chart to go all the way
down to 0 so that we have some space
underneath these valleys here so these
valleys don't look like they're at the
very bottom so at the start of the next
video we're gonna cover the answer to
that challenge but between this video of
in that video see if you can get the
chart down to 0 so as always this is
Scott with little of tutorials if you
have any questions or comments become at
the video hurt me up at Twitter or
Facebook a level up tutorials I love to
hear from you if you want to watch the
