up
and I'm going to be working in Drupal a
lot more so you might see a lot more
Drupal tutorials coming in the next
month or so because usually that's how
it works if I'm working in a particular
system a lot I just have more
inspiration to do these videos for that
particular system so in the past a
couple of months here I've been working
on a large Magento site that sites going
out the door right now so I might be
pulling back a little bit on the Magento
and maybe coming to do some more drupal
tutorials however both will continue
going as well as the Android series but
I wanted to kick it back into Drupal
with something really cool and here I
have made a responsive grid for our
videos here and so you'll notice that
when I resize the page the grid stays
intact our gutter stay the same and it
it you know breaks down to this nice
list and then I pull it back out perfect
so you might be wondering how do I do
something like this with Omega well
that's what we're doing today and if
you'll notice this is a level up tuts
website which is actually is not the
site that we have up right now you may
have also noticed that level up tots has
probably put about a whole hour into the
design of our current site and it's
really because we've been spending our
time making these videos instead of
working on our own things but that's
about to change because this March is
level up tubs one-year anniversary we
want to get this site going for March
I can't guarantee it's going to be the
this current theme is going to be done
by March but you may see some tutorial
videos using this theme because you know
as we're building this there are going
to be topics that we can talk about so
here we have our drupal tutorials video
page and we're going to be building this
grid so that it's responsive using omega
so this is the end product let me show
you what it looks like before we did
this so here's our list before we did
anything fancy with it and we're using
views here to output this and this is
just our Drupal page and here's our page
description but all this stuff is a list
coming in of a lot of different tutorial
videos the drop shadows on these the
color the text this is all styled with
CSS
the styling isn't anywhere near
finalized yet but basically it's just
outputting a list nothing fancy so how
do we get this to cooperate with a Omega
here
well let's edit our view and let's add
some classes and once you see how this
is done you're really going to be
surprised at just how easy it is so we
have our fields our post or Metro title
and our body for our format for our view
we're using semantic views and then we
are showing a semantic views of fields
and I like semantic views in particular
because it really cuts down on some of
the Drupal bloat where it just adds div
upon div a pontiff and that's you know
probably my least favorite thing about
working in Drupal so now that we have
this semantic views if you don't have
this extension of this module please
install this module semantic views check
it out we have a video on semantic views
already so if you need to know how to
use it you know you can see it there so
you don't have to use a grid in fact if
you use it a grid it's actually going to
be more difficult to make this
responsive what this is going to do is
it's going to help put it in a list of
however you want and I'm going to have
it wrapped in div tags so let's click on
our settings here we're not going to
have any groupings so we don't have to
worry about groupings and we're going to
have this be a list how is it going to
be a list well it's not it's going to be
none and it's going to be known because
we're going to be wrapping every row in
a div and we have a class right now
that's just Tut teas that stands for a
Tut teaser and uh and we just have this
odd-even striping so here's where the
magic happens to get this to respond to
Omega let me go to the site and another
tab here just so you can see something
so when we have these up blocks let's
inspect one of these blocks here you can
see let's check out the code right here
it might be a little small type let's
see if I can make this bigger if you can
see this here this is grid 9 in the
class grid 9 is
giving it a couple of things so
container 12 Grund ID is giving this a
width of 880 pixels and if we scroll
down here it's giving the margin left of
10 pixels and a margin right of 10
pixels so here is our grid 9 and it's
also floating left and all this other
stuff position:relative in line okay so
but the most important stuff is the
stuff I mentioned the margin in the
width so the grid 9 is doing that let's
get out of here and let's go to our
tutorials page and I'm just going to go
to the Drupal's tutorials page and so
here we have these let's click this
blocks to turn on our blocks and well
let's turn off the blocks attempt the
grid on and you can see here's our grid
I want to have this be two columns
because that's really what makes sense
for us we can have more columns than
that but two is nice and good because
then you get a nice large image more
readable and everything so let's look at
how many columns is going to take up
it's going to take up one two three four
and then we also one two three four and
then one extra for some space so there's
a number of things we could do we could
just leave it like this and have some
extra space here or we could have some
extra space at the beginning or we could
change this overall from being twelve
columns to being sixteen columns and
that's going to be more divisible I
believe let me try to do this in my head
eight plus three well it could it could
be close I'm not exactly sure if it
would if it would work any better with
sixteen but what really doesn't matter
to me is this image doesn't need to take
up all four of these columns so if we
have this here and this goes for here
this nice little space here is going to
be okay and we can always extend this
donate button and all the stuff we're
going to have over here if we want to
but it's really not a big deal so if if
you saw in the one in the last screen
when we saw the D blocks taking up nine
columns was a grid nine you can guess
that we're going to want to set our div
to grid four okay so let's do that
and so here classroom is a group
- four and we're going to save it and
let's save our view it's telling me
everywhere that I have security update I
should probably get on that so here's
our grid and it's pretty good but look
at this is happening right here we have
this the text here isn't is going right
to the edge of our container but this is
being pushed up over and you know if I
wanted it like that that would be okay
but let's turn on our grid and we can
see it's it's not quite right so let's
inspect this and see what's going on
so if we hover over this we're seeing
that it's getting the margin on the left
and the right however this is inside a
grid already so this is inside let's
find at this grid 9 which is already
receiving the margin left on the right
so you'll notice that it's actually
going to be messing up the grid
structure it's getting pushed over too
much and it's not in line with the
columns anymore so how do we solve that
well luckily there's a nice and easy way
let's come back into our view here edit
view and we're going to add some
striping to this and it's not really
striping it's every other class and
option class so first and last a class
right here we can say every two rows
give it a first in the last so with
Omega you can have alpha class if it's
the first item in it if it's the first
item in a row and Omega if it's the last
time in the row and this alpha will
remove the margin on the left side and
the Omega is going to remove the margin
on the right side we're going to add
this to our display we're going to save
this and just like that we have an
outline we have a grid here that falls
exactly into how we would like this
perfect perfect perfect cool great so
one thing you may have noticed is that
when we scroll down and got far enough
these images also shrunk
well that's being done with CSS in fact
I just have a nice little mixin that I
wrote that all it does is have max with
100% in then height:auto and on those
images I'm applying that mixin so I'm
just saying include this d7 image and
that's just giving it a max width I have
a 100% and a height of auto and that's
allowing these to resize when our
browser window resizes and so they're
not going to get any bigger than their
container so as always this has got
little of tuts if you have any questions
or comments leave a comment the video
hits up on Twitter level up Tut's let us
know what you're thinking and thanks for
watching
