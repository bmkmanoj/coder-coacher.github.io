of Tut's and today we're to be
continuing our card flipping a CSS
experiment by finishing where we left
off so let's get to that now so to get
started what we need to do is first
create a front and a back to this card
so I can go ahead and create two divs
and one's just going to be front and one
is going to be back now this front
content can just say let's say it will
just say hello and an h1 and for the
sake of making this look alright let's
just add some styles here to card we can
say we want the color to be white and we
want the text to be aligned to Center
and let's just go ahead and make line
height the 200 pixels okay so now hellos
hanging out in the middle and it's just
on the front of our card and we have
nothing on the back so let's go ahead
and do something very similar but on the
back we can just say goodbye now we have
hello on the front goodbye in the back
and let's say what happens when we
rotate this so we have hello on the
front and goodbye on the back however
our goodbyes now really on the back end
is just on a div named back so let's go
ahead and change that let's actually
make our front and back let's have them
fill the entire card so we can do that
by saying we want the front and back
classes here we want those to also have
a width of 200 pixels and a height of
200 pixels now we also now we will also
want those to be positioned absolutely
and we want the position of that to be
with top is equal to zero and left is
equal to zero okay so these are front
and back are now position absolutely so
we'll also need a position
on our card okay so now the front back
are positioned absolutely relative to
our card here and it's looking like it's
the top left and we have goodbye and
hello essentially just sitting on top of
each other now these are getting some
weird sort of extra margin here from the
h1 the default margin from the h1 so I
can just say h1 margin just zero all
around just so it's nice and nice and
perfect in the center cool and let's go
ahead and throw this up top just to get
it out of the way we're not to look at
it okay so we now have hellogoodbye
they're sitting on top of each other and
now when we flip this over we see both
of them backwards obviously we don't
want to see both of these backwards we
don't want to see either of them
backwards so the first thing we need to
do is turn off what's called back face
visibility so back face visibility is as
it sounds it's the ability to see this
content from behind it once it's been
flipped around so let's go ahead and on
our front and back we're going to need
it to say back face - visibility and
it's going to equal hidden okay so now
with back face visibility hidden when we
hover over we don't see anything both of
our texts are gone and that's perfect
because right now back in front are just
positioned on top of each other okay now
let's go ahead and change that to do
that we want to rotate back so that back
is already reversed
Atlee when we flip over the text is also
going to be flipping over and it's going
to be essentially done reversing itself
so let's go ahead and type back
and then back what we need to add is a
rotation value to start off now we want
this to be rotated 180 degrees from the
very start now there's just one last
thing to do because we now have text on
the front in the back we're actually
going to need to pull the background
color off of this background here and
it's off of the card and we're going to
put the same background color on the
front and the back so let's go ahead and
add that there okay as you can see it
looks the exact same because the front
in the back are filling the entire
container of the card so we don't to
worry about it losing its shape now when
we hover over this you can see we get
our hello and then goodbye on hover you
hover off and it goes back to hello and
now keep in mind this is just an h1 but
you can throw anything in here this
doesn't have to be just a text like this
it can be totally images or anything
like that so let's go ahead and add an
image to the back here instead of an h1
and we can just go and make this an
image with the path of this let's make
it 200 by 200 it's a place kitten so now
when we hover over this on the back of
this card is precious little cat so now
we have hello and then this cat so
pretty much anything that you put on the
back here as long as it's filling the
size of the container is going to flip
over and function the same way like our
example so here we have this card flip
over effect and we're now flipping over
to an image perfect so our flipping
effect is now complete and because of
this you now have a playground to check
out preserve 3d you can check out rotate
y and X and we can even look at
perspective
keep in mind you need this perspective
for your container
it shows the container how far away to
look for this 3d transform and to really
get a feel about what this is going to
do go in here and play around with some
numbers
it's just the way to learn it I think so
if you follow along you should have a
working playground now in code pen that
you can go and mess with any time to
create some cool effects yourself in
later videos we're going to be expanding
on this card flipping effect to flip in
totally different directions and maybe
not just rotating over so as always this
disc I would level up Tut's if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment this video or hit us up at
Twitter or Facebook at level up tubs we
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
