down let's check out one of the best
part of any text editor is really the
extensions because what would a text
editor be if it didn't have a bunch of
great extensions now a an issue I have
with any of these text editors that
aren't sublime is that they all lack my
favorite extension which is Hayaku which
is used for CSS completion like like
Emmet but much better
so until vs code has hayaku I'm not
gonna be entirely satisfied but to be
honest I feel like that's just a
personal thing however what we do have
when we click this extensions button
right here in the far left is a complete
listing of all these extensions now this
window it's okay
it could be nicer there are some issues
with how this works and compared to
other platforms like atom it's really
nicely you can install an extension
without having to reload the application
itself if we let's say let's go ahead
and install this a beautify code in
place for es code because it makes your
code look nice let's go ahead and click
install you'll see it goes and grabs it
which is great however it presents us
with a reload button and we have to
reload and we have to reload now the
reloading isn't necessarily the issue I
have here you'll notice when we click
reload reload the window you'll be made
very apparent exactly what the promise
you'll notice we get a message here
saying it remembers the unsaved files
that's fine okay
this pops open and check it out what
happened well nothing happened to these
files but the extensions window over
here is not just showing you the one you
installed so if we click this yeah
that's great but what if we were
searching for something right like what
if I was searching for a theme so for
instance one theme I've been really
liking is this tenacious theme if we
click this you can see we get a bunch of
these tenacious ones this one has 4,000
downloads so it's definitely the one
I've been using so you can see here
looks really nice I like it a lot and we
can click this install
and this is we're gonna this is going to
illustrate the problem pretty quickly
click reload reload window and our
extension it just cleared out what we
were searching for a lot of times I'll
search for something I'll install a few
things and then wish it was coming
married back there so the reload window
and it's not great I wish it didn't do
that but it's at the end of the day it's
it's just a minor nitpick right another
addition to just installing extensions
like that we can also click this dot dot
dot and show things like show installed
extensions show outdated extensions the
show recommended extensions and popular
extensions let's see what's popular
right now you can see C sharp for visual
studio code is something people like
Python the icons we can just click
install we can go ahead and click the
install debugger for Chrome cuz that's a
really nice one we could use es lint
because love me some es lint all sorts
of stuff you can see just go on and
clicking install on a bunch of stuff
here now you may be wondering if we
install several things do we have to
reload after each one well I'm gonna
wait for this debugger for Chrome to
stop installing we're gonna click reload
and check out the status of our plugins
ok now that we have all three of those
let's click reload and see if all three
of them were officially installed and as
you can see it did in fact now it's
giving us a little bit of information
about the icons anytime vs code wants
you to know some stuff lets you know up
top here and you'll notice also
complaining about es lint right here
really this is installed es lint but
it's saying I don't have it installed
globally so it's not going to work and
that's no big deal because that's just
something if you were using es lint
normally you would know to do
let's close this but you can see all of
those were installed so all of our
extensions were installed we can now go
to show recommended extensions and see
some of the stuff that it's recommending
for us we have TS lint 4 vs code if we
select the text here it opens up the
readme just like Adam does this isn't as
nice looking let's face it but uh
you know how much does that get you
really I like when things look nice but
I would take the performance of this app
over the niceness of Adam any day the
interface for this is really not that
bad now TS lint is for typescript
there's no typescript in this project
I'm not using it currently so we can
just sort of ignore that
now what's this other icon right here
well this icon takes us directly to the
show installed right if we were anywhere
else like it click show installed and
it's gonna be right here now let's say
we hated this debugger for Chrome and
even though it took forever to install
and was a million downloads we don't
like it you can always disable it for
this particular workspace you can
disable it for always so where you could
just straight up uninstall it now you'll
disable it always if maybe you're not
convinced you need it at this particular
time and maybe you want to come back to
it you can disable it for this workspace
if maybe this particular project isn't
then it might be more more reasonable or
something like ef-1 right maybe this
isn't a JavaScript project I can come in
here and say hey disable right now and
then like anything in this application
that's gonna ask me to reload so the
reloading stuff again it's annoying it's
just part of how it is but at the end of
the day installing extensions is
extremely easy
now another gripe I have is the fact
that it doesn't separate out themes we
can always get more theme just simply by
coming in here maybe looking for theme
but you know it would be nice if
installing extensions and installing
themes was a little bit different and it
would be nice if the themes were not
just syntax themes you know sublime
doesn't really nice where they have the
themes and then they have these syntax
highlighting sort of separate from
extensions it's no biggie though that's
not anything that's ever going to get in
your way it's just a minor interface
item so these are extensions for vs code
it's not the most thrilling thing it's
super easy you can just search for
whatever you're looking for and you can
most likely find it or you can do what I
do and peruse the popular extensions and
sort of see what other people are using
to maybe get a handle
what kind of cool stuff is even out
there but if you're wondering it does
vias code have the type of plug-in
library that's something like atom or
sublime does with the exception of my
favorite package hi yaku I have found
everything that I'm looking for in this
extensions right here seriously
everything I'm looking for the
configuration has been nice and easy and
you know there's a lot of great packages
here and you can mostly find something
to do what you wanted to do as fast as
you can type it in so this our
extensions for vs code you can see I can
scroll down forever and it's never going
to run out of these extensions because
there's a ton like I said this platform
it has a large amount of users and
because of that it has a large amount of
nice extensions so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials leave a
comment and let me know what your
favorite extensions are I want to know
what you're using because in addition to
popular stuff it would be really cool to
just sort of see if there's stuff that
other people are using that I maybe
haven't found yet because is really hard
to find everything as you can see
there's just so much good stuff here so
as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials thanks so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
