up
creating our own content
and this is really cool because we
haven't done this yet we have used the
content types that exist which are post
I mean which is a page and an entry and
then a kitchen sink and the kitchen sink
of course is just one that's going to
show you all the options that bolt has
to offer however we're going to start a
real simple and it's going to be a
member profile content type so this
isn't a user this is let's say you have
a company page and a company page is
going to feature each employee and then
when you click on it that person's
employee it's going to take you to a
page where it has information about the
employee and whatever sort of stuff
you'd want to have so the first thing we
have to do is come to our sublime text
and we need to browse to the app folder
and then config in this content types
that yml and in here you'll see the
other content types we already have and
there is even this possible fields down
here to show you what possible fields
exist so instead of just copying and
pasting one of these we're gonna type
one out so we can see exactly how this
goes and so we're gonna give it a name
and let's say this is going to be people
well okay you gotta spell first and then
we're gonna do : tab for the next line
and we're gonna have the name of the
content type it's gonna be people and
next line down we can give it a singular
name which if you could guess what would
make sense it's going to be person okay
so not too bad so we have our content
type let's add some fields to it so
we're going to say it's fields : space
and then we tab over another line and
we're gonna start giving it fields so
what kind of fields do we want well we
want a first name so would say first
Under
name and then the semicolon space tab
and we want this to be what type well we
want this to be a type of and you could
look down here to see what other ones
are using and for the title they're
using a text if we scroll the way to
bottom you'll see all of our options and
of course text is what we want
there's also text area for larger text
but text is definitely what we want this
is just a name so we'll say a peer type
text enter so if you lose on this entry
they have this class of large what this
class of large does is it just adds the
field with a larger font in the text
field other classes would be wide or
narrow and you could even give it a
label if you wanted to have a different
label but since we just want this to be
a normal text field we'll just leave it
at that
hit enter backspace and then we're gonna
do less and underscore name colon type
text okay one more we're gonna have a
job and this is gonna be what type of
job they have keep in mind in a future
videos we can make a job its own content
type and then have this be able to
reference the job that exists in the
site if you wanted to get that
complicated with it if you only have
like two employees it doesn't really
matter but if you have like ten
employees or you know where there's
different job titles and then people are
going to be switching titles or
something like that you could definitely
create your own content type that is job
and one more we're going to just call
this description and this is going to be
a type text area text area cool alright
well what's next well let's scroll down
here to see what they have and they have
their fields this is a relation we're
not doing any relations here and we're
not allowing them to have any text out
of me on this so you might notice record
template
and treat dot twig and listing template
is listing dot twig let's scroll down
here to see what page uses for things
like that did you say template type
template select and they allow you to
select your own template and then
kitchen sink is using the template
select as well so we want these to be
their own pages so let's look at this we
want record underscore template and
listing template so let's type record
template and this is going to be the
template that an individual person is
going to show up on so we'll call this
person
twig and keep in mind this file does not
exist currently but it will we'll just
have to create it and for the listing
template we're going to say listing
template and this is going to be listing
dot twig and you could be wondering well
we have listing dot TWIC down here as
well how is that gonna work well you'll
see in a second and this stuff is fine
in fact listing records ten sort date
published ascending and records per page
ten it's all good so we're just gonna
leave that stuff in here as well for
this one I'm gonna fix the indenting on
this
and this stuff actually all needs to
come down a level on the inventing for
it to work
so let's there beautiful okay cool I
feeling that it's this sort of tabbed
type of document this yamo file this is
how it knows what's associated with what
so fields first name is part of the
field all these things are part of
people
so the tabbing has to be correct or us
it won't work so make sure that your
spaces and tabs is all correct and
exactly what you want it to be and
before we try this out we're going to
add one more field and that's going to
be this slug and you may have noticed
this in the pages and our entries and
we're just gonna copy this slug type
slug and since we don't have a title
it's gonna be using there let's say it's
gonna be using their last name so let's
have a bead right down here oops
paste it in here and uses last
underscore name save this and let's go
to check database and this is our
database is up to date so let's go to
view people we have no people notice how
this shows up now let's create a person
my first name last name and you can
notice that this permalink down here it
has my last name and that's being taken
care of from our slug bellow very cool
so we have a description and that's all
we need let's save this person and we
have our first person super cool so we
have a new content type we have some
content and it's all working out so in
the next couple videos we're gonna be
creating those template files for this
we're going to be creating listings and
we're gonna integrate this content type
further into our site so as always this
is Scott with love a lot of Tut's if you
have any questions leave a question or
comment in the video hit us up at
Twitter or level up tuts just let us
know what you're thinking thanks for
