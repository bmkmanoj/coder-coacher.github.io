tuts calm today i'm bringing you the
first in a series of adobe premiere
tutorials this one is going to be real
quick I'm just going to get through the
basics and everything setting up a
project and then we'll get moving from
there so because this isn't the first
the series if there's anything you guys
want to learn or if there's anything you
would like me to cover you know feel
free to let me know leave a comment and
stuff on our website and just let us
know exactly what you want to learn and
be more than happy to I also plan on
doing a series of after effects
tutorials and all sorts of their stuff
so feel free to subscribe and you know
you know give us your feedback and I'm
sure we'll have much more for you in the
future so to get started here basically
we're going to create a new project
we're gonna set up your configuration
and we're going to get going so first
thing when you launch any of these adobe
programs other way this is cs5 which is
what my after effects tutorials will be
in as well so if you don't have cs5 it's
not too different on the older versions
and I can't really think of anything
interface why's that might you know hold
you up so you should you should probably
be fine if you have a slightly older
version so this is the welcome screen
most of the adobe apps have this i
believe you can turn this off in the
preferences but I always just leave it
on at least four premiere and
aftereffects so from here we want to
just click new project this brings up
your your general and your scratch disk
new project preferences so the first
thing we want to do is a ittle location
for your project so it has its default
here it wants to put it in Premiere Pro
documents which is which is fine
although I probably keep it in documents
Premiere Pro and then let's make a new
folder it's call this tutorial
project1 okay great choose that one so
basically this is where your all your
your assets all your files are going to
live with video editing if you're using
all sorts of resources like images or
anything it's you know really important
to have everything and sort of like the
same folder group so if the project gets
moved none of those connections get lost
so once you start bringing in footage
that you're going to edit it's all going
to live within this folder and so we set
that up basically premiere makes this
really easy final cut you have to jump
through another step to do this but
premier the initial option is just same
as project so if you wanted to I mean I
don't know why you would you could have
these your footage stored somewhere else
maybe if you're working off of an
external hard drive or something but I
always just leave same as project same
as project for all of these this is
where it's going to be putting your
you're captured video you're captured a
to you your video previews your audio
preview renders so basically this title
safe area you know the defaults are fun
for this the title safe issue is an
issue where the way different monitors
and different screens about video
sometimes things go will chopped off so
they have these areas in which it's safe
for you to put your text so that there's
no way of your text getting chopped off
but that was more of a problem with
older televisions and things like that
so I used to just like this is the
defaults video display format timecode
no problem there display format audio
samples problem there capture format
this depends on what you're bringing in
if you have a HD HD camera hdv if you
have a normal camera DV for this project
since i don't have an HD camera we're
just going to use DV I'll show you more
stuff using HD video but since I don't
have an HD camera will be importing that
footage that's just premium
HD footage so project saying that's the
same thing actually tutorial project one
okay then this brings up your sequence
presets so this is what you want to be
editing and even though I i selected DV
for my input format I could have my
project to be an hdv widescreen no
problem it's just that the footage that
I be bringing in capturing wouldn't not
be HD and that I mean that works if
you're doing a lot of after effects or
if you're doing a lot of images or
anything that you're bringing and stuff
that's not necessarily captured footage
just to get going here we'll do
something later once we start working
with different kinds of footage but
we're just going to leave it at the
standard 48 kilohertz editing mode you
know this stuff we don't really need to
touch too much I always just leave the
six as a quicktime 29.97 frames per
second standard the frame size just your
typical standard resolution on the
sampling rate for your audio I think 48k
is good is fine with me at least for
most projects display format audio
samples yet we're not going to change
that so this is these are pretty much
the basics and I never really find a
need to change these too much your audio
we're going to be mixing in stereo if
you have 5.1 recorded audio then this is
where you'd want to select that so right
here is your sequence name your sequence
will show you once we get the project
going but for now we're just leave this
as sequence one it's nice to name these
to sort of keep your project organized
but for now it doesn't really matter so
we'll just leave this click OK
alright well this is your workspace and
that's it for this tutorial and the next
one we're going to go over all the
different windows here and basically
what they can do how you can change them
configure them move them around and get
your workspace working right for you you
know sorry this wasn't the most exciting
tutorial but it got us started here in
the future we're going to be doing all
sorts of stuff we're going to be doing
some editing we're going to be bringing
in footage we're going to be connecting
to After Effects projects doing
transitions effects color correction all
sorts of cool stuff so feel free to
subscribe you know let me know if you
have any questions or comments if
there's anything in particular you want
to learn once again this is Scott with
level of Tut's calm and thanks for
