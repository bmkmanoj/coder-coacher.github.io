huts and today I'm going to show you a
little bit more about theming in Drupal
and what we're going to be doing is I'm
gonna set up this project even further
so we can get our CSS or JavaScript
everything ready okay so if you
installed your theme it should be in
your sites all themes and you should see
it side by side with your Omega theme
and say I have my ST theme which is the
one I created before it's all all done
and good and then we have this level up
theme which is the one I just created
and instead of our theme you'll notice
some folders we have a seal oops we have
a CSS folder which has several different
CSS files we'll go over we have our info
file we have a logo pre process we have
process the MS snaps creat a screenshot
just a template that PHP file and file
for our templates so well we're not
going to really cover this templates
this template process pre process right
now we are going to be looking at this
CSS folder and what I'm actually going
to do is going to create a new folder
I'm gonna create a SAS folder I'm gonna
create not inside of our SAS folder I'm
going to create a jf folder and that
should be good for now and so to create
our CSS files you'll notice there's a
global CSS and then we have narrow
normal default wide and default these
style sheets are set up to be with the
media queries for those particular sizes
you'll notice that if you look inside of
these style sheets for instance if we
look at this narrow one there's no media
queries anywhere in here wrapping your
code however Omega takes care of that
basically all you need to know is that
the CSS in this narrow
file goes with your narrow view and the
global CSS file is where you define all
of your global CSS and since Omega
follows a mobile-first philosophy this
is going to be your mobile styles um in
and actually it's going to be your total
base styles and your mobile styles right
and then when you want to make changes
for a little bit wider version of the
site you go to narrow even a little bit
wider and normal default and then
default wide and these files would just
adjust the things that you need
adjusting or moving around as you go so
the very first thing since we're just
starting with our mobile theme first I'm
going to actually create a copy of this
global CSS file and I'm going to drop it
into my sass folder okay and I'm gonna
change the extension of this to be s CSS
because we're going to be using this as
our sass file okay so now we have this
we have our sass folder and we have our
JavaScript folder cool so now it's about
time I'm going to create a new window in
sublime text so for these examples I'm
going to be using sublime text - you can
use whatever code editor you are most
you know fluent in but I you know I
recommend sublime text - if you haven't
checked it out please do and so I'm
gonna actually grab this whole theme I'm
a drag it out into a my project so we
can have everything here okay cool now
instead of our J's folder I'm gonna
create a new file and it's gonna be just
let me save this it's gonna be named
script
scripts that coffee okay this is going
to be our coffee script file more on
that later when we actually need to use
it and let's go to our sass I'm gonna
create a couple of new files in here new
file and they have one that is
underscore base F CSS and I'm gonna have
another one that's going to be mix-ins
and file underscore of Nixon's dot s CSS
okay and in base I'm going to import my
mix-ins import
so I'm going to import my mix-ins into
the base and then I'm also going to
import compass into base which I'm going
to do that before the mix-ins
okay and so this is our base s CSS file
and then any sort of other documents we
want to use it's going to be bringing in
both of these okay so in our global s
CSS at the very top we're gonna do add
import and this is just going to be base
okay and you know if you need to learn
about sass let's say you don't know
about SAS check out the level up tut's
SAS tutorial series it's completely
comprehensive it's gonna tell you
everything you need to know about SAS as
far as learning SAS goes I think it's
something that can really help you
understand CSS and really make writing
it fun so go ahead and watch those
tutorials if you haven't or you can just
be editing your CSS and watching along
so here we have our SAS setup the next
thing we need to do is have our compiler
setup and we need to install compass on
this project so what I'm going to
actually do is I'm using an app called
code kit which I use frequently and I
like a lot
koke it sort of handles all of your
compiling for CoffeeScript does
minification of javascript and CSS it
does j/s hinting it's great app so what
I'm gonna do is I'm going to drag my
theme into code kit and like code kit
handles business here it is it's got all
our files I'm gonna say project or
compass use compass for this project
install compass and so images I'm gonna
him and just being an IMG folder which I
need to create sass is in the sass
folder CSS is a nice CSS folder
javascript is an 8
Jas folder okay and everything else I'm
gonna leave and I'm just click Add
Compass to project and we're all good
while I'm here I'm going to create this
IMG folder for my images cool so if
you'll notice code Kent has all of our
our scripts it can check them with
jeaious hint and it's going to compile
them in fact if I click compile right
now we're going to I don't know why I
took away from that if we check out our
J's folder we have not only a scripts
dark coffee but a script
J's folder pretty cool and now if we
compile our Styles you're not going to
see a whole lot but if you look at the
Styles you can see that global that CSS
is linked up to CSS and as well as all
these perma ones we didn't create as CSS
files for these others but we will so
now we should be all set up to use our
CSS but let's say you needed to add a
new CSS file for some reason you wanted
another CSS file well you can add that
in the dot info file this is also where
you'd be editing scripts so let's add
our script since we have this this dot
coffee by the script CAS file we want to
add those to our info file so let's go
to our the base level of our theme
you'll go to level up theme that info
let me decrease the font size a little
bit on this because there's a lot of
info here and this is basically all the
the guts info for your sub theme that
has the name description the version
which you can change here the base theme
the screenshot name so you can see all
these regions and stuff like this some
settings but if we come up here let's
scroll up up above so what we need to do
is we need to add some scripts we just
need to add our script file and then say
if we need a head another CSS file we'd
do that here too but we can write
scripts and then it's brackets equals
j/s - scripts dot jeaious and as many
script files as you need to add to your
document you can just do it here you
could add more but we just have this one
for now we might have a plugin CAS file
later once we get adding some jQuery
plugins or something but so now we
should have our scripts in our theme and
a good way to test that is to come to
your theme and if you're going to want
to clear the cache so if you're making
any modifications to your themes dot
info file you're going to need to clear
the cache we
or you see any change okay so let's
clear the cache so since we edit that
scripts file to our dot info file we've
cleared the cache if we check our source
let's search for scripts you can see
here it is right here it's added to our
site forest sites themes level up J s
scripts J S which is cool this is how we
want it because technically you could
get in into the template files of your
theme and you could just add this line
of code yourself but what that doesn't
do is it doesn't make this J s Drupal
doesn't know it's there necessarily if
you do it that way and why that's bad is
C in here if in your performance you can
aggregate all your JavaScript files
through Drupal and it's something you're
gonna want to do to make your site run a
little bit faster so add your J's files
and your CSS files through the info in
your in your sub theme and they'll show
up and Drupal will know they're there
okay so we're all set to go now if we
make any changes on our CSS in fact
let's do that real quick just so we have
something to show for it
so in our global don't see it says we're
going to say body and then background no
nutbag trace background and we're gonna
call the background we're just gonna
beat three three three it's just a dark
grey and okay we can see Compass has
compiled we're gonna refresh and now we
have our dark grey background so we're
on the start to theming right now we
have a theme we have our own JavaScript
files in here and we're ready to go a
little bit further as always if you have
any questions please leave a comment the
video or hit up on Twitter at level up
Tut's as always this is Scott and thanks
