Tut's and today we're going to be
leveling up your compass skills for a
third time today we're going to be
getting into some of the amazing mix-ins
that compass has verse css3 while
compass has many many mix-ins for css3
we're only going to be going over a
couple a couple of them and i'm going to
show you where on compasses website you
can use the documentation to learn all
of the Nixons that the css3 part of
compass has to offer so we're going to
do first is if you notice I already have
compass watching this is I'm just going
to assume at this point you know how to
have compass watcher your project if not
go back and watch the second tutorial so
we're going to go to compass - style org
and here we're going to go to the
reference now the compass reference is a
really great part of their website that
you can spend a ton of time on and there
is lots and lots and lots of things to
read here so we're going to go to the
css3 part of the compass core here on
the left and if you notice there's this
thing that says this file can be
imported using import compass slash css3
if you notice in our previous document
we already said compass import compass
so we're importing all of compass if you
just want to import compass css3 by all
means just use import compass - css3 so
what we're going to do first is we're
going to check out border radius so
border radius I mean this works just
like what you would expect it to work
like we have it previously we had a
mixin that said mixin border radius and
took the values and calculated the
border radius so this is basically the
same thing let's go to our page here
let's add a border radius to the main
div so this grad so let's add a border
radius to this to do that just like
incest you would do at include border
radius and then in here inside of
parentheses we're going to say well
let's just say 20 pixels we're going to
give this a buttery so 20
and then semicolon save check our
terminal it's overwritten everything
fine we refresh the page and this now
has a border radius of 20 pixels if we
go to our style dot CSS actually yeah
let's not say this let's go here style
sheets style dot CSS check that out so
as you can see it's adding all of the
vendor prefixes just like our previous
mixin that we had made pretty awesome
well let's say you want it to add a
border radius to only the top or the
bottom or the left of the right well
that's cool because Compass has built in
functionality for that as well so as you
can see you can sort of just paw through
these documents to to find out exactly
all the options that Compass has so
let's say we want to add a different
radius for each corner let's just do 20
pixels 5 pixels 10 pixels and then let's
try 40 pixels and we're in it save let's
check out our project see what happened
so refresh this as you can see it's gone
down it's 25 40 10 so as you can see
these things are pretty robust uh if you
go through here you can even do things
like assigning the horizontal radius and
the vertical radius for each corner so
it can get pretty wild they definitely
didn't leave anything out in terms of
being able to use this to your full
advantage here let's do something like
get rid of this gradient this webkit
gradient this one's a interesting
example because gradients are a little
different so we're going to do the this
one is under images here so under images
you'll notice that this has include
background-image:url and then this
linear gradient is inside of here if we
want to see exactly how this works
these things have often have examples
and in the examples in the documentation
they'll show you exactly how to create
various things so if we just want to do
a basic linear gradient just like you
know
something like this we can come down
here and you can find one that is just a
basic linear gradient let's make this
little bigger so let's see here let's
grab this one is a basic linear gradient
giving it two values and what that's
going to do is it's going to go from top
top left to bottom right or basically
just top to bottom and it's going to go
white to light gray so let's grab this
in our project here get rid of these so
we're going to we went from cream to
cream to so we'll keep that going it's
just to leave this and now we're going
to include a background image
parentheses linear gradient parentheses
and then we'll do cream and then cream
to save that out make sure compass does
now many errors great refresh our page
and as you can see there really it
really isn't a ton of change because it
worked correctly if we go to our CSS
you'll see that it did add all of these
gradient vendor prefixes so before even
though we made our mix-ins before
they're sitting at the top here and now
we don't even have to do that at all our
CSS gets really clean or should I say
our sass gets really clean it gets a lot
easier to navigate up basically you just
don't have all this clutter and this is
just the tip of the iceberg with compass
if you go through these documentation
online here you should be able to find a
ton of great stuff in the css3 if you
want to make sure you're using the right
includes the right mix-ins you know I'm
not here all the time just to you know
see what what other things we can do
with this so I would suggest just going
through here and learning the mix-ins
and then using them in your projects
just like you would your normal css3
properties okay well that's it for this
lesson
if you have any questions or comments as
always leave a comment on the video or
hit us up at level up tuts
at twitter we should have a bunch more
videos coming for you this week
once again this is scott and thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
