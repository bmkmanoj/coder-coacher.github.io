love tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be showing you how you can use
tomorrow's CSS syntax today with CSS
next now you can think of CSS next is
sort of like a babel for CSS where you
can use the next generation features
today and it's going to compile into
useable actual CSS so let's check it out
wording it using CSS next with post CSS
so as you can see here we're going to be
using CSS next which as it says here is
the future of CSS now you can think of
CSS next to sort of babble for CSS if
you haven't used babel it essentially is
a transpiler allows you to use es6 or
javascript 2015 or whatever you're
calling it features today and it will
essentially output usable JavaScript
that's going to be usable by browsers
today instead of future browsers so CSS
next is really the answer for that for
CSS it allows you to use the next
generation syntax for CSS now that's
pretty awesome
simply because then you're not
essentially selling yourself into a camp
of sass or a stylist or any of these
other syntaxes that aren't actually a
part of CSS and they're sort of their
own syntax you're actually getting
experience using things like variables
and properties with actual CSS syntax so
let's go ahead and install CSS next into
our project throw it in to our post CSS
processors and see it in action so let's
go ahead and let's come to our terminal
here and let's do an NPM install - I can
save - dev and it's CSS next okay and
this is going to add CSS next into our
project just like we've been doing cool
so that's done we can come to our gulp
file here and we can simply just require
VAR CSS next
equals require parentheses CSS next okay
like so and semicolon so now we can
actually go ahead and use CSS next as
our one of our processors I'm going to
go ahead and add it after autoprefixer
here and one thing you're gonna want to
notice is that I do CSS next parenthesis
and then I'm going to do some curly
brackets like so to have just an empty
object so let's go ahead and run our
gulp watch command now and let's try out
some of the CSS next syntax as you can
see we can set variables using this
colon root syntax here so it's gonna
take some getting used to it's a little
bit different than how things like sass
use CSS or anything like that so we can
say root and then the - - main color is
going to be equal to red now any time we
want to use that main color we simply
just have to wrap a var - - main color
like so we can save this and let's check
out our CSS output as you can see it is
in fact getting the background color red
and it's not outputting any of this
other at root stuff so while the syntax
might not be as necessarily as beautiful
as something like stylus where you're
simply just saying main color is equal
to a value you do have the added benefit
of it's essentially in graining these
techniques into your current techniques
so that once this syntax is in CSS then
you would be able to successfully make
that transition and you'll have practice
that way so it's essentially allowing
you to use this early syntax and get
some practice with the next generation
of CSS so you can see some of the
features here we're not going to go over
all of them but you can just head over
to CSS next dot IO check out the
features there's things like semantic
media queries where you can have a
custom media query where you're
essentially giving it a name small
viewport and then
that way your every single time you're
defining that media query then you can
just use - - small - viewport and then
that's going to be a look at more
readable media query maybe like what
you'd be used to with variables in the
CSS preprocessor and then they also have
things like media query ranges they have
things like custom selectors and there's
even a color function which allows you
to modify something using an alpha
Channel to give you sort of an RGBA I
mean if we copy this line here and let's
paste it in and let's see what it
compiles to we can do color like so and
I'm guessing this is going to be an RGB
a here we go and so here we have the red
value at 0.9% and so that would be just
sort of like the RGB a function that you
have in sass and stylist and what's cool
about this is on every single one of
these features or properties you can
come in here click on the specification
you can actually read the draft of the
specification here so it gives you a lot
of information about sort of why they're
doing what they're doing and how to use
these various next-generation CSS
properties cool so this is CSS next
using it with post CSS to give you
access to the next generation of CSS
syntax so as always this is Scott we
love love tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment in
the video below and it's a ventral to
our Facebook and a LevelUp tutorials we
love to hear from you thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
