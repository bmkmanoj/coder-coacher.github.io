level of Tut's and today we're going to
be going over formats in views before we
get started I wanted to make one quick
announcement today I launched my first
course on marketplace Tut's plus calm
and of the tutorial section it's a sass
mastery tutorial series now if you've
been following along with my sass
tutorial series and level up Tut's you
might not learn a whole lot more than
what you learned in that series
however these videos are a little bit
higher quality the video formatting the
text is a lot larger and it comes with
source code so these videos are a little
bit more in-depth they are usually about
10 minutes apiece and there's 10 of them
so if you like level up Tut's and you
want to support and you want to check it
out it's only eight dollars to purchase
the videos and then you can have them on
your computer so it's only eight dollars
so like I said if you've already watched
the sass sessions on level up Tut's then
eight you know it's no big deal but if
you feel like supporting you can throw
down eight dollars and get these videos
for yourself okay so with that all the
way let's get started with their views
what we're going to do first is we're
just going to delete this body field and
so I'm going to show you how to delete a
field right now and also reorder them so
right next to your add if you notice
there's this little downwards arrow if
you click this it's going to give you
some options it's going to ask if you
want to rearrange them so we'll click
rearrange and now you can rearrange your
your fields in the order that they'll
appear in and you can also remove them
we're just going to click remove here
and remove this field body and we'll
just leave the post date and the content
type and we'll just apply this to all of
them okay so as you can see now we just
have our title post date and type well
let's get into formats then right now
they're being outputted as an
unformatted list right now they're being
output as an unformatted list if we go
to our home page let's refresh this or
actually let's save this view so this
those things take into effect okay if we
check this out you can see that the
source code has them in an unformatted
list
they're just spans inside of divs you
know all these have classes and
everything
but it's not really anything special
let's so if we edit our view let's get
out of inspect here too so let's check
out some of the other formats to see
what we have so we have a grid we have
an HTML list which will output a ul with
allies we have a jump menu we have a
table so let's click table to see what
it gives us okay it's going to ask us
for some things you know where do we
want them aligned we'll just leave this
all you know separate you can fill this
in at your leisure you can check whether
it's sortable let's actually make these
make one of these sortable will have the
title sortable leave it ascending
default sort okay so let's apply this to
our display and as you can see it's now
outputting them as a table you can see
the label is now up top type label post
date and this one doesn't have a label
because we turned it off so let's turn
it back on right here for fields we'll
click the title and we'll just create
label and we'll just say title just so
we're going to have it here in the table
okay so if you'll notice this title here
is actually highlighted here because we
selected that this field should allow
you to sort it so let's click this to
see it sorting and now it's sorting the
other way you know you can click here so
if you want your table to be sortable
that's an easy feature in Drupal
especially with views here it's a one
click thing so if we go to our settings
under table it's going to bring you back
to these settings that you selected when
you first click table so if you ever
want to change anything you want to make
other things sortable you can always
come back here click settings and get to
that stuff now you can sort by any of
the fields so you can see this is really
nice and easy especially if you're going
to be working with tabular data so let's
click table again to change it to
something else we're going to make it an
HTML list and we'll keep it as an
unordered list you can give it a class
you can give your list of class you can
give your rows of class so it's all
great things here we save this let's
inspect these because these are going to
come out in the same way that they're
going to be on the page so what we have
here let's see if we can see this Oh
better we have a div inside of an Li our
Li is the entire little bit here so the
Li includes the title the created date
and the field type all in that and
they're just divs inside of there and
then spans inside of that so I'd say if
there's any downside to Drupal it says
sometimes it adds sort of extraneous
HTML elements to your code but it's not
really a huge deal
and you get learn to get around that
pretty quickly so let's check out a
couple more let's go to grid and grids
really great if you have like a let's
say you have a grid of images or
something I know on the LevelUp site
we're going to be having a grid of the
images of the poster images that we're
going to use for our tutorials so we'll
be using a grid view to output those
we'll keep it at 4 columns have it be
horizontal fill up the single line add
to this display so let's check it out so
we only have two items in here however
you can see they're coming in just like
this let's take off our filter here to
that make it be not just articles so we
can see a little bit more so if you'll
notice instead of clicking the rearrange
you can also click the content and in
here you can just click remove so both
things are pretty much a two or three
click process so it's not too hard to do
either I usually just do the rearrange
although that you know that's just as
fast so let's save this out and look at
it on our page so as you can see we now
have a grid here this actual grid is a
little bit wider you know we might want
to touch all this stuff up with our CSS
of course this views isn't really
handling the style of anything it's just
sort of handling the output so let's go
back to our view and we'll go over some
more things so let's say we have a let's
see how many pieces of content 1 2 3 4 5
we have 5 pieces of content here and we
only want 3 to show up but we want there
to be a pager so let's go and let's set
this to just be an unformatted list
we're just going to keep it like that
for now and apply so we want this to be
a pager so over here in our second
column you'll see that there's a pager
setting so if we see in this pager
column it's going to say use pager
display a specified number
items this is not going to use our page
or just going to display you know that
item and that's it if we want a paged
output
let's click full pager and let's click
apply to all displays ok items to
display we're going to want to display
only three before we have our pager and
you can have an offset let's say if you
wanted to start at the second one or
something what we're going to leave that
as zero okay so let's just click apply
even in our preview you can see there's
now a pager that says you know one page
two pages next last let's see what
happens if we select not full and we
select a mini pager we select this we
leave it all the same apply here we go
it's just going to have one of two in
the next arrow let's save our view so
you can see how that looks on our page
as you can see it looks just like this
we click the next arrow and it's going
to have the rest of the content come in
we go back here it is so that's cool but
when we click this next you can see it's
reloading the whole page it's impending
this you know page one to our your URL
what happens if we want to just Ajax in
the next content well views makes it
really easy for us to do that so let's
edit our view in the Advanced column
you'll see use Ajax all it's going to
take is for you to click this and set it
to yes apply to all displays let's save
it and you now have an ajax and pager in
your view that can go through as much of
your content as you like back and forth
URL stays the same we're all good okay
well that's setting up a pager and
changing your format in views in the
next lesson I'm going to move away from
views for one lesson just to show you
something new I'm going to be using imce
and imce
bridge to show you how to add an upload
image field into your WYSIWYG so this is
different than the insert image that we
did last time and I'll go over the more
specifics in that video so once again
this is Scott with level up tuts and
