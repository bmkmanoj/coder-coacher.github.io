up Tut's and today we're gonna continue
talking about drush with this basic
introduction to brush and if you're new
to the command line in general it's not
scary Russia is not scary and it's gonna
make your life way better so you don't
have to know really anything in fact you
could probably googled Rush cheat cheat
and find some good cheese cheats out
there to give you a good idea of the
most used commands just in case you
forget them while you're still learning
them but first off let's just run a
brush and then space inversion and this
is gonna tell you what version of drush
you're running since we downloaded from
github it's the master branch when I
downloaded this and we did this video
we're running version 7 so the hit drug
version you're gonna see drush 7.0 - dev
so this is the current master branch of
the brush repository and this is the
current version I have installed so keep
that in mind if you're running into some
things or something that isn't exactly
like how mine is we're running Josh 7 so
that's always something to keep in mind
- if you're running drush commands and
you're getting an error about
bootstrapping something google that
however google the line of the error
that says something more specific maybe
like P do construct like with a number
like 2002 no such file directories an
error I was getting right and if you
googled those errors in accordance ad
rush rather than this this bootstrap
error or whatever that comes up you're
gonna have more luck finding an actual
solution in fact this error that I was
having after I installed rush and I was
running database commands or something
like that it was giving me this error
and really I needed to it was because of
a disconnect between MAMP and my system
so I needed to create a symlink
and in fact if you're having that issue
if you're using map for your Drupal site
and you're getting this PDO concert I'm
gonna post a link to a blog post that
tells you two commands you run them and
your fixed
however because everybody systems
different you may be running into errors
here and there and it's hard for me to
troubleshoot all of them because like I
said everybody's systems different but I
guarantee that your issues have probably
been solved somewhere down the line if
you follow the steps step by step from
the last video then you should be good
to installed and if you have errors
Google um seek help on the Drupal forums
chances are there is somebody to help
you cool so we have drush installed
proof by me typing in brush or drive
version and seeing a version there now
let's just type in rush again and you'll
see it gives you a complete list of the
commands and anytime you're forgetting
the commands of course you can google
them but they're really right here at
your fingertips in the command line
so let's grow up I'm gonna go all the
way to the top of the list here and we
can see that at first you can actually
get help on specific commands just by
typing drush help and then the command
and then it's going to give you some
specific help you can also run brush
topic you'll see here to read more
documentation so that's great
that it has all that information
directly in here you also see there's
some global options so - D is a debug
mode where you could do a - - debug
instead if you want to type it all out -
age and help system so basically like
with most command line things you would
just type in these extra flags these
extra options and you could be getting
more information with the commands
you're running so let's see what other
commands we have here and these are the
cord rush commands and looks like you
have arc
dump back up your code files in database
into a single file our kind of restore
expand a site archive into a Drupal
website clear cache which is actually
probably my most used rush command
because if anyway you know it's worked a
Drupal for some time you know that
clearing the cache becomes a thing you
have to do all the time and actually
claim the cash with drush is so much
easier than going and clicking the clear
cache and stuff like that it's just way
faster and we could go over through all
of these but it's really worth your time
to just to go through and check them out
so even a court quick Drupal download
install serve and login to Drupal with
minimal configuration and dependencies
how does that not sound super useful I
mean there's some really great stuff
here you can get really easily full
Drupal installations downloaded in no
time through really quick commands you
can update your Drupal system and one
command you can update all of your
modules and one command you can download
and install modules you can unable
disable uninstall all sorts of stuff
just go through this list check it out
you're not going to be disappointed and
so what we're gonna do now is we're
gonna run our first rush command and of
course you have to have a Drupal site
already running so you already have to
have your Drupal site running and it has
to be up and running I haven't going
with NAMP
in fact it's one of the ones we were
building a while ago in the drupal
series browse to it I have this site
here and it's really nothing fancy at
all but I want to go to this site and
this site is located in my sites folder
and so I'm gonna navigate there right
now
and to do that in the command line you
type the command CD for change directory
well first off you have to kind of know
where you are right now I'm in my home
directory because this is usually where
you are when you open your terminal if
you type LS it's gonna show you what
files are in your directory sort of
where you are this looks familiar as my
home directory if if it's not your home
directory you can certainly get there by
navigating with this change directory so
if we do CD just change directory we can
do space and then I'm gonna go to my
sites folder there we go and now I'm in
my sites folder and I'm gonna change
directory again and this is just going
to be in this level Drupal site now keep
in mind when you're changing directory
using the CD command you don't have to
just do one level at a time you could
say CD users Scott you can do multiple
directories I'm just sort of
illustrating this slowly for people who
are not super command-line skilled or
savvy so we're now inside of our Drupal
project I can confirm that by typing LS
and you can see all your normal Drupal
stuff in fact this has got a whole bunch
of that extra stuff then install text
and stuff like that that you should
probably delete but this was just a test
demo site so now now that we're inside
of our Drupal site we can run a command
keep in mind you've run your commands
from inside of a Drupal directory okay
so you navigate inside of your Drupal
directory it can be anywhere within that
Drupal directory but now when we type
drush we can type CC space all and let's
hit enter and now it gives me the
message that all cache was cleared with
a success green arrow and if we refresh
our site you're not gonna see any
difference but the cache has been
cleared and we didn't have to go to
configuration
performance they clear all caches so I
mean of course there's easier way to do
that do that with some other modules but
dress see see all took one second notice
how we can also type drush cache clear
all and it gives us the same message
so the drush see see all and rush cache
clear partner the CCL is really just a
shorthand and in fact if we typed rush
to get all of our messages you'll see
that next to some of our commands here
we have these little short hands and you
scroll all the way up
sure enough you're going to see that
clear caches shortcut is CC so once you
learn the brush commands you can use
these shortcuts to really just speed it
up so instead of you know having to go
through all this blah blah blah you can
just tap over to your command line brush
CC all enter come back to your project
and most likely by the time you do
anything your cache is already going to
be cleared so it's great and it's really
fast and easy
so that is clearing your cache with Josh
we ran our first rush command we've got
things straightened out and you sort of
got the scoop on what drush does so in
the next video we're going to show you
how to download an able and install
modules in one second with the drush and
it's awesome it's really cool so as
always this is Scott with level of Tut's
and thanks for watching
