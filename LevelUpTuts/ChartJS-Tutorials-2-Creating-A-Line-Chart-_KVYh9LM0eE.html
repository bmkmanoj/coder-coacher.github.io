tutorials and in this video I want to
create our very first chart with charge
a s and we're going to do a line graph
so let's get going on that now now to
get started we're going to create a line
chart now a line chart is sort of a
basic chart if we select this right here
you can see what it looks like we can
hover over and get some more information
but really we just have a line with a
grid here so let's go ahead and actually
get this going now first we're going to
take some data and we're going to just
sort of customize this as we go to
actually fit the needs of what we want
to do so if we scroll all the way up
here so the first thing we're going to
do is create a canvas item we can do
that just head to our HTML let's get rid
of this hello world and we can create a
new canvas okay get rid of that extra
bracket here and if you've never used
canvas before it's essentially a drawing
surface for JavaScript it allows you
some cool vectorized stuff and really
what we just need here is an ID and a
width and a height so let's go ahead and
give this an ID we can say the ID for
this is line chart obviously with
correct capitalization okay so we have
line chart and we're going to give this
a height of let's say 400 and a width of
let's say 400 and then we have our
canvas now our canvas by default really
does nothing in fact if we head to this
page you're going to see we don't have
anything but if we inspect this page
here in this general area you'll see
that we do in fact have this block level
element right here if we can get to our
HTML when we hover over canvas you can
see that it exists right if we were to
give it a border solid you could see
that here's the boundaries right here
okay super cool let's head back and now
what we need to do is in our JavaScript
we need to first grab the chart and if
we were using Jake
you do so with the dollar sign ID my
card if you're just using straight-up
JavaScript you can do so with the
document get element by ID so let's head
to our JavaScript and in our main J s we
can say document dot get and element by
ID and inside of here we just need to
pass it a string that string of which is
the ID which we had it's line chart
okay line chart and just like that let's
go ahead and assign this to a constant
variable so we can say Const chart is
equal to and then
document.getelementbyid e now let's go
ahead and do a council that log and
let's log this chart variable and let's
go ahead and head back to our document
and let's give this a refresh you can
see we have in our council down here
let's go ahead and bump up the size of
this I'm going to open up here bump up
the size and you can see we just have
basically our canvas item here where of
course we have its width and all sorts
of stuff now what we're going to do is
we're going to take this canvas variable
and we're going to pass it into a new
chart so as you can see if we scroll
down here you can see we need a new
chart declaration and we need to pass it
in the chart itself so in here they're
using CTX for context I'm gonna keep
mine as chart just to make this a little
bit easier to read but what we want to
do is say let line chart equal to new
and then we're going to get to declare
chart now you might be wondering where a
chart comes from well in this world
we're not importing things we're loading
this script first so chart as we now
have access to chart and then inside of
main degeus so we're loading this charge
AS first and then main
jas so we're not needing some import
statements or anything like that here
but if you were doing this in sort of a
system where you're using require import
you might need to do that
okay so we have any new chart now inside
of this chart function we need to pass
it the context in this case it's this
variable chart now if we head down to
the line chart section of this
documentation you can see we declare a
new chart with the context and then have
a comma with an object where we pass in
some information so here we need a comma
an object now inside of this object we
can say type is then a then a string
which is line okay because we're doing a
line chart and we need to pass it some
data and potentially some options now
right now this data it doesn't really
exist but let's go ahead and say data :
and inside of here
let's scroll down and just plug this
data directly out of here
where they have this VAR data let's go
ahead and pull all of this out of here
we're going to talk about this a bit
more after we get this up and running
you can paste this in directly like this
but as you can see we have data is now
going to be equal to and let's get rid
of this data equals and just have an
object where we have our labels our data
sets and where we actually have our data
values down here let's wrap this up with
a semicolon okay let's check this out in
our browser now and see if we have any
errors and as you can see in getting
unexpected token parentheses so let's go
ahead and verify that everything that we
have here is as it should be you'll
notice we have a new function where
we're opening up and we say new chart we
have a parenthesis and we have a bracket
we have an open bracket we have an open
bracket and it looks like we are missing
this closed bracket on the data so let's
go ahead and have that there okay and
now we should be all set you'll notice
we have a bracket to close out the data
object we have a bracket to close out
the array then we have a bracket to
close out the overall data object and
then we have a bracket and a parenthesis
to close out
our initial object creation and function
and just like that we have a line graph
now this is pretty sweet
but we didn't do a whole lot I mean we
just kind of pasted in some scripts we
added a canvas and the main thing that
we really needed to do was say hey
create a new chart with the type of line
and here's some data labels here's some
labels and your data sets and here's
some color information too so as you can
see I mean we didn't do a whole lot
because we ended up just copying and
pasting a ton of stuff but what we're
going to do in the next video is we're
going to take control of this chart
we're going to totally customize this in
all sorts of ways we're going to break
it down this object we're going to add
some options we're going to talk about
what makes this work here and you'll
notice it's fully responsive even though
we gave it a wit so what's up with that
so how can we control the width and
height of this chart so that we can get
it to do exactly what we'd like it to do
so as always this is Scott what level of
tutorials if you want to see the rest of
these videos before they're available on
YouTube had to store that level up
tutorials calm and you can purchase
these for streaming and download access
or you can become a LevelUp pro and have
access to this entire series right now
so as always thanks for watching and
I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
