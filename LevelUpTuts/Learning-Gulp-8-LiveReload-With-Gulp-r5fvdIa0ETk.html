huts and today we're gonna take our gulp
a little bit further by triggering a
live reload now what's gonna happen is
when we're gonna save a particular file
it's going to run a task like normal and
then in that task we're going to pipe in
a live reload so that we can control
what reloads our browser and what
doesn't so keep watching we're gonna
show you that right now so the first
thing you need to do to get live reload
working is that you need the live reload
browser extension for whatever browser
you're using I'm using Chrome it looks
like this circle with the two arrows
around it and you'll notice if I try to
click it right now it's what I tell me
that it can't connect because a live
reload or a compatible server is not
running okay so make sure that you've
gotten at least this far where you have
the extension installed and you're
clicking okay and that's as simple as
just going to the extension like Chrome
extensions or Firefox plugins and just
searching for word live reload ok so
once we have that what we need to do is
then get the gulp package for live
reload now that cope package is just
simply gulp live - live reload so we can
type NPM install I know that because of
the dr.aman I have to type sudo so sudo
npm install gulp - live reload just like
that when we get entering and it's going
to go ahead and go and get that install
it and get us up and running ok so it
looks like that worked we have live
reload installed now and now we just
need to require it just like we've
required our other packages here so we
can say live reload and live reload is
going to be equal to require and if you
could guess it's the name of the package
so gulp - live reload just like that ok
so we're requiring live reload and we're
setting it to the live reload variable
so now to get live reload working
all we need to do is call this live
reload function that's all we have to do
however before live reload we'll do
anything we need to start the server so
we need to create a server and we're
gonna do that in our watch task because
this is going to run and our default
task it runs scripts styles and then
watch so after that then it'll start up
the live reload server and anytime we
save our CSS after that we can then
trigger a live reload so let's say var
server equals and then we just have to
say live reload just like that with
parenthesis and a semicolon after
because it's a function here okay so var
server equals live reload okay and now
we just want to run this same function
as a pipe after our CSS is done
compiling so in our Styles task right
here we've compiled and compressed our
sass we're checking for errors and then
we're saving it to the CSS folder now
let's add one more dot pipe and inside
of this pipe we're going to say the same
thing we had down there server it's just
gonna say live reload and then
parenthesis like that like it's a
function right so now we are triggering
live reload once all of this stuff is
done it saved our CSS and then we're
live reloading so let's try it out I'm
going to run our gulp command and
instantly you could see it's run scripts
Styles watch and it's sorted the default
and you'll notice it says live reload
server is listening on three five seven
two nine now this port is the default
port for live reload and yours will
probably say the same thing now if we
can come to Chrome all we need to do is
turn on live reload for this page by
clicking the extension right here that
says enable live reload you'll notice
that the little circle has now filled in
black it's really subtle I wish they
would make that a little bit
are obvious but the circle is now filled
in black and we should be good to see
this in action so let's go ahead and
change this background color that I have
set as an accent it's this bluish color
change something really bold it'll say
red save it and without doing anything
our page is already refreshed so let's
come back and let's make it blue and
green okay but you'll notice that all of
this is in real time I'm tabbing back
and forth as quickly as I can and you
can't even see the change happening now
this branch of this isn't very complexed
CSS it's not doing a whole lot but this
live reload is actually pretty fast so
if we come back all the way okay there
it's it's really cool that we can have
all of these things in one configurable
tool that you can use for all sorts of
stuff so this is live reload working in
gulp so check it out get going with live
reload and be blown away by how
convenient this is you can now subscribe
