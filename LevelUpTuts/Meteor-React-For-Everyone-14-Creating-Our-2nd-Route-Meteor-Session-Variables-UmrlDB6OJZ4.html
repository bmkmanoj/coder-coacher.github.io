up tutorials and in this video we're
going to explore meteor session data and
we're going to be creating our actual
second page using our main layout just
so we can have two routes to toggle
between let's get going on that now
okay so we talked about the state of
react in fact we use state inside of our
resolutions wrapper and although we only
use state for our subscription you can
use state for all sorts of things such
as like toggling things and and just any
sort of state that's going to be only
seen by the user that's using the site
at that given moment right so state is
going to be really helpful within a
component but like I said this dead
State is only within this stuff this
resolutions wrapper now meteor also has
a way to set state and it's a session
variable now meteor session variables
are great in fact when you toggle this
accounts that we've already made here
when you toggle this we're actually
toggling a session variable we can
confirm that by hitting control m and
check it out we have all this stuff here
now if we check on the right side we're
going to be singing jetsedder now
jetsetter is going to show us all of our
session variables for instance we have a
drop-down visible set to false watch
what happens when I click this it sets
to true so this is being used as a
session variable now what's cool about
session variables in meteor is they are
site-wide now session variables will
last the entire session A's users the
entire time a user is using a website
for instance if we were to refresh this
page you will see that this session
variable goes away so using session
variables is a great way to handle
things like menu toggles where you maybe
click this menu and it opens up
somewhere else and you can create your
own session variables and meteor and
access them with react so don't think
that you can't use session variables
when you're using react now let's go
ahead and show you what I mean here so
let's go ahead and first make the about
page and now let's head to routes JSX
and let's create a new route simply just
by copying this route pasting this in
here and now we can say about cool let's
go ahead and just use the about
component we're still going to be using
the main
let's come up here and import from we
had resolutions wrapper let's go ahead
and just import about from and then a
string we have the same folder and then
about JSX
okay so check it out we already have
this link in our navigation to go to
about when you click this so let's go
ahead and come sublime text and in the
side of client we'll just make a new
file just inside of the root for a
client we can just call this about that
JSX
usually I'll have a folder that's like
pages or something like that or I can
put all of my individual pages but this
is just fine here we can once again as
always import react and comma brackets
component actually you know what
I keep typing this every time but really
it's I when I really work in react I'm
always just copying this line so let's
just copy and paste this from another
one save us some time in typing right so
from here we can also copy another line
such as this export default class in our
class name so like so we can now have
this just be about okay now we want to
render return and instead of here let's
just really I'm just gonna have a div
because we need a container remember and
let's just go ahead and have a single
age one see about us okay h1 and now
let's just have a paragraph in here now
this is just going to be like this okay
paragraph inside of here I'm gonna grab
some hipster hips um and you'll notice
we have some green text here we were to
save this and head to our bout page
let's check this out you can see it's
working totally fine we're about page we
can now click resolutions about
resolutions about cool so we actually
have a working
route despite actually creating a router
so many videos ago so let's go ahead and
now let's add a button I'm just going to
say button here and button now what's
gonna be fun about this is you're gonna
get to see just how session and site
wide this is is gonna just say click me
okay and let's come back here we have
our click Me button now what I want this
click Me button to do is I want this to
toggle something on this page so we're
going to actually just toggle a value on
this page and it's literally just gonna
pop up here but it's going to show you
that this session variable is totally
site wide so let's go ahead and hand
what we can do is have an on click
function on click and equals brackets
and now we can say this that now we can
just say set var and you'll notice that
we're not having a dot bind in here
because we're not actually passing this
into this function we're not going to be
having to be using any sort of context
here we're just simply setting a meteor
session variables so now we can say set
var parentheses brackets and check it
out we can use meteor session variable
system simply by saying session dot set
and we can pass it two strings the first
string is going to be the key so the key
will be just test so the key will just
be test comma and the value is going to
be the actual value so we can just say
something like hello okay what's cool
about meteor and react is we now have
access to the session everywhere so
coming to our let's go to our main
wrapper above any of the stuff let's
just do it I'm gonna do a hyphen here
inside of my resolutions and now I'm
gonna put some JavaScript brackets in
here and you'll remember we now have
access to use JavaScript so we can
access meteor zone session system by
saying session dot get and now we simply
just need the key with
was test so we can get the session
variable test let's go back to our site
and if we head to resolutions you'll see
my resolutions - absolutely nothing we
come to about we click click me set you
resolutions now we get resolutions dot
hello now this is easily observable
within if we do control M I'm actually
gonna refresh this page so we can have a
blink you can do control them and see
there's nothing in session we click
click me and test is now saved in
session regardless of where we clicked
around here cool so this is really super
cool now let's go ahead and click this
and you'll see that we have this meteor
dialog and buttons that drop down
visible now there's actually a way to
toggle this a little bit different but
we can actually come in here and set
this variable here to whatever we want
meaning that we can set up a proxy
trigger for this login situation over
here let's say we had a homepage button
and you wanted to say I want to login to
your site and we could just basically
have that button here you'd click it and
it could open this for us
so we want to have meteor dot login
buttons that drop down visible let's go
ahead to our session variables and set
this meteor dot login buttons dot I
think it's drop-down visible drop-down
visible okay and we want to set this
value to a boolean which is true okay
and now let's change this on click to
sign up and let's head back to our site
let's give this a hard refresh because
when that meteor automatically updates
it doesn't reset the session variable so
just by doing a command R you can see it
resets s so you can imagine we're on the
home page in you sign up button we could
click sign up and it automatically
toggles us now depending on how you have
this styled you could have something
maybe that's full screen or whatever
either way we now have a button that
will take you to directly opening up the
sign up link simply by just setting a
session variable and we have seen now
that you can set session variables
across different
and even across different pages which in
reality are just different components
now session variables aren't a per user
so the cool thing about react is if you
had a text box and you were adding
resolutions and let's say everybody had
the same sort of abilities to see all of
the resolutions and I added one and you
added one we would see them both update
and real time on the screen but what's
not true about that is with sessions if
you have a session variable and you set
a session variable the only person
that's going to see that as the user
currently using this site cool so these
are session variables in meteor keep in
mind they are globally named space so if
you want something that's locked into
your component and use it reacts to
state if you want something global use
meteor session cool so we now have set
sessions and we've use sessions to set
functionality that already exists within
meteor and we've learned that you can
use control m if you're using meteor
tools which is a package we installed
earlier to have access to jetsetter that
allows you to see all of your session
variables and what they're set to nice
and easily cool so in the next week I'm
gonna show you a package by a good
friend of mine who runs the meteor chef
in this package is called Bert it allows
you to show really nice easy
good-looking error messages on your site
quickly and easily with a single package
so as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you want to view the rest
of these videos along with some content
that's not released on youtube like
server-side rendering react router
deploying your site to galaxies and
deploying your site to digital ocean you
can head to store that level up
tutorials comm and purchase that or
subscribe to stream those videos thanks
for watching and I'll see in the next
one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
