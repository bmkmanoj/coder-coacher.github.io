up tutorials and in this video we're
going to explore meteor session data and
we're going to be creating our actual
second page using our main layout just
so we can have two routes to toggle
between let's get going on that now
okay so we talked about the state of
react in fact we use state inside of a
resolutions wrapper and although we only
use state for our subscription you can
use state for all sorts of things such
as like toggling things and and just any
sort of state that's going to be only
seen by the user that's using the site
at that given moment right so state is
going to be really helpful within a
component but like i said this dead
state is only within this step this
resolutions rapper now meteor also has a
way to set state and it's a session
variable now meteor session variables
are great in fact when you toggle this
accounts that we've already made here
when you tackle this we're actually
toggling a session variable we can
confirm that by hitting control m and
check it out we have all this stuff here
now if we check on the right side we're
going to be singh jetsetter now
jetsetter is going to show us all of our
session variables for instance we have a
drop-down visible set to false watch
what happens when I click this it sets
to true so this is being used as a
session variable now what's cool about
session variables in meteor is they are
site-wide now session variables will
last the entire session A's users the
entire time a user is using a website
for instance if we were to refresh this
page you will see that the session
variable goes away so using session
variables is a great way to handle
things like menu toggles where you maybe
click this menu and it opens up
somewhere else and you can create your
own session variables in meteor and
access them with react so don't think
that you can't use session variables
when you're using react now let's go
ahead and show you what I mean here so
let's go ahead and first make the about
page and now let's head to routes jsx
and let's create a new route simply just
by copying this route pasting this in
here and now we can say about cool let's
go ahead and just use the about
component we're still going to be using
the main
out let's come up here and import from
we had resolutions rapper let's go ahead
and just import about from and then a
string we have the same folder and then
about jsx okay so check it out we
already have this link in our navigation
to go to about when you click this so
let's go ahead and come sublime text and
in the side of client will just make a
new file just inside of the root for
client we can just call this about jsx
usually i'll have a folder that's like
pages or something like that or i can
put all of my individual pages but this
is just fine here we can once again as
always import react and comma brackets
component actually you know what I keep
typing this every time but really it's I
when I really work in react I'm always
just copying this line so let's just
copy and paste this from another one
save us some time and typing right so
from here we can also copy another line
such as this export default class in our
class name so like so we can now have
this just be about okay now we want to
render return and inside of here let's
just really i'm just going to have a div
because we need a container remember and
let's just go ahead and have a single
h1c about us okay h1 and now let's just
have a paragraph in here now this is
just going to be like this okay
paragraph inside of here i'm going to
grab some hipster epsom and you'll
notice we have some green text here we
were to save this and head to our bout
page let's check this out you can see
it's working totally fine we're about
page we can now click resolutions about
resolutions about cool so we actually
have a working
route despite actually creating a rudder
so many videos ago so let's go ahead and
now let's add a button I'm just going to
say button here and button now what's
going to be fun about this is you're
going to get to see just how session and
site-wide this is is going to just say
click me okay and let's come back here
we have our click me button now what I
want this click meet button to do is I
want this to toggle something on this
page so we're going to actually just
toggle a value on this page and it's
literally just going to pop up here but
it's going to show you that this session
variable is totally site-wide so let's
go ahead and and what we can do is have
an unclick function on click and equals
brackets and now we can say this that
now we can just say setvar and you'll
notice that we're not having a dot bind
in here because we're not actually
passing this into this function we're
not going to be having to be using any
sort of context here we're just simply
setting a meteor session variables so
now we can say set VAR parentheses
brackets and check it out we can use
meteor session variable system simply by
saying session dot set and we can pass
it to strings the first string is going
to be the key so the key will be just
test so the key will just be test comma
and the value is going to be the actual
value so we can just say something like
hello okay what's cool about meteor and
react is we now have access to the
session everywhere so coming to our
let's go to our main rapper above any of
the stuff let's just do it I'm going to
do a hyphen here inside of my
resolutions and now i'm going to put
some JavaScript brackets in here and
you'll remember we now have access to
use JavaScript so we can access meteors
own session system by saying session dot
gift and now we simply just need the key
with
was test so we can get the session
variable test let's go back to our site
and if we head to resolutions you'll see
my resolutions hyphen absolutely nothing
we come to about we click click me set
you resolutions now we get resolutions
hello now this is easily observable
within if we do control m I'm actually
going to refresh this page so we can
have a blank you can do control them and
see there's nothing in session we click
click me and test is now saved in
session regardless of where we clicked
around here cool so this is really super
cool now let's go ahead and click this
and you'll see that we have this meteor
dialog and buttons dad drop-down visible
now there's actually a way to toggle
this a little bit different but we can
actually come in here and set this
variable here to whatever we want
meaning that we can set up a proxy
trigger for this login situation over
here let's say we had a home page button
and you want to say I want to login to
your site and we could just basically
have that button here you'd click it and
it could open this for us so we want to
have meteor dot login buttons that
drop-down visible let's go ahead to our
session variables and set this meteor
dot login buttons that I think it's
drop-down visible drop-down visible okay
and we want to set this value to a
boolean which is true okay and now let's
change this on click to sign up and head
back to our site let's give this a hard
refresh because when that meteor
automatically updates it doesn't reset
the session variable so just by doing a
command are you can see it resets is so
you can imagine we're on the home page
and you need to sign up button we could
click sign up and it automatically
toggles us now depending on how you have
this styled you could have something
maybe that's full screen or whatever
either way we now have a button that
will take you to directly opening up the
sign up link simply by just setting a
session variable and we have seen now
that you can set session variables
across different compose
it's and even across different pages
which in reality are just different
components now session variables aren't
a per-user so the cool thing about react
is if you had a text box and you were
adding resolutions and let's say
everybody had the same sort of abilities
to see all of the resolutions and I
added one and you added one we would see
them both update in real time on the
screen but what's not sure about that is
with sessions if you have a session
variable and you set a session variable
the only person that's going to see that
as the user currently using this site
cool so these are session variables in
meteor keep in mind they are globally
namespace so if you want something
that's locked into your component use
reacts to state if you want something
global use meteor session cool so we now
have set sessions and we view sessions
to set functionality that already exists
within meteor and we've learned that you
can use control em if you're using
meteor tools which is a package we
installed earlier to have access to
jetsetter that allows you to see all of
your session variables and what they're
set to nice and easily cool so in the
next video make sure you have packaged
by a good friend of mine who runs the
meteor chef in this package is called
Burt it allows you to show really nice
easy good looking error messages on your
site quickly and easily with a single
package so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorial so you want to view
the rest of these videos along with some
content that's not released on youtube
like server-side rendering react router
deploying your site to galaxy and
deploying your site to digital ocean you
can head to stored I level up tutorials
com and purchase that or subscribe to
stream those videos thanks for watching
and I'll see in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
