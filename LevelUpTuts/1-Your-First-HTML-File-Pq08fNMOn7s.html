tutorials and in this video we're gonna
be exploring the absolute basics of HTML
by writing our very first HTML file from
scratch so let's get started right now
with the absolute most basic foundation
you need to start making your own
website so to build our very first
website we're actually going to be using
an application called a text editor I'm
going to be using sublime text you can
get sublime text for free online and you
can use it without registering it or
without paying for it as long as you
want another choice might be atom which
you can get at atom dot io if you'd like
to follow along you can go ahead and
grab sublime text now you can work with
sublime text on Windows Mac or Linux so
if you have any of those systems that
you should be able to follow along just
fine now in addition I'm going to go
ahead and just create a folder I'm just
in my documents in a folder I have
called level up Tut's
you can create this folder anywhere
that's going to be reasonable for you
documents or sites folder or something
like that I'm just going to name it
first - site and now I'm going to simply
drag this folder into sublime text as
you can see what that does is it adds
the folder right here now over here
where it says folders we can right-click
on this folder and select new file now
we're gonna do command S or file save to
create a new HTML file now HTML which
stands for hypertext markup language is
the language for the structural web
anytime you see a website it's going to
be using HTML now there are other
languages like PHP and some JavaScript
or server-side code that can be used to
generate HTML and that allows you to
build more and more complex websites
however hTML is what the browser reads
to understand the structure of your
website along with the content so with
most websites the page that is
immediately loaded when visiting is the
index page so let's go ahead and name
our file index dot age
tml okay so as you can see here we have
an HTML file here in left and we have
this blinking cursor on the first line
now usually when working on websites
you're not going to be coding from
scratch every single time however since
this is your first HTML file or your
first website I think it's good to have
a blank HTML page so we can actually get
started and you can really understand
what's going on now the first thing we
want to do is type a less than sign and
then exclamation point and then the
words doc type with the space after then
we're going to say HTML and then we're
going to close that with a greater than
sign now this less than sign and then
greater than sign is something you're
gonna see very frequently in HTML in
fact this is how you define what's
called an element now there's lots of
elements in HTML and with the addition
of HTML 5 which is the latest version of
HTML there's even more now these things
allow you to do all sorts of stuff
mostly just define your content such as
headings paragraphs links to other pages
and now even things like video and audio
files so after our initial doctype
statement which just lets the browser
know that this is an HTML document and
it lets it know that it's using the
latest version of html5 if you've seen
HTML before in the doctype looks a
little bit different or more complex
it's most likely using an older version
of HTML okay let's hit enter and add a
new element here and this element is
going to be HTML now we can close that
like so now unlike the doctype statement
here this element actually needs to be
closed now everything that's contained
within this HTML tag right here will be
a part of this element so let's go ahead
and type less than now simply by just
hitting the forward slash key sublime
text autocompletes that for you to type
forward slash HTML and then close that
out let's put this on its own line
because everything we're typing in our
HTML document is going to be contained
between these two tags so next we have
the head element which we can't
just by typing less than head and close
it off with a greater than and just like
the HTML element we need this to be
closed like so let's go ahead and create
space in here now the head of your HTML
document is gonna contain a bunch of
information and links to files for your
site nothing in the head here is
actually gonna show up when you load
this page for instance let's have a
title tag so we can say title and let's
close that as well and in our title we
can say our first web site like so now
let's actually open this HTML file in
your browser so by selecting this file
in clicking reveal and finder or just by
browsing to this file in your my
computer my files or whatever you can
just drag this file into your web
browser now when these videos are gonna
be using Google Chrome and I would
suggest you do the same you don't have
to use Chrome to browse the Internet
normally if you don't like however
Chrome has the best options for
developer tools
although Firefox is a close second so
now we have this file open you can see
instead of a normal URL up here it's
actually linking to the file itself and
we don't have anything output on the
page
it just says our first website at the
top if you notice the title of your page
corresponds with what's in the tab of
the browser here now a nice way to see
the HTML for this page is to click on it
and select view page source it's gonna
open up a new tab that shows you
directly the HTML as it corresponds with
what we're typing so you can really go
to any website lets head do just
google.com we can right click and say
view page source now Google is going to
be quite a bit different you may not
recognize all of this stuff because it's
a some higher-level JavaScript code
however we do see our doctype HTML along
with an HTML tag and if you look closely
in here you'll even see a title tag
somewhere so if you scroll down here
yeah it's going to be a lot of
JavaScript and a lot of craziness
however you can really check out the
source on any web page that exists ok
let's head back to our first website
let's get something on the screen here
so in addition to title
we can have tags that are meta now the
meta tag is sort of different because in
your head you can have as many of these
as you'd like and they all have sort of
different functionality so for this one
we're going to say char set is equal to
utf-8 now utf-8 is the encoding of the
text on this website
now we're gonna close that off with a
greater than sign in addition these meta
tags don't need to be closed so we don't
need to have a forward slash meta after
it now there's a whole bunch of
different meta tags which we'll cover in
another video but for now we'll just
leave this utf-8 we can also link files
in our head we can link CSS files which
control how your website looks or
javascript files which control
interactivity in your website ok so
let's get out of the head for a little
bit and we're going to go into what you
would expect if we have a head we must
also have a body so we have less than
and then body and again body is a tag
that you need to close out so like so
everything that's in your body is most
likely going to get displayed on your
website now there are exceptions we can
link JavaScript files from your body as
well and some comments in your code that
are only displayed for the person
editing the code and not the website
itself we can write our first comment
simply by doing the less than
exclamation point and then two hyphens
this is a comment okay and now we wrap
that up by doing two hyphens and then
the greater than sign let's head to our
browser for a second and refresh you can
see we still see nothing however when we
refresh the index.html you do see the
this is a comment in your body now let's
go ahead and add a header tag now a
heading tag is going to be what defines
a heading on your website and headings
are special because search engines like
Google specifically pay attention to
headers to know what your page is about
for instance if we were to say h1 and
then have it like that we could say our
first website now we can close it off by
doing less than and then hitting the
forward slash so now a tag like
h-1 defines this as the first level
heading a first level heading holds most
importance over all your headings on
your entire website now there's only six
levels of headings however some of them
have a very specific purpose for
instance the h1 should be saying exactly
what this page is in fact you can only
have one h1 per page keep in mind that
the browser will let you have multiple
h1 s but it's a rule that you should
really be using one h1
just so that the search engine always
knows what each page of your website is
doing exactly so now if we save this
file we come to our browser and we
refresh you can see the source we have
our first website in the tag there and
if we refresh our actual document here
you can see in nice bold text it says
our first website and in addition to an
H tag we can also have a paragraph tag
so a paragraph is like you would expect
just any standard paragraph so they can
do less than P and then we need to close
this one as well now in between a
paragraph text we can say our first text
okay now when we head back to our
browser the font size is quite a bit
smaller and there's even some default
margin between these two right it's not
just stacking them on top of each other
we'll get into that a little bit more
once we talk about what's going on with
CSS so we now have our very first HTML
file we wrote it by hand and it's
showing up in our browser it's
absolutely nothing fancy or spectacular
but if this is your first web site this
is a pretty good accomplishment so
because we have lots to go over in the
next video we're gonna give you a brief
introduction into CSS and what it is and
why you need it in your website and then
later on get into some more advanced CSS
topics as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video heard us about Twitter or
Facebook at level up tutorials we love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
