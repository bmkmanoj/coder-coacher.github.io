Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to import and export product data
into Magento and this is super powerful
if you're one moving your Magento store
anywhere or two coming from anywhere
else where you you know have a database
export with all your products in it this
is how you can bring the stuff into
Magento and have it just filter right
through and you know just get all your
products in there in one fell swoop so
to get started all we have to do is go
to system and then import/export and
what we're going to do first is actually
export we're going to export a CSV of
all of our products and the reason I'm
going to do this is so that we have the
format that we can import our products
and if you were to have no products at
all you would still get useful
information so if you have a completely
empty products and you want to add all
your products still come and export the
CSV that way you know exactly what you
need to work with so as you can see here
it's giving you things that you want to
like filter out we don't want to filter
anything so we're just going to click
continue and we're going to see a CSV
download here and I'm going to go ahead
and open this in Google Docs and then
we'll get looking at that data okay so
here's our spreadsheet and now if you
have like if you have a Mac I know there
is some sort of issue with Excel
spreadsheets on a Mac in the way that it
encodes them so you might be getting
some errors on your Mac if you are
trying to you know have have this data
be entered from Excel so that's why I
actually typically just use Google Docs
because I know there's no issues and
it's something that you can just be
avoided so now we have these really long
descriptions and stuff like that and
here they are so that's why these these
columns are so long and tall but as you
can see going from left to right we have
all sorts of things starting with the
SKU number the store this would be like
main store effect see if we can just see
one of these ones that is a little bit
less information put in scroll down here
because I know we had at least one or
two or you didn't fill up
kind of stuff yeah see this is even
better so we have the SKU number
actually let's float this top line I'm
going to freeze this top line here
temporarily freeze Row 1 so now we can
scroll the way down here to one that's a
little bit easier to see so ok so this
is one that we made the SKU number is a
1 1 1 1 1
that's your unique number the store you
don't have to put anything in here
because it's going to default to be the
main stored attribute is going to be
what type of product it is so in this
case it's a tutorial so reason the
tutorials attributes set if you remember
we have other ones computer default keep
in mind these attribute sets have to be
created before you bring in your
tutorial or your products themselves
type is whether it's simple configurable
as you went over in the product creation
you should know about that category
again categories need to be created
beforehand you can get a third-party
module or you can even write your own to
import categories but it's not built
into Magento so you'll have to create
your categories beforehand if you have
not its root category and this is the C
this is the website of course everything
is pretty much going to go in the base
it's going on everything and then as you
see here it's pretty much what's
applicable for your product the color
contrast ratio is something they only
have four computers country-of-origin
CPU speed you obviously wouldn't need to
fill this out if you are doing a
tutorial so actually let's go ahead and
add a row here and add a row and let's
fill this information we can see this
product actually be created so let's
start at the very left and go all the
way to the right let's delete these rows
ok so I'm going to have this and the ID
is just going to be four sixes I'm just
not taking it seriously and it's going
to be
the attributes that will be a tutorials
it's going to be as simple and it's
going to be tutorials for our category
our root category is going to be root
catalog product website is going to be
base and let's just keep going over so
create it at we don't need to fill that
in it will fill in in itself description
this was imported okay
and now okay let's keep going over so
let's check out this one this is like
enable Google Checkout per product you
can do that sure
this can be an mp4 this also format has
to be one of the options because we only
have limited options so you're going to
get an error if you throw up something
we were there and now let's keep going
over it does not have any options so we
need to put a zero which stands for No
let's keep going over as you can see
that the fields that have nothing in
here are pretty much ones that you won't
need to fill in unless you have to for
that particular product like megapixels
memory so you can just skip over those
meta description I'm just going to put
imported so we can see this when we
check it out again this stuff if you
don't have it in here it's just going to
import blank use config basically we
don't want to change any settings for
this and this is the name so we're just
glad this be imported sure we'll do
block info after column just because
that's how we have it price is going to
be $50
and as you can see there's a whole ton
of options pretty much everything on
your site
this is required options none keep gone
short description and imported here
basically you have your image so the way
that you import images is let's actually
check out our project structure so I'm
just going to browse to that really
quick okay so in here we have a folder
that is media in your project and what
you're going to do is put your images
that you need to import in this media
and then we need a folder called import
so create one report you'll want to put
your images in this folder and if you
just have the image name right here as
let's say slash image dot jpg then when
you import it it's going to find this
image it's going to know what to do and
it's going to put it in the right place
in your file structure that's not
something we'll get into in this one if
you're having problems importing your
files I will make a dedicated tutorials
of that because you know it's not crazy
difficult but you know if something goes
wrong it's always nice to know if
anything you might just want to do a
quick search for whatever error you're
getting but you just need to create an
import folder have your image name in
there and let it go so status one is
going to be enabled zero is going to be
disabled we want it to be one zero for
text status and thumbnails same thing we
can have a different picture URL key
imported URL path I'm just making this
blatantly obvious exactly what it is if
you don't fill in this it's going to
just generate itself I'm just going to
copy a lot of these settings so you'll
just have to look up at the top and see
exactly what they are but it's pretty
straightforward and you can if you
already have data in here for these you
can look at them none of this stuff is
necessarily you know necessary these are
just
of configuration options we have like
you know whether it's using the
configuration the default configuration
for things but for the most part we want
to do this one if it's in stock yes we
want it in stock
like I said I'm just sort of copying
these examples the ones that are already
here but this doesn't really matter
because if you need to edit any of the
stuff later you always can or maybe you
might want to build a product exactly
how you want it in your site before you
do your import then copy it from that do
your export and then copy it from that
that way you just have these settings to
know exactly what you want them to be
otherwise 0 equals no 1 equals yes and
then you can sort of look up what they
are and determine what that answer needs
to be so I'm going to keep going over as
you can see this goes on for a long time
there's all sorts of stuff in here
keep going so what I'm going to do so
we're not reading all this stuff is I'm
just going to delete all this other data
we have in here just so I'm only
importing the new stuff let's just
delete these rows if you need to update
your stuff through that you can actually
do it that way too but let's just go
ahead and export this I'm going to
download this as a CSV because that's
what you need to upload and now we're
going to go back to Magento so now what
we're going to do is go to a system and
then import/export we're going to click
import now it's telling us our total
size of uploaded files must not exceed
32 megabytes
that's fine we're not uploading anything
so our entry entity type is going to be
products our import behavior is going to
be a pen complex data because we just
have this you know these products that
we want to append to the products where
you have and I'll go ahead and select
our CSV and you want to check this check
data this is going to look over to make
sure that you have no problems so this
is saying checked rows one checked
entries invalid rows 0 total error 0
well good we only have one row anyways
so having 0 errors on that row was a
good thing and now saying your file is
valid to start import press the import
your file was invalid it would not let
you import so let's click this
is going to go ahead and import our
product and now it's telling us that our
index is not up to date so let's go
ahead and reindex this data guys select
all first submit ok our day is now index
notes check out our catalog let's go to
manage products we can see right up here
at top is our imported product it's the
latest one and has a price it has our
quantity everything that we had in there
from the CSV so you can dive more into
that and see if you have to import a lot
of products just make sure that you have
your fields and like I said maybe create
a test product in your in your catalog
create a product as you would like to
see your products be imported and then
model that in the CSV either way this is
a pretty powerful way to import products
if you have lots of them and need to get
them in here ok so as always this is
