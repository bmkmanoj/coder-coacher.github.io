up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to do something in sublime text 3
and 2 basically I've had some comments
where people are asking how we get
proper code coloring like syntax
highlighting on certain types of
documents in fact I usually have a
proper syntax highlighting on my SCSS or
my sass files however this particular
one I've gone ahead and removed that
package now what you might notice is
that down here in the bottom right
corner of your application it's is this
is a plain text file so what we near is
a package and we need the SCSS package
now if you are using other files maybe
like CoffeeScript or maybe a handlebars
or something like that right just a
non-standard
file that may not ship with sublime text
well you're going to probably have to go
grab that package luckily I haven't
found anything that I've needed that a
package doesn't exist for so you're
gonna want to get package control if you
don't know how to install package
control we actually have a video on
level up Tut's on how to install it for
sublime text too
the process is the exact same for
sublime text 3 so 2 or 3 doesn't matter
just get package control now we're going
to use command shift P to bring up our
prompt if you're on Windows you can use
ctrl shift P and then in here we're
going to type in install and you'll see
this option package control and install
package shows up and now we're going to
look for s CSS and you can see I found
it here if I was looking for
CoffeeScript or something I would just
type in coffee most likely you're going
to find a package with the name of the
label that you're looking for now we're
just going to hit command shift P and
use the we're going to type s CSS into
our prompt here and then we're going to
use the set syntax as to s CSS now now
that our syntax is correct in the bottom
right-hand we now see it's this s CSS we
now have proper code coloring for SAS
files
so like I mentioned before it's really
fast to come in do command or control
shift P package control look for your
package maybe we're looking for
let's find handlebars there we go enter
now we have proper syntax highlighting
for handlebars that's it so as always
Cisco would love love Tut's if you have
any questions or comments please leave a
come in the video it is up a Twitter
level of Tut's on Facebook we also have
a forum at level of Tut's comm check
that out if you want to ask some
questions or just see what it's about so
as always thanks for watching I'll see
you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
