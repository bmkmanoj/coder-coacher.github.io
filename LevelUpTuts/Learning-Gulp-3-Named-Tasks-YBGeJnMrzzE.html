of Tut's and today we're going to take
our gulp a little bit further and in the
first video we created our gulp file and
we created our first task in the second
video we added in a plugin and we used
that plugin in this video we're going to
be creating a new task that's not the
default task and then we're going to
show you some cool tricks where you can
actually run tasks within other tasks so
keep watching and we're going to get
into that now so between this video in
the last I just changed the folder name
to build and we just had this default
task that all it does is it uglify is
our JavaScript and then outputs it to a
folder which is now build /j s so this
is great but uglify our JavaScript
shouldn't necessarily be in our default
task now it's nice to keep your default
tests clean and break things up into
separate tasks that way you can run them
separately or just a part of your
default gulp task now you can make tons
and tons of tasks here that do various
little things and then you can even
start and run those tasks in a specific
sequence so we're going to get started
by creating a new task and I'm going to
head I'm going to go ahead and start
this off with a comment that just says
scripts tasks and just a brief
description uglify it's saying that it
Uggla Faiz and it's going to do some
other things like later so now let's
make a new gulp dot task and this time
let's give it a name and it's going to
be the scripts so this is going to be
all things that we are going to do to
our JavaScript and just like before
we're going to have a callback that's a
function and inside of here we can
pretty much just grab our our code from
our default task and put it directly in
here so now all we have is this gulp
source it's going to find our JavaScript
files
within the j/s folder it's going to
uglify them and then it's going to
output them in the build folder so to
see this in action let's head to our
terminal
now to run this specific task all you
have to do is type gulp and then the
name of the task so we can say gulp
scripts now we hit enter and you can see
that it's started scripts and finished
it in seven point six four milliseconds
and likewise if we were to run gulp just
the gulp command without scripts it
would still work because we technically
have the same code in our our default
right here so let's get rid of that ok
and what we can also get rid of is this
callback function now instead of the
callback function what we can do is pass
it in an array of tasks that we wanted
to run once you run your default task so
we're going to make an array and then in
a string here we're just going to say
scripts just like that it's the name of
our task that we want to run if we had
extra tasks in fact let's just make an
extra task right here let's make another
one
and let's just say Stiles and this is
going to be for Stiles and this one is
simply just going to output a counseled
log for now because we're not going to
make this any more complex just for this
example but we can say counsel log runs
and Stiles
okay now we'll put a comma here and
Stiles is added to our default task okay
so now we have two separate tasks here
we have a scripts task we have a Stiles
task
both of these can be run independently
however when you just run gulp by itself
with no task name it's going to run
scripts and styles so let's see that
action by just
being in gulp and as you can see it's
run both our scripts and our Styles
tasks it even tells you the output time
for each of those individually and then
the output time for your default
function itself so these examples I'll
show you functions and tasks that you
just run once and they're done well
that's not always the case in fact you
can create a watch task so in the next
tutorial we're going to be creating a
watch task that watches certain files
and then can trigger certain other tasks
based on the change so that's something
that you'd be used to if you're using
something like Seth's watch you can
write a watch task that's going to watch
your sass for changes and then compile
it when you change that can then also
trigger something like route live reload
or all sorts of other things so you've
now had the ability to create separate
tasks which is just building upon more
of your gulp skills so keep watching
there's plenty more to learn about gulp
in the future you're going to become a
gulp master writing your own scripts
like nothing so as always this is Scott
with level up tuts if you have any
questions or comments leave a comma in
the video or hit us up at Twitter or
Facebook we love to hear from you thanks
for watching and we'll see in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
