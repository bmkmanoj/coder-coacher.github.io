up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be talking about floats now floats
our way that you can take things out of
the document flow and maybe shove them
to the left or to the right and we're
gonna be talking about some of the
common pitfalls and why you might be
using this so in this example we're
gonna be pushing our heading to the left
in our navigation to the right and our
header is going to start to look more
like what you're familiar with with
navigations and a header system so let's
get going on that right now ok so in the
last video we got our navigation started
we have some links here there's no
rollover state and there are featured
directly underneath our page title so
there's a lot that can be improved here
so let's come to our header and let's
check this out if we open this up in
here we see we have our h1 it's taking
up all of this space and we have our
navigation that's taking up a hundred
percent of the width as well we learned
before that you could make things
display inline so if we were to say
display inline you could see that the
header no longer takes up the full width
and we could maybe make the nav display
inline as well and you can see that
things aren't really working like that
so we can't just go around throwing
display:inline on everything because
it's not going to work now what can we
do especially if we want to make this
text the navigation up here on the right
side well this is where floats come in
to the picture now floats are a CSS
property that makes it layouts with CSS
a little less painful by allowing you to
float things out of the flow of the
document for instance if we were to
float this h1 to the left knee let's go
ahead and say float left you can see
that now this nav completely even though
it says it's full width if you hover
over it it still says it's full width
but it's not being affected by this h1
because this H 1 is now pulled out of
the
of the document now the nav Surtur comes
up along the side of it because it's
being refloated into the document it
does see that there's something there
it's not totally making it invisible or
anything so it hits this and it the text
itself sort of stops here although the
nav element itself shows up being as
full width well that's where we even
want the nav itself we want the nav to
be on the right side of the page we
don't want it to be but up against the
page title so let's think maybe we can
make this float right okay now we have
our text on the right side we have our
header on the left side but there's some
issues with our header here it's totally
collapsed we had our padding which is
still there 10 on 10 so the header is
only 20 pixels tall now but because both
of the children of our header are out of
the flow of the document the header now
has no content to give it any sort of
structure the header doesn't recognize
the h1 or the nav is taking up any space
so therefore it's just sort of
collapsing on itself well this is where
a technique called the clear fix comes
in now there's been all sorts of ways of
doing the clear fix over the course of
web development history at one time
people would even throw at a sort of
empty div into this header just to just
to have a clear fix now it's mostly
being used by CSS preprocessor which is
something we may get into towards the
end of this series however there is a
nice and easy solution to this that we
can go ahead and just grab from another
website now there's something called the
clear fix class so if we come to a new
tab in Google clear fix class you can
pretty much come to any of these the CSS
tricks is a great site so I mean the
first one is obviously not a bad link to
go to and you can see there's a whole
bunch of stuff here showing you how to
use clear fix it's a nice read if you
haven't read it already however what we
want to do is actually just grab this
first little bit here this first CSS
clear fix and we can come up to the top
of our document it's not something that
we're going to be model
flying we can just paste this in here
now you can go through this if you'd
like it's basically a lot of it might be
a little interesting especially because
we haven't gone over these pseudo
elements after yet however all you need
to know is that adding this class of
clear fix to a container will make it so
that that class knows to essentially fix
that collapse of the flow of the
document so like I said we're not gonna
get into the technicals right now but
all you need to know is that it this
clear fix a CSS class applying it to the
container will fix issues you have when
floating its children elements so let's
actually add that float left to our site
header in the real code instead of just
in the inspect which is temporary as you
remember and then the main nav we had a
float : right okay so once floating to
the left it was flowing to the right now
we just need to add this clear fix class
to our header now if you remember you're
allowed to use more than one class when
we talked about classes so we could just
add a space and write clear fix here so
now it's a site header and clear fix so
why the using this clear fix class it's
going to know not to collapse the left
is flip the h1 is flow up to the left
the nav is floated to the right let's
come to our page and give it a refresh
there we go so we now have our links to
the right we now have our headline to
the left and we have no collapse going
on thank you to this clear fix class so
this is a basic introduction to floats
now we're going to go over floating
things more once we get into parts of
our layout where we're having maybe a
side column or main column or things
like that however for now we do know
that floating takes things out of the
flow of the document and we need a clear
fix on the parent if we want to prevent
a collapse from happening so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
you have any questions or comments they
become in the video or hit us up at
Twitter or Facebook a level up tutorials
we'd love to hear from you thanks for
watching and I'll see in the next one
