in this video I'm gonna be showing you
the device mode in chrome dev tools now
this is going to allow you to experience
your website in a way like you'd be
using it on an actual device so let's
get going on that right now so now that
we have these tools like PageSpeed to
really see what the search engines and
platforms are you looking at on our
websites now it's time to dive into some
chrome web developer tools to really
understand how we can troubleshoot debug
and fix a lot of these items and
ultimately just have the fastest website
possible whether or not that's appearing
to be faster loading actually super fast
now the first thing I want to show is
the device view in chrome developers
tools so if we inspect this page you'll
see that in chrome we have this device
here if we toggle this device mode
you're given this new pane over here if
we refresh and you'll see that we have
the option to select a specific device
now let's go ahead and select something
like the Nexus 5 it's a good sized phone
we refresh our page and you can see that
we now have a screen that's 360 by 567
it's a Google Nexus 5 and it's in
portrait now you can see we can scroll
down like this
we have actions to touch events we can
click and drag we can do a lot of nice
things here and what's great about this
is it's really just showing you the
mobile experience if you remember in our
Google PageSpeed analysis the mobile
experience in user interface was
accounting for a lot of points and that
will affect your search engine and
performance ranking so let's actually go
ahead and make this a little bit larger
here and we have some options to a lot
of tools right so in addition to being
able to you know change portrait
navigation bar keyboard that sort of
stuff to be able to see our site in all
sorts of different ways look if we
select keyboard
and you can see that this site when the
keyboard is up at this point is really
hard to see anything right however
luckily for us there is not a lot of
typing on the site unless you're adding
your cart information and at that point
you should be able to see just fine so
now we can take this back to normal
refresh and it's all good
now what's cool here is that we also
have the option to add some network
throttling so we can say on a 3G
connection let's say a regular 3G
connection which is only 750 you could
see that this site runs and functions
pretty quickly so that's a really nice
thing that we're able to test these at
different speeds now let's actually go
ahead and just go with a even crappier
network here now if we refresh the page
you can see this time the load time
takes quite a bit longer and this image
when it popped in sort of pushed
everything down so let's refresh again
you can see something really interesting
here we get the title here and then once
the image is load it pushes down so
that's how these users are going to
experience this site and I don't know if
you've ever used a website where things
of loading and when something loads
things get pushed down and then all of
the sudden the thing you meant to click
on is no longer where you're meaning to
click on it and that can lead to some
some pretty big frustrations so this
sort of device profiling and allowing
you to select your network here can
really open up your eyes to things like
that maybe we can have a container in
here that's keeping the proper size here
so that when this load maybe we just
have space here for this image to load
rather than having the image load and
push everything down now in addition to
be able to select specific devices we
can actually increase this ourselves and
sort of see it in a responsive way and
see this as it's getting a larger and
maybe different sized devices so this is
a tablet view pretty much nine nine
eleven by five sixty seven but we could
always
to give it a specific device and nexus7
we could give it a nit nexus7 in
landscape and then you'll want to
refresh after you select the device but
as you can see we now have this 1/8 960
by 600 and what's cool is that you don't
have to have this tablet to see this or
understand that this is what the mobile
experience is gonna be like for somebody
who has a bad internet connection and is
on a Nexus 7 so this is device mode in
Chrome developer tools now it's a mostly
visual way of understanding how your
website works and loads it's not
necessarily the best for having a great
analysis of what's loading and what's
taking a lot of time but it will give
you a great idea of what the user
experience is like and that for me is a
very important thing as well so in
addition to having those metrics you
want to know what it feels like for your
users now that mobile is such an
important part of web development this
is a great way to dive in and to how all
of these devices are going to look and
feel so as always this is guide level of
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments if they come in the video hear
me up at Twitter our Facebook I love
love tutorials I love to hear from you
thanks for watching and I'll see in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
