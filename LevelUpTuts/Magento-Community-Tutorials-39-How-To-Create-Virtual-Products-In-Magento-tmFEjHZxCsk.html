level of Tut's and today we're gonna
create a virtual product and now we've
done downloadable products and virtual
products are different because with the
virtual product you're not really
getting anything right you're not
getting a set of files or anything like
that so what can be used for a virtual
product well one thing may be like a
software license right so let's go ahead
and I've first I'm going to add a new
category to our site sort of bugged me
in the other tutorial when we could not
add a you know the right category for
the T so I'm gonna do at a sub category
and it's going to be software license ok
save this and of course I forgot to
enable it so let's scroll down here and
select is active safe category now we
see it here software license cool let's
go to manage products and we're gonna do
a new product and it's going to be a
default attribute set and it's going to
be a virtual product
let's click continue and now this is
just going to be actually instead of a a
software license this can be a level up
tuts
Pro one-year account a little up touch
pro does not exist and if it did that
might not even be its real name it's
something that could be possible and
it's not going to have any text class
and it's going to be available on
catalog and search notice how just
random SKU hopefully I haven't used this
number before other than that nothing
crazy but this is really just giving a
user one year access to level up tux Pro
okay and the price for one year it was
let's just say it's a hundred bucks I
don't even know what that gets you but
I'm telling you it's worth it so I don't
have any images or anything no big deal
and
um bro okay cool and of course short
description long description you want
that to be accurate in fact in a virtual
product this may be I mean it's
important with all your products but to
make sure you have customer satisfaction
you're going to want to make sure that
they know exactly what they're getting
with this product and that they're not
expecting some you know crazy thing that
you're not going to be able to deliver
because this product doesn't really
exist in any shape or form as a physical
or digital entity and you can enable a
reoccurring profile I'm gonna save that
for another video reoccurring profile
would allow you to actually treat the
suck a real subscription and have it
automatically renew every year every
month that sort of thing so we're gonna
say no to that for now and then we're
not gonna have any gift options quantity
we're gonna say is in stock no we're not
managing stock there's infinite amount
of these and then we're gonna have this
available in the main store and in our
software license category
I shouldn't actually should be
subscriptions now whatever and then
we're not gonna have any related
products because this is something
totally unique and we can add custom
options maybe if they wanted like a pro
elite account that got you something
more which also doesn't exist so you
could of course add a custom option in
fact let's do that we can just say e
elite member and it's just going to be a
checkbox and then add new bro and this
is just going to be yes I don't know if
yes is the right word either way this is
just going to be fifty dollars more and
the price is gonna be fixed
of course crazy skew and now if they
select this yes it's going to add fifty
dollars on and they're gonna be an elite
member which apparently will get them
something additional now if we save this
we should be seeing our product on the
home page so let's refresh our account
Paige here you know see software license
with our new category we click this we
can see our level of Tut's Pro one-year
account so let's select this and keep in
mind that simply by purchasing this
product they're not getting anything
right
in fact you would have to manually as a
level of Tut's creator enable their
account that they purchased this on to
be a one-year profound in fact you might
even need a custom option that's a text
box that makes sure that they give you
their email even though you already have
it but make sure that their email that's
associated with your level of Tut's
account or something and of course I
want to be an elite member so I'm gonna
click yes I'm going to add this to my
card now I'm gonna go ahead and delete
some of this stuff out of here so we can
see what actually happens when you
purchase a virtual product because this
of course is very different than your
downloadable products or your physical
products or anything like that so let's
proceed to checkout it's a hundred and
fifty bucks yes I have my fake address
in here I hope that's alright I'm gonna
pay with check or money order and we'll
click continue place the order and it's
been placed thank you
here's your receipt and let's click your
order so let's check this out and now I
have in my orders a basically an item
that says I've purchased this one-year
account for a hundred and fifty bucks
that's my record of the account but what
do I get out of it I get nothing right I
get absolutely nothing unless the level
of Tut's website person goes ahead and
changes my account to actually be a
one-year pro purchasing a virtual
product literally does nothing in fact
that you know it's really just giving
money for something right and that
something is a virtual service or item
maybe it's a software license that has
to be gen
so then they purchased this you generate
the software license and then you email
them that license number so this is a
virtual product there is no product ha
but you're spending money on it so this
is just one instance in which it could
be useful but I'm sure you could think
it tons of others you could Google tons
others they're out there so if you have
any questions or comments leave a
comment in the video it is up at Twitter
level of tons let us know what you're
thinking
we love to hear from you all the time
it's it's great so thanks for watching
this is Scott talansky and have a good
one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
