up Tut's and today I'm gonna start a new
series and it's going to be a series
about creating a theme for your site and
it's gonna be using things like sass so
I'll show you how to integrate sass into
your Drupal installation and if you
don't want to use sass you can just use
CSS that's fine I'll show you how to
incorporate things like CoffeeScript and
really you're just going to be building
a theme from sort of scratch but it's
going to be completely responsive so
it'll look great on mobile sites it's
going to basically give you the tools
you need to create a theme pretty much
to whatever your heart desires and we're
gonna be using omega as a base theme and
what base themes do is they often
provide a set of tools or a set of
parameters that you would have in place
for a theme that you wouldn't want to
redo every single time there's several
other base themes if we look at Drupal a
project at org themes you'll see that
the first one is Zen which is a theme a
lot of people use for as a base theme as
well and you can see that the latest
version of Zen now uses html5 its
responsive has mobile first integrates s
encompass and the very second most
downloaded one is omega there's also
adaptive theme if we keep going down
there's fusion and then now we get to
these these are some sort of themes that
aren't really being used as base themes
like Marinelli
and daemon these are sort of a theme
that you would install because you like
the way it looks and maybe you want to
tweak it or something but I would always
pretty much recommend starting off with
some sort of blank slate theme and when
you install a Omega it's really just
going to give you a blank website but
what it's going to give you is tools so
if we go to my website here some of
these tools is like this debug here so
we click this grid button it's gonna
show you the grid that the site is built
on and this uses the 960 grid however
you can tweak it however you'd like
and then if we click this blocks it's
not going to show you all the different
block areas you can have some minor
tweaked a little bit but uh in Omega
there's an interface to going and
setting the width and the position and
what these blocks all are so you can
have complete control and you click this
button you can see where everything is
it gets you a little bit more of an idea
of how this sites working out
and now if I inspect this you'll see
something when I move this you'll watch
this grid adjust so it's gonna resize at
the media queries so these breakpoints
are going to be how the site resizes for
different devices mine's not doing a
whole ton of craziness other than maybe
shrinking in size a little bit but once
we take it to the mobile it changes
quite a bit let me turn off some of this
debugging stuff and so this is what the
mobile site looks like if you're coming
to it anything error then whatever I
think it might be 480 or something that
I'm not exactly positive offhand but so
these this is the sort of things that uh
megha makes really easily possible and
what you want to do in these sort of
situations we're gonna be building what
the mobile first philosophy and you're
going to be creating the theme for your
mobile stylesheet first and then we'll
move into how you can tweak it for the
next size up the next size up and you
can have as many breakpoints as you want
so if you're interested in learning how
to build a mobile site in Drupal using
Omega as a base theme please continue in
the next video we're gonna get started
by installing omega and i'll show you
how to make a sub theme okay as always
if you have any questions this is Scott
with level of Tut's and thanks for
