chap with level up Tut's and today we're
gonna level up our expression engine
skills this is expression engine to
tutorial number three we're still going
to be in the control panel and we're
going to be going over the admin menu
but before we do that there's a quick
reminder to check out our YouTube feed
our YouTube channel and please subscribe
got one subscriber right now we need
many many more so please do so know it's
happened to the tutorial so right now
I'm at my expression engine - control
panel homepage if you are not logged in
remember you just have to add admin dot
PHP and put in your login credentials
and then you'll be here - now we're
logged in we're gonna go over again the
admin menu and we're going to be
sticking to the channel administration
menu item here there's a lot going on
here so I'm going to go do an overview
of these items so starting with channels
channels and expression engine are what
content types are - Drupal and WordPress
become from that area it's just one way
to separate two different pieces of
content for example you will have
probably on your site static pages or
pages or you may also have like news
items or maybe you have you're gonna
have a staff directory on your page so
maybe a person would be a channel below
that we have channel fields channel
fields are custom fields that are then
tied to channels so in the example of
creating a person for a staff directory
section of your website I custom field
would be a first name a last name a
position title a bio an image those
would all be custom fields or channel
fields and expression engine and then
those channel fields all go into a group
and then that group is assigned to a
channel below that we have statuses and
an expression engine a status
is a way to flag a piece of content by
default with the expression engine you
have a two statuses available to you and
that is open and closed and we'll go
into those in detail but expression
engine allows you to create as many
statuses as you would see fit an example
of a status would be besides being open
and closed would maybe be like a first
draft or second draft or potentially you
could flag something as a featured item
below that categories similar to
channels and status okay so the next
item we have here is categories and
categories are a way that you can assign
category terms to channel entries
categories can have you can have parents
and parents who have children and
grandchildren and all that type of stuff
and so that is what categories are and
we'll go into that a little bit deeper
in the next video and then the final
item here is the global preferences and
we're actually going to go into this but
the items that will find in this menu
are items that are sort of rule over all
of the channels as opposed to you know
individual channel preferences so let's
go ahead and go end of global
preferences and talk through these items
here so I'm scrolling down just a little
bit and the first item that we see is
use category URL titles well before we
know what a category URL title is maybe
we should know what it is a URL title is
and a URL title is something an
expression engine that is a unique
identifier for a piece of content that
you would find in the URL address so for
example say we had a news entry and so
maybe all the entries for news would
show up in the news section of our
website
but an actual entry would be like you
know article article underscore one or
something like that so
this is a URL title for an entry but for
a category URL title what that is is
when you create your categories which
we'll do again in the next video you
will assign it a name and then you also
assign a URL title and so what that
means is if you click yes here that
means instead of having to have like an
ugly-looking
URL for a category for example right by
default it wants to put like something
like CID or something like a category ID
one like that's kind of ugly for one and
not very helpful for search engine
optimization so what you can do in
expression engine and I do this in all
my sites is I just take this yes radio
button or radio button here and then
what I'm what I'm gonna be able to do
instead of using one which is the you
know the ID for that category it's going
to put like local news and instead of
you know this it's you know it's just
sort of like category local news so you
know this is obviously a lot more SEO
friendly so definitely when you're
creating your site go ahead and hit yes
here this category URL indicator what
this means is you are defining a
reserved word category in this case and
what happens is whenever expression
engine sees this word as a segment in
your URL it then knows that it should
display the entries that belong to that
category so expression engine if it saw
this URL and I set up my template
correctly it knows because the word
category matches here it knows to only
give me in local news say you were doing
a music website category sort of makes
sense but like genre would make more
sense so then you know if you
music sigh you could say like music
category you know indie or something
like that and now we're only gonna get
you know or not category genre music
genre indie so you know what we'd get
there would be just our indie music
because that's what we have here but I
don't I'm gonna leave it on category
that's fine for us auto sign category
parents I think is probably pretty
self-explanatory when you select a child
it's gonna be automatically assigned to
the parent clear all caches when there's
a new entry posted for most expression
engine websites especially if this is
your first one this is probably fine
what happens is when you post an entry
it's gonna go ahead and just dump all
the caches for your site you know
whether that's a database cache or a
template cache or whatever it's it's
probably fine then the one of the last
items here I guess the last two items is
we have cache dynamic channel queries
what this does is this is another way
that you can speed up your site with
expression engine and that's by caching
database queries but the one caveat to
this and this is why I always just leave
it as no is because you can only enable
it if you do not use future entries or
expiring entries and what that means is
say you have an event website and
something's happening next month that's
of future entry and so if you basically
have like anything content like that
then you're stuck and you have to use
now then the last item here is the word
separator for URL titles and again what
that means is up in the URL earlier we
said news you know sample - or - news
that's what this is getting at here by
default when you start entering a post
expression engine will convert your
spaces to dashes
there the other option is underscore I
leave it on - I you know did some
research into that a while ago and
Google put out a video and basically
seemed like - is the best way to go sort
of out of the box
automatically so we did make a change
here I changed from no to yes so I'm
just gonna go ahead and submit this and
it just kicked us back to the same page
I'm gonna go back to the control panel
home page and that's where we're gonna
end for this video thanks for watching
and please watch the next one and
remember subscribe to the level up
