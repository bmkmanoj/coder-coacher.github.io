to another static tutorial by levelup
Tut's this is ben schaaf and in this
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
log into the control panel for Stanwyck
for the very first time and to do that
what you need to do is navigate to a
band PHP and once you're there you're
going to see a login box which will be
asking you to enter your username and
password but what we haven't done is
created that username or that that user
as a whole typically when you're
installing a new site that's you know
built on WordPress expressionengine
magento or any of those one of the first
steps is you know what is the username
and what is the password but because
this is static files they live on the
server flat files that live on the
server what we're going to look for is
to create our user or edit our user the
manual way so to do that we go to
underscore config and users this
actually some reason did not load there
we go having some server issues as
always so let's go ahead and take a look
at this so it's asking us for the
username and password we haven't created
it yet so I can put anything in here and
it's not going to work I could put admin
and I get this little you know message
saying that it wasn't set up and that's
absolutely right because I haven't done
anything so if we go under like I said
underscore config to users we're going
to see a sample file that we can look at
what I'm going to do is duplicate this
file and what's sort of interesting is
you know this the way that static works
is it's to make up of you know ya moul
files markdown files PHP HTML CSS and
JavaScript and them with the majority of
the files are ya know files so if you're
not familiar with that it's something to
sort of get introduced to men
one thing that's nice is it's pretty
easy to understand so let's go ahead and
take a look at this file so the name of
this file for one is called admin amo
and this is actually the username so
whatever it is you know preceding the
dot y animal is the username so in our
case the user name is in fact admin what
we need to do is set the password for
this user so I'm going to change the
first name to my name and my last name
the role here you're there an admin or
you're not in this case obviously I'm
going to be the admin and what I'm going
to do is I uncommented out this line and
I'm going to give it a temporary
password and save this file so what this
is doing is you know I you know this
doesn't look very secure right now and
it isn't but what was going to happen is
once I save this file what's going to
encrypt and salt the password making it
you know far more secure so it's quite
into admin and then do level up password
and what we might get here is a heir and
this you know this will vary depending
on you know what happens when you upload
files to your directory what this is
saying is basically you know permission
denied so that to me is very much a you
know file or folder permission issue so
let's go ahead and take a look at this
yeah it doesn't have enough promotions
I'm not really sure what it I played
with this a little bit i'm going to put
this 2777 just so we can get through it
and try to rerun this so let's go ahead
and say admin and level up and the
reason why it's actually needed to write
to that file anyway is what it what it's
going to do is it's going to like I said
encrypt that password so if I come back
in here you know here we're seeing the
password you know encrypted insulted so
you know pretty nice security all around
there
and go ahead and close that file and you
know that's it that was you know how to
log into the first time once you're
logged in you know this is the CMS
interface pretty pretty clean and
straight forward you know if you want to
change your password you know or like i
like i do i don't want everyone knowing
what my you know password was you know i
can either a you know change it right
here or I can you know do it through the
interface but what it's saying here is
and I figure this we're going to happen
while I change the permission of that
initial file what I need to also do is
change the permission on the user
directory because what you can do is
write from here you can you know create
users and you know you don't necessarily
have to do it just through the folder
directories but what you can so let's go
ahead and say go back to Adam and go to
users and so now I see myself here I can
click and I can you know crew you know
create a new password
and wine it safe remember successfully
done I'm go ahead and say my password
and that's it so that's how you log into
the first time and then once you're
logged in you can you know pretty easy
easily you know create you know
additional users so let's just let's
just do one real quick so this will be
for Scott
and I'll make him an admin my crypt is
password it's save and there we go so
now again this isn't writing to a
database so let's see what happened over
here i'm going to my users folder button
refresh it and now we have another user
so that's it that's everything i will
show you in this set be sure to tune in
next time for some more stat and make
