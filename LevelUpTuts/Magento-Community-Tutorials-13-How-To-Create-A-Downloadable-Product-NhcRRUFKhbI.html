up tubs and today I'm going to show you
how to create a digital downloadable
product for your Magento site so to get
started it's nice and easy we're just
going to go where we went before we're
going to go to catalog manage products
and then we're going to click a new
product or add product it's up here on
the top right just like before and this
is nice and easy so we're just going to
have that attribute set is being default
and if you want to see how to create an
attribute set you could check out the
previous tutorial and creating an
attribute set and let's say you have one
for mp3 you have like an audio CD or you
have a video whatever you're trying to
sell it's a digital download you can
create your attribute set specifically
for that ok so now we're going to select
product type as downloadable product and
click continue ok now we're just going
to give this the product name so let's
say you were selling an album this would
be the album's name you wouldn't have
the individual tracks here we'll get
into the individual tracks later luckily
magenta makes it really easy for you to
just create an album add your tracks and
then you can sell the tracks
individually as well if you'd like so
we'll just come up with an album name
we'll just call this you know test album
the name you can call whatever you want
and the SKU of course this is an aerial
product so just entering some numbers
here of course you want to have your
real SKU if you have a an album you
probably have a SKU number for it ok tax
class you know this is whatever it's
going to be or just select none for now
visibility we want this to show up in
our catalog and search okay that's it
for general prices this will be the
album price so let's put the album has
$9.99 and quote ok so if you'll notice
there's not a ton of extra stuff here
there's nothing crazy yet in fact this
doesn't really get totally different
until the very bottom if you notice this
downloadable information here so let's
go to images we're going to want to add
an image of course let's just grab
something from my downloads folder I was
uploaded this is an image from
the five fingers of death okay save this
and we're going to set these to be all
the same image okay and now in
description we're just going to put a
new album and of course you might want
to put the tracklist here but once we
upload individual files it's going to
have those tracklist so this is whatever
information you want it to be about this
album design we're not going to change
the design for this gift options we're
not going to touch inventory quantity
we're going to put Tomatoes just put
this as a tongue because we're never
going to run out okay and even though
it's a digital download you can still
manage your inventory so let's put this
in let's see even though this is not a
tutorial we'll put it in direct
tutorials Magento tutorials just so we
have more stuff there actually I'm going
to take it out I'll just leave it in
tutorials alone and we don't have any
related products no upsells no
cross-sells custom options we don't have
any custom options but downloadable
information here right here on your left
this is where we get to the good stuff
so you can actually have samples let's
say you want people to hear a small bit
of the trek without being able to hear
the whole thing or take the whole thing
you can put a sample here that they can
listen to maybe you have like an audio
watermark on it or something so this is
where you would upload your samples
we're just going to add links though so
the title this say let's just call this
tracks because this is going to be lets
say an album so our title is tracks
links can be purchased separately yes
they can
okay so let's add a new row in this row
we are going to say track 1 and then
what's this track we'll just let's see
we're picking a song here stars okay
that's just a bunch of audio I have in a
folder here and you can say this track
individually is $0.99 max number of
downloads is unlimited this will be like
how many times they get to download the
track
they buy it I'll just leave this as
unlimited because if you bought it then
you bought it you might as well be able
to have access to it
shareable yes or no use config yeah
you're gonna want to set this up in your
config we'll go over that but we'll just
leave it to use config and then if you
want to have a sample you can select
this if you don't you can just have your
file here or you can have them both be
the same thing let's go to music I'll
grab this song check number 14 okay and
I'm actually just going to use the same
one as a sample that way you can just
check it out
and if you look if you'll notice you you
can actually have these hosted somewhere
else on another URL if you don't want to
upload them here but if you do it's nice
and easy sorted order we're going to put
this as 0 it's going to be our first
song and we're going to upload files ok
look like that worked fine let's add a
new row let's add another track and
track 2 and we're going to call this one
let's just use cities and we're gays
same price know the United cents
unlimited ok same thing we're going to
upload ok grab this and grab this upload
your files ok so that should be enough
to get get the point across we're going
to put this as sort orders 1 it'll be
the second track now if we save this and
we should see our new product showing up
here so let's actually go to our site
and check it out I always looked at
after I save a creative project or a
product I like to just sort of scan this
page and see ok downloadable attributes
as default SKU price quantity visibility
status enabled this way you can sort of
see if something's not showing up
because if all of these are the same and
they're all showing up then that's
usually a pretty good sign and if you're
having problems with finding something
to show up that's the first thing I'd
usually check maybe you didn't click
enable or something or it's not on the
main website ok and it looks like that
isn't showing up so this will give us a
good opportunity to troubleshoot and see
what we did wrong like I said we scan
this it looks like main main website
enabled catalog and search ok so those
are some of the usual suspects for what
went wrong but the
is one more I got a check and their
inventory I noticed I put the quantity
here but I did not change the stock
availability from how to stock to in
stock so this can happen and I'd say it
sort of frequently happens if you're new
to working with Magento or even if
you're you haven't worked in a little
bit there's all sorts of stuff where one
little box can be not checked and then
it just won't work or won't show up so
check make sure your stock is enabled
make sure your status is enabled your
visit yours and the corrected visibility
and you should see it show up so we'll
refresh this page and now we have our
new album the suite picture click on
this and so you have two different
tracks one of course has a sample if we
click this sample it's going to open a
window and it's just going to play this
ok so now they can get a idea of what
this song is going to be like however if
you were to have the full track as the
sample like I did here they're going to
be able to probably download this
because this is just linking to a track
here
there's also two ways you could end up
grabbing this track let's say you could
inspect it I think the file is probably
just sitting here so I would not have
the sample B or full track maybe have it
be a 30-second loop or something just to
give the user an idea of what the song
sounds like but maybe not the entire
song okay so now we have two tracks you
can choose to buy them individually for
$0.99 if you wanted to do this you would
a you could say you know notice how the
the product is ninety nine nine dollars
and ninety nine cents we might want to
change this to be zero and then every
single track they add is is $0.99 but
let's just edit edits to our car right
now and see it's going to make us select
our options let's go back to our product
and let's fix that so let's edit and
that's downloadable information and so
here each track is $0.99 yes that we
still want them to be able to be
purchased separately however let's go
back here and let's say the general
price we're going to have this be zero
okay click Save and continue or will
delete the save and continue so we can
keep editing it if we have to now if we
refresh each track we add is going to be
a little bit more of course you can
always have it be so they have to
download the whole album if you want or
you can have individual tracks as
individual products there's all sorts of
flexibility here and Magento really
offers that and it's great that they
have this downloadable platform built
into the Magento software so if we want
to click this you can see it's in here
shopping card all's good we proceed to
checkout and it will provide the
purchaser with the links to download
okay well that's how you create a
downloadable product in Magento if you
have any questions or comments please
