up Tut's and today we're gonna finish
out cleaning up this header it's not
going to be perfect but at the end we're
gonna have a nice looking header and it
should be everything that we need it to
be so first thing we want to do is I
want to get into editing the search I
don't really like this that it has this
visible label here I'd rather just not
have that the search button I would like
it to be on the side here so let's get
started with that and in fact I'm
actually going to leave the label on the
search bar I'm just going to display
none for now we could get into the
template itself and change that but I
think that label would might be useful
in the structure of our document because
this is an input so we'll leave that
there but we'll give it a display none
so I'm going to go to our styles and
what we want to do is we want to go
inside of this search form mini inside
assert our form search and we're going
to give the label a display of none
we're going to give this input we're
going to give this a a display inline so
that the search button comes up to the
right side of it here so let's copy some
things out of here so I'm going to say
that the search bar that's inside of our
quick access so here's our CSS right
here let's just go down here and I'm
gonna say quick access just say search
the search bar it's good to come in your
CSS so you know if other people are
looking at your code it's nice and easy
to figure out what it is that they don't
have to do all this diagnostic ativ work
to sort of figure out what your what
your form is and I'm going to grab this
form search so form search and the first
thing we want to do is hide that label
so let's just say a label that label
label okay
display:none
okay and then we also wanted to say a
quick access form search and we're going
to give the input with a class of text
input text I'm going to just grab this
and put it and we're gonna give this a
display inline and your semicolon hey
now let's come back here refresh the
page cool we have our search bar that
labels gone okay what about these quick
access links let's inspect these two now
this is a list item we want this list to
be display inline one thing you can do
when you're testing out your CSS if
you're in this inspect element mode here
you can make changes to your CSS and you
can see it happen on your page it's not
going to get saved to your file but you
can see you could test some things out
so if we go to this div and we say
display inline and it doesn't it's not
gonna do anything right because this is
we're calling display inline on on the
UL it's making the UL itself in line you
can see it's not doing the desired
effect you want so you're like oh well
okay that must not be what I need so
let's click down here and let's click on
a list item so in this particular list
item we can click on it and we can try a
display inline are not initial inline
okay there we go and let's put this one
display inline as well it's basically
only adding the style to one it's
basically adding an inline style okay so
now we've got a display inline to these
two list items you can see they're right
up next to each other that's what we
want so you know that you'd have to give
a list item inside of this class links
inside of quick access a display inline
for it to show up how you want okay so
you can test everything out and then
when you refresh the page it's gonna go
right back to normal
so let's come here and then inside of
here we're going to say I'm gonna do
another comment and this is going to be
quick access links and quick access
again that links is the UL and then
we're going to say list items so any
list item in quick access is going to
also be display:inline
what display:inline does if you're not
familiar with display
I would suggest watching some of the CSS
tutorials but it's going to take these
list items that are vertically it's
going to let them be next to each other
just like this perfect great so what
what other things do we would you want
here you notice that this is sort of
crowded this is all close to the top of
the browser window here so let's go to
our header container and I'm this
element style I'm going to type padding
and I'm going to put 20 pixels and then
0 so this would add 20 pixel padding to
the top and bottom that's pretty good
let's see if it's a little bit more so
I'm going to click over here to this 20
20 pixels that I have over here I'm just
gonna hit up on my keyboard and you'll
see that this increments by 1 so if I go
all the way up to 40 that's a bit a bit
large I do like the space at the top
though so I'm gonna add a 40 padding to
the top then 0 for left and right then
20 pixels to the bottom just like this
and watch this I can actually select
this from element style here copy it and
throw it in my CSS so this is the header
header container but it's not the class
of header container it's header with a
class of container so we'll just say
header actually we should probably give
this a better class in case we have more
than one header in this site let's come
back here I'm gonna actually write a
class here in a main header okay so I
know that this is the main header some
people call this a mastitis intake main
header okay and now I'm going to paste
in that padding code that I had here as
you can see our padding 40 pixels for
the top zero left and right 20 at the
bottom save this connector page and it's
going
the same cool one more thing let's check
out these links I want them to be white
and I just want the I want the underline
to only come when you hover so I know
this is just the SS stuff but I want
this site to start looking a little bit
more respectable here so quick access
dot links Li and then the anchor tag
this needs to have a color of white and
a text decoration of none and add one
more class and it's going to be quick
access links it's so funny I'm not used
to writing CSS because I've been writing
sass for so long
and I highly suggest checking out one of
our sass courses if you've done the CSS
or you know CSS because it's so much
more efficient to write in fact I'm
writing all this you wouldn't have to
write half this stuff if I was doing
sass but for the sake of these tutorials
I'm writing a normal CSS today and here
I'm just going to add a text decoration
underline and so on hover you're going
to get this tuck decoration underline
and also I want a little bit of space
between these links so on these list
items I just want a margin in between
them so I wanted zero and then we'll
just say five pixels on the left and
right I'll refresh this okay it's a
little bit better there now too far
apart let's check this out see how wide
they need to be so now if I click over
here there's my margin five percent I
can click this and page down until they
fit in okay two pixels that's all I need
so gives it a little bit of padding
there refresh great and you'll notice
when I shrink down the site it's going
to one column so this is what you're
gonna get on your mobile browser we'll
go over exactly how to target just the
mobile browser but this is an awful for
not doing anything extra we have this
header that resizes itself our search
bar is still in the center everything
looks pretty darn good for
for not even focusing on making them a
mobile site here okay so we now have
quite a bit of a header also one more
thing let's turn this h3 and let's make
this h3 white
so this h3 is the I think it's a class
of a welcome message okay so let's go to
our CSS and now this is actually below
below the search bar welcome oh boy okay
and okay perfect
we now have just a little bit better
it's got our tagline here it's it's got
this headband this banner here on the
header this is looking pretty good and
not to mention we have this this whole
sides really starting to come together
next time we're going to be going over
the navigation and we're gonna make it
drop down navigation to use so that we
can have our categories fly out and like
a normal drop down navigation that you'd
be used to seeing on a normal site that
will pull all this content up and it's
gonna really start looking good okay
as always if you have any questions
please let us know this is Scotty level
up Tut's and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
