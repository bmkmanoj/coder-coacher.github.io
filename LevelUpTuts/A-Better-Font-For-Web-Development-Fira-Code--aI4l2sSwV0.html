level up tip I'm going to head to fira
code i'm just going to google f ir a
code and this is essentially a beautiful
open sourced mono spaced font that looks
awesome look at this thing I use this
constantly now this font right here is
so much better than anything else I've
ever used and it's free unlike some of
the other expensive sort of developer
fonts that exist and as you can see it
works with a whole bunch of stuff it's I
turn to support is coming in 3.1 so it
doesn't work there yet but it works in a
lot of editors except for sublime text
which is a huge bummer it has to do with
how sublime text does not support
ligatures but it does work in the atom
and it works in net NetBeans so any of
your webstorm any of that sort of stuff
webstorm as you can see a visual code
textmate xcode any of the good stuff
everything that's good except for
sublime text so let's go ahead and what
we just really need to do is install
this font we just need to install this
so let's go ahead and click download
so clone download download the zip
should be easy inside of this folder is
just essentially going to be a
distribution folder inside of bed we can
go ahead and just grab our OTF and you
can just select all of them and let's
install this thing super cool okay if
your code is installed now I'm going to
just show you Adam because that's what
I'm using right now and here's just a
basic react document so let's go to this
one right here so you can see some
things like we have our arrow function
here how cool this is going to be let's
head to preferences and now it's going
to be different for
every single text editor however if we
had to edit or I believe we can change
our font right down here so under a font
family we can just say
Fira code and you'll notice that I this
has two words here in fewer code and
instantly just like that you can see we
already have the benefits of these
ligatures it turned my equal girder then
into an arrow and it turned my forward
slash bracket into an actual bracket
here like this is all combined one thing
and in addition if I were to just come
to anything and let's say I wanted to
have an equals you can see when I do two
equals it combines them into one line
and when I do three equals it does this
three line equals thing and likewise if
you do a not equals exclamation point
equal equals you can see it's a slash
through I mean this is just awesome
right this sort of visual representation
looks so much better than the
exclamation point and overall I find
fewer code to be extremely easy to read
overall and just little things like that
man they just really help out when
you're developing if you want to see
what other sort of stuff exists in here
you can see exactly this conversion
table here where it's sort of showing
you what equals what right and even this
like commenting one words taking this
sort of HTML style exclamation point
comment and having the line go through
it I mean that's just awesome it's it's
it like turns your actual code things
into the syntax it turns them into
symbols really and it just makes
everything easier to parse so I highly
recommend fewer code it's a mono spaced
font with programming ligatures couldn't
be any cooler install it get it going in
your text editor whatever you'd like but
I highly recommend it one of my favorite
things that I use thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one I hope you found this quick LevelUp
tip to be super helpful I'm gonna hope
to be pumping out a lot more of these
whether it's
little things like Fuhrer code or just
little things that make my workflow
easier
so if you see fewer code in any of my
videos or you came from another one of
my videos to this video this is it right
here
github.com thanh sky Tomsky Fira code as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video hurt
me up at Twitter or Facebook and I level
up tutorials I'd love to hear from you
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
