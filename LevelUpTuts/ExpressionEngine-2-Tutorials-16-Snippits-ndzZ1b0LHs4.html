tuts i'm back from a little break i has
a having some hardware issues and i got
a new microphone so coming at you better
than ever hopefully i want to thank
everyone that's been watching so far and
encourage you guys to as always
subscribe to our youtube channel so you
can get updates when we post them also
feel free to follow us on twitter at
level up dots in this video I'm search
are gonna be like a three-part video and
I'm going to cover snippets global
variables and embedded templates we're
going to start with snippets and then in
and then as each video goes on i'm going
to explain sort of the advantages of
each one of those functions and in the
last video sort of we have a good
summary here so this would be sort of
quick tutorials but i think it's a good
thing to do here so um in
expressionengine to alice labs
introduced snippets and the idea of a
snippet is you know you can point sort
of any piece of content that you want to
repeat throughout your expression engine
site so for example here we're looking
at you know this the doctype HTML head
hope you have the page title obviously
there'd be style sheets in here the body
and maybe the header you know maybe like
your navigations here as well well this
is something that you're going to repeat
on every single page in an effort to
make this more manageable you don't want
to have to put this you know if there's
a change to have to edit this in every
single template so what you want to do
is extract it to in this case is snippet
and I'm going to go ahead and show you
how to do that so then when you do need
to make a change you just go to the
snippet edit it there and it's going to
change it you know wherever that snippet
is included so for the first step for a
snippet what we do is I'm just going to
cut out this piece of text that I'm
repeat I'm going to cut out this and
I'll just leave this cursor blinking
year and I'll open up a new tab and
we'll come back to it so to create a
snippet you go design templates and then
right here snippets it says that there's
none created that's true the Risen right
now and it also right here this is
important anything can be included in a
snippet it could be an expression engine
tag variable PHP one thing to note that
is if you use PHP in a snippet you need
to make sure that that template that
you're embedding it in has PHP enabled
and actually you know what i'll to show
you that as well so let's go ahead and
say create new snippet we'll call it
header and I'll just paste that in and
just so it's cool we can verify this is
working we'll just a snippet and do that
all right so i'll say so i'm calling it
a header someone say update and finished
and now the worst has snippet syntax
we're just going to highlight this i'm
going to go back to that oops you know
what I guess I could accidentally close
that template I'm gonna go back to the
index template for our home site our
home page and put in header here go
ahead and hit update oops I don't even
have the home page open alright so
nothing looks different but if I view
the source we're seeing there we go
there's a snippet so that's how you
include a snippet now again one thing
that I mentioned was you could put
anything inside of a header so it can be
an expression engine tag it could be if
you're using third-party modules some
expression engine I'm third-party ma
module markup can go in there and
additionally PHP so i'll show you real
quick what i was talking about so if you
include PHP it
in one of your snippets so maybe I want
to say like no no no HP echo and I'll
just echo this welcome to thing I guess
so if I say welcome to and go of it
heading over here it's that's gone now
Ben you just said that anything can go
in there including PHP well what we
first need to do is any template that
you want to run PHP in we need to
actually tell through the preferences
for for that template that PHP is
allowed so if i go ahead and change this
to yes hit update and refresh now it
prints it because PHP needed to be
enabled um so there you go that's a
snippet all right well thanks a lot for
watching this tutorial stay tuned the
next one we're going to cover is global
variables they are sort of similar to
what we just covered with snippets but
there's a right time and place to use
them and I'm going to explain that in
the next tutorial thanks a lot for
watching and again please subscribe to
