up tutorials and in this video we're
going to be showing you the most basic
example for routing we're going to be
routing between one static page and one
page that's dynamically injecting
another template so let's get going on
that right now so if your meteor app is
not already running you can go ahead and
run it now we should really only see
this there is no route for path and then
the forward slash because we have no
breaths
we have nothing really set up we created
these a couple of templates here this
home lay on the main layout but there's
nothing telling anything to use them so
of course our meteor sites just looking
at index dot HTML and all it's seeing is
this so how do we want to proceed about
building routes what we want to do is
create a lib folder so we can do new
folder Lib now at the root of our now
within that folder let's go ahead and
create a file and I'm just going to name
this file routes J s ok so here we have
our file that we're going to use for
routing so let's go ahead and make this
happen right so to use flow route or
really what we have to do we just have
to use the route method of flow router
so we can save flow router dot route now
inside of these parentheses now here we
can pass it in the actual path so I'm
just going to say forward slash now I
can have a comma a curly bracket and
open and close close that up for the
semicolon now inside of here we can do a
couple of things this is where we're
going to be adding some properties to
this object here along with an action
that's going to tell meteor to render a
specific template so here we can say
name colon and let's give this a name
the name is just going to be home
that way we can refer to this route by
its name if we would like we can say go
home and it's going to know to use this
route as home now next we need an action
now this is what's going to happen once
we hit this route we can use this syntax
where we simply just have parentheses
and then open in close curly brackets
like this and this is going to run this
function and this is going to use this
action now we can simply say
a blaze layout dot render and we're
going to then pass it in the name of the
layout this is the home we want to use
the home layout wrap that up with a
semicolon so this is basically saying
once we hit this route path then render
this template since this template is not
expecting any other zones or anything
like that if we head back to our site of
course because this is meteor you should
see this is already up and running we
have this organize your meals we have
the sign-in box we have the my recipe
book we have everything up and running
here okay so now let's actually go ahead
and create another route here let's go
ahead and create our route that's going
to be using this main layout however
we're going to need a template to
actually throw into this main layout so
inside of this file here I'm going to
make this this better don't worry about
this for right now we're going to break
all this out into their own files but
just to show off this routing we can do
template name and let's just go ahead
and name this test for right now and we
can say hello not with the W though okay
cool so we can say hello to let you know
that this layout is going to be thrown
into this dynamic template tag now I put
this in the same file it like I said
it's just temporary however putting this
in this file does not have anything to
actually do with this layout where we're
going to be defining the connection
between these two templates is going to
be in our route itself so let's jump
back to our routes and let's go ahead
and add another route
now this route can be defined basically
the same way so what I'm going to do is
just copy this last line so we don't
have to type all that boilerplate sort
of stuff and we can just give this a a
test route here it's a test and once
again we have an action now this action
can this time instead of just taking one
file what we can do is to say take the
main layout main layout like so and
we're going to want to enter something
into the main area if you remember we
named this area we named it
main so to do that we can just simply
say comma now we have an object and now
we need the name of that template area
which is main and then colon now we're
going to pass it a string this string is
going to be the name of the template we
want to render into that layout so we
want to render the test capitalized
template into this layout so we can do
that just simply by pasting in tests so
now with this route when we visit this
forward slash test we should be able to
see the main layout template with the
words hello with cap exclamation points
in it so we have our one route here now
if we do forward slash test ENTER you
can see we have this hello with the
exclamation points we still have our
header everything is working just as we
would expect okay cool so we have just
defined our first two routes we have
officially able to take a layout throw
some stuff into that layout as well as
just render a plain old page now in the
next couple of videos we're going to be
diving into more of this stuff we're
going to be actually creating our recipe
we're going to get started on our
collections adding our schema and
everything like that so as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments if I come
