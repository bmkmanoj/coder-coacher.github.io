tutorials and today I'm gonna show you
when I consider a game-changing plugin
for sketched 3 by Mattei heuristic who
is an engineer at Facebook
now Binet has been using sketch to do
his layouts but after you've been
working for a while and that your
content changes it's not always easy to
have to go back and modify your design
as the content changes so he created
this plugin that allows you to use CSS
rules including flexbox properties to
control your sketch layouts now this
means that you can write some CSS in
sketch now it's a little bit different
no hyphens and stuff like that we'll go
over but it allows you to do one key
command and have your design snap to
those CSS rules it's really super cool
so let's check it out right now
so to get started we're gonna head to
our sketch tool box
by now you should have that and we're
gonna search for sketch flex layout so
here we have the sketch flex layout I
think you'd have page pulled up and I'll
leave that in the description of the
video so you can check that out as well
and read the readme a little bit so
let's go ahead and click install and
let's get going on a new sketch project
here ok so just like that it's already
installed
that is why sketch toolbox is one of my
favorite tools and now let's come here
to sketch and let's make a do document
I'm just gonna click OK to this and
let's add a new artboard I'm just going
to select a pretty standard iOS device
let's just do an iPhone ok so here we
have this artboard that's 375 pixels by
667 and let's go ahead and set a
background color so I'm going to check
this box and we're gonna make this
something dark just so we have some work
to play around with now inside of our
artboard we can make some shapes here so
let's give this a try let's make our
very first object here let's just make a
rectangle and I'm just gonna make a
rectangle with some border radius to it
so let's just grab a rounded rectangle
here and let's just drag it
and I'm gonna get rid of the borders and
make the fill not totally white here
just close okay now with this flex
layout looking you can actually write
CSS in your sketch up now we have this
rectangle we can just name this as this
is just going to be the container now
the name can be whatever you'd like
however after the name we can add what
you're used to with like CSS class names
so we can say we have a space between
this and the name by the way
we have period and let's just name this
container so a period container okay I'm
actually going to copy that text so we
can use it in a second
so we have this container now let's
figure out how we can write some CSS to
go ahead and modify this container so
I'm gonna create a new text layer just
by hitting T and then I'll drag it off
the side of the artboard here and let's
go ahead and paste in that period
container and I'm gonna change the color
here because you can see it's white make
it black nice and easy to see let's zoom
in on this
okay I'm also gonna make this a mono
spaced font because that seems like it
would make this easier to read as code
okay so we have this monospaced font
don't worry about it being only 12
pixels this isn't going to get output so
it doesn't need to look great
so another way of the style is correct
let's just type period container just
like that make sure it matches the class
you've given your layer and now I'm
gonna go ahead and do an open curly
bracket and a closed one go between it
enter and a tab over give it some space
now see we can reference this particular
container on our artboard now with CSS
now there's some things to know about
the CSS that you're going to be using in
this let's head over to the github page
for the rules okay so if we scroll down
we can see that there are supported
properties listed here so the support
and attributes are with type men Whitman
height next with max height left right
so all of this stuff here in addition to
simplex box layout stuff that's going to
come in super handy in a second now we
can see that it's using camelcase not
hyphenated so normally where you'd have
margin - bottom all in lowercase we now
have margin with no spacer - and capital
B for bottom okay
and in addition there's no units so if
you want to have 400 pixels you've just
typed 400 and shortcut rules are not
supported so you can't just type
margin:0 0 50 you have type margin
bottom 50 and you can only use classes
so no IDs or elements or something like
that and no nested styles so this is a
very pared down version of CSS but
you'll find it's still super handy to
have inside of sketch because you can
find yourself writing rules and always
having your document reflow to those
rules so we want this rectangle to be a
header of sorts so let's go ahead and
give it some size we're gonna go ahead
and say that this is height
and then : and we could say 50 semicolon
space tab now we can say it's going to
be wit now since there's no units we're
working with an artboard size of 375
let's come here and just make this 355
that way we know we can have margin left
see I almost did ah - there we can have
a margin left of 10 pixels and that's
gonna put us in the center okay so let's
get out of that so for this to work now
we have to do some we have to do a
couple of things we have to first change
the title of the Styles layer to be apt
style sheets so you can see it here I'm
gonna go ahead and copy it directly here
just so I know there's no spelling
errors and I'm gonna paste it in as the
title of this layer now I'm gonna make
sure nothing is selected right I've
clicked off here if you have this layer
selected it's not going to work so you
click off entirely and now we do the
shortcut which is going to be ctrl
command L now what you've seen is this
rectangle all the sudden snap to some
things if we select it you can see it
has a 50 pixels tall it's 3 955 pixels
wide and has a margin left of 10 pixels
now if we wanted to give this some space
at the top we could always just say
margin top 10 as well click out ctrl
command l and there goes it snaps right
to it and you can notice we can even
change some visual properties like we
can change the border radius and things
like that and it's not going to affect
anything that we have in our CSS so
let's say this is going to actually act
like a container not just a rectangle
what we want to actually have is instead
of this being a rectangle we want to
have it be a group so I can hit command
G when I have this layer selected and we
see we now have a folder with the
classic container let's go ahead and
make this rectangle now let's rename
this this rectangle to something like a
row
so now we have a rectangle named grow
inside of the container I'm gonna hit
command-d on this to do play a couple
times or three yeah a couple times and
then I'm gonna get rid of this copy at
the end of here having anything after
the class name that's not going along
with the class will mess you up okay so
we now have three rectangle it's another
name container the only thing that's
important is this class at the end here
this dot row now for this container we
want to have a height just 20 pixels
short of the artboard itself so this is
667 tall we can make the height now 647
and that's going to spread all the way
just do about the bottom okay and we're
gonna have the width be 355 that's just
fine margin left and margin top are
still good now I'm gonna add a space
after this closed curly bracket I'm in
at a new class in its dot row and in our
row we're gonna make each of these items
in our row with 355 so they're gonna
extend the entire width of the container
now we can give them each a margin
bottom of 10 pixels and so what we're
gonna be essentially doing is spacing
these rows out vertically within this
container now let's go ahead and select
off of there and let's do ctrl command l
once more and you can see our objects
have sort of disappeared so we haven't
defined a height for them so they're
getting this height negative one let's
come back into our row and let's give
them a height of 50 now if these rows
were also containers themselves and had
items with Heights inside of them then
the row would have collapsed to the
height of the objects inside of it but
since there's nothing inside of it we
have to define a height so I've selected
off and do command control L no it's
more
you can see without doing a whole lot we
now have three evenly spaced rectangles
here now we can do a whole lot with we
can move this around we can change this
like this and they're all over the place
we select off do command ctrl L once
more and it just snaps it back so this
is really super helpful because as
allows us to set rules for our document
that we can always make sure are being
maintained now let's go ahead and do
something a little bit different
so before we mentioned that if we had
this row and it was a folder itself just
like the container when you have objects
inside of it
so I'm gonna go ahead and delete those
to do a command G on this we now have a
row which I'm going to rename just row
just to avoid confusion of having
everything name container and inside of
here I'm going to take this square here
I'm gonna name it
BG okay so this layer itself is going to
define whatever the background of its
container is by naming it BG the plugin
knows to use this layers color and
essentially the background properties to
be used as the background for this dot
Rho now dot Rho is getting its width and
height from the CSS not from the BG
itself so if we once again do command
control L you'll notice nothing has
changed and if we change this BG to be
any sort of other color or something we
change it to be red we do command
control L you'll notice it doesn't
change back to anything so we now have
this background and if we say give me a
height of 100 instead of 50 command
control me deselect that command control
L so while it is changing the group
itself it's actually changing the
background to act like the background of
an HTML element right so the background
is going to take on the properties of
its kin
so instead of here we can add more
things right so let's go ahead and just
add a circle and it's just going to be
I'm gonna hit Oh 4 oval and let's make a
circle here we have this gray circle I'm
gonna get rid of the borders all right
it looks just like this and I'm gonna
put it inside of our row
now I'm gonna rename this and this is
just going to be photo and the class is
going to be dot photo I'm not clicking
the my CSS and we do dot photo right
some properties and here we can give
this a width and a height let's say with
it's going to be 40 and height is going
to be 40 so it's going to be a perfect
circle here and it's going to we have a
margin left of 10 semicolon just like so
okay
all right I'm going to click off here
now let's do command ctrl L and you can
see this is snap to the top left some
things I also have to do a march on top
of 10 or let's come out of here and we
can just come right into our row and do
a padding and we can say padding of 10
overall actually let's even do padding
of 20 okay now command ctrl L and you
can see this is padding with 20 on both
sides now because we have an object
inside of this folder let's see what
happens when we get rid of this height
so no more Heights before when we had no
height and nothing inside of it it
collapsed now if we do command ctrl L
you can see it goes to the size of its
container okay so we're just scratching
the surface of some amazing things you
can accomplish with this plugin so keep
watching and we're gonna show you how to
how to flex bucks to these layouts to
truly create some flexible layouts in
your designs as always this is our level
up tutorials if you have any questions
or comments leave a crime in the video
radius I've been twitter or facebook at
level up tutorials we'd love to hear
from you thanks for watching and we'll
see you in the next moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
