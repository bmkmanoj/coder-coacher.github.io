up tuts and today I'm bringing you your
third CSS tutorial we're going to go
over background so if you want to add a
background of things it's really
important it's something they use all
the time so what I'm going to do first
is I'm going to wrap these into div so
just like this I'm going to wrap it with
the div of with the class of wrapper
alright cool
and then just close this out here
alright cool so let's say we want to add
a background of this right now our
paragraphs have these alerts I'm gonna
go ahead and get rid of these yes okay
and I want to go in here I'm going to
give this text a text color of white and
our wrapper is going to be black
so let's come back and get rid of this
stuff dot wrapper is going to have a
background color of black you could also
do if you wanted we're just going to
have this feed black because why not if
it's black it's black and we're going to
give this age one a color of white and
then this paragraph tag a color white
and now when we save this we go to our
HTML we should see that the text is
white and then this wrapper is div
that's surrounding this is black let's
say you wanted to add an image to your
background I'm going to add an image and
it's going to be the background for this
whole white thing so our body so in in
this and our CSS here we can just say
body brackets and then we're going to
give this a background - image okay just
like background - color background -
image here you have to specify a URL how
we do that is URL and then parentheses
and then
needs to be the path to your image so in
quotes here I'm going to do B since
we're in the CSS folder or doing dot bad
a forward slash and then IMG and then
we're going to pick an image and let me
just drag this into our images folder
here so you can see this is just this
level up tubbs square I'm going to throw
this in here this is our image cool so
I'm going to copy this file name because
it's nice and long I don't have to
retype it and now I'm going to paste
this right here and what we should see
is we should see this image tiling at
just completely filling up the page so
let's refresh our page here and when we
see we see the image unscaled tiling
across the page
it's pretty awesome but what if for
whatever reason we only wanted this
image tiling horizontally well you can
do that you can do that really easily
right here in background image you can
say repeat - X and this is going to
repeat only the x coordinate
well that's really easy all we have to
do is that a new property background
repeat' and then in here we can say
repeat X and X is just the x-coordinate
so it's going to be horizontal and here
we are
it's just repeating horizontally also
repeat Y is going to just repeat
vertically and then you can also do no
repeat now it's just there once so
that's pretty cool now you know how to
tell an image for your background you
can use anything let's say you even just
had some it like color with noise it's
just it adds a nice texture to your
background if you don't want to
necessarily have a loud image I mean I
wouldn't recommend using an image like
this because it's totally obnoxious but
it's just for an example right it's easy
to see it's repeating so what if we
wanted to be able to write all of this
stuff this background image background
repeat' I mean it seems a little
redundant or writing background repeat'
background image well what you can do
with some properties in CSS they have
some like parent properties right so if
we get rid of this background image
let's just delete this whole line right
here we're now saying the background has
a URL of this and then right after the
parenthesis we can actually say
no-repeat we save this let's go to our
document it's not going to change also
if we just say like we had before we can
repeat X there we go so background
actually contains a few things
background contains background color
background image background repeat'
background attachment and background
position background position is really
useful to change and move around the
image if you only want a certain part of
your background image this is super
useful for doing a technique called CSS
sprites which we will get into later
background attachment is how you decide
whether the
background image is fixed or Scrolls
along with the rest of the page we don't
really have an example to do that
because we don't really have enough
content but really the values the
default value is scroll so the
background Scrolls with the website you
can also say background attachment fixed
and it's going to fix it so you scroll
everything but the background of the
page okay so that's just background
attachment background repeat' is the
same thing we already did here
background image and background color so
the order is color image repeat
attachment position so if we wanted to
specify a color here as well we could
say let's say blue because it's really
nice-looking so we're going to say blue
URL is this and then repeat X so now
everything else that isn't repeated with
the image is going to be blue that's
really great I mean this is doesn't look
great but let's check out what it does
when we actually use the same color as
this purple so right here into the
single blue we're going to put in a hex
value and it's 5 2 4 7 6 3 this is the
level up Hutt's purple now if we go to
our page and refresh it you can see
there's like no difference here so yeah
even if we only had one of these here we
hit let's say we have no repeat again
not that doesn't look too bad because
here we have this it's not super
obnoxious as the same color it blends
right in so this is background if we
even wanted to attach more things at the
end like a background position or an
attachment you could you could just type
it in right after this repeat and you
can have this to anything if we want to
add a paragraph background we could say
background for this paragraph is going
to be red let's refresh this page and
all the paragraphs are going to have a
red background ok well that's the
background background image background
color and all the other background
properties in CSS once again this is
