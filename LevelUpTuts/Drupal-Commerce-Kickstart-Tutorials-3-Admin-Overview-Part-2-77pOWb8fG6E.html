tuts and today we're gonna continue our
admin overview of commerce kickstart 2
and we're going to start with store
settings so the store settings are where
you going to find the settings that are
related to the things that are your
store and how it functions so we have
you can see M product settings we have
our categories you could also get to
these by doing product and categories
there's a setting subhead so you know
that it's sort of related to subheadings
and variation types that was our our
content types if you remember these
categories were our taxonomy promotions
that we can get to our discounts and
we'll go over how you create these but
just know they're in here and you could
click add a discount and go investigate
this for yourself in the meantime we
also have customer profiles so customer
profiles these are our customers who
have made an account on the site when
they've purchased we can check out our
sample customer who has an address in
France and that's that's cold so if we
wanted to create a customer for a
customer let's say they're having
problems you could create a profile here
add their shipping and billing
information for them and that way they
don't have to do it if they're having
problems so your service providers and
service providers are sort of
third-party things that can really
enhance your site you can see that
commerce pay leap is a payment provider
as well as a commerce hosted PCI Kyla is
for shipping methods giraffe is for
analytics we saw that earlier when we
clicked on reports and it just told us
to sign up for giraffe we also have
another payment provider we have yatta
site optimizer and payment provider
which is paypal pay flow or PayPal
Express and now PayPal pay flow her
payments advanced that serve and handles
credit card processing like behind the
scenes so your customer would just click
you know charge credit card type in
their information and they would never
know they were using PayPal or PayPal
Express is you click purchase and it
takes you to PayPal site so let's come
back here
so under store settings we also have a
shipping and these are types of shipping
methods free shipping Express standard
we'll go over those more taxes is we're
going to where to set up your tax rules
now Tex rules can get a little bit
complicated but we'll make sure we set
these up in future lessons we have
payment methods so right now we have
enabled payment methods which is the
kickstart example payment and this is
just in here so you could test out
buying something and we have these other
ones that you can just wait we will set
up will definitely set up PayPal we
won't probably get to set up to PayPal
payments Pro because I don't really want
to pay for an account for this but
you'll get the idea setting up a payment
is pretty great they they sort of just
walk you through everything so checkout
settings here this is going to go over
the order in which your checkout
settings happen so first is checkout
it's asking for shopping cart content
account information billing information
next is your shipping and then your
review order then they pay and then you
confirm the order you checkout and then
that's it notice how you can drag and
move any of these just like normal
Drupal interface stuff and you can
disable them some of what you would not
want to disable there's also checkout
rules and we're going to go over these
rules are pretty complex so these are
going to take a lot of understanding but
you know luckily this makes it pretty
easy for us to accomplish some you know
complex things
so under currency settings right now
enabled currencies it's just the US
dollars you can enable other currencies
if you would like line item types we
have it right now we have three line
item types as a product shipping and
fixed item discount so line item type
you can see it represents anything on an
order that affects the order total so
that's pretty straightforward if you
just think about what these three things
are it should make perfect sense okay
and now we have order settings so this
is just an optional message that to be
splayed on the order form managed fields
this is where you have your fields in
your order settings we have your first
year line items then your order total
and your shipping information billing
information just count just like content
types or anything like that we can drag
them around and we have pricing rules
and pricing rules allow us to do really
complex interactions by setting rules in
Drupal using the rules module actually
and it's going to you know gives you a
greater control of how your store
interacts with more advanced
configurations let's say you need the
site to react a certain way to various
types of products or customers you'd be
doing it in your pricing rules so let's
click reset reset it's going to wipe all
the content from the site we obviously
don't want to do that and commerce
search API
here's you can say allow users just
search by tags brain whatever you can
uncheck any of this stuff check it if
you want site settings with where you
get to more of your Drupal stuff visual
and layout is sort of your theme
appearance is your theme settings you'll
notice we have classic Bartek in here if
we wanted to install that and we have
commerce kickstart if we click settings
you might recognize that this is
actually built on Omega so this is an
Omega theme although you might not
recognize it this is built with Omega so
if you're used to Omega then it should
feel right at home
and we have an Omega couple lessons that
we're gonna be having more but just you
know they're not up there yet blocks
blocks your typical blocks feel free to
refer to the Drupal tutorials on blocks
and then views is also installed with
commerce kickstart because really what
site isn't going to be using views and
so here you can you know manage your
views just like normal structure is your
normal structure stuff we have menus and
all this stuff
it's using crumbs for breadcrumbs which
is a kind of a complex module but it's
pretty cool allows you complete control
of your breadcrumbs
we have people which allows you to users
and permissions so this is just like
normal you can create rolls this is all
normal Drupal stuff so nothing crazy
here our modules is just like our normal
modules although what's really great is
that they have the module filter module
installed by default and this is one of
my day one module installs on any Drupal
installation without this filter you
just have a huge long list of modules
and it's a huge pain and then we also
have configuration which is your normal
configuration page and it's saying
something about my status report it's
probably saying that my file still has
the permissions I I haven't changed it I
mean the site's living on my computer
I'm course going to get to it but yes
something here I want to do but it's
just yelling at me haven't I just
haven't done it being lazy right now so
so this is your back-end site settings
is your Drupal stuff store settings is
your store stuff most of this is should
look familiar but be things that you've
never seen before and then content
orders products it should be all
straightforward and we're gonna get
ready into making some products and
making our store in fact we might even
create a sub-theme who knows but let's
check this out even the base theme is
responsive out-of-the-box so cool so as
always if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video hit
us up at Twitter or level up Tut's let
us know what you're thinking this is
Scott and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
