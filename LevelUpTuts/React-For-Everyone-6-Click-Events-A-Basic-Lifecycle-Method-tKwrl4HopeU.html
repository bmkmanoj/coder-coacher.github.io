up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be talking about how to create
your own custom method within your
component and then how to fire that
method how to run that method using an
on-click event so we're basically going
to be first creating the method and then
creating the unclick and talking a
little bit about that so let's get going
on that right now okay so in the last
video we covered state and we had this
really sort of non practical example we
just set the state to value of one when
we loaded up the application in the
moment that the component rendered we
reset the value to 20 by taking the
current value in incrementing it by 19
now what we want to do here is actually
have a button rigged up to increment
this whenever we click it now this seems
like pretty rudimentary but it's a nice
technique to show what you can do with
click events and how you can have a your
own function within an object it
basically shows a lot of nice
foundational techniques that are going
to be useful once we're building
something practical okay so the first
thing we need to know is that we have
these default react methods like
component did mount get initial state
render get default props prop types is
an object here but all these things are
things that react sort of knows how to
handle now if we were to make our own
method in here which you certainly can
do and will do often react doesn't
necessarily know what to do with it
until you explicitly state what to do
with it so for instance if we were to
have a method here this can be like
handle click or increment value or
something like that a good practice is
to start this method with an underscore
so that you know that this is a custom
method for this component now the
underscore isn't required but it's nice
to see and a lot of people recommended
so we can say underscore and we can just
say add by one in camel case like so now
head by one then we can have a colon and
a function just like we've been doing
now we can have some brackets here and a
comma
can't forget that karma okay so this is
now going to be a method that is run on
our site whenever we essentially tell it
to run for instance if we want this to
fire on a click we have to have an on
click event
ad to trigger this function let's go
ahead and do a council log we'd say
console dot log and we need to say click
like so now let's come down to our
component and under this state value
let's add a button we can just add a
button and we don't need a type here we
can just simply say click mean brilliant
ok now what we can have is an on click
in the camelcase
property onto this element here no we
can say equals now it's important not to
use quotes here because passing in
quotes to this is essentially just
passing this to a string since we want
this to run a JavaScript function if you
remember to do that we need the brackets
to run JavaScript
so we could say brackets and inside of
here what we want to say is this
referring to this current component that
we're in and then we're going to say dot
underscore ad buy one which is our
current method now it's important to
note that what we don't want is we don't
want the parentheses here we're gonna go
over that in a second but don't worry
about that what we need here is this dot
ad buy one now let's head to our site
here load it up and you don't see
anything but when we click on this click
me we do get click fired over here okay
so let's refresh this page now let's
head back to our code and let's actually
come back here and add these parentheses
now let's refresh our page and what you
see is some interesting stuff happening
we have clicked being fired twice so
this is precisely why you do not want to
have these parentheses here because it's
going to run this function and you might
be wondering why in the world you would
ever want to do that well for instance
let's say if we had a function up here
that
is simply something like I'm just going
to give this a name like hello function
and you don't have to type this this is
just an example here we're going to
delete in a second we can say return and
inside of this return statement we can
simply just pass this in and h1 hello
okay now if we wanted to have this
render in our render function we could
simply say this dot underscore hello now
with the parentheses you'll see what
happens when we run this we do get hello
output so obviously in this case we want
this to be output and that's going to be
helpful later on down the road so just
know that when we have this dot have by
one we do not want the parentheses here
or else it's going to automatically run
okay let's get rid of this let's get rid
of that back to where we were now we can
just take this value come this set state
right here let's cut this completely out
of here let's actually just copy this
whole this dead set state here I'm
actually gonna cut it not copy it and
I'm gonna paste that inside of here
instead of this on click now we can
increment the value every single time by
nineteen even though he said we
increment it by one so let's change that
to one that way this is truthful okay so
now what's gonna be happening is when we
click on click it's going to hit this
add by one it's going to set our state
to the current state plus one
so you should see this be counting up
every single time we click refresh we
should see one here two three four five
six seven eight nine ten all right
beautiful so that every single time I'm
clicking it's incrementing this value
it's updating on the screen and we're
not having to do anything to say hey
update this value on the screen reacts
like you know what I got that no problem
so we are now successfully modifying
state we have a click event going and we
have sort of the foundation set up to be
able to create a real sort of practical
app so in the next few videos we're
gonna be making a
text list app that allows you to not
only animate in contacts and things like
that but have a really nice looking
interface so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video hit me up at Twitter or
Facebook at level up tutorials also if
you head over to store dot level up
tutorials you can see that next level
CSS transitions and animations is now
for sale this is the first premium
tutorial package from level up tutorials
it's 2 hours and 10 minutes just about
of practical CSS animations examples
where basically you learn how to create
not only practical but performative
animations and sort of the process and
thought that needs to go behind when
crafting your own animations and your
custom interactions if you'd like to
help support me creating free tutorials
this is a great way to do so with these
16 high-quality video tutorials code
examples and templates so thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
