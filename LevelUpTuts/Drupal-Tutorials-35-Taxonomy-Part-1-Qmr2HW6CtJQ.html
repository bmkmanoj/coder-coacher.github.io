up tubs and today only going over
taxonomy in Drupal 7 so what taxonomy is
is a really powerful core module it
gives you the options to basically sort
and really just categorize your content
so a taxonomy is sort of just like its
metadata its tags sort of like if you
would have like a wordpress blog or
something where you are giving your blog
post different types of categories or
Det like I said tags you would then use
a taxonomy in Drupal what's great about
this taxonomy is you're not confined to
being tags or whatever you can use them
to be all sorts of things so when you
click on or ticket to taxonomy you go to
structure and then texana me and so as
you can see here it says taxonomy is for
categorizing content so it says you know
you can create a new vocabulary called
fruit and terms would be apple or banana
as you can see here I have a cat or a
vocabulary already and it's called tags
if we click Edit vocabulary here you can
just see it has a description of what
this is and its name okay so let's go
under list two terms here and you can
see that I've already created some tags
and these were actually created during
the creation of a journal so if I click
add content up here let's open this in a
new window I'm going to go to article
which is actually my journal postings
and here's a field called tag so just
like if you're used to any other
blogging platform you could enter your
tags comma separated and then once you
save your page this a blog post will
have these tags associated with it and
what that will do is it's actually going
to just add those tags to this list of
already existing tags and if your blog
post sees multiple ones or ones that it
already knows let's say something is
tutorial in my journal if I start
writing tutorials I'll write tu
it's going to find that tutorials
already exists as a tag so we can click
that and then click comma okay so there
you go just want to add another one you
can just keep adding them and if they
don't already exist look it add to the
list and if they do already exist
it just gets sent to be categorized as
that so let's show you how to create a
new vocabulary so let's go back to our
text on t'me and so sure this is tags
these are for journal posts but I want
to create a taxonomy or vocabulary for
what types of projects I have so whether
they're going to be this project is
whether it's a tutorial or the project
is development the project was design or
just totally something out there let's
create a new vocabulary so click Add and
we'll just call this project type and
for the description you can come up with
your own or whatever you're doing so
this is the type of project it's fairly
straightforward since I'm using the site
myself I'm not going to take too much
time on my descriptions I know I'm going
to know what everything is going to be
but of course if you're building set up
for a client or another content manager
you're going to want to make sure these
descriptions are nice and just useful to
whoever is going to be visiting and
seeing this thing for the first time
when they're trying to understand it so
let's click Save here and then here is
our project type and let's click this
add terms button right here so we just
want to add a term you can give it a
description if you want you don't have
to it's not required so I'm just going
to call this let's see this will be just
development
okay under relations you can have it be
a parent term you can have it be
underneath another term so this is the
just a standard parent term in fact I'm
not going to get into sort of nesting or
anything like that
so okay we'll click this it's going to
generate an automatic alias for this so
let's click Save okay create a new term
development as you can see it actually
kicks you right back out to this create
another one because frequently if you're
creating a term or you're creating
taxonomy terms you're going to want to
be doing a few of them you're not going
to just want to do one so it sets it up
nice and easy for you so let's do
another one that almost development
let's say this is design well could
spell that right design okay cool
same thing save it perfect now let's go
back to our text on any project type
okay
so now we have our two design
development let's just click Edit on one
of these and now you can see this URL
path that it generated so project type
development so let's let's check out
what happens when we go to that URL on
our site I'm just going to take any
random window and go to that project
type development so this says
development there are no there's no no
content classified with this term well
let's change that so what I'm going to
do is let's go to our content types and
for our projects I need to add a
taxonomy reference field so if we click
down here it's actually called a term
reference you can see that as the field
type you can choose between select list
check boxes or auto complete the
autocompletes what we used for the tags
however since I'm only going to have a
set number of options that I'm just
going to check and uncheck I'm going to
do check boxes this way because I'm not
going to physically be tagging things I
want to have a bunch of set options and
those are the only ones it can be okay
so check boxes we're going to call this
project type okay already got it
okay let's maybe move this up right here
save and okay save filled settings okay
so this is going to say project type and
a design development which is the
default value I'm just going to not have
it select anything by default and I'm
going to let you be able to select a
limited amount because sometimes I
design and develop sometimes I just
design sometimes I just develop
okay save that now let's edit some of
our content let's edit this perpetual
project we'll click Edit and then I'll
scroll down here and let's say I did
design and development this was a
Magento site and design and developed it
and okay so now that has that let's go
to that piece of content full okay so
under here project type development back
to where we were let's refresh this page
and you can now see that this page has
our information
Perpetua the name and the description
and a read more button if we click this
you could edit this right here and it's
going to be able to edit your content so
if you wanted to keep adding them and if
you visit this URL project type
development you're going to get all of
the ones I developed which is really
nice because it sort of builds out a
list automatically for you
alternatively you can build something
like this in views and we're going to be
going over that in a future tutorial if
you want to have more control over sort
of what fields are coming out here or
just the general you know you want to
have more control over what's getting
output with this taxonomy so this is how
you create a vocabulary you set up your
own taxonomy and then you can add it to
a content type to classify your projects
this way you can show certain types of
ones you could build a menu that had all
your different types of tags out in it
and it would link to you know project
type development or project type design
of course these are both the same ones
so you could have your menus here and it
could be all working and your content
could be all categorized
and easily accessible so that is how you
use texana me in Drupal to categorize
your content once again this is Scott
with level up Tut's
