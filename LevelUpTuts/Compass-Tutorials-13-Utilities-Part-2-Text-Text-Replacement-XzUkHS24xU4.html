lot tuts and today I'm gonna be talking
about some more utilities and these one
time they going over today are some
things that are gonna help you with some
text-based things we're gonna go over
one that's gonna force a rap and we're
gonna go over some text replacement
mixes so this fourth rap is really
useful let's say you have a word that is
so long it's breaking your layout
so let's actually make a really long
word I'm just gonna turn this into a
really really long word and so we'll
save this and let's look at our layout
as you can see it's totally breaking our
layout it's it's going way past the
margins way past our padding it's
outside of the element itself we want to
force this word to wrap and stay within
our layout here it's actually really
easy
so in our intro paragraph where that's
located we're gonna type in our mix in
and that one's going to be @include and
then we're gonna call this force - rap
semicolon save this refresh our page and
as you can see this super long word now
wraps and stays within our layout it's
looking perfect let's actually see what
the CSS did scroll down here and was
check it out tonight okay so it's added
this white space pre white space
pre-wrap rights so everything that you
need to make sure that this is going to
wrap correctly on all of your browsers
so this mixin we're going to do is just
going to hide our text so to do that we
want to assign this to the paragraph
we're going to do the paragraph that's
within intro so instead of our intro
class here we're just going to say you
know brackets have our paragraph in here
and for this we're going to do add
include and then the mixin is called
hide - text semicolon now if we refresh
our page as you can see the text has
been completely hidden and this is
actually doing some cool stuff I mean
it's really just let's see
yeah it's really just giving this
overflow:hidden white-space:nowrap and
then indenting the text by 110 percent
effectively pushing it from view so it's
still being you know rendered on your
page it's just being hidden so this is a
common technique for text replacement if
you're using images of course that's
just hiding the text there so let's get
rid of that one and now let's do
something a little bit different this
one's actually very similar this this is
going to be @include and instead of high
text we're squishing text okay and so
what this is doing is it's actually just
squishing it from display so you can't
see it but screen readers will still
pick this up so you're hiding the text
but the screen reader is gonna pick it
up no problem so that's squish text if
we want to replace text with an image
that's also no problem so let's not do
this on the paragraph because it'd be
kind of weird save this let's look at
one of our links let's try let's make a
link to do this with okay so well I'm
gonna put a link in between these two
paragraphs
so right here before three we're just
gonna have an anchor and we're gonna
give this a class of hide me and it's
going to have text hide me okay
save that okay let's go to our CSS so
I'm just going to declare this class
here I'm gonna say it to hide me she did
I have a hyphen in there no okay and
inside of here we're going to use a text
replacement so this is @include and then
replace - text and then parenthesis okay
so in here we're going to specify the
relative path to our image and so we
have this in our images social folder so
because the compass is configured to
look in our IMG folder for images all we
have to say is social - slash and then
our image which is Facebook PNG okay and
then we can actually do a comma for its
background position vertical and or
horizontal and then vertical but you
know we're not using a sprite for this
so it doesn't really matter and then in
here we're gonna need to also
display:block because this doesn't do
that for us and we're actually going to
need to wrap this in quotes okay I save
that
now let's check out our HTML as you can
see here is our image but of course you
know there's no height or width we
actually didn't tell it a height or
width because off and I don't know how
huge this images or not you know so
let's actually go back to our sublime
text and there's another mixin that will
actually find the image height for you
it's called a replace text - with -
dimensions okay so now we save this and
same thing we'll just leave this display
back on here it's actually going to find
the image dimensions for us so now that
this is refreshed you can see is
actually pulled in our image and it's
dimensions for us it's using some SAS
functions that are actually looking at
the image finding its height and width
and setting that to this elements height
and width so there you have it I was
just able to replace this link with an
image and I didn't even know its height
or width I did in two lines of code it's
pretty special let's check out the CSS
just so you can see you know just really
appreciate everything it's doing for you
BAM so all this stuff from two lines of
compass and sass is just awesome
okay well that's it for these utilities
encompass as always if you have any
questions please let us know you know
hit us up on Twitter at level up Tut's
and let us know what you're thinking
once again this is Scott with level up
Tut's and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
