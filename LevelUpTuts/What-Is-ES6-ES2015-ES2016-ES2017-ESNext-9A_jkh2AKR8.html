talk about es6 because even just
yesterday I saw a thread on reddit about
asking about learning es6 and now here
we are in 2017 soon-to-be 2018 and even
though es6 is sort of long gone there's
still some confusion over exactly what
es6 is and all of the features that came
along with it so before we get into some
of those features let's talk about what
the es in the es6 s stands for and some
of the versions that came before and
after es6 so ES or ECMO script is
actually the base language that
JavaScript is based on you'll see that
javascript is listed as a major
implementation of atma script so
javascript actually comes from Ekman
script and therefore that's where the es
name comes from now you can read all
about the history of echo script on the
wikipedia page here and you can also see
a whole lot about the different versions
well in 2008 an abandoned version of
echo script as es4 or Atma script
harmony was abandoned due to political
differences concerning the languages
complexity now since then a group of
several different companies such as
Yahoo Microsoft and Google and other
fourth edition dissenters form their own
subcommittee to design a less ambitious
update to echo script now a lot of these
updates came along and in 2015 we got
Atma script sixth edition or Eklund
script 2015 now you may also have heard
of this as es6 now es6 was finalized in
June 2015 and includes a whole ton of
excellent new features for Java Script
things that people have been asking for
for a long time such as generator
expressions arrow functions typed array
collections promises and a whole bunch
of nice things right there are just so
many features here
suddenly existed inside of JavaScript
now you might be thinking well es6
that's it right well not quite because
in the very next year Atmos group 2016
or es 2016 aka es 7 came out in June and
also included a bunch of new features
while not as large as es6 the es 7
features were a welcome addition and as
you could guess the es 2017 version was
soon released the very next year this
included things like a sink and a weight
which hasn't been a huge upgrade to how
asynchronous code works within
JavaScript now you also see the term yes
neck now yes next is the name given to
the very next version of Atma script and
this is going to possibly include some
things and possibly not include others
there are certain features like
decorators that have been planned to be
included in other specifications and
have not yet made it into the official
Atma script spec now this doesn't mean
that these features won't ever make it
into the spec it just means that they're
not here right now so we got a little
bit of the history in the future of
JavaScript here and how it pertains to
es6 but what about actually using it
today because well some browsers support
some es next and es future features not
all of them support all of the features
and on top of that which features do you
even need to know so how can we use
these features today
well babel is sort of the de facto way
to do it now babel is simply just a
javascript compiler if you've used
something like sass or stylus for CSS
pre-processing babel kind of does the
same thing where it takes your
javascript and spits it out into a
version of javascript that different
browsers will be able to understand i
could sort of think of it like an
autoprefixer right autoprefixer for CSS
takes your CSS and make sure that older
browsers can understand it correctly
now babble is doing the same thing and
you can see some examples of exactly
what's happening in this little video on
the home screen now the cool thing about
babble is that you can use it with es
next features or you can target very
specific releases of Ekman script and
you can even choose which browsers you
want it to support as in which
generation of browsers or how far back
you want your JavaScript to actually
compile to so why do you need this well
like I mentioned before even when the
spec is released it still takes time for
browsers to implement these new features
and sometimes they already have all of
the features in and sometimes it takes
time for users to adopt the latest
browser and because of that you don't
want to be serving a version of
JavaScript that those users can't
understand
so this is where Babel comes in and it
takes your code and gets you into es
2015 JavaScript syntax and beyond now
this is also a great place to learn
about es 2015 and what it includes for
instance if you see it learn es 2015 you
can scroll down and see all of the
awesome new features such as arrow
functions and how they affect the
keyword this classes and allows us to
create classes like many other languages
have already had we also have things
like enhanced object literals template
strings which allows us to interpolate
our variables into our strings we have
destructuring which we use all of the
time and react now there's too many
features to go over in their entirety in
this video however there's some
excellent resources you can use to learn
about this stuff other than babel IL
learn es2015 ok so now we know how we
can use es6 let's talk about where you
can learn more about es6 through es next
features because honestly there's a lot
of exciting new features that come to
JavaScript every single year and it's
important to stay on top of those
because if you let a one version slip by
and then another one slipped by you know
maybe five years later you are now
several years behind on features that
have been added to the core of
JavaScript
a free resource would be the Luke Hoban
es6 features repo which shows you a
basic overview of all of the features
and tells you when and how you would use
them this is a great place to really
truly get a handle on what's new if
you're looking for something more
tutorial desk you can check out es6 dot
io and you can learn from syntax FM
co-host West boss as he teaches you all
of the new features in es6 this is a
great series and if you're looking for a
premium learning experience this is
definitely a great place to get that if
you'd like to help support this channel
please click on the link in the
description if you're going to purchase
es6 for everyone in addition if you're
interested in learning the s6 features
in the context of react you can use
react 16 for everyone where we actually
go over not only es6 but es6 through es
8 features and we teach them in the
context of react as if it was just
normal javascript so instead of saying
hey this is a new feature we're talking
about hey this is how this work and this
is how you should do it from now on so
stop thinking about es6 es 7 es 2015 es
next and start thinking about the
current version of es or javascript
because these features aren't additional
add-ons to JavaScript they are
JavaScript so if you don't want to learn
arrow functions and you are choosing to
ignore a particular part of the language
as a whole so any of these features like
that you want to make sure that you have
a proper grasp on them so that you know
when how to use them correctly and while
new features in a language like this can
be kind of scary at the same time the
features within es6 es 7 all the stuff
have continually made my life as a
developer better so I can tell you with
great certainty that this stuff is going
to improve your day to day so stay up on
the new releases and make sure that you
follow along whenever something new
comes out in JavaScript and if you are
extra Ventris check out some of the es
next some of the stuff proposed
to come out and see what exactly could
be good for you in the future
or maybe you can try them out using
different babble plugins or presets so
as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you want to learn more
about es6 in the practical react head
over to store dot level up tutorials
comm and check out react 16 for everyone
or become a pro because i'm gonna be
talking a lot about these new features
and every single javascript based
tutorial series that i have coming so
thanks so much for watching and i'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
