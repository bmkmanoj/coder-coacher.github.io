up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
a little bit about replacement patterns
in views okay and replacement patterns
can be very useful if you're rewriting
the output of a view they also become
very important let's say if you're doing
something with you have a custom let's
see a custom text field basically
anytime you need to bring in some
information from one of your fields and
you want to really really change how
it's going to be output replacement
patterns are the way to go okay so let's
actually add a custom text field to this
view that we already have here it's just
a few fields we have just some content a
title video whatever and then I'm going
to just have this be custom text as the
label just so you can see what it is and
if you notice in our text here this can
be anything you want it can even be HTML
but it doesn't have to be okay what you
want to put in here if you click on this
risk site or a replacement patterns if
you click on this it's going to give you
all of the replacement patterns that are
available now if you can sort of see
it's grayed out here but this custom
text is the most recent field that we've
added so it's at the very bottom here
okay if this a custom text field was at
the top this replacement part patterns
list would not really exist like this in
fact let's check that out and see
exactly what I mean for your replacement
patterns to be usable they have to be
loaded as a field before the field that
you are using them in so let's rearrange
this and move our custom text field
custom text to the very top and then
let's try to add some replacement
patterns to it so I'm going to click on
this and if I go to replacement patterns
you'll notice that the only things
available is this nothing one which is
the this particular custom text field
and the battle title and the input which
is our arguments actually so these are
things that are available by default
even if it's the first one but like we
said we want to have access to these
other ones so I'm actually going to take
this and put this back to the bottom
where it was and that goes for rewriting
the output of a field to if you need to
do that makes
whatever you are outputting the field
into that custom output is either loaded
before it or that feel itself so first
off let's add this custom text and let's
check it out exactly what we want to do
here let's say there's some you know
crazy stuff that you want to have before
afterwards whether it's HTML but you
still want this round information which
is one of our fields what we can do here
is we can look until we find content
round which is this and it's field round
is it's a replacement pattern and it's
in brackets as you see here so if we
want to say this round is and then field
round it's going to be good okay so now
this is going to output the value of
this field into here okay exactly where
we have it let's apply this and then
I'll show you what we mean this this
particular view takes an argument ten of
which I is I know it's going to bring
that stuff if it's not taking an
argument it doesn't matter so as you can
see here we have our field custom text
this round is quarterfinals it's going
to be good okay and if you'll notice
it's just the text itself and not the
formatting so it's not getting the same
formatting that we're telling it to use
in semantic views it's just getting the
value as you can see here I also have
this watch on YouTube was another custom
text field I had before which has a
watch on YouTube with a link and that
link is linked to a particular page and
when you can do pretty much whatever you
want as long as it fits in those
replacement patterns is HTML whatever
and if you need to use PHP there's a
custom PHP field that's another module
but we'll go over that at some other
time okay next I want to show you how to
use the replacement patterns within a
field if you're going to rewrite it so
let's say we just had to write this
round and we didn't want to have a
custom text to just output this round we
want to just do it all in this content
round field that's definitely possible
if we click on our round field
you can say it's excluding from display
so I Munchak that so that it's not being
excluded this is something that you
would often want to use let's say if you
were out putting it somewhere else you
could check this and it's not going to
show up here then you can use it again
in your custom text and it's going to be
showing up so let's go to rewrite
results and now if you want to check
this rewrite the output of the field our
replacement patterns also show up here
we can check these and again it's
everything that's either above it or
without itself so for this one we could
also copy this and we could say this
round is the it is going to be good okay
and so this is a little bit more
involved than just having a label here
it's a little bit more customized you
can do pretty much whatever you want you
can even use the replacement parts the
title whatever so let's apply this and
then I'm going to update my preview and
you can see here this round is the
quarterfinals it is going to be good
cool all right
let's scroll down to the D to the next
one this round is semi-finals it's going
to be good cool so that is how you use
replacement patterns and views using
both a custom text field or the rewrite
the results of this field if you have
any questions or comments please leave a

once again this is Scott and thanks for
