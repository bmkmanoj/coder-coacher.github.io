of Tut's and today I'm going to continue
our theming Magento and we're not going
to do a ton of Magento things today
we're gonna keep working on these
templates that we have here we're gonna
clean up we're gonna create a drop-down
menu right here for our navigation so if
you're interested in something a little
bit more technically Magento technical
development stuff then you can feel free
to bypass this one if you already know
how to just take this and use skeleton
to make a drop down navigation if you
don't feel free to keep watching we're
gonna break it down for you okay so just
like in the last lesson we have a header
dot P HTML and we took that and we
modified it to be using html5 and then
we use that to use the skeleton
framework to get what we have here so
we're gonna just continue on with that
by editing the next file so what file is
this navigation if we go to our header
dot P HTML this should all look pretty
familiar because we've been in here
you'll see top links if you remember
those with those links at the top start
language top search top container all
the very bottom here is this get child
top menu so I'm gonna go ahead and and
guess well I don't have to guess because
I know but this is the navigation here
if you were to guess that this was your
main navigation for your site you could
verify that by going to this file
well what file is this just like we
noticed when we wanted to find get child
HTML top search we're doing get child
HTML top menu so there should be a top
menu dot P HTML file and let's go to our
finder to confirm this sure enough and
our by the way this is in the front end
default template the file structure and
under page HTML I'm sure enough we have
top menu right here so just like we've
been doing before I'm gonna copy this
file and I'm going to put it in that our
X our themes HTML folder just where a
header one was just like we've been
doing so nothing crazy
there's probably better ways to do it
than just dragging it but for simplicity
right now that worked fine so I'm gonna
open this up in Magento or in sublime
text 2 here and here we have this file
just to verify that legit dough is
getting this file one thing you can do
is you can just write test at the top of
your file and we can refresh here we
should see test pop in perfect so it's
exactly what we would think this is the
file that we're looking for so let's go
back to sublime text and I'm going to
change this div with the nav container
just gonna change this to a nav tag this
tag is an html5 tag that basically says
your navigation lives here and this
isn't for any particular an ordered list
of links or anything like that but links
that are relevant to your navigation of
your site so as this we have the nav
class HTML our nav container we have
this ul with an ID of nav what I'm gonna
do is I'm also going to add a class of
container to this the reason why I'm
doing that is because as we've done in
the previous lessons when you add a
class of container using skeleton it
gives it a width and sets it so the
margins are auto on left and right so
that centers it so that should be good
for this template we don't have to do a
whole ton else let's check out our page
and make sure everything's nice and
centered ok no it's just CSS so let's
actually see let's inspect these links
so we know that they're inside of a UL
we have a list item anchor tag and
inside of that to span just in case we
want to do anything else you can change
that you actually don't have to have the
span if you don't want to I think for
this purpose it's fine to have it in
there so here we have this UL okay so
this list we don't want all these
subcategories to display we just want
the main ones so we're gonna do some
things if you'll notice here our nav and
then our ID of nav ok
so let's go to our CSS and let's make
this happen let's scroll down here
I'm gonna comment my code here okay
actually gonna put a main move it's
really important I'm sure I've said this
before but to comment your CSS in case
anybody else is looking at it keep it
nice and clean and organized so we're
going to say nav and then I guess the
idea is also named for the UL and then
we want to say any unordered lists
inside of this navigation we want these
to be display:none and we also want our
nav ID nav list items we want these to
be display inline hit and now let's
refresh this page cool now we now have
these links in the line here let's add a
background to this whole navigation area
and so now we want to add a color to the
nav so we're going to say they have with
an ID of nav container let's make sure
that's actually correct
they have - container it's actually a
class and an ID this is good thing I
checked just make sure it spellings all
exact and everything okay cool so if
we're here we're gonna add a background
color of it's going to be 5 - 4 7 3 or 7
6 3 and this is just gonna be a darker
purple we're gonna say all anchor tags
within this nav nav container are going
to be white
hey no let's save this let's check out
our page cool
one thing is actually I didn't get the
right color I made this the same purple
color let's go back here the color I
wanted to use was actually 3 7 3 1 4 2
although I'm sure you're not following
along with these exact colors so it
doesn't matter if you are just know
there's some small change there ok so
now we have this dark purple look let's
keep going with this
okay so let's add text-decoration:none
we're gonna add a font size of let's say
1.6 m/s and refresh let's check this out
okay now let's add some margin in
between these list items I'm going to
add a margin left I'm sorry I'm margin
right let's just say 15 pixels and let's
add some padding in this nav container
I'm gonna add some top and bottom
padding so just do padding in here I'm
gonna add about 10 pixels of padding to
the top and bottom refresh all right
looking a little bit better I think I
want some more margin here and I want
these to give us a underline when we
hover over them I also want to have the
list item below it hover appear when we
hover over them because then it will
function like a true drop-down menu as a
right now we're just displaying these
main categories so because this is not a
CSS tutorial I'm not going to bore you
with the specifics on how to make a CSS
drop-down menu especially if you already
know what I will do is if you have have
no knowledge about how to make a
drop-down menu as CSS I'll link you to
resources where you can learn how to
make a CSS drop-down menu it's not very
hard there's a couple of lines of code
and you can implement it really easily
but all you need to know is right now we
have a work
looking nice navigation on our site and
when we hover over it a drop-down a very
simple drop-down menu appears and more
can be done with that in CSS over time
however if you need resources to learn
how to do that just check out level up
Hut's CSS tutorials and the resource I
post in the video below on how to create
a drop down navigation using only CSS so
we have our nav all cleaned up ready to
go and we're ready to move on to the
footer as always this is Scott with
level up tuts
if you have any questions or comments
please leave them in the video art hands
up at twitter at level up tuts if
there's something you want to see in
particular let us know if you really
want to see how we made this drop down
menu let me know and I'll make another
video specifically for that as always
