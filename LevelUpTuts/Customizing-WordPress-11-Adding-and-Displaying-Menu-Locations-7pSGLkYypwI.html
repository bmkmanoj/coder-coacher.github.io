up touch and today we're going to take
our function style PHP even further by
adding a new piece of functionality to
our site and it's basically just giving
us more practice modifying this
functions file so that we can add
functionality to our site now what we're
going to do is register a new menu if
you have checked out your menu locations
and that's being under appearance menus
and then menu locations you'll see that
this theme only has two menu locations
now we have the top primary menu and the
secondary menu in the left sidebar you
see that we had the secondary menu in
the left sidebar and the primary menu is
the one up top here and we had a way of
creating a menu before and then we added
it to a location maybe using a widget or
edit it to one of these theme locations
but how do we make a new theme location
just like we made a new widget we want
to have a new theme location that we can
drop in our menu and not have to worry
about widget areas just want to have a
menu so let's head to our functions file
and let's do what we've done before
first we need to create a function
that's going to register this new menu
we can call it function and then we want
to just copy and paste this 2014 child
just like we've been doing and in here
we can just say register underscore menu
now we can have parentheses here because
it's a function but it doesn't have any
arguments and we wrap this then in curly
brackets just like so just like we've
been doing now we're going to want to
run the wordpress function register nav
menu so this function is register
register underscore nav underscore menu
now the arguments that we're going to
pass it is first a string of how we want
to identify this mid
you and it's going to be new we can just
say - menu and then we're going to have
a comma then next we're going to pass it
in what it is going to show up as in the
theme locations box on the website so to
do that we need to type underscore
underscore and then in parentheses
inside quotes the string of what we want
this to be called so we can just say our
new menu of course you want to give this
a name that has some sort of meaning to
what its general purpose is and then
we're going to finish this line up with
a semicolon
so this is our function and just like
before these functions don't run without
some sort of call to them so we need to
have a hook and we can use our hook and
say add action like we're used to doing
and the hook we're going to use is just
in it and then comma and we're going to
then run this function within quotes
just like we've been doing we wrap this
all up with a semicolon and let's save
this so now way this registered nav menu
we're passing it new - menu and our new
menu right here and now when we come to
our site and we refresh you're going to
see a third menu location our new menu
so let's actually put the main nav in to
this our new menu and click Save come to
the front end of our site and of course
this main navigation isn't showing up
anywhere well again just for fun let's
just throw it down here where we had our
widget area and I'm just going to put it
directly above here we're sort of
stacking up useless things here but it's
nice to just show you this stuff out
putting in a place that is totally
neutral and it's also a good example
because it really shows you that with
PHP and once you have these location set
you can just put them anywhere
so let's come back to our index dot PHP
file that we looked at last time and we
have this if dynamic sidebar then print
it to display our widget
however for the menu we don't have to do
anything that complex we just do have to
have a function called WP nav menu and
pass it the name of our menu or the ID
of our menu so what we can say is once
again we need a less than question mark
PHP to close open then a question mark
greater than two close the PHP and we're
just going to run this function directly
its WP underscore nav underscore menu
and then parentheses because this is a
function and we're going to pass it an
array and this array is actually an
array function so array like that with
parentheses and inside of here like we
did in the last video when we were doing
this kind of thing we're going to have
the first string this string is going to
be theme underscore location now we're
going to have the equals greater than
like this like you saw in the last video
or that one before that I believe and
now we're going to give it the ID of our
menu so this is really the important
part here because this is going to
display whatever menu we tell it with
our our our ID so let's come back to our
functions we had new - menu as our ID so
let's come back here let's paste that in
there and let's click Save now I'm going
to have a semicolon at the end of this
line because I you need it so we have
this function WP nav we're passing this
array function that's taking these two
strings and this will now display if we
refresh our main menu in this new area
of course if we come here and say hey we
actually want the footer menu there
instead refresh there's the footer menu
so this is going to show whatever you
have in your theme location
and this can be really useful especially
if you're building a theme right if
you're building a theme from scratch
you're probably going to need to add
venue areas and menu locations or if the
theme you've downloaded it just doesn't
have the right locations for you you can
now throw menus in wherever you want in
your site so as always the SUBSCRIBE
