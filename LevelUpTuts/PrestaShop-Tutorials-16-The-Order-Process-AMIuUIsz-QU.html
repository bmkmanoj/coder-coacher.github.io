up tutorials and today we're gonna take
you through the order process of a
PrestaShop store we're gonna show you
what happens when a customer takes your
order and submits it and then the order
is gonna come through in the backend and
we're gonna be able to change the status
and move it along from from received to
prepare to shift to delivered so keep
watching we're gonna show you that right
now so we've created products we've
created price rules we've set up
shipping all sorts of stuff let's get
into the process of actually putting an
order through and what that's like as
both a customer and a store manager so
we have our order summary here
I'm already signing one with the user
account with my address and everything
so let's come down here and as you can
see I have a fake address in here so
don't attempt to use this information
it's all fives so let's go ahead and
click proceed to checkout
and it's making sure your delivery and
billing address are correct and now
let's proceed to checkout again it's
going to give you the shipping
information so I'm going to use this
table rate shipping and then I'm going
to click agree to the terms and service
and then proceed to checkout okay now
that I've done this we now have our
final order screen that we can make sure
everything is fine we have a little
discount here we have our total of 71 66
after text and shipping let's go ahead
and select pay by check since I don't
want to actually put in any information
here I'm actually just going to select
to pay by check so that the order goes
through without me having to actually
pay any money okay now it's telling me
yeah here's the details of paying by
check so I'm gonna go ahead and confirm
my order okay your order has been
complete here it tells you to make the
check payable to and since we don't have
this actually configured it's not
necessarily a real statement here but
that's okay because we really just
wanted to see what happens when this
order comes in so as a store owner on
your dash board you would get a
notification in your
hurt and we click on this you can see
that there's a new order by Scott
wolinski order number 8 471 66 and it
was placed a few seconds ago so we'll
even tell you when it was placed and
even from here you can see all of your
orders also we have here in our activity
overview currently pending orders 1 so
since we have one currently pending
order let's see how we can get it out of
pending and actually move this order
along we have a currently pending order
it let's click orders here and it's
gonna take you to our orders screen here
we have some helpful information like
abandoned carts conversion rates average
order value net profit per visit and we
have a listing of all of our orders that
we can actually filter by we can search
for various ID by typing it in here and
then clicking search and you can see
that we have a lot of options here to
get our our order information and drill
down and find a particular order so as
you can see here our latest order was
set by payment by check and is awaiting
check payment let's go ahead and select
this order and see how we can move this
along let's say we've received the check
or we have received the a payment so we
would like to push this to the next step
you can see here we have all of our
order information you can see we have
all of our orders information and you
can even see what's last happen to it
basically the order is at 0 pounds it
would tell us the pounds here it's even
going to show you a little bit of map
where this person's address is since I
have a fake address on it's really just
giving me the general area of this zip
code because this this doesn't exist but
it will give you a nice little map and
allow you to see where your package is
actually going to and same with the
invoice address now we can come down
here and see there's been no payments
made on this so since they have paid
with cheque we're going to want to
change that let's scroll all the way
back up here where it says a waiting
check payment we want to change this
status so we can say payment
you could also have remote payment
accepted but let's just say a payment
came in and it's been accepted this way
you want your staff to know or maybe you
just want to know for future that this
product has been paid for but it hasn't
been shipped yet so let's select payment
accepted and click update status ok as
you can see we now have this green
payment accepted by Scott talansky on
this certain date that way if other
people are looking at this order they
can always come back and see that this
payment has already been accepted and
furthermore if we scroll down to payment
you'll see that a payment by cheque with
the amount of 70 166 has been added to
our order and we didn't have to do that
it just did it automatically when we
accepted payment great so now let's say
the payments been accepted and an
employee of yours is packaging at this
up to ready to be delivered we can now
actually move this into preparation in
progress so let's click update status
and now it's in progress as in the order
is getting ready to get shipped out now
keep in mind you can skip to any one of
these statuses from any one of these
other statuses let's say you just pretty
much shipped it out immediately and you
didn't have to prepare it at all you can
actually change us right to shipped so
now it's been prepared and we're going
to come in select and say it's been
shipped because we've sent it off so
let's go ahead and click update status
it's been shipped so now we want to add
a tracking code to our order well we
have the shipping tab down here and it
says that's been shipped with table rate
shipping and there's an edit button
right here we can click and add a
tracking number right here since I don't
have one exactly I'm just going to make
up a number and click update we now have
a tracking number associated with this
order now depending on how you ship this
you can make sure that this order has
been delivered after this order has been
delivered we can go ahead and mark this
as delivered and click update status now
it's green it says delivered and the
order is complete
so let's come back to orders we can see
that it is marked as delivered and our
total is now highlighted in green
stating that we've been officially paid
this transaction is complete we can see
our slip or our invoice here or we can
view the order now as you can see
there's lots to do within the order page
we've gone over just some of it but
we're mostly changing our statuses based
on the status of what's happening with
the product now this isn't an automated
process we have to go ahead and mark
this as shipped when it shipped and
that's what's going to let our customer
know that this product is in the mail
that way they're not wondering if their
product is going to arrive or when it's
going to arrive and they'll get notified
that their product has shipped so we've
now completed our order process as
always if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video heads
up at Facebook or Twitter at level up
Tut's we love to hear from you thanks
for watching and we'll see in the next
one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
