up tutorial so today I'm gonna show you
how to get started using polymer on your
site and now we're going to be
installing polymer using Bower so if you
haven't used Bower don't worry we're
going to give you a little bit of a
introduction and show you how to get
going with that as well not too long but
just enough to get started so get ready
we're gonna get polymer started in a new
project right now so to get started we
can try downloading the polymer starter
kit now this is something that Google's
set up so that you can get going with
polymer right away and it uses some
built in defaults and default
boilerplate code for you so we can go
ahead and get that just by clicking the
download polymer starter kit okay now
here it takes you to the github page
where you have the latest release and
here's the various available downloads
we have the beginner version which is
light we have the inner media which is
for advanced users and we have it for a
yeoman user where you can use the yeoman
generator for polymer since we're just
going to be using this beginner version
we can go ahead and click download here
and it's going to give us the latest
version of the starter kit light so I've
thrown it into a folder where I keep
some websites and as you can see I have
a couple of folders here I just dragged
the polymer starter kit in here I also
made a with a bower and without Bower
folder for when we show you how to use
polymer that way so I'm just going to
change directory into the polymer
starter kit wherever you have that
located and so now you can see what's in
here we just have an app folder we have
Bower JSON we've a readme a license and
a bower RC file and if we check out
what's inside of our starter kit here we
have a license file the readme file an
app folder and a bower JSON file if you
were checking hidden files gel so see
there's a dot Bower our C file we want
to actually change directory now into
the app folder and again let's see
what's in there we have an index dot
HTML a manifest file robots file that
sort of thing so we want to start a
simple HTTP server we can do so with
Python just by typing Python and then
- em then simple HTTP and all caps and
then server like so now when we hit
enter it's going to start a new
localhost for us at this folder address
so let's go to our browser and as you
can see with no effort here we already
have this polymer starter kit up and
running what's cool about this is we can
already come in here we can change this
welcome text to say hello and we already
have an example with two-way
data-binding already going for us we
also have some various pages this is a
user section we have a contact section
now none of this stuff's really totally
functional but it's pretty cool to see
with very little effort we have some
nice little material design the
flourishes and we just have a nice basic
starter kit going for us and let's check
out what's going in the actual files I'm
going to open this up in sublime text
and as you can see when we open up our
app folder here we have this index.html
and inside of here we just have a
standard html5 doctype and we have
inside of our head and as you can see
that nothing's really crazy if we scroll
down we see all these meta tags which
are various mobile tags for styling and
nearer mobile browsers and icons and
home page icons things like that but if
you'll see we actually have besides our
stylesheet that main CSS we also have
this bower underscore components web
components j/s and then web components -
light j/s and we also are importing this
link right here where we have elements
for such elements HTML now this may be
new to you when we explore our first
element and we write our first element
you're gonna see a little bit why this
is but we're essentially bringing in our
own custom element here we're using some
really interesting things so this is
this elements HTML you can pull through
this if you'd like but for now we're
gonna ignore that and we're just gonna
say that hey we got polymer up and
running and we're using this starter kit
but let's say you don't want to use a
starter kit right you just want to use
polymer on your project and maybe you're
just starting your project and
maybe you have your own themes and stuff
like that you want to use so let's go
ahead and start any new project I've
downloaded just a standard html5
boilerplate here and I'm gonna open this
up in sublime text and as you can see
there's not really a whole lot here just
a basic HTML page which includes not a
whole lot just normalized mom and Iser
that sort of stuff so let's take this
html5 boilerplate page and add polymer
to it using Bower
well server just by doing ctrl C I'm
gonna change directory out of this and
back into my polymer 1 folder where I
had several different boilerplate sites
so now I I'm gonna change directory into
my width Bower this w underscore bower
which is like I said is just an html5
boilerplate site with no additions to it
so we have this blank site here we can
see inside of it is all the stuff that
we were just looking at in sublime text
now let's go ahead and add polymer to
this using Bower so we need to set up
our first we can do so by saying Bower
in it now if you don't have Bower you
can install it using NPM just by simply
typing NPM install - gee Bower you can
go to Bower dot io to get that installed
on your system you'll need know just to
have that installed but it's definitely
worth having so know don't feel weird
about having it on your computer if you
don't already okay so now that we've hit
Bower in it it's gonna ask for some
details and we don't have to fill any
these details out so we can just simply
hit enter to go through it we can just
we can just keep hitting Enter
unless of course this is a project that
you plan on continuing to use and then
in fact you'll want to answer these
questions
okay so we've hit enter through all of
that and I'm just gonna hit yes - it
looks good and now we can install a
polymer simply by typing Bower install
and we can have - - save now this adds
the polymer to our dependencies so that
way when we check this into our code
base and maybe move it somewhere else
you can just run a bower command
and it's going to install the
dependencies and that way you don't have
to have these dependencies saved in your
codebase in the first place so we can
have Bower install - - save now we're
gonna type polymer with the capital P so
polymer forward slash and then now
polymer with a lowercase P now the pound
sign then the up arrow and then 1.0.0
now we can just hit enter here and it's
going to grab our polymer okay and as
you can see it has added a polymer to a
web components folder in our project so
let's head back to sublime text and you
can see we have Bower components and
inside of here we have web components
jeaious and we have our polymer folder
so we now have polymer in our project
and after we show you how to install it
without Bower we're gonna go ahead and
start to use polymer by importing the
necessary scripts into our project and
get going with polymer so if you want to
get going quick use the starter kit if
you want to get going on a blank project
go ahead and just use Bower and if you
don't want to use Bower check out the
next video where we just show you how to
download the latest version of polymer
and get going that way as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments you
become in the video where decebet or
facebook at level up tuts we'd love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see the next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
