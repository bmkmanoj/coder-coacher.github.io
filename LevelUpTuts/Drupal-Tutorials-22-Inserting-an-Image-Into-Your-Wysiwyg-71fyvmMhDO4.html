of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to insert an image into your text
edit field using the WYSIWYG and insert
modules in Drupal 7 continuing from last
time when we enabled a WYSIWYG into our
system
I actually had a comment on the video
asking god how to insert an image well
this actually is impossible without
another module called insert so I'm
figured out which show you how to do
that really quick before we got into
views which is what's going to be our
next little mini series because views is
going to take quite a few tutorials to
go over and full so before we get into
that let's download the module insert
insert search drupal.org for it all
right let's grab the latest one
and if you need help installing modules
again you could always check out the how
to install a module screencast that we
did I forget which number it is but was
a few ones ago so we'll go to modules
and turn on insert and of course if
there's any dependencies or anything
that we need to have turned on as well
as for insert to work it's going to tell
us that doesn't look like it so click
Save and to get this insert plus module
working all you have to do is you have
to have an image field field on your
piece of content and that image field
has you'll give it an option to use
insert so let's go to I'm sorry let's go
to structure content types and then
let's add this to an article so we'll go
to manage fields and then and we're
going to add a new field and this is
going to be insert image well I spelled
something wrong sort insert okay and
we're just going to say this is an image
and it's going to be an image like
normal and we'll just put this right
here underneath this other one and click
Save okay so yep yep so field settings
and the next screen here this is where
we're going to tell it to use insert so
if we scroll down here there will be a
insert tab or just select this and we're
going to click enable insert button and
you want to select all of these or or if
you setup a specific image style that
you're going to want to use for this
image in particular you know go ahead
and do that
actually let's use the medium or project
test because I know some of these are
kind of gigantic so the default image is
just going to be automatic and let's see
if we need thing else additional CSS
class you know you know you could do
this if you want but basically this is
it you just have to select insert here
and if you want to be able to upload and
insert more than one image you're going
to have to select this to be unlimited
under number of values or otherwise it's
just going to allow you to insert one
image so click Save Settings here and
now if we go to add content and let's
add an article so test test app it so if
you see here's our insert image let's
choose a file see if I have anything my
downloads I have the same picture that
we used before
let's grab that click upload ok so here
it is you can select a style we'll
select product test and click insert and
as you can see here is the image in our
WYSIWYG it's actually the reason why
it's upside-down and gray is because
that's what project test is if you
remember from the image style tutorials
also if you'll notice it added this
image directly to the end of where our
our place was in our text so if we have
a break first and then click insert you
can see it puts it right in there again
and I mean for any reason if you want to
insert it more than once anytime you
click this insert button it's going to
keep putting it in and it's just
basically adding this image to your
WYSIWYG and if you wanted to add another
image because we selected unlimited it
adds a new field here we can just choose
another one and I need to know if I have
anything else in here that's an image a
lot of videos but yeah if we had another
image I should here I'll just take a
screenshot of this page with a quick
okay screenshot we can upload this and
also select project test and click
insert and you can see there's our
screenshot as well although it is upside
down and black and white due to the
image style actually if we did want to
now select automatic and click insert
it's going to click the full sized image
here which is as you can see gigantic ok
so if we were to save this out just
click Save
you can see that not only has it added
and see down here not only has it added
our images it's also added this insert
image field so if we go back to the
content type that we're at you can tell
it to just not show the insert image
field by default content-type article
manage fields and then manage display
we're going to say you know we don't
want to show this and we don't want to
show the image it's hidden okay saved so
now the only ones that are going to be
in here are the ones that were in our
WYSIWYG so let's look at it here
refresh this content and actually it
doesn't look like it's showing up let's
see why
oh this isn't showing up because we have
this filtered HTML if we have this set
to full HTML and save it here it should
work okay
so there's actually a problem on my part
here if your text format has to be set
to full HTML if you'll notice we didn't
set this full HTML up to have a WYSIWYG
so as you can see you could still use
this insert here to edit if it's just up
to full HTML but let's just set this up
so that it's exactly perfect if we go
back to configuration and then we go to
WYSIWYG profiles we want to set this
full HTML we'll just click Save and
let's set it up just really quick
buttons whatever added just a couple for
now if you remember from our last video
if not you can go back and look at that
one we saved this out go back here
can we edit this okay now you can see
that these images are inserted in the
WYSIWYG we save it and it works if you
want to change this foliage to melt to
be your default that's also in
configuration and then text formats and
then see here you can drag which ones
you want to be the initial one so if we
drag full HTML at the top we won't have
to worry about that from here on out so
if we come back to our page here and
let's create a new piece of content
we'll make it an article same as before
just garbage text right now we'll select
insert an image will grab the screenshot
will insert it upload it as project test
insert here it is you can see we're
already set to full HTML we can save
this and here it is okay so that's all
working that's how you insert an image
into your text edit screen into your
WYSIWYG in Drupal 7 if you have any
questions feel free to let me know once
again this is Scott with level up tuts
