tutorials and in this video we get
started with react we install react and
we get our application basically
rendering an h1 that's as high pretty
much so let's get started right now as
we add react to our bear meteor app okay
so in this video we're gonna get started
with react now if react isn't your
favorite front-end framework you can use
any other with Apollo there's packages
for all of that unfortunately what I
work primarily and is react which is a
very popular framework so what we're
gonna be doing is building this app
what's react now I'm going to assume
that you know react or at least you know
enough of react or are interested in
learning where you can get by with the
bare minimum of explanation that said if
you do need to learn react I have a
really awesome beginners tutorial series
on react at level up tutorials calm you
can head to level up tutorial stack on
forward slash store and purchase it
outright the series is react 16 for
everyone right here 29 bucks right now
on sale and or you could become a level
up pro subscribe and get access to that
along with a new series every single
month including one on CSS grid which I
love or react and redux or just react 16
for everyone so uh yeah check it out or
even react native if that's your thing
okay so now that that little promo is
over let's go ahead and get started here
when we left off we had our basic app
that was simply just outputting a div we
also had a folder structure which looked
like imports API and startup and UI
instead of startup we had client and
server and at our root we also had a
client and server okay so if you need to
go over that head to the github just
copy the folder structure or go ahead
clone that repo if you want make sure
you have meteor installed let's get
started with a installing and getting
react setup in this process so let's
head to our command line from the root
of our project we simply just need to
run NPM install - - save react
react dumb okay and turn this is going
to install those dependencies into our
app just like any other node project so
meteor is not that scary if you haven't
used it so if we head to our app we
could check out our package file we can
make sure that it react and react um
exist inside of package JSON okay this
is your node packages just like any
other framework here okay so we now have
react installed let's go ahead and get
our application well using react in any
sort of way the first thing we want to
do is head into our server folder and
our client folder client folder is more
important right now so we'll head there
the client folder we're going to click
on it and select new file and create a
new file which is a knit dot J s the
naming for this file does not matter
because we don't import it it's at the
root folder structure and we tear
automatically nodes that upon
initialization this file is going to
load up now all we need to do inside of
this file is really just import a file
from our imports folder now you might be
wondering why the heck we even make this
client dot a knit file at all if all
it's doing is importing another file
well I mentioned before that the
anything in the root of your project
gets eagerly loaded by the meteor build
tool so by pulling a single file into
the root of our client-side code and
having it load up everything else from
the imports it gives us total control
and total import and export from all of
our app folder here ok so inside of
start up inside a client let's go ahead
and make a new file which I'm just
simply going to call index that jsn side
of our client now index J s is simply
going to import we're gonna import react
from react okay we're going to import
meteor from and then to use meteor
packages and imports you first use
meteor forward slash and then the
package name so the package we actually
want to access is meteor itself
okay so we're importing meteor from
meteor forward slash me
year and lastly we're going to be
importing render from react dom so
render from react - dom okay i need to
set up es lunes and all that stuff so
that it automatically fixes some of my
code here but I'll do that off the video
at some point and now what we want to do
is actually create a really super basic
react component we can just say Const
app is equal to a new arrow function
okay and this arrow function is simply
going to well I guess I don't even need
the return statement here if it's just
going to return its simply right now
let's make it return an h1 okay and just
say hello because why not let's get a
hello world going here so our app right
now is simply just an h1 next what we
want to do is say meteor dot startup and
on meteor startup which is a function
here that has a callback callback
callback callback and the inside of the
air and our return statement always
simply need to do is use react dumbs
render so we can say render and well
what do we want to render we want to run
your app and where do we want to render
it to we want to render it to document
dot get element by ID and if you
remember in our HTML file index.html we
use the idea of app okay so let's paste
this let's paste this in here like this
okay so check it out meteors not so
scary because this is sort of exactly
what you'd expect from any react app
we're simply just running react Dom
render but only thing special about this
is we're doing it on meteor startup now
this index file isn't being loaded yet
because it's inside of our imports file
structure here like there's nothing
telling this index file to be included
in the bundle okay so to do that we want
to head to an it which is the the only
JavaScript client file that we have in
here okay and let's go ahead and import
and we're just going to import a file
we'll have to go back a directory and
then we're going to import from imports
start up client and the file we want is
called index J s so we don't even need
anything at the end of here we can just
leave it like this like client right
here so what here's what happens with
media right the package gets bundled in
and this initialize one because it's
inside of our client folder gets put in
the client side bundle right so since
this is the only JavaScript file here
while it does is runs this line which is
import to startup client which is while
our index file which lives inside of
imports startup client now from here
we're just simply importing react we're
creating a component with an h1 we're
rendering that component to the app ID
on meteor startup and if we head back to
our code if there's no errors that you
should see hello now if you don't see
this hello you obviously did something
wrong so check the repo that's in the
comments and compare your code or better
yet try to fix it first and then do that
okay so we now have react setup in
meteor which is great because well from
this point forward everything that we do
we can ignore this client folder and for
now we can ignore this server folder
until we get going with some Apollo
stuff and most of our components that
we're going to be doing from now and are
going to live inside of our UI folder so
for instance we just have an app right
here let's go ahead and set up our UI
folder let's make a new file and we'll
just name this app j/s ok and again
let's head back to our index file let's
copy some of this stuff paste it in and
I'm going to remove meteor here and
react to dumb we're just importing react
from react we're creating a constant app
and we're going to export app actually
let's export I'm sorry default app now
you might be wondering why I'm not just
exporting a default function here I like
this better
to be honest to export a default named
function okay so we have export default
app now from here instead of defining
our app inside of our index file we can
import
and we're going to import app from and
then from here we can go back a folder
back a folder and then head to our UI
and then app just like that okay so
check it out we now have meteor and
react talking we have our packages set
up and we have a little bit of hello
right here okay nothing crazy at all
okay so that's it we now have react set
up in our app now you might be thinking
well this was a lot of work to get
started with react and a site it's
really not that much we're just starting
it up here and by the end of this whole
thing what we're gonna have is a working
resolutions app I mean that's January
2018 so might as well have a resolutions
app where we can have sub resolutions so
it's sort of like a to-do list with sub
to-do lists right and that's going to
show us some of the excellent excellent
capabilities of graph QL and working
with relational data but we're going to
have a full stack app even with an
account system using graph QL meteor
react and MongoDB
so check it out if you want to learn how
to use Apollo this is a great place to
do it because we get access to not only
the client side but the server side as
well so thanks so much for watching and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
