up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be exploring a new sketch plugin
called magic mirror now magic mirror
allows you to essentially mirror an
entire artboard on to another shape and
allows you to use the perspective tools
and things like that to then sort of
modify that design to fit other
perspectives it's really great for
creating mock-ups onto devices to just
see your design and a new perspective
like what it might look like on a user's
phone or computer screen but it's also
great because it is non-destructive to
the artboard and it can update when you
update your artboard so it's not
necessarily a one-time and you're done
thing in that regard it functions like
symbols but quite a bit different so
we're gonna going with magic mirror for
sketch right now so here we have magic
mirror I'm going to post the link in
this plug-in to the description in the
video and you can check this out it
gives you a nice little primer about
what you can do you can even see some
examples here they have this image here
of the device on the phone and device on
another phone and the device on the
watch and in their examples they show
you some device in different
perspectives
now what this doesn't do is it doesn't
automatically insert it into one of
these images for that you'll need to do
some masking and stuff like that of your
own however what we want to be able to
do is to make this perspective on this
device and then be able to use this
plug-in to make this image itself so
here we have the magic mirror plug-in
where we can download this and it says
that for it's free for personal use but
for commercial use please consider
donating which I would highly recommend
doing you can do so at this page where
it's just you can donate five dollars
really nice and easily and what's cool
about donating is so as you can see you
can just come in here and quickly donate
via PayPal and I would highly recommend
doing that if you're using sketch for
anything sort of professional but what's
great about donating for a plugin like
this is actually give you a little bit
of incentive however they can't you see
that they give you a special package
if you in fact donate so it gives you a
sketch file that package and a license
for commercial use so you should
definitely consider donating if you like
this plugin so let's check it out you
can grab it pretty easily and sketch
toolbox so we'll just type magic and we
can go to magic mirror and let's click
install now I'm going to open up a file
that we were working on before where we
have this design we had this in the CSS
one where we're using CSS to control
this layout so we have an iPhone
artboard here and we're gonna want to
turn this in to a magic mirror now I'll
show you how easy it is to get going
we're just gonna make a new artboard and
it's not going to be any specific
dimensions here we're just going to go
ahead and then use our vector tool and
we're just going to draw some sort of a
skewed type of shape in some kind of
perspective right so you could imagine
that this might be the front of a phone
held in a certain way so here we have
this vector path and what we really need
to do is we need to give our original
artboard this iPhone 6 we need to give
this artboard a new name we're just
gonna have this name be phone layout
like so and I'm gonna copy the name in
here just so I have it in my clipboard
now what I want to do is click on this
vector path that we have here and I'm
gonna select this and paste in the same
name that we had our artboard as so we
had phone layout and now our vector
layer is also named phone layout so
we're just going to come to plugins and
then magic mirror now what we can do is
simply do this magic mirror or as you
can see we can do ctrl shift and M so
I'm going to go ahead and do the command
here control shift M and if you'll
notice nothing happened immediately now
this might not always be the case
depending on which tool that you went
ahead and used for instance if we go
ahead and make a rectangle with a fill
in it it's going to have no problem
showing up right away however what this
does is it's actually creating an image
from your lair and then sitting that is
the fill so if we select our vector
layer you'll see that it's right here in
fill so this may have definitely worked
for you or may not have worked for you
if you didn't necessarily see anything
check to make sure that your layer
didn't have the fill unchecked okay now
we can also make a rectangle here and
then we can use some transform tools to
skew and rotate this put this and maybe
some bit of a perspective here maybe
it's sitting on a table and you're
looking at it from above or something
like that so here we have this layer I'm
gonna go ahead and rename this layer as
well to the phone layout layer and I'm
going to once again do ctrl shift m' and
as you can see this time it pasted it in
here and it looks like it's not quite
the right orientation so another
keyboard shortcut command that this
magic mirror allows you to do is to
rotate your fill within the perspective
so we can do that by simply doing ctrl
command shift R and as you can see it's
now correctly looking like it might be
something that's sitting on your table
if we had a phone to use for this we
could certainly use that so let's check
out the sample sketch file that you can
download from the magic mirror website
so here you can see that they have a
just press control shift M we have an
art board we have a phone here we have
another phone image and a couple of just
static phone images here so you can
quickly see the power of a plugin like
this for creating sort of mock-ups or
just showing off how your interface will
look in a real-world situation so here
we can do ctrl shift m' once more and
you can see in a second it's going to
have all of these designs adjusted and
on to these displays and it looks really
super awesome especially these ones in
the phones where you get things like the
phone reflection on top of it and this
image right here now in another video
I'm going to show you how you can create
your own version of these images using a
phone and hand
images and things like that that you can
find around the web and we're going to
recreate something just like this
similar from scratch so you don't have
to use these ones that are sort of built
into this sketch file so as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video or this event or
Facebook at level up tutorials we love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
