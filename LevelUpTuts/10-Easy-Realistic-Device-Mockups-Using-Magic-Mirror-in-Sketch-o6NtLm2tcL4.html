love tutorials in this video we're going
to show you how you can use magic mirror
to quickly and easily create mock-ups on
actual devices within sketch now you
don't have to take this to Photoshop you
don't have to take this to any sort of
pre-made package word it puts your photo
onto this device you can do this all
yourself and have it updated dynamically
within sketch using this magic mirror
plugin so check it out let's get going
right now so as you can see here in the
last video we had these sort of
perspectives here and this is going to
be the finished product here we have an
image and we have our mock-up on top of
that phone image and what's cool about
this is that we have the glare and
everything on top of it so let's
actually go ahead and delete this
artboard entirely let's go ahead and
delete the layers and let's recreate
this from scratch so I'm going to go
ahead and make a new artboard it doesn't
really matter the size here I have that
image open in another window I'm just
going to paste it in to our artboard
this is a nexus 5 that i just grabbed
off the internet I should don't have a
great resource for finding these images
so if you know of one please post it in
the comments to help out I just got this
off of Google Images now what we want to
do is we want to go ahead and zoom in
really close on this image now what we
can do here is we want to make our
vector shape equal to the screen size of
this phone so we can hit our V key to
open the vector tool and click once in
the top right corner here now I'm going
to scroll down and I'm going to sort of
guess down here because it's sort of
tough to see we want this to look right
but it's not going to be perfect because
we can't really see this totally but
that's okay so I'm just gonna go ahead
and select there I don't feel like this
phone is that big of a chin on the
bottom so I think that should probably
be about right now you can sort of guess
the perspective here you can sort of see
it a little bit I'm going to go ahead
and click here now keep in mind if this
isn't accurate and not correct you can
always adjust it later it's not set in
stone so let's go ahead and select our
final point here and I can already see
them a little bit off so
go ahead and select this one and now
let's zoom out of our phone and it looks
like this bottom right one could come in
and down a little bit if we were to
change this color oh like white and
increase the thickness or something just
a couple of points we'd be able to see
that yeah it definitely could use some
work here so these bottom ones need to
be adjusted let's go ahead and do that
now some images are going to be easier
to work with than others so let's go up
and over up and over that should be
about right and let's go ahead and
likewise this one needed to come down
and down just a little bit and most of
this at this point is sort of just
guessing here so I'm just trying things
and see if it looks right now that looks
pretty good like I said if it's not
perfect we can always change it later
another thing I want to do here before
we use our command is I'm going to turn
on the fill just so we don't have to do
that later so you can now see we have
this sort of blank screen on this phone
now let's go ahead and rename this layer
and what we had named it before was
phone layout if you didn't check out the
last video please watch the other video
first where we show magic mirror
because magic mirror allows you to
create these perspectives so to do so we
have an art board named phone layout now
we just need a layer named phone layout
now we can do command shift M and what
you'll get is your layout thrown onto
that vector now because this isn't the
right rotation we can adjust that using
magic mirrors tools by simply doing
command ctrl shift
R
and it says nothing selected so let me
reselect this phone layer and do that
once more command control shift are
there we go and I'm gonna turn off the
border here because we don't want that
and as you can see we now have our phone
mocked up on to this device and it looks
really nice however or there's a total
lack of reflections it looks like an
image pasted on top of a phone and it's
not that great but we can easily change
this to make this into something really
nice and now this image works really
well for us because the screens
completely often it has a nice glare to
it so if you're using an image with a
screen that's on it's gonna be a bit
more difficult and you're going to have
to recreate that glare yourself entirely
using gradient tools and things like
that but luckily for this one we don't
have to do that so I can duplicate this
phone layer the image I'm gonna set it
on top of the phone layout so as you can
see we now have our phone layout with
our actual magic mirrored center
sandwich between these photo layers are
the same now what we can do with this is
we can simply select a blending layer
like soft light and you can see we know
how our image showing up underneath it
we can change the opacity to make the
glare look a little bit more reasonable
so we got like 47% here now you'll
notice what's weird though is because
we're overlaying this entire image on
top of the same image we're getting some
weird color burn here if we turn this
off you can see the background colors
are being adjusted it's not what we want
but luckily we have a vector layer here
that's in the exact shape of the content
that we want to have the glare applied
to so what we can simply do is weaken it
let's turn this layer back on we can
simply select the vector layer here by
right-clicking and select use this mask
now we're using the same vector layer as
a mask and nothing else is being
affected we can come up back to our
image and we can totally play around
with it now and just see what sort of
gradient tools and things like that make
it look a little bit more real it
realistic so we have some light coming
on the top you know maybe that's a
little bit more realistic here because
this gets so dark down here now another
interesting thing you can explore is
that in this real sort of world the
screen is slightly set in to the phone
device so it's really not pressed up
directly against the glass so in this
example it's sort of like it's the image
is directly on the glass we can do
something a little bit further by even
adding an inner shadow now you can see
by let me zoom in because it didn't
really add a whole lot but what it did
add just check will zoom in here okay
just check out this line right here you
might have to have it on the HD setting
to see this but if we toggle this it is
just adding a nice little softness that
really makes it look inset a little bit
and we didn't really even have to do in
this is the default inset shadow so I
mean I'm sure if you spent some time
playing around with it you could get a
little maybe a little bit more dramatic
with it or maybe a little bit but it
just adds something that gives this a
little bit more depth
so we've now in no time at all created a
mock-up in sketch without going to any
other programs using our application
here and what's super cool about it is
if our application changes for instance
we make this red rectangle let's make
this something totally not red we can
make it green now we do control shift M
you can see that these two updated now
the problem occurs here where this one
did not update didn't update because
when we made this a mask it actually
rename this to mask for some reason so
we can actually come back here and
rename this as phone layout click off of
it control-shift-n and as you can see
it's then updated there as well so as
long as your vector layer is named the
same as your artboard when if we do ctrl
shift m' you're going to get it updating
and that is just awesome so this is one
of my new most very most favored
plug-ins for sketch 3 check it out it
adds a lot of potential to creating
we're just really nice mock-ups for your
sketch files so as always this is Scott
we level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments
become in the video hit us up at Twitter
or Facebook at level up tutorials love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
