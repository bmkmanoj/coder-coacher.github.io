up tutorials in this video we're going
to be talking about FTP now FTP is a
technology that allows you to upload
your files on to a server in this case
we're gonna be uploading our website on
to to a blue house a shared hosting
platform where we can then view the
website at an actual domain so let's get
going on that right now so in the last
video we talked a little bit about
hosting I recommended that you sign up
for a hosting plan at Bluehost using the
level up tuts referral link if you would
like to help us or you can sign up on
your own or with another shared hosting
platform like Hostgator or something
like that either way you should now have
a domain which you got for free with
your hosting and you should have access
to either the Bluehost cPanel here if
you're following along or a similarly
looking cPanel from another hosting site
now the cPanel offers a lot of great
stuff I'm not going to get in-depth too
much because some of these are a little
bit different usually typically they
offer things like 1-click installs or
backups or file managers and things like
that however really what we want to be
doing is accessing our information for
FTP now FTP or File Transfer Protocol
allows us to take files from our
computer and put them on to the Internet
and it's not just on to the internet
it's on to a specific directory on a
computer somewhere else that we have
access to and is attached to our domain
so what we want to do is click FTP
you'll notice that we already have some
generated FTP accounts let's just go
ahead and make our own we're going to
just say Scott at and then it has my
domain name here password I'm just going
to make this something easy again it's
telling me that it's weak however I'm
just doing it easy right now for the
sake of this video I'll delete this user
afterwards
now you could even have a generator
password for you if you'd like now you
can have it select the directory as well
but we don't want necessarily anything
selected here so let's go ahead and just
click create FTP account you'll notice
that up on submit' it's going to tell
you that you actually need
a directory path here so because of that
we're going to be using just this public
underscore HTML like it's suggested to
use now when we create FTP account it
should say account created we now have
our account right here and while your
current hosting platform might not have
the exact same interfaces it should have
these similar things where you're
essentially creating a login a password
and potentially choosing what directory
to go to now let's go ahead and download
an FTP application for this video I'm
going to suggest using cyberduck not
because cyberduck is the best in fact I
wouldn't necessarily typically use
cyberduck I like to use an application
called transmit however transmit being
paid and cyberduck being free that makes
it much more difficult to follow along
in addition cyberduck is also available
for our OS X or Windows so I'm going to
download cyberduck that way you can all
follow along and we can have an FTP
going no time now this is downloading I
wanted to show you something in blue
hosts FTP which is nice that they have
this we and many other hosting platforms
have something similar we can click
configure FTP client and it's going to
give us these settings now what's cool
is that we have FTP settings directly
for cyberduck though you can open
another panel it's going to tell you to
download and install and have the
configuration going but it's nice they
give you a user name they give you the
FTP server and the port so you don't
have to guess on any of that sometimes
with different hosting platforms this
informations not exactly what you'd
expect especially like a shared hosting
plan like we have with Bluehost here so
it's nice to have these values here
explicitly given to us
not that cyberduck has been installed I
have it open right here and you'll
notice we Yi might not be immediately
obvious what we need to do however what
we want to do is click this open
connection button and you'll notice we
have some what maybe become familiar
looking fields first we have the server
which is listed here as the FTP server
so we can say FDP green sites
obviously you want this to be your own
information and not mine and then for a
username we have this as our username
this whole string here being bolded is
our username and again we would want to
enter our password where it says
password nice that the port 21 is set as
the default and you can choose to add
this to your keychain if you'd like so
that way we don't have to re-enter this
information every single time now when
we click connect you'll see some
information down here now this is asking
us if we want to use an unsecured
connection for right now we can just say
continue and what you'll notice here is
what we have is a bunch of files you'll
see a default HTML you'll see a site's
folder you'll see some backups will see
a 400-page let's actually go to this
green sites CO and see what we see right
now so you see that we're actually
getting this permission denied now what
happens if we just create a basic index
dot HTML page or better yet let's just
actually drag in our page here we can
just drag in this index dot HTML I'm
just dragging and make sure it doesn't
land in one of your folders and as you
can see as we dragged it in we now have
this upload complete green light and
it's upload of this file and I should
say that the index file is directly on
the list here if we refresh our page on
green sites Co you'll now see we're no
longer getting a permissions problem but
we're getting this our first website now
we didn't upload any of our other CSS or
any of that stuff so let's go ahead and
do that now you might be wondering why
exactly we got a permissions error
before but now everything's working just
fine well the main problem was that
there was no index file if you remember
we went over in the very first few
videos we need an index file it hit the
server the server looked into this
folder and is like I'm looking for
indexed at HTML where is it it's not
here ok there's a problem and because
this is a directory if it had different
permissions all of the
files in this directory would have been
available to be seen however the
permissions are set so a way that users
can't see all of the files in a
directory without you is explicitly
telling them that it's okay so now what
we can do is let's just drag over
everything it's going to ask us what's
good to overwrite in what's not good to
overwrite for instance I have the index
file already here and because of that
it's asking if it's ok to overwrite it
well yes I think it is now I should keep
in mind when it's over writing a file
that file is gone forever
so the version of index dot HTML that we
had on our server before is no longer
there although it is replaced with the
exact same version now when we go to
refresh you'll see that green sites Co
and if you go if you go to this URL at
the time of viewing this video you'll
see it looking like this as well you'll
see that green sites that code looks
exactly like our home page the only
difference is instead of having this
long path it doesn't even say indexed at
HTML it just says green sites Co now
these links at the bottom of our page
which didn't work at all will now take
you to the correct page and the forward
slash one will not take you to the root
of your file directory but will take you
to the root of the web site so we now
have green sites that Co on the Internet
it exists it is something so the next
step is going to be getting our local
environment working environment to act
and function more like our hosted
environment with a proper and so it's
not just loading this off of an HTML
file so like I said in the next video
we're gonna show you how you can set up
a server locally on your computer and
then from there we're just going to
improve this site dramatically we're
going to improve the way it looks we're
gonna make it more modern and we're
gonna show you how this can work in
mobile as well because right now this
site when you make it smaller
it just gets squished and it doesn't
look very good so what we're gonna do is
take this and make this design work on
all browsers so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments if you come in the
video were having up a Twitter or
Facebook I love love tutorials I love to
hear from you thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
