love tutorials in this video we're going
to be out lying sort of the project that
we're going to be making I want to be
talking about some of the tools and
techniques that you'll be learning in
this series so check it out as we start
to talk about our next major project in
meteor
we get going I thought I would show you
what exactly we're going to be building
so I didn't want to do the same sort of
applications and things that every other
tutorial was showing you how to build
yet I wanted to show you some of these
techniques so what we're building is
essentially a recipe book now this is
sort of an interesting project because
it contains a lot of cool things but
really it allows you to just add new
recipes and you'll notice that we have
the options to add a particular recipe
to a menu so let's say we wanted to make
this recipe this week we could say add
to the menu so now when we go to our
menu the current menu is just going to
be a list of the various recipes that
have been selected to be in the menu now
once you've added something to your menu
it's also going to add the ingredients
to a shopping list so we have the
ingredients here we have the menu which
is just the title in the description and
then we have the overall recipe book now
in advance iterations of this we're
going to be working on adding images
adding it tagging and making this into a
really super full-featured application
but for this intermediate series we have
some really nice things going on here we
have the things that meteors known for
like the instant updating so for
instance let's go ahead and make this a
new window and I'm going to get out of
the mobile view here so let's say you
are at the store and your significant
other is at home and all of a sudden
they want you to actually pick up some
new items so your your shopping right
this is your list as your your shopping
list
now whoever else is in charge of your
account could maybe say well we actually
want to have something additional let's
just have some sushi as well this week
so we can say shoot sushi and you can
give this just a quick description I'm
not going to spend too much time because
this is just a demo and then for
ingredients we can go ahead and say we
want to add sashimi grade tuna we got
one big ol pound of that and then we can
add something like we want some white
rice as well one bag
I kept this measurements the amount sort
of vague just because we can now just
sort of add whatever we want here
whatever language you're using now let
me click Submit you'll see we instantly
have this new dish here now of course
you being at the store you're still
seeing your shopping list like this
however when it gets added to the menu
you can see instantly without any
refreshing we're getting these new
ingredients here and for instance if we
decide we don't want trim tacos anymore
okay shrimp tacos are now off the menu
the shopping list is now just the
ingredients that are on the menu so like
I said this is a sort of a different
project I wanted to make this a little
bit more interesting than making it a
polling application or a blog or just
something very general but it should
give you a lot of nice techniques for
instance we have routing going on here
we have a schemas that are validated we
have account support we have some more
interesting data structures where we're
having a sub document that's including
the ingredients and things like that
and there's a lot of potential for the
advanced series once we want to go ahead
and and work with image uploading and
things like that and in addition to all
of that it's also built to be responsive
and what's cool is that I'm going to
provide you with the CSS for this so
when the time is right you'll be given
the CSS and you won't have to redo any
of this work and we're not necessarily
going to go too deep into it but you can
explore that because there's some may be
interesting things going on there so in
this series we're going to teach you how
to auto generate forms we're going to
teach you how to build schemas we're
going to be teaching you about a lot of
the packages that are frequently used
the routing we're going to be doing with
flow router we're going to show you how
to add Google Analytics to your routes
I'm going to be talking about a settings
JSON file that can allow you to keep the
settings private on your site that way
you can store private keys and things
like that without having to worry about
those being accessible on the client
we're gonna be talking about some
different kinds of package management
and some interesting things about sort
of project layout and options that you
have there so I hope you find this
project interesting it should teach you
a bunch of great techniques and packages
that you can use to apply to build
whatever sort of web application you're
interested in building as always if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment
video hit me up at Twitter or Facebook
at level up tutorials in the next video
we're going to get our project started
we're going to get going and we're going
to start showing you some different ways
to add your packages into your project
so as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
