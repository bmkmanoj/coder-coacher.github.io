up huts and in the last video we went
over how to create a configurable
product using Magento and if you
remember nothing showed up after we
created the product well that's because
we needed to create smaller products
simple products that are associated with
that product well luckily Magento makes
it really easy if you recall before when
we created a simple product we had to go
through the whole business of adding a
product and filling in all the
information the price and everything
like that but if you want to do that for
a configurable product Magento makes it
nice and easy so you don't have to
create it outside here and then have to
have all that information to be
different you can actually create it
right within your configurable product
so let's click on our configurable
product that we created last time and
here we are just as we left it and if
you notice down here this is associated
products this doesn't exist on these
sample products I mean on the simple
products so this only exists on the
configurable products so let's click
this so there's some things to see here
you can create a simple associated
product just by clicking create empty or
copy from configurable or you can do it
what I find is the easiest way you can
do it here in this quick simple product
creation so if we want to uncheck this
Auto generate we want to give this a
name we want to say this is new Tut MOV
and the SKU number will be the same the
weight is the same the status is enabled
visibility is in catalog and search and
our format we're going to have this be
MOV and quantity this is how many you
have in stock we'll have a whole lot of
them in stock okay so this price this is
if you want to have different products
be different prices since I have a MKV
movie file format as one of my options
it's like a premium it's like a high-def
movie then I can bump up the price here
you can do it fixed or by percentage
well this MOV isn't going to have a bump
in price so I'm just going to do quick
create right here and once we've created
and you can see it just pops it right
down here and these are the products
that are associated with this particular
product as you can see the format is MOV
new Ted MOV ok let's create another one
let's do MKV or woven MKV okay and
weight is still 0 notice how it keeps
the stuff filled in for you so it just
makes it super easy the only thing you
actually have to select here is the
format and since this one was $10 I'll
have this would be $15 just because this
is a high def format quick create again
ok now we have to alright just one more
I want to do an mp4 okay we'll leave
this all the same format mp4 this time
the price is still the same we create ok
here's our 4 here's our 3 products and
you'll notice how they all have
different product IDs that's because
these are individual products they're
just being sort of grouped under this
larger tent of this this large product
ok so let's click Save now let's go back
to our tutorials page and we should
refresh and now you see we actually have
another product showing up um it didn't
show up before but now we heard is new
Tut - ok we'll click this and if you
remember we had two separate images here
you'll notice that we have a second
image down here if we click this one it
opens up in a larger window just as this
one would if you were to click it up so
now we have two images associated with
it you can do all sorts of cool stuff
with that later
ok so format you'll notice here now is
in a drop-down we can select any of
these notice how it says plus $15 for
MKV so the MK V is going to come out to
being $25 so if we select this it's no
$25 in our price has been bumped up and
any of these others are just going to be
15 or it'll say minus 15 and that makes
it back to $10 so um you'll notice when
your customers come to this page it's
actually choose an option and it says
it's required if we try to add this to
our cart it's going to highlight this
and say
you have to do this so your clients
can't get away with adding a t-shirt to
your cart that doesn't have a size if
you need it to have a size so let's
select MKV because we're want to spend
some money and we'll click Add to Cart
ok here it is here's this a new tattoo
in the format of MKV ok so that's how
you create simple products that get
assigned as associated products to your
configurable products ok it sounds like
a lot but really it's just you have
these smaller chunks that are being
associated with a larger chunk and the
larger chunk houses all the information
that doesn't change like the description
the name of the product you know where
the manufacturers or any of that stuff
basically anything that doesn't change
is in the configurable product and then
the simple product is only the stuff
that changes the weights are the format
or whatever your option is and if you
have installed the sample data you can
go through their options you can add a
new they have t-shirts and stuff so we
could go through and add a new t-shirt
and it's going to be the exact same in
fact if we just click catalog manage
products add product we want to say
shirts t-shirt configurable product
continue it's going to say which one
these do you want to be configurable
options gender shirt size color so it um
this is how you do any of that sort of
stuff if you're looking to create
products that have options okay well
