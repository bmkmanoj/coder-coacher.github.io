up a little bit we fix some of our
issues honestly this thing looks super
ugly I'm sorry for that I should just
start using a CSS framework in some of
these to atleast not have them look so
vile off the bat or something and this
video I'm gonna be talking about well
one of the issues that we're having here
which is unauthorized resolutions I
showed you in the last video I can make
an unauthorized resolution as a non
logged in user and this API is not going
to care because it's not attached to a
user just ends up in this Bank of
unattached resolutions now obviously in
a kind of platform like this we would
like it to only accept resolutions from
those that are logged in so how can we
go about doing that well check it out
I think one of the things we need to
realize is that inside of our resolvers
for instance our mutation down here our
create resolution right we are doing
this insert and we have access to the
user ID and we're returning a resolution
and while this mutation is looking for a
resolution to be returned right it
doesn't necessarily always need to
insert one I mean this is an API and
whether or not this API is available you
know through an interface if you're
building this API this create resolution
in graph you well this thing will be
publicly available as in that you could
come into you could make a query against
this or a mutation against this API
because it's publicly available and
right now this application isn't going
to care it's just going to insert these
let's leaving you up into a lot of
potential abuse now obviously we want to
protect against that and we have access
to a logged in user so we should protect
this mutation with oh that login so we
can do a simple if if the user ID exists
if there's no user ID this is going to
come in as undefined right so if this is
defined if a user ID exists then we're
gonna want to go ahead and say hey now
we can insert this resolution cool okay
otherwise we're going to
you throw a new error and this error is
just simply going to be on uh seven
authorised capital a I don't even know
although arised I feel like I should
know that unauthorized I don't know if
this is a hyphenated word somebody let
me know in the comment the correct way
to do in sort of English here
that's not my strong suit so let's check
it out here in this basic mutation we're
saying hey if the user exists then go
ahead and insert the resolution
otherwise go ahead and throw a node
error which is just going to be
unauthorized and if we had to our
application let's go ahead and try to
add a new resolution now notice how
we're not logged in we can say hey
what's up I'm sorry about these
resolution names being so terrible here
I can submit and we get a graph QL error
it says a graph QL unauthorized actress
here's the stack trace whatever and
that's okay it's throwing an error and
it's popping up in our our counsel here
if we were to look in our command line
we would also see the error being thrown
inside of our terminal let me just pop
this down here you can see it briefly
doesn't really to much matter but that's
not necessarily what we want to do now
let's check out inside of our resolution
form and you'll remember we had our this
type props that create resolution
mutation and we said hey catch an error
and if an error exists console.log that
error which is why you're seeing the
error show up right here and that's
great
I mean that's a really excellent thing
to have happen this errors been
swallowed up by our application and we
are able to take care of it
so let's actually come in here and well
you'll see that the log for the error is
going to look like this if we open up
this error object we have the error
message which is graph QL error
unauthorized so we can simply output
this sort of error and we can do so
maybe inside of a state there's probably
other better ways to do this to be
honest but we just want to have a simple
alert we're going to say error is equal
to null okay so we're defining our
initial state with error is equal to no
at this point we're gonna say this that
set state error is going to be equal to
error message error message okay and
from at this point we can now output the
error message in here inside of just a
paragraph tag or we can do something
like this with two brackets and say this
that state that error so if this dot
state dot error exists double ampersand
then we're going to go ahead and do a
simple paragraph tag and say error
message so we can have our brackets this
that state that error okay and then wrap
up this P tag here now obviously you'd
want to style this you'd want to make it
read you'd want to make this be some
sort of error that makes sense here if
we come back I go to submit a new
authorised submit we could say hi submit
graph QL error unauthorized obviously
you could tweak this to make this say
unauthorized requests or whatever you
would like here this is just a way that
we can take this error is headed to a
state and display it to a user now
honestly I think a better way would be
to just not show this form at all in
fact we're going to be doing that now
but let's talk about another aspect
because I mentioned that anything inside
of our resolvers or our mutations in
here like our create resolution mutation
this is public so what about our goals
resolver where we're able to toggle a
goal so the toggle goal accepts an ID
now you could lock this one down a
little bit more by bringing in the user
ID finding the goal comparing the user
ID to the current goal and making sure
that those are equal right but this is
accepting an ID and to run this mutation
you would have to somehow know the ID of
an object of something that's in the
database if they don't have access to
any ways so to me this is less of a
concern it's something you could
certainly lock down much further however
one thing that we do want to do is
certainly lock down create a goal
because create a goal is simply just
going to insert something into our
database so we don't want
somebody'd be able to just insert goals
willy-nilly into our database obviously
willy nilly is the right way to go there
so just like our create resolution I'm
gonna do a comma user ID on our create
goal comma user ID and I can just go
ahead and snatch this whole thing I'm
gonna snatch this if line by itself and
paste this in here the next I'm going to
snatch this closing bracket as well as
the throw unauthorized error right down
right down right down here okay
save this let es lint do its thing okay
so just like that I have protected by
create goal now again we have access to
the user ID we have access to the goal
if you want to lock down things even
more like I said with this toggle goal
you could then do a find on the goals
you could do the user ID compare the IDs
make sure that user is the same user in
a higher stakes situation you would
probably want to do that but this is
gonna be the the way the land for
locking down your graph QL mutations
within meteor we do have access to the
user ID here for any logged in user we
might as well take full advantage of it
to make sure that the user is logged in
or correct before doing anything okay so
this is a little bit more locking our
mutations so if you have on other
strategies for locking down your
mutations or queries let me know in the
comments I want to keep this a graph QL
dialogue up and going Apollo graph QL
all this stuff is super new so I can't
wait to learn even more about everything
in the way the land and I hope that you
have picked up quite a bit from this
series so in the next video I'm going to
be tweaking the interface and we're
going to be talking a little bit about
what's next as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you want to help
support level up tutorials I don't know
how to level up tutorials calm you can
become a pro or purchase any of these
excellent series that I have handcrafted
at myself every single month we have
modern CSS layouts react and redux for
every one level to react native with
graph QL ease these are the three latest
new series on level up tutorials and
this month is going to be pro gatsby so
this will be the second
a month of a new graph QL pro series as
well as this free series that I've been
doing and I'm going to continue the free
graph QL videos here on this channel as
well so thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
