up tuts and today we're going to be
talking about some CMS page stuff okay
most specifically I'm going to be
showing you how to edit the about Us
page so if we come down here in the
footer you'll see this link about us and
if you clicked on this you would see
these three paragraphs you know some
pink color or whatever and you can be
wondering where exactly this was coming
from well luckily we have our dashboard
and in our dashboard we have a CMS and
then pages so if you click on pages
you'll see some of the pages that are
here including the 404 page the privacy
policy page the home page the home page
with two columns which is actually the
one it's enabled you know this one says
disabled enable cookies page a customer
service page and about us so let's click
on this a preview button right here on
the side and you can see the actual page
notice how this is just a preview it's
opening up in a new window but it's not
actually the same URL as this but okay
let's click out of this so let's click
this about us here it's going to take us
to where we can edit so this is going to
say all store views its statuses enabled
if we turn it off it will not be showing
up this we can change the pages title
the URL key see like if we want to just
say about - us this is now going to be
the URL which I think is a little bit
better than whatever they had before
okay so now if I click content here in
the far left you'll see this content
editor this is the WYSIWYG editor this
is where we can change and completely
edit any of that stuff
if you click show/hide editor right here
you can see this is actually giving you
access to the HTML itself notice how
there's a div class of call one call to
call three you can just fill in what you
want in between those and it's going to
keep this three column set as long as
you don't get rid of any of these
classes all you know you could also just
from here take this and edit this one
paragraph at a time if that's what
you're interested in doing notice how if
I click back here where was that I typed
low just like this
it's right here so this actually kept in
the columns
you know I'd PI feel more comfortable
just editing the HTML myself however if
you're a content editor you don't know
HTML you can definitely use this content
WYSIWYG editor it's also quick for
styling if you want to change something
to a head header or something like that
you can you know bold things you can do
all sorts of stuff that also gives to
the option of adding variables and these
widgets so we can insert a widget but we
don't actually have any widgets just yet
let's see what happens if we even click
that yeah it's going to say okay you
want to insert a CMS page link aesthetic
block category link pretty much you can
insert any of these you can add this
recently compared products right here
and you can just say display five
products in a compare products grid and
click insert and it's going to insert
this code here that when this executes
it's going to actually have those
recently shown project products on this
page well actually leave this one even
in here even though it's a little
ridiculous to be using this it's
perfectly fine you know whatever this is
just a test site cool so you can just
get in here and change any of this text
make it nice and perfect however you
want it and you'll notice I didn't do it
ton here whatever now design you can say
this is one column you can make sure
there's a left car left sidebar right
sidebar three columns if you'd like
we're gonna leave this up one column so
sort of like this three column look and
you can also give a custom design that
runs from a certain time to a certain
time I'm not going to bother you can
also give this metadata just you know so
the page has metadata let's save this
page and let's see our new about Us page
I'm gonna come back here and I'm going
to refresh and as you'll notice uh this
URL no longer exists is taking us to a
404 page okay so this doesn't exist as
if you remember we changed our URL to
Magento store or about us about - us so
now that we did that we can see all the
edits that we made including this hello
text that we edit and our recently
viewed products here let's go back to
our template actually
let's check something out show files
okay so this template isn't inside of
this three column set I actually don't
know if this would obey the laws of the
three comb such as it is you might need
to use your powers of CSS to make this
look nice in here ya see this sort of
just messes it up but as you can see the
content is in there using this uh this
widget so of course you couldn't put
this however you want I don't know why
you'd want to do the suddenly about page
anyways however for some reason if you
felt so inclined you could do that and
it would be all good let's refresh this
and here is our about page okay so you
could put images you can put text you
can change the columns here any of the
stuff and it's going to be good okay so
the same thing goes with this privacy
policy page it's just another template
right here where is it at privacy policy
is right here here it is and it's the
same thing for the home page so if we
just click this home page go to content
you can see here's the images here's the
it's grabbing the popular that I think
you can see what's it actually grabbing
on the home page the best selling
products so this is the template right
here best selling products here we are
all this stuff and this is how you edit
it okay so these are the CMS pages in
Magento you can also create your own CMS
page we're going to go over that later
it's not really needed right now and
that's that's how you create or edit the
pages that already exist in here the
home page about us and need that stuff
okay
so if you have any questions uh you know
