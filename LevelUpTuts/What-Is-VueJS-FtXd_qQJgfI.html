going to be fulfilling a much requested
topic so before you say that this is an
advertisement for my new series which it
will be mentioning it's certainly
something that a lot of people have been
asking for this video is what is view J
s now view J s is a new ish JavaScript
framework now it says it's the
progressive JavaScript framework now at
the end of the day what the JavaScript
framework is in this sort of regard is
just some way to add interactivity to
your page right whether it's just plain
JavaScript or you're using a framework
like angular or react or review or
you're using a library like jQuery at
the end of the day it's all for building
interactivity into your websites and
with UJS you could drop in a view to a
single div and add this interactivity or
you could build your entire application
view just like you would react your
angular or anything like that so what
view jas does is it takes some ideas
from all of the other sort of modern j/s
frameworks and sort of combines them
into a really nice modern mix of
different types of ideas for instance we
have at the view sort of a template here
where you have sort of handlebar style
template tags and this isn't necessarily
JSX and it's not JavaScript and it's not
HTML it's sort of its own thing right
and if you come from angular land the
templates in view are going to see more
familiar now we also have this sort of
style where we have an export default
object where we have things like our
data or computed properties or lifecycle
hooks now at the end of the day view j/s
is really just a way to build
applications or websites and JavaScript
and the fans of react and angular will
both find things here that they find
familiar or like in particular for
instance people who use the angular
version one will find things like the ng
for very sort of
analogous to the way that view handles
for loops let me go ahead and find my
movies list you can see that we have
essentially a v4 right which is v4 movie
in movies this is going to feel very at
home for angular people and just like
that we also have components with props
so if you're used to react those of you
who are used to components based
workflows using props will also find
things that they find very familiar
passing in a prop to a component is a
little bit different but the ideas are
the exact same so you can see examples
of some view code here we have our
template which has our HTML and what are
called directives again from angular
folks will feel very comfortable with
this and then we have things like
components next we have our JavaScript
part of our view file where we can
import things from other components we
can set our data we can have lifecycle
methods we can have methods that are
triggered via actions or via lifecycle
methods and stuff like that we can have
our components that we're using and we
can even have things like computed
properties that give us access to
template tags that are really just
pretty much anything you want whether
it's modifying props or data in your
component or just simply outputting
something new now one of the other cool
things about you is the weight handles
CSS you basically have your style tags
inside of each of your files and you
couldn't scope them directly on your
style tag so for instance this style tag
even though we're not attaching this UL
to anything specific we're not saying
hey this is a particular class we are
saying this is scoped to this file and
that means that hey if I use an
unordered list anywhere else in my
application it's not going to get these
styles but if I use an unordered list
inside of this component which I do is
going to get the styles that are scoped
directly here so there's a lot of really
nice built-in goodies here and that's
the thing I really like about view jas
is it really actually takes care of so
many things for you that other
frameworks make you do yourself now if
you're the type of person who likes to
do everything yourself and have
everything super explicit you might not
love
view but if you're the type that likes
to save time and actually you know spend
a lot of time making things rather than
writing a lot of boilerplate code and
stuff like that then you're going to
definitely like a lot of aspects of view
now view jeaious was originally created
by avenue as a way to sort of be a
modern accessible JavaScript framework
something that you could get up and
running with quickly get some real
results but also maintain a lot of the
things that people really liked about
the modern Jas frameworks and again this
component based workflow is going to
make anyone who's used anything like
react feel very at home so if you're
interested in learning more about view
Jas you can come to view jst org you can
watch this little wide view you can
click get started one of the things I
love about view is their documentation
their API their cookbook all of this
stuff is excellent and on top of that I
found their ecosystem part of their site
to be extremely valuable too I went on
the chat room to solve a problem I was
having and in the discord room there
there was a lot of people ready to jump
and help solve my problem even though I
was obviously a beginner at view so
definitely the community seemed very
very open and definitely the type of
community that you'd want to have around
a project like this so if you want to
learn more about view head over to view
JSTOR again the documentation everything
is excellent if you want to learn how to
build applications in view j/s this is
the part where my a little advertisement
comes in so you can probably just skip
this part if you're not interested but
if you want to learn VJs from the ground
up head to level up tutorials comm
forward slash store view js4 every one
is a full on tutorial series of 24
videos long that will teach you how to
build real applications in view j/s we
do all sorts of stuff from just
understanding the basics and
foundational concepts behind view but
also hitting an API doing routing doing
some animations and just really
understanding how to build applications
by the end of this course you're gonna
feel like you can build a full-on web
application in view and at least know
where to go if there's additional
things you need to pick up so check it
out if you want to learn view J s I
highly recommend view J s for everyone
it is currently on sale and only for the
month of April here come May this price
is going back up and if you're watching
this video in May of 2018 don't worry it
will go on sale again I just don't know
when yet so take advantage of this
limited time price and get this thing
for 29 bucks and start learning view
you're going to be seriously amazed at
just how productive you can be with view
J s now I have a few preview videos I
think the first five videos of this
series are going to be released on the
YouTube channel so keep your eyes open
for that that may happen as soon as this
Friday so again view J s is a modern
JavaScript framework as a way that you
can add interactivity to your pages but
it's also a way that you can build
full-on JavaScript apps with everything
from routing to animations to all sorts
of that good stuff so I don't know do
view JSTOR learn more about this and try
out view right one of my favorite things
about web development and all these
different frameworks people want to to
claim and say there's too many
frameworks or whatever like that
well every single time a new framework
comes out it gives you a different idea
about how to do things so if you're a
react developer an angular developer or
anything I highly recommend trying out
view just to give yourself a different
perspective and who knows you might even
be a little bit more productive with it
or you might not so again check it out
thanks so much for watching as always
this Scout would level up tutorials
thing I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
