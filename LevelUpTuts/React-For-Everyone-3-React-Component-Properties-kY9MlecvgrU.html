up tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you how to work with
properties or props within react we're
gonna cover some introductory stuff as
well as some best practices so let's get
going on that right now so now it's time
to introduce properties or as frequently
referred to as props and react where you
can add a property onto a given
component and the pass information into
that property that you can then use
inside of your component now props will
become a very important part about how
you use react but for now let's just
build a very quick example so that you
can exactly see the syntax and how we
build props so let's come to our code
here and the first thing we want to do
is we want to actually pass in a prop to
this element here so in our component we
can just simply say name and name can be
equal to anything right you could pass
in an object in here you could pass in
JavaScript in here and in fact if you
have brackets like so you could pass in
any sort of JavaScript you could say
something like false you could have an
expression but either way we're just
going to be passing this in a string
right now and the string is just going
to be Scott I'm gonna be saying hello to
myself here
okay so name is now equal to a string of
Scott what that means is that inside of
our component here keep in mind that
this react dumb render I'm gonna give
some space here and this hello world
component these are very separate things
this is just saying render the component
to the screen this right here is the
component itself so we've passed this
value Scott into the component right
here and now we don't have to do
anything here to actually get this
component working all we have to do is
simply inside of our code here we can
have our brackets like so and what we
can have is this dot props dot and then
the property so we can say name so now
hello world this should not become hello
Scott as this dot props that name looks
for the props passed into hello world
and sees Scott so let's head to our page
it's refresh I'm gonna bump this up just
so it's blatantly obvious that this is
hello Scott and as you can see if we
were to change us to anything hello Tim
refresh hello Tim okay so now as you can
see we have quickly and easily added a
property to our component now I'm gonna
open up my inspector here now one thing
we can do here is we can add a default
prop for instance we can come here and
inside of our component before our
render function here if we hit a space
here and we want to create a new
function and now this function is
something that's created by react it
will run before your component is
rendered so we can say get default props
get default props is also a function and
because this is an object we need to go
round this off with a comma here so
instead of our get default props what we
can simply do is return an object so we
have curly brackets and then we can give
us some values here so we can say name
and name can be equal to Scott okay so
the default value for name is now going
to be Scott so in this instance we're
passing in Timm Timm is still going to
override scott right because Scott's
just the default value if we removed him
entirely from the picture here and we
just say hello world it's not going to
say it's not going to give us an error
and it's not going to be blank it's
going to say hello Scott now it's a
really good practice to define your
props and what their types are in your
component that's way it's sort of self
documenting and in addition to that if
you aren't using the correct prop type
when you pass your value into it you'll
see an error so let's go ahead and check
that out right so what we can add here
is we can add prop types now prop types
is going to be an object again this
whole thing is a JavaScript object so we
need to have a comma
that now we can simply say name and we
want to give this a prop type so to do
that we could say react dot prop types
notice how this is camel case with a
capital P and then the last value here
is going to be what type it actually is
so since this is expecting a string
we're can say string and the prop types
available our array bool func
number object and string so if you're
passing it in a function do not type
function if you're passing in a boolean
do not type boolean it's bool and func
now here we can actually let's try to
pass this in something that's not a
string so we could say name is equal to
and then just pass it in false right
we're gonna pass it in a boolean it's
going to now when we refresh it's gonna
say failed prop type invalid prop name
type of boolean supplied expected string
so this is great if we wouldn't have had
that statement we wouldn't have gotten
this error that would have said hey if
we're looking for a string here so it's
important to define your prop types even
though it's not necessary for this to
work now in addition if you want to make
this property required right now this
isn't required right if we don't have
anything here it's going to output Scott
right if we want to make this prop
required what we can actually just
simply say is tack on the end of the
string period is required okay and
that's very simple
now when we very fresh we do see Scott
here that's because we have a default
type if we were to give rid of this
default type save this refresh you can
see it's saying that name was required
we add this back and it's going to be
all good awesome so this is a great
introduction to properties in react now
properties are going to become a lot
more important over the course of the
series as we're passing in objects and
then we're iterating over objects and
we're passing data down through our
components now in the next video we're
going to pass them in
information into our first component
which will be then carry down into our
second component to illustrate the
downstream approach of data so as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
