up tutorials and in this video I'm going
to be talking about bug replay now I
need to mention before I get started at
that this video is sponsored by bug
replay however I do feel like this is an
extremely important and interesting tool
for teams now what bug replay does is it
allows you to essentially screen record
via a Chrome extension while you're
using the site and it's going to collect
bugs you can see they have some sort of
default reports in here so you can check
them out here's a default report I can
press play I can see not only what's
going on in the network traffic but I
also can see the JavaScript logs and
basically if they're getting any sort of
error this is going to let the
developers really know how to fix stuff
so the the point of bug replay is to
make it so that non-technical people can
report bugs accurately which is a huge
need I've been on so many teams and
professional projects that I you you get
feedback from people and they're just
saying oh I tried to click on this and
it didn't work like okay well this gave
me no information and it's not helpful
and it's gonna be very very difficult to
solve this problem but imagine you had a
video that showed exactly what the user
was doing so you don't have to rely on
their words and not only that but you
get the network traffic and you get the
JavaScript logs and it's all catalogued
what's super cool about this is you can
connect it to your your your slack
channel you can connect it to your issue
tracker if I go to like integrations
over here let's say add integration you
could see you could connect directly to
github JIRA or slack so it's a super
cool product that I do want to take a
time to highlight and like I've
mentioned this video is sponsored but I
can just think of a billion times in
which this tool would have made my life
a ton easier so what we're gonna do in
this video is we're going to do a quick
bug find on level up tutorials I'm going
to first install the bug replay Chrome
extension because that's really all you
need to get started
other than an account so I'm going to
click add extension get this going
select bug replay here and you'll notice
because I'm logged into the site it's
already up and running it's hanging
cannot be used on this page which makes
sense because this is you know Chrome
Web Store extensions let's go ahead and
head to level up tutorials calm and now
I'm gonna go ahead and click the
shortcut and then the video recorder so
you'll notice we get this little message
it says bug replay is debugging okay I
have a countdown in the timer you're not
gonna see that in the Chrome extension I
can go and navigate to the site let's
click on a page you can see it allows me
to use my site like totally normal and
let's actually go ahead and try to find
something that is broken that I know is
broken if I hit the back button and then
the back button again well actually that
didn't do anything okay let's select
tutorials let's scroll down now let's
hit the back button and you can see the
logo here is not correct because it
didn't sue muss up to the top which is
what this needs to be able to know and
now I'm gonna go ahead and just stop the
recording and you'll see we now have
this little recording window now what's
great about this is if I'm a
non-technical person
I can't articulate exactly what happened
there all I know is the logo got messed
up I don't know under what conditions it
caused it to get messed up so I can just
go save this under as navigating and and
logo messes up ok and let's just click
Save ok so what's cool about that is our
video is now processing and if we head
back to bug replay and I give this a
refresh we still have the sample of
reports we have a nice little customer
service down here I'm gonna click clear
all on these and I just got a chrome
notification saying that bug replay is
ready so what's cool about this is now
under team reports I have my navigating
and logo messes up and I can come in
here and okay we got more customer
service ok well we can come in here and
I can press play and one of the most
interesting things here is we also have
report details down here if I click this
tab you can see I know I'm on which of
of which operating system which version
of which browser I'm on the total memory
our cookies enabled the timezone offset
and if we get far enough in here let's
go ahead you can see that I'm now
getting that this logo is now messed up
here so now I can come in here and I can
effectively know that what's going on
with the network I can know that there
were no actual JavaScript errors when
this is happening which leads me to
believe it's just a problem with the
implementation I actually know what the
problem is here it's that when you
change routes via the back button it
doesn't trigger as a new route and
therefore it's not telling reactor to
zoom up to the top fYI if anyone knows
how to fix this reach out to me cuz I
actually don't know how to fix this I
haven't done a ton of investigation
though however people do comment on this
a lot it just has to do with the back
button though okay so here we now have
video proof of this issue happening and
we have definitive report details as to
what's going on now this is SuperDuper
cool because like I said you don't have
to rely on the word of your coworker to
say hey I was clicking around and the
logo got messed up and in that case you
would click her on the site and you
couldn't get the logo to mess up and you
wouldn't know the exact conditions of
the user hitting the back button right
and so now you can actually see exactly
what they did and how they did it so
this is one of those tools that I think
is really super great especially if
you're working in teams now one of the
things that makes this great for teams
is that you can add additional users as
you want and now what's cool about this
is you can add a whole bunch of people
to your team at no cost and get up and
running that way now we can also share
this video if you click this little
pencil here we can click share and you
can get a public link if you want we can
click this share and get a public link
and I can share that with other people
that aren't necessarily even a part of
my team and saying hey look at this
issue tell me what is going on here
what's up so I really like bug root play
I mentioned a couple times this video is
sponsored by bug replay but this tool is
super duper cool
and definitely something that I love to
see because it just sort of fixes this
major problem in which we have people
testing and we have developers and a lot
of times those communication channels
can get totally mixed up so check out
bug replay head to bug replay comm check
it out if you're working on a team go
ahead and create an account install the
extension and try it out for like the 30
day trial I think you're gonna be pretty
impressed with how nice this makes bug
finding so check it out again bug replay
calm and thank you so much for bug
replay for sponsoring this channel and
helping to promote free tutorials on
level up tutorials so thank you so much
for watching check it out
love this tool and I'll see you the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
