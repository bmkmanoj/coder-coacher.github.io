up Tut's and this isn't going to be a
full-on tutorial and in fact it might
not be very informational at all however
what I'm going to do is tell you a
little bit about what we just did and
where we're going to go from here so
this is the end of the wordpress basics
with the skills that you have from these
past 20 or so videos I think there's
maybe like this is maybe number 19 we
have made a post made a page we've added
things to the menu we've added on to
WordPress with plugins we've added on
with widgets we've downloaded and
installed themes and we've even updated
a version of WordPress so all of those
functions are what you should be able to
need to successfully run your own
WordPress site now from here we're going
to take it into a more customizing
WordPress route so the next few videos
are going to be about the actual file
structure the files that are actually
make up WordPress right
what makes WordPress do what it does and
then from there we're going to talk
about theming so we're going to build a
theme from a parent theme and then we're
going to write our own theme from
scratch we're also going to be getting
into editing templates along the way to
add things like more widgets owns and
stuff like that and then we're going to
move on to advanced topics like writing
your own plugins and truly understanding
WordPress and being able to completely
control it add on to it you're going to
be writing a custom post types and stuff
like that
and then being able to display and
control your data you're going to be
able to walk through menus and exactly
output the code as you want and you're
going to learn a lot about PHP along the
way and not just PHP you're going to
learn a lot about WordPress so starting
next week we're going to be diving
- customizing WordPress so please
continue along with the customizing
WordPress series and learn a little bit
about how to further control your site
also if there's any topics you believe
belonged in the WordPress basics series
that we didn't cover and you would like
to see covered please let us know and we
will add on to the WordPress basics
series in addition to moving on with the
customizing WordPress series so as
always this is Scott with level up
