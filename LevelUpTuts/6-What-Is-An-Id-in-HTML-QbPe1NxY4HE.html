up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be talking about IDs and HTML when
to use them when not to use them how to
use them and what you can do with them
so people actually we're gonna get into
that right now so in the last video we
talked a little bit about display:inline
and display:block and those are two sort
of default ways that elements are
displayed now in this video we're going
to be talking about something called an
ID now an ID is a way to sort of
identify a particular element on your
page now IDs are only supposed to be
assigned to one element as in if we have
a paragraph tag here we can say
something like ID is equal to and then
inside of quotes we can say main - text
okay and what this is doing is
identifying this paragraph as the main
text now what we can't do is we can't
come over to our footer and use main
text as an ID again now if we come to
our HTML and we've refresh you'll notice
nothing's complaining about us using an
ID for both of these items however that
just goes against the very rules of
using an ID now an idea supposed to
identify one element and it's supposed
to be used as a way to really pinpoint
one element and so for an ID it has to
be in quotes here it has to be at least
one character along it may not contain
any spaces so we can't say main space
text like that we want it to be
hyphenated or underscored or whatever
particular style you're working with I
typically use hyphens to separate words
myself and even though it is case
insensitive as in you could have a
capital t here instead of a lowercase t
it's fairly common to see IDs just in a
completely lower case so now what are
some things you can do with IDs well you
can style off of an ID so we could come
to our CSS which was our Styles CSS
you'll remember we just and just a
second ago we had our our main text I'm
just pasting this in here like so and
how you can reference an element using
its ID in CSS is by simply saying pound
then the ID name and then we have our
brackets and we can say color equals
let's just give this an ugly blue color
so we can say blue and let's come back
here and refresh you can see anything
what that ID is getting the color blue
but like I said we only want one item to
have an ID also even though we can style
based off of an ID doesn't necessarily
mean we should for reasons that may not
be obvious right now and don't really
matter we'll be using something else to
do most of our styling off of now you
may see some people use IDs but there
has been definitive studies that show
that browser performance is worse when
styling off an ID as opposed to a class
so we'll go over what classes are in the
next video but for right now just simply
know that you can do this although it's
not necessarily the best idea all the
time okay so in addition to styling we
can also link to IDs so for instance
let's just throw in a ton of sort of
blank text here so I'm gonna have a
paragraph tag and I'm gonna paste this
in here and I'm going to grab what's
called lorem ipsum so we can type in
lower them if some and if you're
familiar with design at all there's
frequently used to generate lorem ipsum
text which just sort of like fake text
that looks real it's frequently used
lorem ipsum text to sort of add in fake
text that that sort of looks accurate
okay so I'm just this is just temporary
here so now when we refresh you can see
we have all this text so the reason I
did this is because I wanted to prove to
you that we can link to a particular ID
you see that we have to scroll all the
way bottom to down here to get to the
footer however let's assign our footer
and ID and we can just sign this as ID
equals
footer like so now let's come up to the
top here and just beneath our h2 let's
go ahead and add in an anchor tag which
is an a so this is a linking tag now we
haven't gone over anchor tags really
this is how you can possibly link to
another page but in addition to linking
to another page you can also link to an
ID on the same page so we can say href
that stands for hypertext reference or
it's typically just pronounced href and
from here if we're not giving this a
specific page we can give this an ID and
we do so just by the same way we use
this for our Styles by saying pound and
then the ID name now let's wrap that up
and inside of here let's say link to
footer okay now we close up that anchor
tag like so and let's come back to our
page and refresh now when we click this
link to footer you can see it's going to
jump us down to the footer now the
reason that's not going further down
than this is this is the bottom of the
page it's as far down as it gets but
typically if you were to have an ID
let's add an ID to this paragraph text
right here the second paragraph we added
we can have this be ID equals long text
and I'm going to just go ahead and use
this ID and our link instead of the
footer like so now if we come here we
can click link to footer even though
it's not the the footer anymore we can
click this and you can see it jumps us
to the very top of this paragraph so
this is how you use direct people to
various content on your page if you ever
see some website with a link that just
jumps you to another point in the page
this is how they are accomplishing that
so you can use IDs to style off of you
can use them as an anchor link and you
can actually use them in a lot of ways
in JavaScript to identify a specific
element however we haven't really gotten
into any JavaScript stuff like that so
that should not
and be on your radar yet however just
know in the future that IDs are always
pretty much used to identify a very
specific element on your page so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video
artists up at Twitter or Facebook at
level up tutorials we'd love to hear
from you thanks for watching and we'll
see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
