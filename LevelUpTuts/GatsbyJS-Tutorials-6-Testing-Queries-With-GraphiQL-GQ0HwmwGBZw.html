first post going and you saw how we did
that we basically we wrote our post in
markdown and we headed our path in this
top part called the frontmatter
now let's go ahead and explore what it's
gonna take to have an index page because
obviously with any blog you want to have
someplace to arrive at your pages I mean
right now having to go to first post is
not a great idea but in the last video I
did challenge you to do this to find the
post and iterate over it right and
before we get going on the actual doing
of that let's go ahead and explore
something that happens to come with
graph QL and gatsby here because gatsby
is using graph QL and if you head to
your command line you can see only make
this quite a bit bigger here you don't
need to do this you don't actually need
to see this and here you can just go to
this path but might as well you can see
that your graph QL debugger is running
at and then let me move this over a path
in which my path right now is just
localhost port 8000 so chances are if
you have this running and you don't have
any other sites running you can go to
localhost port 8000 forward slash 3
underscores and then graph QL let's
actually head here and see what this is
all about and as you can see we have a
nice little graphical editor here where
it allows you to write some queries and
you can see a little bit of info about
this which you can read on your own time
let me bump up this font size here
although this kind of kills some of this
interface I want to make this easy for
you to see me add some space at the
bottom of this file just to push this
stuff up okay there we go you can see we
have our graph QL query which is really
just looking for at this point all
remark markdown or all markdown remark I
should say limit of 1000 edges node
field slug and we can run this query
simply by hitting the play button now
you can see week
and not query fields on type markdown
remark okay so by default whatever I
have in here is not quite working so
let's go ahead and head back to our code
and check out the query that we wrote to
get all of our posts or at least get our
particular post I want to be heading to
we're at our template post HTML so here
we have our post query that we wrote and
we have query blog post by path path is
equal to string all markdown remark
frontmatter get all of this stuff
okay so we'll notice that if we head
back to our graphical we can see that of
all markdown remark we're then looking
into edges node fields slug well we're
only looking for one here so this isn't
exactly the right query for us but
another query we might want to explore
is in our Gatsby - node where we
actually queried all markdown remark
which is going to be looking similar to
all markdown remark here then we had
edges node fields slug now here we have
all markdown edges node and then
frontmatter
path instead of slug or any of that
stuff so what I want to do is actually
dive into here and I want to grab the
title
so you'll notice edges node okay we're
all good frontmatter and then title so
if we can continue that query in here
instead of having fields we can say
front matter you'll notice a little bit
nice auto completion and then if we
start typing check it out if we start
typing you're gonna get some of your
fields here all the fields that have a T
in it in this case we have path parent
and title whether or not it's starting
with the T or not now we wanted to get
this T title so we can hit title and
then let's run this query and check it
out
we are getting all markdown remark edges
with a node frontmatter title first blog
post now this is a super handy way that
you can write your queries and know if
they're going to work before you start
throwing them into your code
and and this is really super nice
because it's using your same system so
if we were do is simply head to our
pages and I'm going to find this current
folder in here and I'm gonna duplicate
this I'm gonna do this find in reveal
and finder so I can just do a command D
on it I don't know why there's not a
duplicate folder option maybe there
isn't I'm just overlooking it so you can
see making a copy change the title and
we can say second now today is 914 ok
2017 and again now we'll have just this
standard index page where we can say
this is going to be our second blog post
second I'm just gonna should have done a
finally replace for this whatever ok
we'll change hello - hi because why why
not okay so as you can see here we now
have two blog posts and when we run this
query if you expected to see two blog
posts show up then you'd be absolutely
correct because what's awesome about
this is it's using our file system and
it's looking through our markdown files
the exact same way that the Gatsby or
graph QL within the system would so this
is the perfect way to test out your
queries before they even happen and
let's say our query is all done and you
just want to copy and paste this in your
code we can select fortify and it's
going to give us a preview of this now
we can also get some history - if we
want to go back in time so this
graphical interface is really super
duper handy for writing your queries and
seeing instantly the object that you're
going to get back this is just one of
the many reasons why a lot of people are
really really liking graph QL right now
and if you listen to the syntax podcast
we're gonna be doing a whole episode on
graph QL really really soon and if you
don't listen to the syntax podcast head
- syntax FM and this is I guess is a
shameless plug for these syntax podcast
featuring West boss and I talking about
web dev topics so we're gonna be
covering graph QL in a future episode
here basically doing a little bit of QA
with it
so here we have all of our pages okay
and we're getting the title now what
else might we want from this query right
if we're building a
a listing and index in addition to the
post you're gonna need the post path
right basically how to get to that path
but that's really pretty much all you'll
need unless you're writing some sort of
description of the blog post or
something like that and what's cool
actually is that remark gives us a
little bit of a description for us
alexxa we don't have to do anything to
get that so if you're writing a blog you
wouldn't have to write a separate
description if you wanted to remark and
take care of that definitely super cool
okay so we have our frontmatter
and our title and now if you guessed it
we just need our path let's hit play and
you can see without doing anything
additional here our query is going to
work and grab us the path and now we
have this nice pretty version of a query
that we could use to do our blog posts
now let's say we only wanted the first
ten of these we could set this limit
that already exists in here to be ten
and regardless because we don't have ten
already it's only going to give us ten
which is nice for an index right you
don't want a thousand posts in your
index so this is the kind of query that
we're going to do to grab all of our
posts so check out the next video as we
actually build this page out into our
index template and we get this query
into our actual code so as always this
is Scott with level up tutorials thank
you so much for watching if you want
more premium content head to level up
tutorials dot-com and you can become a
LevelUp a pro will you'll get access to
a bunch of series you can see all of
them available under the tutorials tab
and I should say that there's many many
many new series coming I'm an about to
finish up a figma series that I've been
talking about for a little bit I'm
pretty psyched about that I will be
getting into some Apollo and graph QL
stuff I'm gonna be getting into a lot a
lot of cool stuff very very soon here so
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next one where we actually
build out this index</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
