huts and today we're going to be doing a
little bit more with blocks so in the
last lesson I give you an introduction
to a block sire today we're just going
to create a really basic block and we're
going to add it to somewhere on our site
so to get started we're going to click
blocks if you remember last time we
saved it in our shortcuts if you don't
have it in your shortcuts it's under
structure and then blocks so up at the
top here you'll notice this add a block
will click that here we're going to want
to add a title we're just going to call
this our text block and then the
description this is what's going to be
shown in the blocks administration page
so it's going to be something you want
to be able to call and move it around by
but not necessarily have something
that's going to be displayed so make it
something that you'll remember it by but
not necessarily something that your
viewers will ever see so we'll just call
it test text block and in this block
body is where you're going to put
whatever you want
so because we don't have any WYSIWYG x'
or anything installed we're just going
to type away and we'll just say test
block content and I'm going to copy this
just paste it all a bunch of times just
so we have something here okay cool and
then in Bartek I'm going to select where
we want it well I say a good spot would
be in the sidebar second and we're going
to want this to show up on only the
front page and we'll click Save okay now
you can see that Drupal has
automatically put this sidebar in here
and placed our text block in here with
its title the reason why this sidebar
wasn't being rendered before was because
it was no items in that content region
now that there is an item in that region
it's going to be rendered if we move
this out of here and let's say put it
into the left column then it will then
no longer render this column at all in
this theme
okay well that's how to create a text
block in the next lesson we're going to
be going over menus once again this is
Scott with level up tuts and thanks for
watching right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
