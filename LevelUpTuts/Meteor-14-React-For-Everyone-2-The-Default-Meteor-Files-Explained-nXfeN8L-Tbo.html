of tutorials and in this video we're
going to actually explain a little bit
about the default file folder structure
that comes with meteor and what happens
now that we're ready to start creating
our app okay so now that we have our
application created we have meteor
installed at this welcome to meteor
screen let's actually get started here
doing summit code or at least looking at
some code so I'm gonna open up my finder
head to my sites folder and then I'm
looking for voting app react I'm gonna
just drag this into atom now I'm using
atom as a text editor in this series the
reason I'm using atom is it's just nice
and simple what we can do is here let's
check out some of what we have now
instead of our voting app react we have
a dot meteor folder now this is the
important thing we could delete most of
this other stuff and have well obvious
our application wouldn't work but meteor
itself would be fine inside of this
meteor folder we have a local folder
which includes a bunch of stuff you
never need to touch we have a build
folder or bundler cache folder database
ISO pack this stuff you will never come
into this local folder I can maybe
guarantee that in addition here we have
a dot git ignore which says hey get
ignore this local folder because this
gets rebuilt okay
this isn't something that you need
committed to your repository now in
addition we have this dot ID which is a
unique token for this project you don't
need to ever get in this file really and
next we have packages now these are all
of the packages that come with meteor
that by default now meteor has two
package systems and that may seem
confusing but it's important to know
where the stuff comes from in the past
before version 1.3 of meteor it only had
meteor zone package system which was on
atmosphere atmosphere j/s and you could
add packages with a meteor add command
and that would be great it was really
nice and simple now the problem is is
that if you need to get into the
standard NPM ecosystem that you have
with other node projects then you'd have
to repackage that as an atmosphere
package and then there's a potential for
it to get out of day didn't people not
committing and updating to their stuff
so basically what they did is they
opened up access to and p.m. and we can
now use NPM packages directly in our
meteor application but what that means
it doesn't mean that the EMAs your
package system has gone away in fact at
the current time right now of 1.4
meteors package system is still here and
it's still used very frequently for
meteor specific packages for instance
meteor based mobile experience Mongo
blaze templates all this stuff reactive
are the stuff comes with meteor and
we're gonna need a lot of these packages
and if we ever need to get rid of them
we can get rid of them with meteor
remove package anymore you could just
come in here and just straight-up delete
whatever line but what's nice is that
all the default packages give you a
little blurb about while there why
they're here now by the end of the
series we may add some more packages but
we're definitely going to be removing
these to auto publishing and secure
we're not gonna be removing them quite
yet because I need to teach you a little
bit about why they're there and what
they can do to help us basically these
two packages allow us to create
applications much faster than if they
weren't here it's great for prototyping
and testing things out not good for
production okay next we have platform
which is we have server and browser as
platform this will be different if you
want to be developing for like a Cordova
iOS or Android app next the release is
the current version of meteor we're
running as one for one one and that may
change by the time this is out the
latest version of meteor may be released
by then but we'll have to see about that
right now it's just one for one one and
last we have versions which is basically
going to tell us every single thing
that's installed in here dependencies
any of that stuff and what version we
are running now this file is
automatically generated we can change
version number in here or something like
that but for the most part we don't need
to head into versions that too much or
at all really the main file you're ever
going to be headed into is packages
right here and this is typically faster
to add a package just by pasting in the
package name in here rather than meteor
add but you can certainly use these
commands as well because that's also
very easy part of the benefit of meteor
is that things are just easy right now
next we have a client folder where we
have our main CSS which obviously has
nothing our main HTML and our main that
j/s know these are going to be going
away except for main dot CSS and for
server we also have a main dot jeaious
which is really just containing an
import meteor statement and on meteor
start up run this code on your server
now we also have your standard get
ignore which is telling you to ignore
these node modules and with a
package.json which is going to be for
our node modules if we ever add anything
with NPM install - - save then we can
have those added to our packages in our
package of JSON like you'd be used to
with any other node application and
that's the beauty of meteor 1.4 1.3 and
above is that you can use NPM packages
on the front end and the back end just
extremely easy
so getting things done quickly and
easily is still meteors best strengths
even though it has gotten a little bit
more verbose lately okay so let's take a
look again about this file structure
with meteor if you haven't used it
before you might not understand what
these folders are actually doing here
because the folders have some
significance we have our client folder
anything in the client folder is
actually going to be loaded on the
client and anything on the server folder
is going to be loaded on the server we
don't need to tell meteor that this is
going to run on the server now in
addition everything in the client folder
and everything in the server folder are
automatically going to get compiled
without us having to do anything we
don't have to write any sort of web pack
config or gulp config we have to write
no config and it gets it for an
if we come to Maine dot CSS and let's
just type in body and we can give body a
background of black let's head to our
web page and instantly our background is
black it couldn't be any easier right I
mean to get started you can just start
typing and we have live reload running I
didn't have to install a browser
extension or anything like that and it
just sort of automatically knew what to
do that said things won't stay this easy
forever because a lot of people like
this easiness and this is great to get
up and get up and going right small
projects anything like that this
couldn't be any better but once you get
into a large mammoth-sized project for
instance i have a web application that
is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
files and components and stuff like that
you're gonna wanna get into a more
direct declaration of what's being
compiled and what's being imported
so you'll see along here we have things
like our import template from templating
all this stuff technically because these
are in the client folder you don't need
them right if we were to save this at
this point because everything's in the
client folder this would all still work
and it still does let me get rid of the
black that's ugly okay but as you can
see this still works right you can still
push the button and everything works
fine even though we're we got rid of
these explicit import statements and
that's a great thing about meteors that
you can get up and running however as we
grow what we're gonna do is start
putting things into an imports folder
and we're gonna import them explicitly
now the reason to do this is to not only
make your application just smarter but I
mean we don't need to compile everything
right it lets each file know what's
being used in that file and everything
gets nice and explicit and that not to
mention organized now I should also note
that we will be using ES 2015 es6 syntax
in this series so if you see things like
arrow functions i will be explaining a
little bit about why we use them and why
we don't use them and i'll be explaining
little es
fifteen syntax things just in case you
may not be up to speed on all the latest
I'm not going to go into full depth
about it though so as you can see here
this is our project now to get started
we can keep this server stuff because
there's nothing blaze as specific blazes
the front-end framework that comes with
meteor but it made out HTML this is all
blaze right here template all this stuff
so I'm going to click delete on main dot
HTML and I'm gonna click delete on main
j/s I'm gonna move those right to the
trash and our applications going to
cease to produce anything but if we
check the source say it's still working
here we still have our stuff loaded
there's just nothing being output okay
so now we're ready to go with react in
the next video we're going to set up
react in our ecosystem and we're going
to get it actually displaying some hello
world code nothing too crazy but we're
gonna get react installed into our
meteor project and get started so as
