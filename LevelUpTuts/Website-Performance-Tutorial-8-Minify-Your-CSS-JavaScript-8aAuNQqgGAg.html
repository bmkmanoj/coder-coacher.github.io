up tutorials in this video we're gonna
be talking about minifying your CSS and
javascript and why it's important to do
that so let's get started right now so
you may have run PageSpeed and you may
have gotten a mark saying that you need
to minify your CSS and JavaScript and
now you might be wondering what does
minifying my CSS and JavaScript actually
mean or do for me well really it's
taking out all of the whitespace and
extraneous characters and sort of
compressing it all down to its absolute
bare minimum now this code becomes
completely unreadable in a lot of ways
and certainly uneditable so what you're
not going to want to do is you're not
going to want to minify the code that
you're necessarily working on now how
does that fit into most workflows now
this is one particular place where
people using CSS preprocessors have it
easy
most CSS preprocessors have a way of
automatically compressing minifying your
code for you for instance even if you
were to use an app like code kit it
would minify your code or pre-press
would minify your code so i mean really
you could use something like
preprocessor code kit to run your code
through minify it and have it out put a
minified version now if you're using a
sass or stylus or less even you'll be
typing your code saving it and then
these pre processors would essentially
be spitting out a CSS file that looks
probably something like this right
actually this is JavaScript so no it
would be looking something like this
where really all of the whitespace is
gone but even if you are only running
just CSS you should be saving your CSS
and then having a build process that
puts it into a separate folder now
common practice is to have something
like a build folder so you could be
using something like gulp or grunt or
any of these toolkits that will take
your CSS it will minify it for you and
then it will save it into a new file
inside of a folder called something like
build now then your website instead of
looking
at the CSS file that you're editing is
actually looking at the CSS file in the
build folder because you told it to do
that now what does this mean for
performance exactly well it basically
just cuts down your file size I mean
it's taking let's see I have some CSS
here it's taking CSS that looks said to
this minify er looks like this and then
we can click minify and as you can see
it's crunching it down now now are you
going to be saving a megabytes worth of
space I doubt it and it depends on
really how much CSS you have and the
large projects you have a lots and lots
of CSS so the benefits going to be more
noticeable however it's basically free
performance points you're shaping off
bits of data that you just don't need to
have in your production code so if you
go to your website and your CSS is not
minified or your javascript is not
minified then you are essentially
forfeiting a free minor performance
upgrade for really just no reason now
you might be thinking well I use
something like WordPress or Drupal and I
don't necessarily have a build process
maybe I'm not maybe you're not using
gulp you're not using a CSS preprocessor
well the good thing is if you type in
WordPress minify or if you tripe in
Drupal minify you're going to be finding
packages and this might not be the only
packages because like I said these are
just the first ones that came up when
you google so you might want to refer to
those respective communities but like
say this one has you know 69 5 stars so
it seems like it's pretty good right
basically this is going to combine and
minify your J's files to improve page
load time and it's basically just a
wordpress plugin you can throw in your
site along with this Drupal package now
I think this is a better one advanced
CSS and J's aggregation but as you can
see there are modules and packages that
exist for the CMS sites that make it
really no excuse right because now you
don't have to change your build process
and you don't have to change anything
you can just throw in a module you can
throwing a plug in and it's going to
work and the end result is your live
code that comes out like this yeah it's
totally unreadable and variables and
your JavaScript have been renamed and
things like that but the code itself is
so much smaller and like I said there's
just really no reason not to do it
especially when you're getting a
performance increase out of it and
having a fast website is such an
important thing that you should really
take every single step you can to
improve your loading time performance so
minify those javascript and CSS files
and get your code crunched up as small
as possible so that it takes less time
to download and therefore improves the
loading time of your website so this is
CSS and J's minification and why it's
important as always this is Scott with
