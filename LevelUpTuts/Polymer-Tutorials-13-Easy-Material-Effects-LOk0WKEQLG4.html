up tutorials and today we're going to
take some of that material design that
we saw in the last video and we're gonna
learn how we can apply things like the
ripple and the shadow to any element on
our page so that way you can build your
own not only custom elements but even
using the standard HTML elements so when
you click something you still see that
ripple effect which is such a nice user
experience and just sort of a great
feedback item for when a user click
something so check it out we're gonna
get started on that right now so in the
last video we gave you a brief
introduction for the material elements
here and one of the cool parts about
using the paper elements in material
design with polymer is that you have
access to these material effects
throughout your project for instance by
simply dropping this paper ripple or
paper shadow element into your custom
element you can use the touchable effect
now you don't even have to make a custom
element for these to work and you can
simply just throw them into things right
so for a quick example just to show you
how easy this is to work
I'm going to re-add our hello world
element which is elements hello world
HTML and then down here further on the
page I'm reading hello world now into
the hello world dot HTML simply within
our template I'm just gonna throw it
right below this button I'm pasting in
the paper - ripple and I'm gonna pass
this paper ripple an attribute of fit
now the ripple itself needs to have a
position:absolute so to accomplish that
we're just saying fit and this is sort
of going to make it fit its parent so
now that we have a ripple effect in here
this question just click anywhere in
this hello world and you'll see that the
ripples going all over the place
whatever but it's originating where
we're clicking right and like I said
it's madness it's not a super useful
example because there's really no reason
you'd want this click effect on all of
this stuff you probably wanted on
something like a button
so let's actually add this paper ripple
to
right so if you can have it to a divvy
you can add it to anything so let's go
ahead and make a new div that's just
going to be like we'll just say we'll
name the div itself ripple we'll have it
a class of ripple inside of we're gonna
say hello I mean we don't even have to
say anything in here and inside of this
div we're actually going to paste in our
paper ripple and we can do this with the
fit as well let's go ahead and give
ripple some properties here so we can
come up to our CSS and they div with the
class of ripple we can say with 200 pix
height 200 pixels and let's set a border
of just like 1 1 pixel so it's solid 1
pics 333 okay now let's see what happens
we have our box here and when we click
it we still get this ripple that's going
everywhere and that's because this
ripple if you actually check it out
you'll see it as a position:absolute and
since this ripple div doesn't have
anything telling it otherwise its
positioning absolutely over everything
so when you click it it's anywhere okay
so let's go ahead and add a position
relative to this ripple and let's just
say position relative its refresh and
now what you'll notice is that without
having to even add an overflow hidden or
anything we get this ripple effect
inside of this square exclusively you
click outside of it nothing's happening
ok and you'll notice that there's a CSS
property that's grabbing the host and
giving it an overflow of hidden which is
pretty cool okay so what are there some
other material effects that we can use
besides the paper ripple there's also
things like the shadow so the paper
shadow effect so these paper buttons are
using this raised button however we want
to go ahead and just use this
shadow using the paper shadow element so
if we scroll down here you can see that
the paper shadow element you can apply
it a level of Z when Z is how far away
from the page it is thus making the
shadow even larger so if you can imagine
a light source above something and
shining down and the closer gets to the
light source the larger the shadow is
going to be there so we can pass that in
simply with a Z equals and then a number
okay know to use a paper shadow element
you actually have to use this as a
container okay so let's go ahead and
wrap our div in a paper shadow by
copying this and to our rippled div
we're going to say your paper shadow and
debt this and then close that tag okay
and now let's go ahead and give it a Z
so we can say Z is equal to and I'm just
gonna say five because it's a nice large
number and let's come back to our page
let's refresh now when you refresh it
you'll notice that there's something not
quite right we have defined this div
class width and height and so sure our
oh is taking up the entire width because
this div is a display block and this
paper shadow is if you click on it
you'll see that it's a display block so
let's go ahead and change the paper
shadow we can change that particular
element we can actually give this a
class so we're not targeting every paper
shadow we can just say ripple shadow now
using this class we can say this shadow
that's wrapping around our ripple div is
going to have position:relative
is going to have a display:inline-block
okay and so this display:inline-block is
now going to let this shadow wrap around
this div like it should we refresh and
we now see that a level of Z equals five
this is what our Square our div looks
like and we click it and we hit our
ripple shadow
okay so we've now learned how we can not
only use the paper elements to use the
material design style and that's in our
project but we've also learned how we
can apply those nice interactions and
effects to our own projects in our own
elements so there are lots more to learn
as always I recommend just pulling
through this documentation and reading
everything there is about this ripple
and all the different things you can do
with it in the next video we're going to
talk about transitioning using
core-animated-pages if you want to check
out these demos there here you can see
some pretty cool ones so grid to full
screen we click one of these it goes
full screen let's go back we can check
out nested core pages here just like
that so there's a lot of great stuff
coming up using transitions in polymer
as always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video or in
its Abed Twitter or Facebook I level up
tutorials thanks for watching and we'll
see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
