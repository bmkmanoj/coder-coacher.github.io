up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
sublime linter for sublime text 3 and
now we already did a video on how to
lint your code with sublime text however
sublime text 3 has a new sublime linter
which is really quite extraordinary but
very different so the important thing to
note about sublime text 3 is linter is
that it doesn't come with any linting
plugins and it doesn't come with any
additional linting packages what that
means is that to get the linters to work
not only do you have to have the
specific linter package but you also
have to have whatever software your
system needs to actually run that linter
and now for each linter that process
might be a little bit different however
from what i've seen it either involves
installing some sort of ruby gem or
installing an ode package or something
so we're going to go ahead and install
Jas hint with the new sublime linter so
first things first we have to get the
new sublime linter and so if i do
command shift p or ctrl shift P on
Windows I can bring up a package control
by typing in package and then going down
to install package now we're going to
look for sublime linter now there is one
called sublime lint you're going to make
sure that it's sublime linter all one
word just like this and we're going to
hit enter here so now this is going to
install and it gives you this big
welcome page and it says it's not a
drop-in replacement it is different but
like I said it's awesome umm it's it's
actually I definitely preferred the
reason why it's better it's the last
sublime linter uh when you lint in
something it opened up a little dialog
box down here this it actually puts in
the gutter a little circle giving you
errors and warnings and stuff like that
so it says to read the docs and please
do there's a lot of stuff in there
we're gonna cover the basics here but go
ahead and just read this stuff right um
you'll understand it just a little bit
better okay so now I close that out and
I want to grab a linter for let's say I
want to add a linter for JavaScript so
let's open up this plugins das file
right and I didn't write this this is
this came with the html5 boilerplate and
I'm going to do command shift P or
command or control shift P to open up
our prompt we can type in package and we
want to find the package 4j s hint which
if you are familiar with Jay as hint
it's basically a JavaScript linter and
the best way to find these is basically
to type in the sublime linter and then -
and there's a list of all of the
different sublime linters and you can
see there's a couple of CoffeeScript
ones there's actually an S CSS linter
there's a CSS lender and pretty much
anything you'd want here you can let
your code and I really really like this
so then we're going to use is J s hint
we hit enter now this tells you it's
important that you want to go to this
github page to learn how to actually
install the linter itself because the
program the package here for sublime J's
hint doesn't actually know what to do
without going - without having the
actual note package here for this
particular one so if we go to this page
it brings us to this github page and it
gives us some instance elation
directions down here and first thing you
need to do is installed nodejs
so they have a link here for you node.js
has a really easy installer
you can just click install and download
it here I believe I have it on my system
but I'm going to go ahead and confirm
that in a second
if you want to know if you already have
it I mean chances are if you didn't know
you downloaded it then you probably
don't but a way you can check is by
typing in NPM space hyphen V and of
course it's going to say NPM not found
because I don't have node package
manager installed so I'm going to go
ahead and run this installer that I
clicked from the node.js website and be
back in one second okay so then
installer was nice and quick now if I
type NPM - V you can see I actually get
a version because I have node package
manager and a no package manager is
basically um like it says it's a package
manager that's going to grab a different
node package that your system can use
for all sorts of handy things so in this
particular instance we want to run the
command NPM space install space hyphen G
which means it's installing it globally
for your system and not just part of
this project and then Jas hit so of
course I'm just going to copy this
command directly from the github and
because I'm installing this globally I'm
going to have to need to type sudo first
so sudo space and p.m. space install
space hyphen G space J s hint and we hit
enter I enter my password and it and
it's going to go ahead and install this
package now as long as everything's good
we should have this package installed
and we should be ready to go with our
linter so let's come back to sublime
text so we have it installed now I'm
actually going to go ahead and close a
blind test and reopen it and you know I
just sort of like to make sure that it's
uh you know closed and reopened after
installing new plugins especially
because sublime text is so good about
remembering you know your windows and
stuff like that it's really no problem
so now we have our
javascript document now there's clearly
no problem with this document at all
right until I start typing in here and
you'll notice some stuff happened so
let's go ahead and actually get rid of
just some of this code up here and now
when I I don't even have to save it
right you can see I have some red dots
here not to mention I have some us or
you know rounded squares around part of
my code so now when I click on this code
if you look at the very bottom of your
sublime text you will see it's going to
explain the errors a bit so this says it
expected an identifier and instead saw a
var of course that's because we're
missing some of the parentheses here and
one of the brackets so of course if I
fix that it's back to normal now that
the Reds are going to be errors and the
yellows are going to be warnings
likewise if I delete this semicolon here
it's not going to be an application
breaking semicolon however it is going
to tell me that when I go over here
that I'm missing a semicolon now I've
checked out some of the other letters
the scss linter and the HTML PHP linter
and they all work pretty much the exact
same however the installation process
might just be a little bit different for
instance for the sass hinter we had to
install the sass linter gem so instead
of installing it via node package
manager we had to run a gem command a a
gem install command now if you have PHP
on your system already we can confirm
that by typing in PHP space hyphen V if
you have PHP on your system then you'll
note that the package for sublime linter
I'll find it right now
sublime linter - PHP
is going to work fine so we can go ahead
get that one and of course it has
another github page and if you go here
it's basically just going to tell you
hey you need PHP here's how to tell if
you have PHP if not you can install it
via these methods so this is how you can
use sublime text linter three now one
quick thing to note is is that let's say
you're tired of it linting your
JavaScript you don't really care but you
still wanted to lint some other things
well if you do your command prompt again
we can type in linter and you'll see
that there's an option for toggle linter
now when we hit this you'll see that j/s
hint and PHP are both enabled now we
could select one of these and disable it
if we no longer want to receive errors
so let's go ahead and disable the jas
hint now when I make a mistake I don't
have it bugging me about anything and
you know it's it's no longer linting my
code of course the point of the linters
is to have a check out your code so if
you're using it you can always tuckle
them on and off whether or not you want
them on or off there we go its back on
cool so that's a blind text linter three
let me know if you have any questions or
any trouble with any linters in
particular and I can go over installing
those in more specifics because they're
all just a little bit different so as
always this is Scott with level up tuts
if you have any questions or comments
leave a comment the video or hit us up
at Twitter or Facebook or our level up
test form we'd love to hear from you so
thanks for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
