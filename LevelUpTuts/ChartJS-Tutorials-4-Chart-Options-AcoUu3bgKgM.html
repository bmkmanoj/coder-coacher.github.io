up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna dive into the chart options for
the line chart and pretty much to show
you how chart options work overall with
charges it's gonna be really super cool
and you're gonna see how you can dive
into the documentation and be able to
tweak things a little bit more to how
you would like them so the first thing I
want to do before we get started is I
want to give the answer to the challenge
at the end at the last video so I
challenged you to have the bottom of the
data axis here to be 0 and not 20 now
you would think there might be a
property that might be like why access
value or something like that but really
there isn't anything and this is going
to dive into the topic that we're gonna
be talking about in this video which is
going to be the third property inside of
our chart object here we had the type of
line and we have the data inside of
which we had our data set and labels
let's actually come all the way down
here to the bottom now here notice how
this isn't the last curly braket but the
second-to-last curly bracket we can have
a comma and the next thing we're gonna
have in here is a property called
options
okay now options is a property that can
accept another object now inside of this
we're gonna be able to define various
other options but for right now we're
going to define one that's scales and
then a colon which is also going to
accept an object and then y-axis which
is going to accept an array of objects
so we can have an array and inside of
that an object now instead of here we
have the property of ticks now ticks is
going to accept another object so as you
can see we're really drilling down here
but ticks is now where we finally have
the ability to say begin at 0 now this
is going to be a true or false boolean
you hear so we can say hey when the
scales on the y-axis make sure the ticks
begin at zero so now if we refresh you
can see this goes all the way down to
zero up to 100 our rallies no longer
look like they're at zero and it's
scales really nicely now it depends on
what type of chart you're going to make
it at obviously you can see the default
option is for the ticks to start at the
very bottom of the value which is of
course this case 20 now you might be
wondering how in the world was I
supposed to know that well other than
the fact that it shows up in the
documentation here if you if you search
for ticks it's also in one of the first
examples but where we want to actually
find that is if we go to a line chart
and then chart options you'll see we
have some options here such as show
lines which is just a boolean we don't
want to show any lines let's turn show
lines to be false so under options we
had scales here we can just say show
lines equals false make sure you have a
comma after that save that let's come
back refresh and as you can see we just
have these data points we no longer have
the actual line or the border that's
connecting them so let's get rid of that
because this chart really doesn't look
great that way but if you have a line
chart without the lines then you have
sort of just like dot plots on a chart
here and that could be totally useful we
also have really nice descriptions going
on over here about what each of this
stuff is let me have this in a way you
can actually read it better so as you
can see is this the point radius
elements that point radius defines the
size of the point shape so the default
is 3 so it's going to be 3 pixels and
that's why we have those little tiny
circles if you wanted bigger ones you
could always change that through
elements point and then element point
radius okay and you can see it accepts
just a number now in addition you could
see that we have scales which is what we
obviously did we had scales and then
y-axis
and then you might be wondering well how
do you know about ticks well if we come
here you can see the scales
documentation now if you want to see the
scales documentation I noticed this link
doesn't work but what you want to do is
scroll down here and click scales right
here and as you can see we have a whole
lot of stuff that scales tanks so as you
can see Charcot j/s is really
full-featured we got up and running in
absolutely no time but let's say you
wanted to make any of these changes you
can come in here and see inside of
scales tics begin at zero ticks font
color font family font style next
rotation and these are all gonna be
things that you're setting in the object
in the options we can even have ticks
mirror or you can reverse the DOE the
order of the labels and the ticks so
let's go ahead and even do that we have
ticks
reverse let's set it to true so we can
have in y-axis ticks we can say reverse
true wrap that up with a comma and let's
head back let's check out what this does
and as you can see our chart is now
starting at zero at the top so just
totally inverse this now this chart
right here
wouldn't be the most fun thing in the
world to read it sort of looks like it's
like cut out and this is the data here
so I can't exactly recommend using this
reverse for this particular type of
example but obviously I think there are
different charts that are going to work
better with different options but the
control to be able to change those
options is here and everywhere you go
inside of options we have scale all this
sort of stuff in addition we have
everything that's also under chart
options here so this is really great as
you could see let's talk about the
difference between the data and the
options did data sets here are
essentially going to be what is the data
object is going to have everything to do
with the data itself where the options
are going to have everything to do with
the chart on the whole itself so
obviously for changing the color of one
of the particular lines are gonna do
that within day
if you're changing something like the
font-family on one of the axes you're
going to do that within options so
that's the difference between options
and data when you now cover all three of
these properties of our chart witchers
type data and options so in the next
video we're gonna be talking about
global properties so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
have any questions or comments leave a
comment the video hit me up at Twitter
or Facebook I level up tutorials I'd
love to hear from you thanks so much for
watching and if you want to get the rest
of these videos before they're available
on YouTube had to store that level of
tutorials dot-com and you can either
purchase this series for streaming
digital download or you can become a
LevelUp pro and watch this series along
with other early access level up
tutorial series thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you the next one
