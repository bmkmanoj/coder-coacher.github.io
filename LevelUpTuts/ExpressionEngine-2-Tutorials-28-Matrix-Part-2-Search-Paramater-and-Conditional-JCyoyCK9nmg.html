we're going to pick up where we left off
some expressionengine training before we
start and remind everyone to subscribe
to our youtube channel and follow us on
twitter at level of ducks alright so
like I said we're going to pick up where
we left off and if you remember in the
last video we were talking about the
pixel and tonic module called matrix and
in the last video the last thing we did
was start setting up a sort of
lightweight gallery what we're going to
do now is sort of expand on that a
little bit more and while we do that I'm
going to show you some more of the
additional or show you some additional
features that you can do with the matrix
module already so let's go ahead and let
me bring up what we have worked on so it
was just sample gallery so this is what
we worked on it's a post and our post
has just two rows and right now one
contains text and one contains an image
and so now let's go that entry and we
see here's just our body and here we're
seeing the matrix and we see two rows
and 2 columns an image in a caption so
one of the functions that I want to show
you one of the more advanced functions
is the search which works almost exactly
or pretty much exactly like how the
expression engine channel entries tagged
or that tag parameter works but i'll
give you a use case and we'll build that
out so say what we want to do
is in this gallery maybe it's a
compilation of images or videos and
right now we're displaying the image
field and a caption but we want to
create another another cell that can
capture some video embed code and then
maybe what we want to also do is say
only show the caption if the person uses
our fills out an image so we're actually
going to create two more cells so I'm
going to just go ahead and leave this
open hop back over to admin go to
channel administration channel fields
I'm gonna pop it into a new tab and I've
been putting this in just the page feel
to bring a page gallery and what we're
going to do is create a new cell so to
do that over in the far right we have a
little plus symbol here which maybe you
noticed probably and we are going to
actually select from radio button and
some select radio button and this is
going to say image or video and gallery
will stay type this is the column name
again this is what we're going to use in
the template tag so remember that I'm
just going to copy it now so I always
forget that stuff and leave this stuff
alone don't care go down to cell type
options
and here we go and I'm just going to say
you know this is a video or is this an
image and it update go back to our entry
refresh and you know now you'll see that
we have the ability to say you know is
this a video or system and they don't
like the placement of this you're
probably the first column so what we can
do is simply actually what do we do oh
yeah 30 just drag it on over alright so
now already the update and come back um
you know it's it's the first column here
so both these are image so let's just
sort of start setting this up and just
hit submit and now i want to go to our
template and start populating this field
so i'm addicted to new tabs and so i'm
going to open this one in a new tab as
well and i'm going to go into our page
here's our tag pair so now if i were to
just do this and say gallery type just
do this just for transparencies sake
scroll down get this page or refresh you
know we're seeing image image so this is
starting to take shape a little bit so
now what I want to do is go back to this
entry and we'll say we want to add some
embed code now for a video and I could
put that in this caption field but I
don't know it's just for for this case
let's create a new cell so I'm gonna go
back over here hit this plus again and
we'll say it's I guess mm I guess it's a
wig wam again maybe we'd want to have
another editor or something that you
know has less functionality doesn't
really matter to me and this is fine
look at ihop over here for that alright
so oops lost that so it again thank you
i am this is going to be video embed
code so say gallery video
and okay so now let's grab some bed
video I know where we can find some
alright
share bed get this code
create a new item called a video we're
not going to add an image I'm not going
to give it a caption who's going to come
over here and I'm gonna just paste this
in the source that's the easiest way to
do it I think for me anyway like just
doing it that way so let's hit submit
come back over here what we'll find is
right video type and it doesn't have a
video so we're gonna we're going to
clean this up right now by using again
the search tag parameter so we need to
go over to the template and we're going
to do something like this we want to put
we're going to put the type so that are
all like together so we can do this
search colon and then the column name
equals two and then we're going to say
you know to whatever it is so in this
case we're going to say image and so
what this will do let's update and
refresh now this only and is only
showing the images so now what we can do
is
do this over again video so now we just
you know don't care about that we also
don't care about that and so we just
wanted to output the gallery video so
there you go so that's how you use the
search parameter alternatively what we
what we could have done was not use the
search parameter at all and used because
the matrix is so flexible just like
again it's there there's so many
similarities between you know just sort
of like what you can do with channel
entries tagged you could do something
like this yeah well today Jenna if
gallery type equals image if else that's
actually not great because I didn't we
don't have it setting a default so now
this isn't you know the best solution or
in most foolproof solution but will work
good nor set up
oh that did not work haha again
help with this stop trying to load oh
whoops heyo
Oh what am i doing wrong let's take a
look if gallery tied oh I'm actually
being sort of silly here we want to do
this let's go ahead and give that a try
there we go cool sorry i had this index
wrong you guys probably watching at home
or like what the hell are you doing so
there you go cool that's all I wanted to
show you in this video stay tuned for
the next video I'm going to show you
guys how to change the sort set limits
and we're also going to discuss single
variables so thanks a lot for watching
I'm sure to keep following along the
best way to do that is to follow us on
Twitter and level-up Tut's and subscribe
to our YouTube channel thanks a lot
