love-love tutorials and today we're
going to show you how you can use
Twitter to log into your meteor
application now this is gonna be super
easy we're gonna add a module hook it up
to our Twitter developers account which
will show you how to obtain and then
you'll have a login with Twitter button
directly on your page so keep watching
let's get going on that right now
so here we have our app that we left off
with our standard sort of logged in here
in fact I'm just going to go ahead and
sign out that way we can see our changes
here and we have the jist username and
password form right now but let's go
ahead and add the accounts Twitter
package so head over your command line
and we can do meteor add and then the
package name is accounts - Twitter so
just like accounts - password and all
that stuff that we used before accounts
Twitter pretty much gives us everything
that we'll need to use a Twitter account
as a login ok so as you can see it
installed a few packages for us and our
servers completely restarted now let's
back to our application and now you see
when we click the sign-in button we now
have some options we now have this
configure Twitter locking or a username
and password so you can lock in the
standard way with the username and
password or you can just click this
button here to configure the login setup
so what that means is basically we
haven't configured we haven't added an
application yet so let's go ahead and
click configure Twitter login and what
it's gonna do is it's going to tell you
to visit dev twitter.com slash apps
slash new so I'm gonna go ahead and open
that in a new tab you can see right here
it's our application let me bump up the
font size here okay and it's telling you
that we need the callback URL set to
basically your local IP address and then
whatever port and then forward slash
underscore OAuth a forward slash Twitter
okay so let's come here to create an
application and this is just going to be
it's okay Chrome okay resolutions and
the description is going to be our
monthly resolution tracker no no I
capitalized it um it doesn't really
matter okay and now for the website this
is just going to be the local so we can
just have that IP address without this
extra stuff here
and the callback URL is going to be what
it told us before so our local IP
address : at 3000 and then the OAuth
Twitter stuff okay so after we get this
information it says on the settings tab
enable a lot of this application to be
used sign in with Twitter so if we
scroll down we can agree and create our
Twitter application here it's going to
say the resolutions has already taken so
we can save my resolutions it might need
a more secure name than that okay looks
like we have application has been
created at my resolutions and we have
this monthly resolution tracker with our
Settings tab like Adam mentioned before
so if we click that we can come in here
and we can find this check box that says
allow this application to be used to
sign in to Twitter cool so let's check
that and you can even give it an
application icon that will show when you
go to log on with Twitter you don't
necessarily have to let's go ahead and
update these settings okay so now what
we really need out of here is the key
now it's asking for our API key and our
API secret so if we come up here to the
top where it says keys and access tokens
we can select that and we now have a
consumer key which is the API key let's
go ahead and copy that and I should note
that you want to keep these values you
want to keep them secure basically the
only reason I'm showing you what mine
are right now is because I'm going to
delete this application as soon as this
it was over okay so we can paste this in
here and then the API secret I'm going
to select that and that's the consumer
secret API secret right here I'm going
to paste it into our API secret so we
can choose either they pop up base login
or redirect based we want to go with the
pop up base because it does say it's
recommended this way it's not going to
take the user off of our page so let's
go ahead and click Save configuration
and now we have this awesome option
right here our button is no longer
orange and it's no longer sort of a
warning but we now have the option to
sign in with Twitter so let's go ahead
and click sign in and let's click
authorize the application because I'm
already logged into Twitter if you're
not it's going to ask you to log into
Twitter but you can now see it has my
name from my Twitter account so that is
awesome but let's say we wanted to
figure out what is included in this
object
well I'm opening up my JavaScript
console in my inspect element so now in
our JavaScript console we can actually
use what we have learned before when we
wanted to get a collection in our
JavaScript we did resolutions dot find
so now what we want to do in our console
just to get a list of this object here
that contains our user we can just say
meteor capital and meteor that users dot
find just like that now we get this
collection which we can open up and it
has a whole bunch of uh meteor stuff in
it so if we want actually to just get
the object itself we can type of meteor
users that find out fetch
now fetch is gonna return just the
JavaScript object
so here's both of our users here's the
user we created before with the username
of admin and if we open up the second
object here is our new user where we
have different we have a more objects
inside of here so we have a profile
object we click that you see the name is
Scott Olinsky and if we come in here and
click services we
can also see that the services a twitter
object has symbol information so we can
access this information like the Twitter
screen name if we want to go ahead and
use that we can even get the profile
image using this object itself cool so
this is all of the information that we
end up getting from signing in with
Twitter and now your customers or your
clients or whoever doesn't have to make
a new account special for your website
if they already have account to
something like Twitter oh cool so in the
next video we're going to show you how
you can do the exact same thing using
Facebook so now we're gonna have two
options how to log in with Twitter and
how to log in with Facebook as always
this is a scout with level up tutorials
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
