today I'm going to give you a quick
preview of Drupal 8 now in this first
video what we're going to do is we're
going to install Drupal aids beta and
we're going to see how the process
differs or is the same from the
installation process that you're used to
with things like drupal 7 or even Drupal
6 so we're going to get into that right
now by installing Drupal 8 beta so from
drupal.org like you would normally come
to download Drupal you'll notice then
they now have this a Drupal 8 bucks
right here it says Drupal 8 is in beta
so let's go ahead and click that link
right there it's going to take us to
this Drupal 8 release page now this page
gives you a little bit of information
about what comes with Drupal 8 what's
changed and even you can download an
infographic to get that however we want
to get to the code we want to be able to
download and get downloading and
installing Drupal 8 so let's click this
large image here that says read the
release notes and that's going to take
us to a page where we have access to
download the zip or the tar now I've
already downloaded this Drupal 8 folder
and thrown it into my sites folder using
map pro I've set up a name for it a host
name for it so whatever method you use
for doing that go ahead and it set up
your domain using map vamp pro or just
using apache on your computer basically
whatever you use if you don't know how
to do that there are lots of tutorials
available for ma'am since this is just
the beta preview we're going to skip
that step and go right to the
installation process however once Drupal
8 you know actually released will do a
more thorough installation videos
showing you that entire process so for
now i have my domain setup and it's just
d8 be standing for drupal 8 beta and if
you just browse to your virtual host it
actually takes you if you don't have
this installed it takes you to slash
core / install PHP so let's go ahead and
check out this installation screen now
this is quite a bit different than what
we've seen out of
Herbal 841 it actually looks nice in
Drupal 7 the installation process a lot
of that stuff left a lot to be desired
from a visual standpoint and that sort
of maybe scared some people off luckily
Drupal 8 has a really nice visual style
so we can click Save and continue and
then we're going to choose a profile if
you remember from past versions of
Drupal you can have installation profile
so that much hasn't changed let's just
click the standard and now let's enter
our database information so my database
was d8 underscore beta and since I'm
using ma'am everything should just be
root and let's click Save and continue
okay it's now installing Drupal and
you'll notice that we didn't have to
edit any settings dot PHP files we
didn't have to copy and move any default
files so the installation process for d8
is already just nicer I mean there was
really some unnecessary steps in the
Drupal 7 install that weren't a huge
pain they just were unnecessary so
luckily Drupal 8 has cleared up those
steps for us and we just have this basic
installer like we're used to with
something like wordpress or any of these
other systems okay we now have Drupal
installed let's go ahead and configure
the site the site name is going to be d
8 beta and for email address i'm going
to enter my Scott at level of Tut's and
site maintenance account is going to be
the admin account so user name I like
using admin you might want to use a
username that you find preferable and an
email address for that log in as well
now you're going to want to enter a
password because the site's not going
any further than it is I'm not entering
a super strong password here it's just
determined to be fair but you're going
to want to go ahead and enter a strong
password just like if you are setting up
any site now you can have a check for
update
automatically and receive email
notifications I'm going to uncheck this
emails but leave a check updates
automatically and click Save and
continue after that we're redirected to
our front and with our logged in were
already logged in so what you'll
immediately notice is that one this
theme looks a lot like Bartok which
we've seen before in fact it looks
exactly like Bartok but don't let that
deter you there's been a lot of changes
in a lot of visual niceties in Drupal 8
that have been added that just weren't
there in Drupal 7 so great that was the
installation process for the Drupal 8
beta essentially you download it you put
in your sights folder you create your
database and like normal you visit your
hostname and that's going to
automatically direct you to install
where you can just follow the steps
enter your information and now you have
Drupal 8 beta installed now I wouldn't
recommend using Drupal a beta for
anything as super serious right now but
if your drupal fan and you want to get a
head start on what's happening with
drupal go ahead and download the beta
check it out get you can start using it
and just and see all these new things
that are coming that you'll be able to
use in production really soon so check
it out as always this is scott to Linsky

watching and we'll see in the next 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
