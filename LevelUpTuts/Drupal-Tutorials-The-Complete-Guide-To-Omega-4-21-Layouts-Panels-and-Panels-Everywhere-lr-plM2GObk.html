HUD's and today we're gonna be talking
about panels and panels everywhere with
Omega 4 and basically what we're going
to do is recreate what we did in the
last video where we had our two layouts
and they're contextually different and
we're going to recreate this using
panels and panels everywhere and so it's
gonna be great because we're gonna get
to see exactly how these layouts that we
built in omega in your you know in your
layout code and everything like that
before can be used within the panel's
interface and it's a really nice
solution and you can completely
eliminate the need for things like
blocks and stuff like that what this
isn't going to be is this isn't going to
be a complete rundown on panels itself
that will be another time in fact I'll
be doing the video series on panels
itself and all the neat things you can
do with that however we're just going to
simply recreate what we have here where
we're contextually changing between a
couple of different responsive layouts
now I should also note that I am
absolutely freezing right now because
there's like a blizzard going on and
Michigan is super cold right now so I
apologize if I sound cold at all I'm
trying to keep warm here my computer is
doing a nice job of heating me up but
yes so let's get into it right the first
thing you want to do is make sure you
have some modules downloaded and enabled
in fact I'm gonna go ahead and say
you're gonna want panels and panels
everywhere download it enabled to
install panels you need C Tools which is
you probably already have if you're
using views or anything I mean I can't
imagine using building a Drupal site
without C tools and you could enable
panel nodes like I said this is going to
be less of a video about panels itself
and more video about how we can use our
Omega layouts within panels so let's
install those right save your site and
let's get rid of our context that we had
had made before if we go to structure I
usually use the administrative menu
instead of the built in Drupal menu so
forgive me if this one's also super slow
I'm just not used to using it I'm just
gonna delete this context entirely
and you should see we should now see
this two column layout on every single
page including the homepage here we go
if you'll notice before we had a
different layout for the homepage I had
a big white square here and you probably
familiar with that have you seen the
other videos again as like I do most of
my videos this this isn't the stuff
isn't good looking but it illustrates
the concepts pretty well so don't worry
about how this looks as I mean we're
building the layouts here we're not
necessarily building the theme yet so
let's check it out this context is
deleted and even more so let's just come
into the modules and turn context
completely off because I don't even want
to look at it and so I'm gonna uncheck
all of these are here context Omega
context you I get rid of this here we go
and let's come to after we say this we
can then uncheck context whoever it went
and if you were doing this on your real
site you also want to hunt it's about
these things and so there is I mean two
different sort of sides right a lot of
people like panels and a lot of people
don't like panels and prefer to use
something else so the context and layout
switching that way using context Omega
works if you do not like panels if you
love panels or you like panels you want
to learn panels check this out because
this is a pretty elegant solution so now
we have this all set up context is out
of here we don't have to worry about it
okay so now that we have context turned
off and done we want to do some other
things if you go under the appearance of
your theme I want to actually turn off
this layouts extension entirely and also
under development let's turn on the
region demo mode just so we can see the
regions for now so let's save this
configuration now if we come to our page
running the home page you'll notice
everything's in one column again we have
all of our regions and likewise this
test page we have same deal everything's
in one column we're not using any
layouts so the first thing we want to do
is we want to create a
page layout and we're going to do that
using panels everywhere so what we want
to do is go to structure and then panels
and if you're not familiar with panels
don't worry about it we're gonna go over
this nice and easy and you'll learn it
too a thing or two like I said this
isn't a definitive tutorial about panels
itself this is just an explanation about
how to use omega page layouts with
panels and LevelUp types we'll be doing
a total panel series later this year
maybe even later this month so let's go
to settings really quick and we want to
make sure under everywhere that enable
panels everywhere for this site template
is in fact make this a little bit bigger
is in fact checked here because we wanna
I think by default it's not checked but
I might have come in here earlier
injected we want to make sure this is
enabled because this allows you to use
panels everywhere so now let's come back
to the dashboard here and what we want
to do is under manage pages we want to
click on this default site template
right here where it says edit let's
click Edit and now you'll notice there's
nothing there's no variants here right
and so this is the panels in your face
if you're not familiar with it it looks
a little weird it's a little different
than gerbil I don't particularly like it
but that's me but that doesn't mean I
don't like its features I just don't
like the way it looks so let's add a new
variant and what this is is gonna say
this is a catch-all it's gonna use this
particular page layout for every single
page and we can say basic sidebar layout
you can give it whatever type of title
you want for an administrative title and
let's call this the variant type is
going to be panel and we don't need any
selection rules because this is gonna be
a catch-all like I said now let's click
create variant
now under our layout it gives us some
options but the cool thing is if we come
to Omega page layouts you'll see that
our layout that we created the home and
sidebar as well as the ones that came
with Omega ro more whichever those are
in admin I don't remember those are also
here so we have sidebar
which is perfect we wanted to use the
sidebar layout that we created ourselves
and this is going to be totally awesome
so let's can click continue now this
brings you to this configure screen we
want to disable Drupal blocks and
regions for this template and since this
is going to be a total page template
it's going to encompass everything this
is going to be the page right so cool so
we have our basic sidebar layout and we
don't really need this in place as you
hear anything
let's click continue like I said we can
go over the you know the panels
subtleties and in other panels based
tutorials but so now we have our
different regions for our theme and we
can say for the header just to prove
that this in fact worked let's just add
let's say we want to add the page let's
go to page elements and we can say site
logo so we want to have the site logo
and then also the header let's add a
search form just like this cool so we
have both of these things and let's
click create variant and down here
update and save cool this page has been
updated and saved now if we come to our
pages particularly our inside page we
can refresh this and see not only is our
content gone but we have our logo our
search bar and it's using our layout
right it's even totally responsive like
how we had it if I do this inspect thing
and I go yep okay nice and responsive
sweet so that's exactly how we headed
before it's now assigning this layout
but there's no blocks or anything what
we have is really just this panel now we
had this you know the home page the home
page is also going to be using this same
panel here so in the next video we're
gonna flush this out a little bit more
we're gonna make this look a little bit
nicer we're gonna bring in our page
titles and our content and stuff like
that and things are gonna be looking
quite a bit better and then we're gonna
contextually change between the two so
as always this is Scott would love love
tut's thanks for watching this is the
first video of 2014
I've been making these tutorials now
since March of 2012 and I'm excited for
this year because I'm gonna produce some
excellent videos and I hope everyone's
ready for the year ahead cool so thanks
