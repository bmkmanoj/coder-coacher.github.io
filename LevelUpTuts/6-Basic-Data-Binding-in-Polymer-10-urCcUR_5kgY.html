tutorials and in this video we're going
to show you how you can have basic
two-way data binding in your polymer
elements so this is going to be like the
angular 101 example where you've seen
where you can type in a text input and
that input is output directly onto the
screen as you're typing it however we're
going to do it all within your custom
element so check it out let's keep going
on that right now cool so in the last
video we learned how to use properties
now what we're going to learn about is a
basic data binding now we saw in the
last video we were in our hello world we
were using some properties we uses some
compute properties some computed
properties and we have output the full
name inside of curly brackets here now
you may have been wondering about the
curly brackets because we have those
being used inside of our template here
what exactly does that mean so really
what the curly brackets mean is it
creates automatic bindings where the
data flow is one way or two weight
depending on whether or not the target
property is configured for two-way
binding now if we want to just strictly
one-way binding we could use these
square brackets themselves so from so
for one weight binding the data is
essentially downward from the host to
the child and the binding never modifies
the hosts so basically if we were to
have in this instance just be using
these square brackets here we could come
back like so full name let's come and
refresh and you'll see we get scott
talansky so the square brackets are
working because we're not expecting this
back-and-forth data binding to happen
we're essentially taking in properties
and we're just outputting them so now in
this video we're going to show you how
you can do is sort of the you know the
very most basic two-way data binding
example that you sort of get on the
angular 101 sort of video or the angular
101 sort of example so one way we can do
this is by first creating an input right
so this example is going to show you
where you can just have a text input and
that input is going to be output
dynamically as you type in a property so
we can do input type text and now we're
going to have the value equal to
something very specific now it's going
to have double quotes and double curly
brackets here now we can give this a
property name so let's just type will
type the property name is just input
value which is I may ask kind of a
stupid name here will change it in a
second then we're going to do two colons
and then we're going to follow that with
the event that we're looking for and
this particular event is on an input so
we're looking for the input event now
other events might be if a checkbox is
changed we would have change here if a
video maybe is having a time change it
could be time update so now that we have
this input we can actually use this
input value and remember where we have
our two-way data-binding tag which is
the curly braces curly brackets we can
have those right here and put input
value here come to our page and refresh
will now have this input box and as we
type you can see this sort of you type
it shows up and this is we have basic
two-way data-binding going on inside of
our element and it's nothing fancy we
just have this input and input out text
but let's say we wanted to have this
value overwrite the let's say it's going
to overwrite the first name so we still
want to output the full name here let's
actually change this to double curly
brackets and it's like so and the input
value is no longer going to be input
value but it's going to be first name
and likewise since we're not using input
value anymore i'll just change it down
here just so it's outputting it twice
now let's come to our application we can
refresh and you'll see by default this
value is showing up as scott all three
places now when we change this not only
is it changing where we're having the
two a databound
down here in the age to Russell it's
also changing in our computed value as
well so as we modify this okay we you
can now see that this data binding
computing value updates as well cool so
that's a very most basic two-way data
binding now I'm sort of just breezing
over some of these topics here we're
going to get into a lot of this stuff in
much more detail I just want you to sort
of snow what you're seeing when you're
seeing it so that way when we get into
some cool stuff you know exactly what's
going on so check it out try out some of
your data binding head over to the
polymer project org check out the data
binding page there and just to start
reading over that stuff sometimes you
know documentation can get a little dry
so i will be covering everything in
there so if but if you absolutely can't
wait head over there and dive in to the
specifics yourself that's always a great
way to pick up new skills so as always
this is scott with level of tutorials if
you have any questions or comments leave
a comment the video artists about or
Facebook at level up tutorials we love
to hear from you thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one bye if you
like this video please check out some of
the other level of tutorials videos we
have lots of exciting playlists from
meteor to angular to polymer 1 point 0
and even some web design stuff using
sketch app there's new videos every week
and check out the video descriptions for
