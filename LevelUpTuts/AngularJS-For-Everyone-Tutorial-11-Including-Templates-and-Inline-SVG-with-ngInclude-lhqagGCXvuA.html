up tutorials and today we're going to
show you how to use ng-include to
include various templates as well as
things like SVG's to have inline SVG's
in your website and if you don't know
why that special we'll show you in a
second so here we have our project where
we left off with since we last left off
I just added a bit of CSS here to make
these heads show up a little bit better
they're not so gigantic this text is now
being vertically aligned here I've
really just added a list style of nut on
the unordered list I added a deist
display flex and a margin bottom on the
list item I did a display in my block
and a line height to the span and I
added some stuff to the image to give it
a border radius as well as a width and a
height to tame it down a little bit so
as you can see this is the result here
we now have a list that's a little bit
better to look at than what we had
before functionally nothing's different
it's just to make it so this isn't
totally hideous to look at let's talk
about organizing our code a little bit
in the previous video you saw we have
this HTML and we have this unordered
list it's repeating full of our people
in this list here now let's say we have
this list of people here but we actually
want to do is be able to pull up the
contents of these people for instance we
want to have this pattern that shows
face name age we want this pattern to be
reusable easily right and we don't want
to have to drag and drop in this whole
thing or even necessarily this line that
has the image let me put this span on a
new line this image and the span and
everything like that so what we're gonna
do is we're gonna make a new template
and we're gonna throw this stuff that's
an individual person into its own
template so let's go ahead and do that
let me show my sidebar here and now just
in my root directory because we don't
really have any project structure yet
we'll get into that in a later video I'm
gonna make a new file and it's just
going to be person dot HTML HTML okay
just like that now inside of person HTML
I'm simply going to copy and paste well
I should say cut everything from our
inside of our list item inside of here
like so if we save this you'll see all
that content is now gone from our site
okay
now let's head back and in our list item
now now within our list item we can use
the directive ng-include to include that
template so we can simply say bracket ng
include now you haven't seen a lot of
directives yet that are like this we've
simply been showing you directives that
are on other elements while some
directives including ng include can be
on their own so we just have ng include
as its own tag like so now keep in mind
like with any tag we need to close it
off so you need to have a closing ng
include now what we want to have is a
property that is source so the source or
SRC is going to be equal to in quotes
the new template that we're looking for
which is person dot HTML okay so now
we're including person HTML with this
ng-include tag now here's where it gets
interesting because we have this source
attribute that is looking for which is
an HTML attribute what it actually needs
is inside of these source quotes are an
additional pair of single quotes now
these quotes are easy to forget but
ng-include is looking for a string
itself so if this was coming from our
controller be defined as a string like
so and then you could output it with the
curly brackets but since we're not
outputting with curly brackets we just
need it like this ok now let's refresh
this page now if you'll notice we're
getting in a XML HTTP request error now
this is a problem with because this is
not using a web server we're essentially
just using the file it's giving us a
cross origin request error so the way we
can get around this is actually by
spinning up a quick and easy server
we're gonna be doing that with just a
Python server you know I'm not sure if
I found is included in Windows but in
Mac you can come to your terminal browse
to the file structure if I hit LS or L
you can see I'm at the root of my
project directory and from here I can
simply save Python - M simple HTTP
server just like so and if I hit enter
there it's going to be starting up a
server on port 8000 now what we can do
is browse to localhost colon 8080 learns
there's some issues here because we're
using ng-include as a directive itself
it's no messing up our display flex if
you haven't used flexbox you may not
understand why so what we want to do is
actually use ng-include itself on the
list item that way we don't have an
additional wrapper around our content so
as we showed you you can use ng-include
as its own element or you can use it by
simply removing this SRC equals like
this let's cut this whole line out here
and we'll delete this whole line of code
and after and before this closing caret
here we can paste this in here and now
we're saying inside of this list item
include ng - include this string so if
we say this now we refresh you notice
our lineman issues are fixed because we
now don't have that extraneous ng
include element so if you don't need
that element there you can just use
something like this by throwing ng
include onto the container itself okay
so now this is great we have separation
a little bit now we want to edit a
person we know exactly where to go and
with it's in person HTML however that's
not all that ng include is capable of in
fact we can use ng include to bring in
SVG's inline which will allow us to
style them with CSS so inside of my span
here I'm gonna
put this on a new line I'm gonna make an
ng Ong - include like so and we're gonna
have SRC again equals double quotes and
then a set of single quotes just like we
had last time I'm going to close this
element out now I'm going to browse to a
path which is going to be /img because
you can see I have an image directory
here and inside of there I have a
Twitter SVG which is the SVG file right
here now we have slash Twitter dot s BG
okay so the brilliance of this is now
that we refresh you can see we have
these tweet these Twitter Birds all over
the place well let's actually check out
the HTML instead of actually referencing
this SVG like an image like we were - if
we had just an image SRC tag it's
actually bringing in the entire SVG into
our HTML and you can see just like so
and we have this path with a fill in it
okay cool so let's go ahead and actually
edit this SVG file let me show you
something pretty cool here so if we come
to our Twitter SVG the fill is on this
path so I can go ahead and give this an
ID let's say something like let's just
say Twitter there's a ideas Twitter and
I'll copy this come to our HTML we have
to save this SVG by the way come to our
HTML and now we can style this simply by
saying Twitter and if we were to say
fill we could fill this in with a blue
color hey now let's come back here and
let's refresh and just see if you're not
getting this blue color but the CSS QT
is getting through because there's a
fill already on it so let's go ahead and
just add an important here just like so
okay we now are able to style these SVG
files even though if you look at our
HTML in our person dot HTML we're not
actually having to include all of that
SVG stuff in the past if you wanted to
have inline SVG we would typically copy
all of this stuff we would throw it into
our document and suddenly our HTML looks
terrible because it has a bunch of XML
stuff in it so that's great we no longer
have to worry about that
using ng-include we can include an SVG
just like we put an image and we still
get access to the ability to style with
CSS really giving us the full power of M
minus VG's perfect so that is ng-include
you can include templates you can
include code as always this is Scott
with level of tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video hit us up at Twitter I level
up huts we love to hear from you thanks
for watching we'll see in the next one
