up tubs and today I'm going to show you
how to do some stuff using arguments in
views or as they're called and views
three contextual filters so to do see
it's contextual filters I'm going to do
something kind of interesting and we're
going to do it on a block view so to
give you guys an idea of what we're
going to do I'm going to add a new field
to our project and I want to say who the
designer was because I'm not going to be
the designer of all of these projects I
do a lot of just web development for
other designers or even at my job every
day so I want to be able to put up those
projects as well because this isn't just
a site for my freelance work this is
site for all of my work so I want to say
who the designer was so I'm going to
make a new field this just says field
designer we're going to select a it's
going to be a text whereas this is just
going to be a text field that's it no
big deal I'll throw this up here and
save this okay so what I want is I want
this text this designer field I want
this to appear in the right column of my
projects let's go to our project right
now I'll add a designer but let's just
go to any of them projects
let's see find content let's go to a
project let's go to sass mastery
okay so here's this project that I made
it's a video tutorial series I did sass
mastery that is on the Tut's Plus
marketplace so the content I have here
is the image for the project I have a
paragraph sort of explaining what sass
mastery is and but what I really want is
I want the designer to be uh in a column
here I don't necessarily want it to be
in the same zone so if you remember if
we look at our regions if we look at our
blocks let's check this out you know
these are our regions right so feature
content sidebar first there's no where
you can really say show up in in the
sidebar here in the sidebar first so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a view and what the view is going
to be doing is it's going to be looking
at this URL
determining what content piece I'm on
and it's going to display the proper
content okay so there are lots of other
ways you could do this this is a great
thing about Drupal is there's all sorts
of ways to do anything so if you already
know a way to accomplish this feel free
and do it the way you know how but this
is going to be using contextual filters
with views so let's get started to get
started I'm actually just going to put
in a designer in this even though this
is for me and I designed this I'm going
to put designer Scott to Lensky okay
cool
save this great so you can see it shows
up right here that's not quite where I
want it so let's go into views and we're
going to create a new view and this view
is going to be a block of U and we're
going to just call this a well the view
name is going to be a project side info
okay and the block title I'm not going
to give it a block title you don't have
to this is just you know it's going to
show up with nothing if you do and I
only want to want it to display one item
per page because that one item is going
to be the particular item from this
piece of content so let's continue and
edit okay
so continue and edit here we are it
right now it's saying you know let's see
it's looking for just published off and
it's going to have a title and by
default you know because I said it's
only one item it's just going to be
looking at the newest one because our
sort criteria by default is by post date
so the most recent thing is SAS mastery
but if we weren't doing the most recent
piece of content here assess mastery
would still show up here that's not what
we want in fact we want this to show up
only on the SAS mastery page so actually
really quick let's just change this
display name up here just so we can find
it we're going to save project side info
apply this and I'm going to save this
and then in another tab really quick I'm
just going to add this block to the page
scroll down here and your blocks it
should be
object left in the project site info
right here you're going to put this on
sidebar first and we're going to save
this block and actually right here in
this configure I'm going to say I only
want it to be on pages that are under
projects so let's see sidebar first and
I'm going to say only on the list of
pages and we're going to do projects
enter and then projects and then they
were going to do a forward slash and
then an asterisk and this is saying all
of the pages that are underneath
projects are going to have this black
drop actually don't want this to show up
on the projects pages specifically
because the project page is just going
to have all my projects I want this to
show up on the projects the pages that
are within projects so we're going to
save this block cool it's all saved up
and let's actually go to that particular
projects page just so you can see that
block is there already so here we have
this block it's a sass mastery you know
that's that's cool but if we were to go
to a different project let's go to this
perpetual one it's still sucess mastery
right that's not what we want so to
illustrate this let's go back to sass
mastery here and we're going to want
this to be able to say my name which is
cool which is what we want but we need
to be able to pass in a contextual
filter that's basing what a piece of
content you're on so it knows what to
display here so under the Advanced tab
we're going to click this and we're
going to add a contextual filter we're
going to want to say what's the contents
node ID and we're going to pull that
from the URL so we're going to look for
content where where is it here we got
content and the node ID okay so this is
going to be grabbing the note ID and
using this as a contextual filter to
show what we wanted to show let's click
Add up to all displays and then in here
we're going to have to select some
options we don't want to display all
results for the specified field but we
want to provide
default value and this default value is
going to be one of these options so what
it's going to be is going to be the
Content ID from the URL so we're
grabbing what the content is from the
URL and we're using that to filter out
our data so that it's displaying the
correct thing okay so that's all we need
to do let's click Add to all displays
I'll click Save here ok so now if we
come down here to our preview we can
update our preview notice
nothing's here because we are have to
pass in an argument right here it's
asking for what the contextual filter is
and normally if we're on this page the
contextual filter comes right from this
piece of content but if I hover over
this edit right it's going to say that
this is node number 14 if you look at
the very very bottom of your browser
window it's going to say localhost
whatever node 14 edits so we know that
this is node number 14 so to test this
out I just want to show you how this
works if we put in 14 here for our
contextual filter that's saying that the
node ID 14 it should give us sass
mastery so as you can see it's pulling
this node ID from the content in this
case we're giving it 14 if we gave it
something else I'm sure because there
was a 14 there'll be a 13 you can see
new site if I give it 12 it's going to
be something else
okay journal okay great so let's save
this really quick but first let's add
what we actually want to show we want to
show the designer field we don't want to
show the title so we'll add the field
the content designer at all displays yes
I do want this label okay and then now
let's rearrange this so I can get rid of
the title remove add to all displays
okay and now let's save this cool okay
so let's click out of this now in our
page where your fresh open designer
Scott to lynskey that's it let's go to
another projects page I believe before
we run the perpetual one so let's go
back to that one
find content okay
on this page you can see designer it
doesn't have one because we didn't fill
in that field yet so to click Edit
designer I also designed this one so I'm
gonna say designer
skepta Lansky cool let's save this out
cool alright well there it is so that is
the contextual filters in your blocks
this is just using the node ID as a
contextual filter these contextual
filters offer a lot of options so this
is just an introduction and and by no
means this is the definitive tutorial on
contextual filters here we're going to
be going a lot over contextual filters
and how they relate to page views how
they relate to just block reason and
then views in general so feel free to
just play around with it see what you
can get but using this node ID and then
grabbing the Content ID from the URL is
how you're going to be able to display
content from your own page that you're
on right now anywhere you please with
blocks and views cool all right well
this is Scott to let's he again with
level of Tut's and thanks for watching
more drupal tutorials on their way soon
thanks but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
