up touch and today I'm gonna be talking
about feet Stamper and feed Stamper
allows you to really manipulate your
feed that's being brought in so let's
say you have a feed of any type but the
data isn't just quite exactly what you'd
like you can manipulate that data while
it's importing instead of having to go
back and change it or anything like that
and as feed Stamper gives in its
examples you can replace every instance
of the word dog with cat
you can filter items based on keywords
and vocabularies make every letter
uppercase I mean I don't know why I'd
wanna do that because you could do that
with CSS but break a comma separated
into lists into words including taxonomy
terms so if you have a list of comma
separated values you you know you can
have those be taxonomy terms you can
combine separate first name and last
name fields into one name field you can
convert URLs from relative to absolute
so there's all sorts of cool stuff you
can do and really if you need to modify
your feet in any way feed Stamper is
pretty much the way to do it okay
so by now you should know how to install
a module I have my module in my modules
folder I'm gonna go to feeds here and
I'm going to select feeds tamper and
feeds tamper UI and a monkey save and
yeah because without the UI you can't
really get much done so now let's check
out our feed
so here's the RSS feed we're going to be
importing and let's check out some of
this stuff so let's say we wanted to
just get some specific content we want
to edit this wasn't looking as good as
we wanted okay so what we're going to go
from structure is in to tamper which
should now be under your operations so
if you click this it's going to tell you
a little bit of information here so what
we were bringing in before is the title
is going into title and then the
description tag is going into the body
so if we check out our feed here's the
description and here's the title really
are only two things well let's try to
modify these things so let's add up
into the title to see how we can modify
this so you can have it be a keyword
filter you can strip all the HTML make
URLs absolute all this stuff I was
showing you before under there examples
calculate a hash value rewrite it so
let's actually do something really
obvious we're going to truncate and how
many numbers do we want this text to be
limited to we'll say we'll say it's five
characters okay and we'll add ellipses
so this is just for fun I wouldn't
actually want to do this but let's say
you didn't want to bring this whole
thing and you just wanted to truncate it
at ellipses okay so now that value is
actually going to come in truncated and
let's add something for the description
as well let's go to the tree let's see
what kind of keyword there is in this
feed so the word album shows up
sometimes so we have this filter on
album and that's going to look for any
word in the item that has the word album
in the description and it's only going
to tamper those ones so we're saying if
it has an album we want to change it to
you know have the ellipses in the real
life situation maybe you could have the
title change to be something like album
release and your content but in this
case we're just going to have it at the
ellipses and if the word album is
contained in our content and our
description content now we're just going
to save this and now let's try running
our importer so let's save this I guess
it might have been already saved and
let's go to structure it feeds importers
again our RSS feed and let's actually
run this so our domain / imports and now
we're gonna select the RSS click import
and let's see what happens okay
let's check out our nodes so it says 14
total items are imported now let's go to
find content so we can see that there
and you can see it's already working
great because we have these items here
the title has been ellipse Eid and we
can tell why those ones are going to be
the ones that have
the word album so let's actually look
whole album is out now okay and let's go
back let's check out this one Oh an
album is available on this one as well
okay so let's check out these ones that
didn't get filtered let's check out this
one right here and if we search for our
album okay you're not gonna find album
so really it's tampering only the ones
that have the word album okay well those
are two quick examples of what we can do
with feet Stamper really the the power
of feet Stamper is just playing with it
and if you know that the content that's
coming in needs to be changed in some
way I would recommend checking out feed
Stamper and just really trying out and
just seeing what can work for you I
found it to be very successful anytime I
need to modify a feed coming into my
site as always if you have any questions
please leave a comment on the video hit
us up at Twitter our level up Tut's my
name is Scott and once again thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
