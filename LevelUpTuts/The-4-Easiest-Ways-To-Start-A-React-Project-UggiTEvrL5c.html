some of the quickest ways to get up and
running with react and now I don't mean
in this is the sense of the quickest
ways to learn react but in the sense of
the quickest ways to get going and start
writing code and this isn't necessarily
code in an environment like code pen
where your code is living on somewhere
else or another server I'm talking about
an actual project so to get started
there are four great resources to get
started writing excellent react
application code without having to get
bogged down with writing your build
process or anything like that because we
all know the joke of well time to start
a project and I just finished writing my
web pack config hours later so this is
going to involve several different
projects that allow you to have a no
config option of getting started so the
first one is create react app by
Facebook and this is the sort of best
way to get up and running quickly and
the best part about create react app is
if you often need to leave it you can
eject from it as then you can leave
create react app and move your
application into a more customizable
environment that would allow you to take
it further but as far as getting up and
running goes you can't really get up and
running faster with anything else one
command and you are ready to go writing
your code and if you need to move your
code somewhere else later go right ahead
so create react app is a great way to
get started writing react code now if
you're looking for something a little
bit more deploy ready we have next J s
known XJS as you can see is a framework
for server rendered statically imported
react apps again next takes care of a
bunch of stuff for you they even have a
nice resource have learned that next J
s.com
so this is a great option if you just
want to give building and build a quick
site in fact the syntax dot F M site for
the
Podcast at West Boston I create is made
in next j/s simply because it's easy to
get up and running with you hardly have
to worry about routing and it basically
takes care of a bunch of stuff for you
along with some really interesting
features like automatic code splitting
server-side rendering and a new react
lifecycle hook called get initial props
so it's definitely an opinionated
framework but one that makes building
quick things in react super nice and
super easy okay next we have GATS feet
Jas
now gatsby Jas is a static site builder
and what that means is that you write
your code in react you run a command and
it spits out an HTML and JavaScript site
for you that you can host literally
anywhere now Gatsby is a great option if
you want to build your blog and use some
tools like graph QL but it's also a
great option for building simple sites
because it allows you to just write
react code and output a static site
without having to worry about your web
pack configuration even though it does
use webpack behind the scenes but these
sites are blazingly fast I'm telling you
everything I've created in Gatsby
jeaious including my own personal site
has just been a dream of an experience
so check out Gatsby j/s there are basic
tutorials on this YouTube channel under
the gets bjs tutorials playlist so check
out those if you want to get started
with something like this keep in mind
though it is a static site generator
more so than an application framework
next we have a meteor now it's no secret
that I love building apps with meteor
and react and this option is really good
if you are looking for something that
again has no configuration on the build
tool side of things but includes a
database option now with meteor that
database option is MongoDB and while I
personally enjoy working in MongoDB some
others may not however one of the
greatest things about working in meteor
is just how quickly and easily you can
get started writing a real time app with
WebSockets and have a database to go
along with it remember
that two-way data-binding example from
the very first release of angular that
made everyone excited - just how easy it
was to type in a text box and have that
type appear right well you get this same
exact kind of thing except only this
time instead of having that text just
show up you're also getting to save
things in a database in real time and
having the user interface react
accordingly it makes using a database
with free act so incredibly simple
without having to write an API but
obviously these are just basic key you
up and running features however meteor
as a framework has a lot of advanced
features that allow you to grow as your
project becomes less and less of a hobby
project for instance the level up
tutorial site is built on meteor + react
so I can say I've used all of these four
methods here the great react app I use
within the upcoming react 16 for
everyone series and I absolutely love
the experience and next j/s we use on
syntax data FM gasps bjs I use on my
personal site and that meteor I use for
the level up tutorial site so all of
these have their own place their own
reason to use them but are all great
ways to get up and running with react
code without having to learn about build
tools and all that stuff that can weigh
your experience down and confuse new
developers so I hope this reduces some
of the barrier to entry for react for
you check it out check out any of these
that seem like they might excite you so
if you want to learn react painlessly
while going over all of the basics all
the way to building really cool stuff
this is the application that we'll be
building in this series head over to
level of tutorials comm and become a pro
and you'll get access to all twenty plus
videos of this series where you're going
to go from absolutely knowing nothing
about react to building interfaces like
this or you can wait until it's released
later this month which is October and it
will be available at store develop
tutorials calm for purchase if
subscriptions aren't your thing so check
it out these are the easiest ways to get
started with
react thanks so much for watching and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
