up tuts and today I'm going to be
talking about a box sizing border box
and if you're familiar with the box
model and CSS you know that padding
contributes to part of the width of your
block element so if we had an element
that was 200 pixels wide with 20 pixels
padding on left and right the width is
actually going to be 240 when it's
calculated not 200 like you told it in
your CSS so if we inspect this block
that we have right here our div main
wrapper you can see this in action it's
telling us that this is 840 pixels wide
however in our CSS we've said that the
max width can be 800 pixels so it adds
that padding to the total width well
this may not exactly function like you
would expect it to function you know if
you told it to be 800 pixels wide you
want it to be 800 pixels wide as far as
I know this is the first article that
has really touched on this it came out
February 1st of 2012 by Paul Irish and
it's this box sizing border box for the
win
I'm going to post this link in this
video but I would suggest reading this
it's a great great article uh and it's
something that I've really come to love
on projects that I've been using lately
because I have decided that I don't need
to support some of the browser's that
this doesn't work with in fact this only
works in browsers in IE 9 and 8 and up
and the latest Firefox versions in
Chrome you shouldn't really have
anything to worry about
Firefox needs the mods prefix however
the other browsers do not need anything
however if you want to support ie6 and 7
there is a polyfill available on this
page here link to this and it will show
you how to make this work within those
browsers but so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to grab this code I'm actually
going to grab the whole thing and I'm
going to add this to my CSS and then
we're going to refresh this page and
you're going to see exactly what
happened what I'm going to do is I'm
going to put it right at the top here
and what this asterisk does is it's a
wild card this is saying everything
this asterisk is saying everything on
our site Maas use border box
WebKit box sizing use border box and box
sizing border box so what this is going
to do is it's going to make our elements
that are if we declare them being 800
pixels wide they're going to be 800
pixels wide so let's check out our page
you'll refresh and we'll see what's
going to happen immediately cool that
looked like it tighten things up a
little notice how everything sort of
pulled in because now the padding is now
just part of the width so this might be
nice in case you're using percentages or
something if you want to say this is 50%
it's going to be 50% regardless of what
your padding is so you can see now that
this actually says it's 800 pixels wide
the padding does not contribute to the
width and this is really nice personally
when writing CSS I like to see that what
I am typing is reflecting exactly what's
showing up on the page and box-sizing
border box definitely helps with that
and makes things a little bit nicer read
the post the Paul Irish post and check
this out use it for yourself if you need
to support it on those older browsers
like I said there's a polyfill so this
is box size or boarding border box
really simple it's one line of CSS you
can add to the top of your code and it
might make your life a little bit easier
so as always this is Scott with level of
Tut's if you have any questions please

me up a Twitter level of Tut's let us
know what you're thinking thanks for
