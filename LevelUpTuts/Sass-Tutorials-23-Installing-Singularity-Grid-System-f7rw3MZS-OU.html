of HUD's and today I'm going to show you
to use singularity on your SAS projects
and the singularity is a awesome very
flexible grid framework that you can use
to build pretty much any type of grid
that you like and so in the last video
we showed you how to install SAS
globbing and we set that us set that up
with this require now to install this
gem we can really install it the same
way that we installed the previous
globbing gem so we can say pseudo gem
install and then its singularity GS now
this is going to install singularity
however they do say on their side that
the preferred method is to make a gem
file and then run the bundle command
bundle install and that definitely works
but if you just have this project like
this and you're you know running your
compass watch the same way we're doing
here it to be honest it doesn't really
matter if you were having a bunch of
gems and maybe use these gems on lots of
projects then it made sense to have a
gem file with SAS compass singularity
and then you could run bundle install
and it make sure that you have all of
those things installed so although we're
not doing that with this method this
time we have the gem installed on the
less so let's come back to our project
and now we just really need to require
and we're going to require and here
singularity and so I'm going to make
sure I spell this correct
singularity GS okay and now we have our
our grid framework setup okay so how do
we use singularity well any way that we
use the singularity nixon's that come
with the singularity grid system we'll
have to import singularity just like we
imported our variables and stuff like
that so at the top here we can just say
add import and then again singularity G
and then semicolon so just like that we
should be able to use singularity so
let's check out our our compass watch
right now you see we have all sorts of
some errors here right basically it's a
little confused uh and that's because we
have an unreadable singularity GS and if
you remember in the last video we made a
modification to config dot RB and we had
to restart compass watch since we didn't
do that this time it's giving us errors
so let's go ahead and command C to
cancel this out and now we can then once
again what run compass watch and you'll
see that in fact we save this and there
is no errors saying that there's an
unreadable singularity D s so that's a
success
we now have singularity being used on
this project and we're ready to start
creating our grid so in the next video
we're going to create a basic symmetric
grid using singularity it's going to be
non-responsive it's not going to be
anything fancy but it's going to be a
grid system and it's going to work
really well so check it out next video
come in very soon we're going to be
working with grid systems so as always
this is Scott with love-love tuts if you
have any questions or comments please
leave a comment the video or hit us up
at Twitter LevelUp tuts
let us know what you think you would
love to hear from you thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
