tutorials and today we're going to be
talking about a sketch plugin that fixes
some of the inherent issues with
sketches copying and pasting so in the
current state of sketch when you copy
and paste when you paste the object that
you're pasting might not do exactly what
you'd expect so check it out let's get
started right now so let's check this
out we have two Art boards here this one
of which you may be seen as in these
other videos and to illustrate this i'm
gonna select this this rectangle here
and then if you click our board to and
paste you'll notice that it paste it in
the same spot and it's grabbing those
dimensions or describing those position
coordinates from the previous artboard
however let's come back here let's
select this rectangle here again let's
come in and let's say we're actually
working on art board too but we've never
selected it if i go ahead and click
command V you'll notice that it's we
have no idea where this thing pasted in
we have zero clue but if we come back
here you'll notice that's in the middle
of the artboard one so obviously that's
not right if we come back here we're all
zoomed in we've selected artboard to
this time and we hit command v gil most
sketched us some weird stuff if we
scroll back up you'll see it pasted in
the correct place but it decided to take
our video our window here all the way
down to the center of the document so
this is just sort of weird right I mean
it took us away from what we were
working on what's in our view port in
what we want to be doing right now so
let's say we selected this play button
we can come over to this artboard and
click on it and paste it you could think
that it would come into this artboard I
mean I clicked on this artboard but
you'll notice because the upward wasn't
selected in the layers panel or we
didn't click it up here and actually the
original copy went back over here and in
fact it was weird because it didn't even
taste it in the same spot it paste it
directly in the center and so basically
the paste function is just really sort
of all over the place that's not
necessarily always doing what you're
expecting something to do right well if
we're in this viewport and we're looking
at something else and we pay something
you should have expected to be where
you're looking so let's go ahead and
adjust that with a better pasting
package for sketch so I'm going to come
into my tool box if you don't use sketch
tool box you should start doing that now
I'm going to go ahead and search for
paste so sketch better paste is the one
that we're looking for let's go ahead
and click install so this is going to
paste like it was meant to be into the
art bird that you're currently viewing
so now let's copy this rectangle let's
come over here into art board too now
let's come to plugins and we want to
have a sketch better paste let's click
better paste you'll see that the command
is ctrl V so we can also just do ctrl V
and you'll notice just pasted her to run
to the artboard here it's right where we
were focused on I never had to click on
anything and my voice if we scroll down
here and we're expecting this rectangle
to get posted into our viewport if we'd
hit control V again you'll see it posted
it at the top but it posted it directly
in our viewport so it's not like we're
having to go off and find it likewise if
I'm coming over here and let's select
this oval it's copy at command C let's
head back over here and I'm pasting I
don't necessarily want this to paste
relative to where it was in the previous
document I just sort of wanted wherever
I'm working I'm working in this space
right here currently so ctrl V paste it
right where you'd expect in the working
environment that you're currently in
likewise if we scroll down here and do
ctrl V again it posts it right here so
now it gives us the opportunity to work
with this like we would probably have
intended to in the first place its
greatest since this is mad to control V
it's
sort of expanding your paste
functionality so instead of pasting
relative to whatever you click down last
or anything like that it's now pasting
relative to where you're looking and and
that can be super helpful if you find
this more helpful than the standard
method you could always come in to
System Preferences we could come into
keyboard shortcuts then we could come in
here and we can add a sketch app
shortcut that would be for control V to
override the general paste functionality
however I sort of like the other way of
going about this where you have control
V and command V as your option to toggle
between the two different types of
pasting because while this is called
better paste plugin I think that might
be a little subjective to what better is
sometimes you want to know exactly what
you're clicking on and where you're
pasting at other times you maybe want
this to just paste right where you're
looking at this affords you the options
to do either or cool so that's better
paste for sketch it allows you to
completely take control of how you're
pasting in your content into your
document as always this is gobble up
