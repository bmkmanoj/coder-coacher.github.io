actually liked this better when we had
only a padding of 10 so I'm going to
change this padding to attend and now
what we're going to show you how to do
is how to use flex box in this design
here to have your objects inside of a
container flow without you having to
really position them individually so
let's go ahead and put some text inside
of this row here so I'm just going to
add the text layer and it's going to be
my name okay there we go I'm gonna
change the font because we don't need
them on US based funding more think a
little bit bigger make it white here we
go okay so we now have my name in here
and let's go ahead and actually move
this layer into there so I'm going to
give this a class name of just name okay
pretty straightforward so now let's
actually add one more item in here and
the less what I'm just going to add as a
triangle here so we go to shape triangle
let's go ahead and add a triangle to
make it here it's rotated a bit and I'm
gonna stretch out just this way a little
bit okay fine so now we have this arrow
here right and let's give this triangle
let's bring it down here and let's
modify the name so we're just gonna head
arrow and it's going to be dot arrow
just for consistency sake by the way you
can really name as you've seen with this
Scott let's go layer you can name the
layer whatever you like the class name
just has to correspond with these styles
that you're giving it okay so now these
all these items are inside of this
container and we're only really defining
anything with photos so what do you
suppose happens when we select off
everything and do command ctrl L
well you'll notice that they stack
vertically except for the triangle
because it hasn't been given a sort of
dimensions it gives us negative point
one height it gets all messed up so I'm
going to command Z and get things back
to where they were okay so let's define
some things here and we want this
triangle which we had class s0 to be wit
will have it be 40 and height will have
a be 35 okay now we do command ctrl L
you can see that they all stack like
this and you might be wondering about
the stacking order so you'll notice it's
reversed to how they harm in the layer
properties so we have Scott wolinski
then we have the photo then we have the
arrow as it's going down it he hits each
one of these and sticks them on top what
if we don't want these to a critically
want them laid out horizontally along
this rectangle what we can do is on the
row we can add some flexbox property so
we can simply say flex Direction row by
saying flex Direction row we're
basically saying instead of being a
column here um actually you need to
spell flex correctly not living fire
okay there we go now we can have a
command ctrl L and you'll see that these
are all laid out now in a horizontal row
now this is pretty good however the
orders all messed up we want the circle
in my name and then the triangle so
let's go ahead and reorder them so we
want this circle then my name in the
triangle command ctrl L
and now we have some issues the arrow is
getting pushed off because this text box
has been given way too much width here
it's set to a fixed within the width is
350 for our 3 35 pixels so this isn't
really flexing things are just sort of
showing up as their size we could always
just put this text box to auto and it
would fix it however it let's try
something else since we have to CSS here
let's go ahead and I'm going to add a
new property for named open and close
now i'm going to give this flex oh wait
so the name let's just give it a flex of
two okay let's click off command ctrl L
and you'll now see that the triangle
shows up on here so what did I just do
well this flex of two is basically just
saying that your name here this name
class has a weight of two so basically
this one's going to take up much more
space than these other two items here
now we have some weird alignment issues
since this is only 30 the the arrow here
is only 35 pixels tall it's not lining
up vertically with the circle so since
we have 40 verse 35 let's actually a day
margin-top to this arrow and we're just
going to have it be margin-top and we're
just going to have it beat three pixels
to try to make up some of that
difference man control L pushes it down
looks a little bit better now we want to
actually give some space in here so we
can say name let's give name a margin
left
of 10 okay command control hell and you
can see we got that space let's go ahead
and add a margin top to the name as well
and we'll just say 10 okay that could
probably you to pull back to like a
eight or nine even though it's just
nitpicking at this point let's go ahead
and try that once more perfect okay so
this is starting to come together it's
starting to look a lot better and the
best part is it flows into whenever we
make any modifications things just sort
of fit in where they can so let's go
ahead and add a square actually we're
just going to add a rectangle and I'm
going to show you how this works this is
going to be really super cool so we
throw this rectangle in here anywhere I
know I'm actually going to give this a a
class of photo as well just so we can
get bitten height so we can say swear is
going to be so you need to say wreck is
going to be photo and now let's do
command ctrl L and as you can see the
first item the circle is still 20 pics
is first 10 pixels in from the row the
last item is still 10 pixels in from the
right of the row and this new square
just sort of filters in if we were to
change the order of this command control
Oh which is something you'll be used to
it's now doing the exact same thing just
reversed order okay so let's get rid of
the square it was better without it so
let's get rid of it there we go cool now
let's actually take this row and let's
duplicate it the hold down option and
drag a couple times here and now that we
have a few rows
I'm going to go ahead and rename these
to get rid of this copy at the end of
here so they're just roll period row now
if these were real rows of things you
might want to label them accordance to
what they actually are okay so now that
we have those rows we can know once
again do command ctrl L and now just
like that we've taken one style that we
had here we've distributed it we've
aligned it we whatever but now we can
modify any of these individually in any
sort of way we can change the text to
say okay there we go we can change the
text we can modify the background we can
do whatever we'd like here and now once
we hit command ctrl L regardless it's
not going to change anything it's just
going to take the layout that we defined
and make sure everything fits the layout
so that way if you've done this design
cop now and somebody says that's great
but we actually don't want these to be
10 pixels from the border we want them
to be 15 pixels from the border now
before you'd have to select these you
would have to resize them you'd have to
worry about the things that are you up
to you'd have to worry about the content
inside those moving those over as well
for every single one of these and if you
have a whole lot of them it could be a
huge pain now we can simply come here
and instead of our inside of our
container we can say we want this margin
left to be 15 we want the margin top to
be 15 and we want the width to be 3 45
instead because that's 10 more pixels
and we're gonna have to change the width
of the row itself to to be 345 know if
you want to see something else
interesting we can always come in here
to this container and get rid of the
width here as well so now since we've
the width of the row we only have to
define it here let's go ahead and click
out main control L and you'll notice
just like that we have this padding in
here and now we want to have five more
pixels to the margin bottom good command
ctrl L and we now have more spacing
between all of these now imagine how
much fun that would have been with
content and the design you've been
working on for a while using the
built-in distribute tool and sketch it
would have taken a long time in order
huge pain now some things to know about
this is that these classes are only
going on our only pertained to what on
this page if you have other pages they
will not apply and you can certainly
hide visually highlight these classes if
you're not using them you can lock and
hide them or something and let's modify
our design here move this over here to
main control help you'll notice they
still work so they don't have to be
visible to be working so like I said
this is a completely game-changing
plug-in for sketch three allows you to
create these flexible layouts so easily
now in the next video we're show you how
to create actual prototypes and use
those prototypes as part of your design
and then have your designs snap to
what's defined in your prototypes so as
always this is scott the level of
tutorials you have any questions or
comments they become the video artists
of a twitter facebook at level up
tutorials we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
