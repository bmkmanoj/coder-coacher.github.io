Tut's bringing you your third Adobe
Premiere tutorial in the series premiere
basics the very first thing we're going
to get into here is a timeline basics so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
import some footage not from a camera
we're not going to get into that yet
that's going to be next lesson but with
just some you know an MOV file we have
here on my desktop and then we're going
to get into the timeline basically you
know being able to trim edit cut all
that stuff nothing too crazy but just so
you get familiar with the timeline and
that sort of thing so what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to start a new project
browse go to the desktop so what you
want to do is when you're working with
video are you working with any sort of
assets that's not you know being
captured directly into your project at
the time you're going to want to keep
them all in the same folder so that way
if you decide to move your project
around later Adobe Premiere knows where
all those files are because a copy of it
will be in that folder so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create a folder
called a Tut let's see time line basics
great put my source footage into that
folder and this is where we're going to
set the destination of our project to be
as well okay you'll notice your scratch
disks like we covered in the first video
or all set to this folder as well okay
click OK because the footage i have is
not a wide screen i'm just going to go
with the standard 48k sequence one is
fine okay so now we're all brought up
here so basically what we're going to do
is we're going to import some footage so
there's a couple ways to do it I mean
you could do finder or you could do file
import and bringing your footage that
way but this is just as easy to go to
finder browse to your folder grab your
assets and then just drop them
indirectly
and you'll notice it's right here up
here you can sort of scrub through it
you can press play whatever all this
stuff is basically your your file viewer
so there's a couple things we can do
this is doing ok so if you double-click
on your icon here brings it up in your
source this way we could watch the
footage and then pick out individual
parts if we want to send them to our
timeline here or if you would like the
entire unedited clip you can just go
ahead and drag this directly to your
timeline but since i want to show you
how to you know set in and out points of
bring get in we're going to do it this
way first so this is a your scrubber
here this is the entire distance of
whatever clip you have open and this is
not in any sort of way you're in your
project this is strictly viewing this
file so let's say we want to start
immediately after the water after it's
been stirred here so there's a couple
ways you can do then you can set
endpoints here just by clicking this
another way you can do it is by hitting
the I button on your keyboard that has
the same exact feature if you'll notice
here that shows that you're at your end
point so what's the saying is is the
part that you want to use is starting
right here so let's say we want it to
end right after the flower peaks right
here so you can do here or if you'll
notice when you're hovering over it says
you could hit 0 as well I usually just
do I and OH easy to remember in and out
so now that you have this section
selected you want to put it in your
timeline you know there's there's ways
to do that with all these and you know
insert whatever but I think the easiest
way is to just click and drag the
footage
just drag it where you want if you'll
notice now in your in your program
window this is now showing the footage
that you set your in and out points and
it is only the length that you set in
and out now if you know later you want
to you know use some of the footage you
cut out here it still exists this is
just referencing your movie here so if
you hover your mouse over here you'll
see this red bracket with arrows you can
click and drag that and that would you
know allow you to use the rest of that
footage that is stored with that file so
this is your sequence I feel notice this
video one video one is basically just
the the track of you to have something
on top of it on video too it would
overlay on top of video one and video
three as well so it's sort of like
layers in Photoshop in the same way is
if you go down here's your audio tracks
now audio tracks aren't going to layer
over there just going to mix in with the
the master audio so because this audio
goes with this clip whenever you dragged
one the other one will move you can
unlink those let's say we don't want the
audio from this at all you just right
click on link and then you can select
just one click the delete button and
notice this doesn't delete the audio
from the video clip itself let's say if
we were to drag another one the audio
will be back in it just deletes it from
our timeline this is just referencing
this so here we are you can scrub
through it um whole I hear this red bar
means that the footage has not been
rendered yet basically rendering saves
like a cached version of the file to
your system so that can reference and
play it back at full speed it's really
useful if you have layered clips and or
if you're working with after effects
because you want to be able to play back
at full speed if it's all
read typically your computer will be
able to handle playing back and
processing the footage at the same time
so it's really useful over here you'll
notice a couple of tools basically it is
an unnumbered marker this is an encore
chapter marker encore is the DVD
publishing suite from Adobe so in case
you wanted to put chapters in your you
know your toll your sequence that when
you publish a DVD you can skip to those
chapters this is useful this magnet is
snapping so let's say if i have the
playhead right here and i want to edit
this i'll grab here and it when it gets
close enough it just jumps to it so this
is useful if you know let's say you've
browsed to this point right here and
you're like oh this is exactly where i
want this so it'll snap directly to it
okay and so down here we have what looks
like two mountains the smaller the
mountains the wider your scope is if
you'll notice this goes all the way to
surround seven seconds and then if you
the larger mountains it's basically
zooming in and in an end and you can get
real nice and close almost frame by
frame depending on how how close you
want to go and I mean this is useful if
you have some really tight editing that
you need to do is so it's very useful
you're always changing you can also
change that by on the the keyboard you
can press the plus or the minus button
and uh plus just zooms in minus zooms
out you don't have to hit ctrl or
command or anything just just the plus
or minus so let's say you need to split
your footage you know in the case that
there's a part in the middle that you
need to cut out or you need to insert
something in between two Clips premiere
makes are really easily you can just use
the razor tool
do that by clicking on the little razor
that's up in the upper left-hand corner
up here or you can just hit C on your
keyboard these keyboard shortcuts are
really nice to learn because they make a
life pretty quickly so you don't have to
be going up to the toolbar all the time
so c is for the razor tool which is just
cut so if let's say i want to split it
right here if you'll notice there's like
a straight vertical line here we click
splits and here we now can move this
left this here and we have two separate
pieces that can both be expanded to
their entirety because we have snapping
on if they get close they'll snap
together and that's it for the razor
tool well that's just about does it for
this tutorial in the next tutorial we're
going to go over some more sequence
basics we're going to show you how to
layer footage bring in some text you
know maybe do some opacity changes once
again this is Scott with level of Tut's
