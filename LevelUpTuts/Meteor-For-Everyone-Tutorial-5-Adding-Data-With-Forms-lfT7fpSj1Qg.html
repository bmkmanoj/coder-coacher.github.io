of tutorials and today we're going to
show you how you can add things to your
collection using a form so it's going to
be your classic here's a form you enter
your data hit submit and that
information is not only going to hit and
save into your database but it's also
going to be displaying live on your site
without you having to do anything extra
so it's one of the really cool things
that meteor does by sort of combining
aspects of the front and back end
together you don't have to worry about
telling the front end of the site to
redisplay the content once something's
been added the whole system just sort of
knows so we're going to get into that
right now by adding content to our
collections so in the last video we
created our collection and we added
items to our collection using the Mongo
interface via command line and that's
not super fun and that's not how you'd
ever really want to use your application
so let's think about how we can go ahead
and start adding a form on our page that
can actually add new resolutions itself
so if we come to our page you'll see we
really just have a resolution name and
when we created new resolutions we gave
it a date of new date and that was just
part of the Mongo insert line that we
wrote so we really don't need a whole
lot more here on our HTML page if we
come there so let's go ahead and add a
form on our HTML page and we're going to
do it inside of the body here
and I'm actually going to do a couple of
things first because we really just had
this ul we had that all before so let's
go ahead and add a container something
that a div with the class of container
and
let's indent these another list okay and
now we're going to add a header and
inside of our header is going to contain
an h1 and let's just put in the title
monthly resolutions okay
now this isn't anything really
necessarily have to do with the form
it's just going to once I pass you along
the CSS which actually should have
available to download at the in the
description of this video that way yours
can look just like mine so we have this
h1 here and also inside of here we're
going to put a form so let's just type a
normal form okay now for the action
we're not going to have anything we're
just going to leave this as a form
however we are going to give this a
class and it's going to have a class of
new - resolution and so here we have our
format class of new resolution let's go
ahead and add our first input field so
we're going to say input and the type is
going to be text and the name is going
to be equal to title so if you remember
we had this field title so our input
field is going to have the same name is
that what we want this to be saved as so
we could say named title now let's go
ahead and add a placeholder and that
placeholder is just going to be equal to
a new resolution okay and let's go ahead
and add a select field now let's go
ahead and add an input a submit button
so we can say input and the type is
going to be submit the value is going to
be equal to submit okay and now we uh
and I've actually created a bunch of CSS
already that I'm going to be making
available I'll leave in the description
of the video so you can just simply
paste this into your project into
resolutions that CSS that way if you're
following along your project will look
like mine and it won't
the sort of super ugly blank no styles
okay so we now have this type of text
this input field and all this stuff here
let's let's go ahead and check out our
page okay so it's looking much better
here we have this input field a new
resolution we have a submit button and
we have our two previous resolutions so
now let's go ahead and write our first
event for this template so let's come to
our JavaScript and this is resolution
CAS now below this template dot body dot
helpers but inside of the meteor is
client we're going to add something new
that's going to be template dot body dot
events now this is basically how you
call any kind of event in your project
so we're going to finish it up with
parentheses and then brackets just like
we had before and you can ended up with
a semicolon now it's important to note
that if the thing that we are trying to
have an event on was inside of this
template this resolution template we
would actually be having to say template
dot resolution dot events now this body
is only here because we're not inside of
a template with a name we're inside of
just our standard body tag okay so we
know template dot body dot events now
here's what we're going to be looking
for it's going to be a JavaScript object
just like this resolutions up here was
an object however the key for the object
is going to be a string which contains
the event itself which is going to be a
submit event and then we're going to
space and then the second part of the
string is going to be which element
we're going to be looking for this event
on so we're going to say period new -
resolution because forms have submit
events it's going to be looking at this
new resolution form and when there's a
submit event it's going to trigger the
function that we're about to write if
you wanted this to be a click
event or something like that this submit
would simply be click instead of submit
okay so now we're going to have a colon
and then we're going to write function
and then we're going to pass an argument
into this function and that's event and
then we're going to finish it up with
brackets and this is our function here
now this event contains a lot of stuff
it contains pretty much any information
you want about this particular submit
event and then includes all of the form
data so to get the title out of this
form only to say is far title just to
set it to a variable so we can do
whatever we'd like with it is equal to
event dot target so this is what the
target event is which would be the new
resolutions form and then we're going to
get the field which was title by the
name of the input field and then we're
going to get period value which is the
actual value of the field now we're
going to want to create a new resolution
so before when we had our resolutions
here
we were able to access them with a
resolutions that find now there's a
nother method on this resolutions object
here that we can save resolutions dot
insert now this is going to add a record
to our database so if we have
parentheses and then brackets here just
like this wrap it up with a semicolon we
can go ahead and fill out this object so
for instance we had the title of our
object is going to be colon equal to
title which is the new variable we just
created so the resolutions title is
going to be equal to this title right
here that we just created now let's
actually edit created add date as well
so we can say created at and I have this
in camel case and then a colon here we
can say new date and so we're getting a
new date using the date function that's
simply just going to grab the time at
which
this resolution was created now all this
is all we have to do this resolution
stud insert is going to not only save
this resolution to our database but it's
also going to update our view it's
really cool okay so actually there are
some more things we want to do we want
to clear the form so to clear the form
you can say events dot target dot title
value which is the form input that we
had we can just set that equal to a
blank string and we also want to say
return false because what's going to
happen if we don't have this return
false is that the page is going to do a
refresh because of the submit event okay
so all in all it's really not bad we're
grabbing the value we're saving that
value to a new resolution we are
eliminating that previous value from the
field and then we're making sure the
page doesn't refresh so all of this
combined inside of this template body
events should lead to us to having a
successfully working resolutions form so
a new resolution would be two three ten
books and now I can either hit enter or
submit and instantly it's at the end of
the line now how would you do things
like change the order of these lists and
stuff like that
well we're going to get into that more
when we talk about the blazeview systems
now meteor is broken up into several
separate projects such as space bars
which is a version of handlebars that
handles these loops like here we have
things like blaze which is giving us the
ability to interact with the front end
of the website and all sorts of other
components which we'll talk more about
when it becomes more important but in a
video I'm going to discuss a bit more
about what you can do inside of this
code here not only finding and doing
things like that but what the events and
everything that goes on there cool so we
now have a working form it's adding
things to our collection in the next
video we're going to give the user
the ability to delete records as well as
check them off like a checkmark that's
going to set them to being done which is
an effectively a the checklist style of
application where you can say hey I did
this resolution already cool so as
always this is Scott with level up
tutorials if you have any questions or
comments leave a comment the video or
hit us up at twitter or facebook at
LevelUp tuts we'd love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
