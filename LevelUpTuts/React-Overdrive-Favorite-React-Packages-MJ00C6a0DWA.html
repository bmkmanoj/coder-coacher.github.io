up tutorials and in this exploring react
packages video we're gonna be talking
about one of the coolest packages around
which is react overdrive but before we
get interact overdrive I want to talk a
little bit about this video sponsor
which is dev mounta so what dev Mountain
is is well it's a coding bootcamp where
you can go and you totally immerse
yourself and what I mean by that is well
it's full time so you show up to one of
their locations and you stay and live
there and you obviously get free housing
while you do this and that there's in
several different locations from Provo
Salt Lake Dallas and Phoenix and you
show up and basically you have access to
full time mentors tons of courses and
the ability to just grow as a web
developer designer app developer in a
place that really encourages personal
growth so dev Mountain is super cool
because you show up and get absolutely
real-world training you can see it's
very career-focused they have a huge
network companies like Nike and reddit
eBay LinkedIn Apple HP the list goes on
and on and on so if you're looking to
really step up your career head to dev
Mountain come check out some other
locations check out their courses
request to syllabus take a tour of the
campus and just contact them and step up
your game by taking the leap into
becoming a full time programmer designer
any of that stuff with dev Mountain
alright now back to the tutorial ok so
thanks so much for dev Mountain let's to
get into react overdrive well you can
see it's super easy magic move
transitions for react apps now this
description is definitely a little bit
better maybe not better
definitely more exciting than the react
power plug video that I did in the last
time like I said not necessarily better
more exciting let's check this out
though so what did thick is react
overdrive and what it does is it allows
for really excellent transitions between
two pages with very minimal setup I mean
when I say minimal it's minimal and you
can see some of their examples here one
of the things I really like about react
overdrive is the amount of sort of loud
em
that it gives you which is always a
great thing for documentation so I don't
know if ooh you remember when material
design was first announced all those
years ago but had some really slick
animations except especially the music
app they had a grid of icons and you
clicked one then it went up fullscreen
and everything went really nicely and
even the Google Play Store now when you
click on a photo in the listing it moves
over and becomes the icon it's a nice
transition right like when you click on
something why should something that
appears on the screen and both pages
disappear and then reappear and so one
of those cool things that this does is
it allows you to make these connections
between the either the same component in
two different pages or two entirely
different components and see a little
bit of a transition between the two so
check it out react to overdrive is the
simplest package ever you import it and
then you wrap your thing in an overdrive
tag and you give it an ID then on page
two or wherever you're transitioning to
you find the thing you want to
transition it to you wrap it in an
overdrive tag and you give it the same
ID and keep in mind it has to be the
same ID and it has to be a unique ID so
those two things are the only caveats
here but between that react overdrive
takes care of everything else for you I
mean just check out some of these demos
here and I made different pages look at
that and that's super cool because they
didn't have to do anything they just
wrapped this they wrapped this and react
overdrive took care of everything else
so I actually use this react to
overdrive inside of the reacts according
to some of these demos check out react
overdrive has the smallest API on
animation and animation delay duration
and element and ID all this stuff is
super useful right but at the end of the
day it is extremely easy
right this is just so easy to get up and
running with so I love this package for
this simplicity I love the pack
for the utility and it makes SuperDuper
nice transitions so check out react
overdrive to step up some of your
transition game if you liked this video
and want to learn more about react you
can head to level up tutorials com4
slash store and check out react 16 for
everyone which is my latest series on
react in fact the new series coming to
level up tutorials in December is going
to be on react as well except for this
time react and redux so if you want to
learn a lot about the basics of react
head over to level up Torres comport
rush store and purchase react 16 for
everyone or sign up to become a level up
pro and get access to every series every
single month the moment they're released
so thanks so much for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
