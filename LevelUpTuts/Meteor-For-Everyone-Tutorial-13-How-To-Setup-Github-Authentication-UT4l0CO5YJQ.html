of tutorials and today we're gonna show
you how to use github to log into your
meteor site now we've gone over Facebook
Twitter Google and now the last one
we're going to be doing is github now if
you haven't used github before it's a
social coding site where it allows you
to upload and version control your code
using git and because of that a lot of
developers have github accounts so if
your site is going to be developer heavy
it might be a good idea to give them the
ability to log in with their github
account so let's check that out right
now okay so we're almost there we've
added Facebook we've added Google we've
added Twitter and now the last one I
want to add is github so to it github
we're gonna head over to our terminal
and just like we've been doing with the
meteor Attic how it's Google we're gonna
go ahead and type meteor add accounts -
and now as you probably guessed its
github okay so this is going ahead and
adding our github package the login
service for github accounts has now been
officially added it just adds github and
accounts github heading back over to our
website you see this familiar configure
button we're gonna go ahead and select
that it's gonna give us the helpful
instructions on how to do this so as you
can see this is getting to be a really
useful pattern here where we're
essentially good filling out this
configure form when we want to set these
up so let's go ahead and visit github
calm / setting slash application slash
new it's gonna ask you to log in if
you're not already logged in it's gonna
ask for the application name so we can
just say new year resolutions okay and
now it's going to ask for the homepage
URL so the homepage URL is just going to
be our local host here copy that paste
it in and the authorization callback a
URL is just going to be this underscore
hola forward slash github just like that
now we can add some more information
like a logo and stuff like that that way
if users want a little bit more calm
that's been logging in that's sort of
smart to do we could go ahead and click
register application and once more it's
giving you a client ID and a client
secret
both of these you're gonna want to keep
secret you're not gonna want to
publicize this information anywhere like
I said I'm deleting this application so
don't try to steal this information okay
now and here we're gonna put the client
ID just in here and once more the client
secret is gonna go where it says client
secret should be pretty easy we're
choosing popup based logging and let's
click Save configuration so now as you
see the github was the easiest of them
all it couldn't be any easier we now
have the blue assignment with github and
let's click this and it's telling us
that here we need to authorize this
application so you can log in let's go
ahead and click authorize and we've now
locked in once more it's created a new
user account it has my name just like
the other ones and we're ready to go so
we've now shown you how to log in with
four different services and don't worry
if this mini login videos wasn't enough
for you we're also gonna show you how to
build a custom login system yourself
because there's a whole lot of stuff you
can do by building a custom login system
from scratch instead of using the
accounts UI package you can use just the
accounts package and build the forms and
what happens with those forms and how
they work yourself so check it out a lot
more meteor videos on the way as always
this is Scott with level of tutorials if
you have any questions or comments leave
a comment the video at us up at Twitter
or Facebook at level up tutorials thanks
for watching and we'll see you the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
