of Tut's and today we are going to dive
into omega 4 and now you may have seen
some of our other mega videos click
download on Omega 4 and seen that it
does not look like it looked in our
videos well that's because recently
Omega 4 has been officially released and
recently as in September 24th 2013 is
when version 4.0 it's officially
available as a non development release
so that's exciting
because Omega 4 is a huge step forward
for Omega and now they say Omega 3 still
exists and it does if you really like
the experience of Omega 3 by all means
continue to download Omega 3 and use it
however it's important to know that
Omega development is going to go from
version 7 and on so development is not
going to continue on 3 but as you may
have known mean building sites with
Omega 3 didn't really have any problems
so as long as you know how to use Omega
3 you can continue to create sites you
just have to know that there's gonna be
no more further development on Omega 3
everything's going to be going towards
Omega 4 now well you already know how to
use Omega 3 Omega 4 is the latest and
greatest and it's going to be pushed
into Drupal 8 land in fact they're doing
a lot of things that are in line with
Drupal AIDS guidelines and and it's
really a wonderful advanced new
framework so how is omega 4 different
well in omega 3 you had to do a lot of
things in a visual interface for one you
are assigning regions to a grid within
the appearance menu and then in your own
theme and then basically you had to say
alright
this region is going to be on this grid
well that's no longer the case anymore
because with Omega 4 you have regions
just like a normal theme file and you're
doing all of your grid work in your CSS
and now they assume that you are going
to be using sass however you don't have
to I would definitely recommend using
sass with Omega 4 in fact I personally
would not use Omega without it and
what's really great is that they give
you the option of using a couple of
different grid frameworks of course you
could use your own but rolled into Omega
is either the Suzy gird framework or the
singularity grid framework both of which
are excellent and they're both SAS
frameworks they both have very similar
ideas and now singularity is actually
put out by Team SAS along with some
other extensions that they've added in
here in fact we're gonna go over all of
those in dedicated videos especially
when we go over what files are included
with but there's going to be an
additional functionality that comes with
using SAS that's just going to make your
life easier and the added benefit of
really SAS isn't a whole lot more than
actual just normal CSS so if you are
familiar with CSS then by all means you
should just dive into the SAS you're not
going to really struggle picking
anything up now another cool thing is
that they allow the ability to create
layouts and now layouts are basically
designated TPL file like a PHP file with
the the regions and everything in it so
now instead of doing all this in a
visual interface you're actually getting
to go into the code in your TPL file and
define where all your regions are
outputting
the semantics of your code yourself and
now I really like this because I'm used
to working in code and omega4
is largely in code so if you're not
comfortable in code this might be a good
way to familiarize yourself with some of
the more inner workings of Drupal and
TPL files and stuff like that
so don't let that scare you it's really
not that scary and once you get used to
it I promise you'll prefer it now Omega
4 also has some great things bundled
into it like live reload support it has
drush support so creating a sub-theme is
now through thrush of course you can
create it without drush and we're going
to be doing videos on both of those I
would recommend sucking it up in
installing drush and learning it because
it's really going to make your life
easier again these are all things that
are just going to make your life easier
there's also compatibility libraries
built into Omega 4 that if you need to
support older versions of browsers or
things like CSS PI and stuff like that
you can just one checkbox and enable and
they're there if you don't want to you
don't have to enable them and then
you're not going to have that additional
hit of I guess a file size from those
different tools like select advisor and
again we're going to go over all of
those once we actually get omega going
so keep in mind it says Omega it should
not be used with Omega tools in Delta
these of course are things of the past
these are Omega 3 tools in fact if we
want to use this contextual layout
changing we're going to be using Omega 4
layouts and context as a module and
we're going to go over that too in this
course so to get started we're going to
download Omega 4 put it in our sites
themes or our sites all themes folder
like normal and then we're gonna get
going creating a sub theme so to do that
we're just gonna of course click
download you can download the gzip and
then unzip it and I have my site here
sites all themes and of course I have no
themes in here so I'm going to drop in
this Omega file and this includes
everything we need including an already
made sub theme called home which you can
tear through and look at to see what
kind of cool stuff exists in there or
there's also the Omega base theme which
you're familiar with which includes
themes like things like starter kits so
we have Omega in here now if we go to
our Drupal site you can come back here
we can go to appearance we can see that
Omega is right here and our home
demonstration theme is in here
feel free to enable and check out this
own theme if you like but in the next
video we're gonna get started creating
our own sub theme of Omega 4 so as
always this is Scott with level up Hut's
