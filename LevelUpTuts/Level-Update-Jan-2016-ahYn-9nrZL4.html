tutorials and in this level update i'm
going to be covering what's happened in
this past month of january what's going
to be happening in February now just
like every single month seems to be this
was a very exciting month for level up
tutorials and while it may have seemed
kind of quiet on the video uploading end
I can assure you that i've been
recording and editing and making new
videos like crazy so before i get into
what's coming for tutorial wise let's
get into some new things coming to level
up tutorials so first i wanted to talk
about a new type of video that I'm going
to be producing which is going to be a
question and answers type of video so
what I want you to do is head to the
comments or you can hit me up on email
if you don't feel comfortable posting
your question on the comments section
and I'm going to be doing a series of
Q&amp;amp;A videos where you can ask me any
questions you want about maybe developer
lifestyle or career advice or anything
like that and technical stuff as long as
it's like what do you prefer to use in
these sort of situations rather than can
you solve this bug for me but the video
should be really cool my wife dr. to
lynskey has volunteered to ask me the
questions and be on camera so she's
going to be sitting along with me asking
me the questions and doing the QA should
be a lot of fun now next I wanted to
talk about developing the developer
which is my ebook that I've been
creating now I've been hard at work on
this for a very long time and I can't
wait to get it out so februari I'm going
to be opening up pre-orders and I'm
going to be offering a sample chapter
along with those pre-orders so I know in
the last level update people are
wondering about what the status of that
was basically it's an editing right now
there's a lot of work still to be done
but I can assure you I'm working really
super hard on it so keep your eyes open
for more information I'll probably hit
on that either in the next level update
or release an own video specifically for
that next there's been a huge amount of
progress being made on stored at level
up tutorials com as well as level up
tutorials com these sites I'm both
creating by myself so you may have been
wondering when you went to login to
level up tutorials com while your login
wouldn't work I'm actually starting over
entirely with logins database all that
stuff so create a new account if you're
a pro user your pro
count will get updated don't worry about
that either way these websites are a
huge step forward they're built on a
really nice stack of meteor and react
i'm using stylus for styles there's a
lot going on it's really cool and it's
going to be really nice moving forward
also if you're interested in potentially
working on the level up tutorial site
hit me up at Scott at level up Tut's
calm I can't guarantee pay or anything
just yet but it could give you a good
opportunity to experience a react meteor
stack in the real world and last but not
least there's a new level up tutorial
slack channel that's been really active
a lot of great people everybody chatting
and helping each other out with either
different coding problems or just
talking about life as a developer in
general either way hit up the link in
the description of this video to join
the level up slack Channel and now to
the video tutorials coming in February
now the series that are already being
produced in production or have already
been recorded the atom editor series
that has been released is going to
continue being released the react for
everyone series is going to see a lot of
new videos and the meteor and react
series will be released you might be
wondering about the status of the meteor
and react series basically you won't
find a meteor and react tutorial right
now that doesn't use the react meteor
data mixin now this is important because
with the new es6 syntax there's no such
thing as mix-ins and therefore that
meteor react data nixon will not work so
instead of creating tutorials using this
approach that's currently being used
right now and having them be out of date
once BTW ur 1.3 launches i'm taking my
time to ensure that i'm following
absolute best practices and the
recommended approach which doesn't seem
to be quite fully realized yet so all
the lessons are planned out all the code
is there i'm waiting on a few best
practices and then those videos will
start to roll out very quickly in
addition there's also going to be a new
inside level up tutorials if there's a
particular top you want to see me
covering on inside level up tutorials
let me know and i'll try to make that
happen and other new stuff that's coming
in February is going to be the meteor
topics tutorial series where I cover
little bite-sized topics that everybody
wants to know in meteor such as how to
do a custom login system I'm going to be
sure
then blaze I'm going to be showing it
and react I'm going to be showing it an
angular and then we're going to cover
things like creating a user dashboard
user management ecommerce and all sorts
of smaller bite-sized tutorial topics
that can be plugged into this base theme
and base shell of a website that I've
created already in addition all that
there's a Drupal 8 series that's mostly
recorded it's just about done I still
need to edit I still need to finalize
everything but the Drupal 8 series will
be coming very very soon early early
februari last but not least I'm also
preparing several new series such as one
on pro screencasting and video editing
and one on user interface design and
prototyping to build interactive
prototypes and designs without ever
touching code you'll be able to build
things that actually look and feel like
websites that you can use to present to
your clients and things like that
there's a lot of really great stuff
going to be happening in there we're
going to be taking a full responsive
website from desktop to mobile we're
going to be seeing how to build great
user interactions we're going to be able
to see how to build great website
designs just a lot of really cool stuff
and the Magento two videos are still on
their way I can promise you that they'll
be recorded and released as very soon as
possible so that's it for this video if
you want to see any questions answered
on my questions and answers video leave
them in the comments or send me an email
scott at level up tuts com I'll accept
any questions that are about web
development web design career interview
questions developer lifestyle how to
deal with things like JavaScript fatigue
or anything like that so hit me up with
those types of questions I'll make sure
I get yours answered on air either in
this first video or maybe a next one in
the future so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
