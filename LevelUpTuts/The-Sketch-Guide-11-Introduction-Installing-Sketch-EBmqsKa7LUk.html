explorer sketch the first thing you want
to do is head you sketch app calm now
sketch app calm will tell you everything
you need to know about this application
from quick overviews as to what sketch
can do for you to who's using sketch how
you can learn more about sketch and
adjust all sorts of great things there's
even a section for extensions and they
learn page where you might hear a
familiar voice instructing you on how to
do various techniques within sketch I
highly recommend checking these videos
out and not only because I recorded them
but also because they're a great way to
learn about some of the more in-depth
features in sketch that we may or may
not cover within this series now let's
head to the home page sketch now if you
have not purchased sketch I would
definitely recommend doing so however if
you're just trying it out and want to
see what it's like had to download a
free trial we can always select download
free trial and it's going to give us a
zip of the application if you would like
to purchase sketch go ahead and click
buy now if you just want to try it out
let's go ahead and just select download
free trial and you're going to be
getting a zip of the application you can
see it's downloading right now
now once the zip has finished
downloading we're going to unzip this
and then just basically drop it into our
applications
okay now that sketch is completed
downloading let's click the zip right
here and it's going to unzip it now as
you can see we simply just have a sketch
app in our downloads we can click and
drag and drop this into our applications
by letting go it's going to add this to
our Applications folder now I highly
recommend if you're going to be using
sketch to find sketch in your
applications and then drag it into your
dock as well you can see sketch is
already there for me so now that we have
sketch downloaded let's go ahead and
click to run sketch let's click the icon
right here as you can see we're getting
the welcome to sketch version 42 splash
screen now I can't promise that your
application will be at version 42 when
you get this series however sketch
although it is constantly evolving
should not change too much where in fact
this series becomes invalidated you can
see we have some recent documents I use
sketch all the time
you will not have any reasons however
you will have some templates if you
click on this tab you can see templates
now we also have some quick links here
for what's new to sketch you can join
the newsletter you can learn about
sketch mirror which is the way that you
can preview your designs on your actual
devices or you can join sketch cloud
where you can upload and share your
designs now if you do not want to see
this type of splash screen and you just
want to get right into the interface you
can always uncheck this show this window
on lunch I personally love this
interface and it's not totally overblown
and it opens up really quickly so I
usually leave this checked great so this
is sketch application if we select a new
document and click Choose right here we
are now greeted with the sketch window
in the next video we're going to be
covering the sketch interface which is
what you see here now there's various
aspects to this interface that are all
important however it's really nice and
easy and once you get the hang of where
everything is you'll be cruising and
you'll be able to find stuff very easily
so let's get started fire up the next
video and learn about the sketch
interface if you would like to purchase
this series and see the rest of it we're
going to be doing three full chapters of
sketch tutorials basically taking you
through everything you need to know from
basic examples and sort of foundational
knowledge to actually building real
