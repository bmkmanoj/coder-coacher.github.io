up tuts and we're going to
by taking some screenshots here
uploading that and getting the rest of
our play stuff going so how do we take
screenshots well it's a good question
in fact eclipse makes it easy for you so
let's go back to eclipse we have our our
virtual device running right in here you
see and what we can do
back in Eclipse here and let's go to up
at the top here we need to say window
and then show view and then we want to
look for Android devices so let's go to
other and come down and we're looking
for devices so devices here we go it
opens up this new tab and this basically
shows any devices that were running we
had a phone plugged in or something you
would show that to so we can have this
here and I can actually look at this and
when I click on this you'll see there's
a little camera right here if we click
screen capture prying a screen capture
and it makes this nice big image for us
so let's save this okay we'll just put
it in the same folder and now let's
actually come back to our app here so
now it's a little bit different of
shocks notices not quite guess again so
this is of course you're going to want
to have nice varying shots of your
application but if you'll notice I
changed what looks like on the screen
now I hit the screenshot button again
it's going to prepare a new screenshot
and it's actually going to be what's
ever on the screen so what's ever on the
screen at the time you click that
screenshot button is going to be what
this creates a screenshot of ok let's
close out of that cool we have our
screenshots let's come back here and
let's upload those so I'm just going to
click this or of course you can drag and
drop as it says drop image here I'm just
going to do it this way cool now we have
our two screenshots and like I said real
lab situation so you're going to want
7-inch tablet 10 inch tablet screenshots
and you could definitely accomplish that
through different emulators or if you
have those devices and developer mode
you can take screenshots with that as
well so now we need a high res icon
which is a 512 by 512
we're and let's check out something
really quick if we come to our project
so if we go to our actual project files
the ones created in Eclipse you'll see
we have these res the icons are all
created for us but there's also this icy
launcher web pink and if you open it up
you can see that it's actually 512 by
512 so they've created this for us to
make this nice and easy and now this one
I am going to just drag and drop this
little Android guide marches around and
we have our icon here cool so we have
this purple and blue eye Android we have
all the stuff and now you can upload
these feature graphics and promo
graphics and all of these things are
going to help your app sell so by all
means do it you can even put a promo
video of this thing working so now we
get to select what kind of application
type it is and now it's an application
the category is going to be I can so you
can say this is educational and the
content rating is for everyone because
there's nothing nothing in it that you
wouldn't want anybody to have and now
the contact deals details of course have
my website and my email address and a
privacy policy and now you can have a
privacy policy in fact you probably
should if you're having with user
information stuff but um because this is
just simple simple simple I'm just going
to check this not submitting a privacy
policy I'm going to click this big Save
button right here applications been
saved and now you'll see we have another
green check box so you know apk is good
our store listings good now we just have
this pricing and distribution the app is
going to be free we want to distribute
in all countries so we check this check
box so if you want to limit countries
you can check them whichever ones you
want you want it to be paid you know we
can certainly have it be paid but you
have to set up a merchant account so you
have to click on this merchant account
and for our next level up touch set that
we're publishing maybe we can do a paid
one so we can see that and now that's
pretty much it so you can actually even
restrict distribution here and only
users of
I Google Apps domain name can get this
it's okay I don't I don't need anything
like that I'm not going to opt-in for
any sort of education stuff because the
app itself is an educational but the
process of the app is educational and
this is an opt-out for do not promote my
application except in Google Play I mean
I don't really care they can promote it
wherever they like content guidelines
this application meets androids content
guidelines and it does so I'm checking
this checkbox and I'm checking this US
export laws and I'm going to save this
now we should be all good for this app
to go ready to primetime so what happens
now every we all these check boxes
everything's good we don't have any
in-app products we don't have any API s
or anything like that
let's go to draft and why can't I
publish and we can't publish because my
registration is not complete so in 24
hours I'm going to complete my
registration and then I'm going to
publish this app by clicking here and
publishing this app so when that's done
I'm going to make it update post the
link and you should all see this app in
action so as always if you have any
questions or comments please leave a
comment on our video or hit us up at
Twitter at LevelUp tuts
let us know what you're thinking we
always love to hear from you this is
Scott with little Hut's and thanks for
watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
