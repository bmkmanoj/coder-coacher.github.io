up tutorials and in this video we're
going to show you the how and why we're
moving your CSS out of your HTML and
into its own CSS file that you can
reference via a link in your HTML so
let's check that out right now so in the
last video we got our first taste of CSS
Wilbury
change the color of our h1 tag and we
made it into this eventual purple color
that we had here and you can see it
right here now in this video we're going
to talk a little bit more about CSS and
we're going to talk about HTML in
general now we saw how easy it was to
simply add this style tag to the top of
our page here well let's say we have
another page right let's say we make an
about Us page so let's go ahead and
let's click a new file up on our folder
and save this as about dot HTML now
let's go ahead and copy the contents of
index.html into about HTML and the only
difference will be we'll change the
header to say about me okay now when we
come to this page you can refresh and
let's actually edit the path here did
you say about dot HTML and you can see
it says about me now the only difference
being that it says about me rather than
our first website so that's great it
follows the same convention we started
before where we had the purple text we
had the body text and it matches it
looks the same right so they look very
similar but let's say we've decided we
hate this color of purple it's no longer
what we want to use we don't like it and
we want to go with a dark grey well we
can come to our code here and let's go
ahead and modify this CSS here and we
can type 3 3 3 3 3 3 so we have six
threes here which is going to be a dark
grey and we can refresh and one the
about me page we can refresh and now you
can see the color grey is there well the
big problem here is now if we come back
to our first website the color is still
purple so then we have to
to index.html and we have to change this
to three three three three three three
okay and now we're refreshing they're
both gray so this illustrates the main
problem with having your styles in each
individual page the problem is we now
had to type the exact same thing twice
just to get it to work now one of the
most cited properties of using a CSS or
HTML in general and coding is don't
repeat yourself now there's usually
tools to help you not repeat yourself
and we certainly don't want to have to
write all of our Styles on every single
page and copy and paste anytime anything
has changed so to do this we can
actually move our CSS into a separate
file a CSS file so let's go ahead and
right click on our first site folder
once more and click select new file now
when we save this file we can save it as
Styles dot CSS okay now this is going to
be a CSS file now let's go ahead and cut
this h1 color completely out of here and
delete this style tag I'm going to do
that from both the about Us page and the
index page okay you can confirm that by
refreshing your page and our title
should once again be black now if we
head to styles.css we can paste in the
h1 like so and we want this to be this
color here but let's say we want this to
be a bit more bold let's take it back to
that really ugly green color just so we
can see when it goes in so here we have
the Styles dot CSS file all it has in it
is h1 in the h1 color a set to green now
we can refresh our page and you'll
notice nothing happens now nothing
happens because we're not telling this
HTML file to look into the CSS file at
all it's nowhere being as it told that
there is a CSS file that even exists so
for this to work we want to go ahead and
type in our head we can use the element
the link tag here so we can save link
now remember when we use this char set
equals well that's called an attribute
we had this attribute char set here and
we want to go ahead and have another
attribute which is going to be rel no
rel stands for the relationship it's
going to be a style sheet so that's the
relationship and then we need to tell
the HTML file where to look and we can
do that with an H ref so an HR F stands
for a hypertext reference now we want to
reference the CSS file that we created
we can do so equals and then it quotes
now we can say styles dot CSS now let's
finish off that link tag just by closing
it off there now what's going to happen
is that when the index.html loads it's
going to see this link and it sees that
it's a stylesheet and it knows to look
at styles dot CSS so let's say this
let's come to our page we can refresh
and you can see it's getting that green
color now to get our about me to also
include that green color we can go ahead
and copy this link stylesheet and we can
paste this in here as well so now this
is referencing the same stylesheet and
you can see they're totally in sync just
like so now if we head to our Styles we
can now change this value and we can do
so to make it an ugly red color instead
of an ugly green color so we can change
that and without having to update it
more than one place we now have the red
headline on both pages so this is just
one of the many advantages you'll have
from having a separate CSS file and
allows you to have all of your Styles
completely organized now if you want to
change a content of a particular page
you will come to that pages at HTML so
now if you want to change the way your
site looks you'll know that you can just
come to styles that CSS now I should
have a word about this path here so in
an href this isn't referred to as the
path now because the Styles CSS files in
the exact same folder as index.html
you'll notice that we don't have to
include anything other than the name of
the file however if this was in a
different folder such as a folder named
Styles we could say styles for word
slash and then styles.css now you'll see
a different sort of paths in here so
without anything in front of a title
it's just referring to the current
directory so since we're an index.html
it's referring to this first site
directory here you may see somewhere dot
dot then forward slash and what dot dot
forward slash it means one file
directory back so this is no longer
referring to this first sites folder
however the folder that contains this
first sites folder and if we were to say
forward slash Styles that CSS this is
now referring to the root of the
directory since this site is not being
hosted by a web server if we save this
let's take a look at exactly where it's
looking for this file if we have a
forward slash since I only changed it in
this page you can see it's already not
getting our Styles let's come to the
code here now this is a great way to
troubleshoot if your websites not
getting the style so you're making a
change and it's now working one of the
best things that do is to make sure that
the page is actually getting the
stylesheet
it's the reference is to make sure the
path to the stylesheet is actually
correct you can do that by viewing the
source you can see that the link to the
stylesheet is now a clickable link if we
select this link you can see that let's
open this link in a new tab you can see
it's not found and if you look at the
path that you can see it's looking at
just the root of our file system where
this is looking at users Estlin ski
sites level up tutorials so you can see
that these paths are instantly not the
same so this forward slash is looking at
the absolute route here so if yours
isn't working check to see by
right-clicking on this and selecting
open link in a new tab and then seeing
why this path doesn't match up with the
path that you might expect
so let's come back to our page and let's
go ahead and delete that forward slash
we can come back here refresh once again
we have the red text now let's actually
refresh our source here and let's see
what it looks like when it's actually
correctly linked we can open this link
in a new tab and you can see we can read
our style sheet just like we could in
our text editor so I'm going to close
out that and we've now moved our style
sheets to their own file it's separating
the concerns right
the HTML should not define how your
website looks only the CSS should be
defining the style of your website so
now we have the Styles in the CSS by
moving into a separate folder and we
have the structure and content in our
HTML by having those in their own
folders now you may have a need for more
than one stylesheet however it's most
common to really just have one style
sheet because every single time a
website needs to load another file it
takes some time for the website to find
that file and then to load it so if you
keep having a whole bunch of different
style sheets it's gonna take some
additional time and that's not very good
performance so it's common practice to
really have your CSS be one file now
there's all sorts of other performance
optimizations that you can make that we
can talk in later videos however for now
we are going with our CSS in its own
file as always this is Scott with level
up tutorials if you have any questions
or comments leave becoming the video
artist effect order or face book at
level up tutorials thanks for watching
and we'll see you the next one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
