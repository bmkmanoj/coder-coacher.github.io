up Tut's and today I'm going to be
talking about a CSS property called
display and display is in charge of
basically how elements on your page are
displaying and certain elements by
default have certain display States
compared to other ones okay so what you
need to know is that some items like H
ones or a header tags in general
paragraph tags div tags these are block
these are items that have a display
block by default and what that means is
that display block means it's going to
take up the entire width of something
it's going to take up all the space
unless you say you know it's unless you
say its width is 80% it's going to take
up 100% and it's going to have a
basically line breaks above and below it
basically it's going to if you create a
div anything that goes above it or below
it is going to go on top of or a bottom
of it unless of course you are doing
some other things which we'll go over so
that's why items like h1 if we check out
our page here let's inspect this h1 and
when I hover over it you can see takes
up the entire width except for of course
the margin that we have or the padding
that we had on that div as well as these
paragraphs are taking up the entire
width this UL is taking up the entire
width Sol but that's something a little
bit different we're going to go for that
this by the UL itself has a display of
block but the individual items do not as
of right now we set those to display
inline which is what we're going to go
over next so also this div right here
even though we have a width of 80% if we
were to have another div immediately
underneath it that had a width of only
5% it's not going to fill up into this
space it's going to stay up below it so
demonstrate that let's actually do that
because that div is only taking up 80%
of the space
yeah whatever I'm just giving the site a
class just so we can make it nice and
obvious so it's going to take up a
five-percent width it's going to be have
a background color of red
there's nothing in it we need to give it
a height as well so we'll just have this
be a hundred pixels okay refresh as you
can see you know there's space for it to
go here here even though it's underneath
it because this is a block level item
it's going to be taking up the entire
width well what well you know how do you
get these left column layouts where you
have two columns and stuff
if the layouts are mostly being done and
divs well that's where there are some
other techniques that come into play
we're going to be going over something
called floats very soon and you're going
to be floating divs but for right now
you just have to know that these block
level items take up 100% of the width so
an other type of display is inline and
in line items are like a span tag and
anchor tag you'll notice that we can
wrap this text in an anchor tag here and
even though it's wrapped in the tag it's
still staying within this line so these
inline tags are just going to take up as
much with this necessary they don't
force any line breaks or anything it's
just wrapping around whatever you're
telling it to wrap around here so if you
recall in the tutorial where we made
these items that were in a list we have
them all standing next to each other we
did that by giving the list item a let's
click on this we did this by giving the
list item a display of inline so if we
take this display then line off they're
going to be back to vertical so right
now by default they have a display of
list item which is actually a special
type of display for lists you don't
really need to know too much about
another that's the default for lists but
if you want them to be in a line you
will give them display inline just like
if we wanted these divs to be displayed
inline with each other we could give
these a let's call this a display of
inline and you can see what happens when
we do this see immediately there's a
problem the problem is is that in line
items you can't really
find their hider width because they're
just going to wrap the content it and so
when you start giving uh items like this
with all this content in it that
shouldn't be display:inline you're going
to have some really really interesting
situations so okay so this is why you're
not giving your divs a display:inline
really okay but if you're wondering how
you could you don't have the best
elements of both of those things you
could have things set to be an inline
block will go over inline block a little
bit more but um let's actually give
these a display of inline block right
now and you can see it still kept its
characteristics where it allowed you to
define the width and the height so our
red box is still here where you remember
last time it disappeared because we
can't really just we can't really give
it a width and height so now these
things are right next to each other
because they have certain properties OA
block and certain properties of inline
they are in line so as you can tell it's
left and right margin isn't really doing
anything but it has width and height you
know there's also another type of
display and it's display:none so if we
give this a display:none it's gone not
only is it gone but its display takes up
no space there's another way you could
have something hidden without taking or
with taking up its space if we give this
a visibility hidden and now is no longer
here it's hidden but it's still taking
up its space so these are the display
properties there's lots more to learn
about display but we're going to keep it
at this from right now and you know
we'll eventually get into when you're
going to want to use inline block and
when you're going to want to use a block
that's using floats once we go over what
floating is okay so as always if you
have any questions please leave a
comment the video is up at Twitter this
is Scott with LevelUp tuts and thanks
