up Hut's and today we're gonna be
dominating this shorthand syntax by
showing you how to use it within the
span mixin as well as showing you how to
use the layout function to create a map
out of the shorthand syntax so check it
out we're gonna get into it now what
other things can we do with the
shorthand syntax well let's go ahead and
let's take this off and let's put our
our grid settings back to 80% for our
container and you can actually pass in
grid settings into the span mixin so
let's come in here and we have the span
mixin and you remember we're saying 8
all we have to say here is 8 that's
spanning 8 columns of 12 right because
of our main layout right now is set to
12 so another way we could say this to
add more functionality here as we could
say 8 at 0 of 12 and then we could pass
in some information here right we could
give it grid settings so we could say
now it's going to be of 24 and then
instead of the 1/4 gutters we could make
our gutters way smaller and say
something like 1/8 and so let's save
this and come to our page and what's
crazy here is that this content and the
sidebar content are both on essentially
different grids so this main area is
spanning eight columns of 24 with 1/8
size gutters meanwhile this aside is
spanning 4 at 9 of 12 it would be the
same as typing of 12 here because it's
using our generic settings our default
settings so you can pass in a whole
bunch of stuff here you could even you
know tell this grid to be fluid or
something here basically any of these
extra settings you can pass
- this fan mixin and it should be it
should be good so this is something you
want to play around with there's all
sorts of crazy things you can do here
but really just the shorthand syntax is
just awesome because Susie just gets it
right it you don't really have to give
it a whole bunch of extra stuff like we
had been doing before with the maps now
what happens if you wanted a map to be
created out of this shorthand syntax
well okay if we wanted to make a map of
this shorthand syntax all we have to do
is use this this function right so the
function is named layout but now what
this function is doing it's not going to
actually set the layout it's just going
to define a map so like we create any
variable we would just say dollar sign
map and then semicolon so now what this
line is doing is it's making a Suzy map
out of this shorthand where it's
actually going to create this exact
piece of code here
with the name of map instead of wide
layout so this is just some of the
incredible things that Suzy can
accomplish in the next video we're gonna
be talking about break points and how
you can use those to build responsive
grids with Suzy so as always this is
