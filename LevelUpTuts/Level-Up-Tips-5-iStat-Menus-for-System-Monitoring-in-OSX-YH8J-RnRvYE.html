Tut's and today i'm going to give you
another video lesson tip about
configuring your OS x space now in the
last video we showed you how to make
your menu bar black and you might have
noticed in my menu bar we have these
icons up here that you might have been
looking a little mysterious also my
clock also looks different than your
clock probably looks and that's because
i'm using an app called istat menus now
I paid for this it's sixteen dollars I'm
not affiliated with them I'm not getting
any kickbacks oh no you know don't think
I'm trying to sell you on this but check
it out it's really cheap and you
basically get access to all sorts of
data about your computer right I can see
how all of my CP user and stuff are
doing you can check temperatures
internet connections and stuff like that
so it's a really great app and it's
completely configurable so let me give
you a little tour and show you istat
menus now because we have the dark theme
I'm going to go ahead or the dark menu
bar I'm going to go ahead and change the
drop down theme too dark not only click
on any of these it's going to be dark
and I'll match everything now we also
have the menu theme as purple but I
could change it to a different color
based on whatever your you know whatever
you're feeling like I have my I've had
my net green for a long time even either
way there it just adds some you know
flaherty or to your menu bar okay so we
have this here right but you still can't
read everything well each of these items
here on the left are different icons or
analytics that you can drag up in there
so we have the cpu and GPU and sure i
have my cpu label here and then the
graph but if you click on this you can
actually change it so i can make these
wider if i wanted like a more detailed
information or I can make them narrower
if I want them to take up less space
since
they are you know I have a wide desktop
I can have them take up a lot of space
and you can use custom colors
specifically for this now I could have a
different color here now under memory
you can see of several different ways of
displaying your your memory you can have
all these options and again you can give
this one specific custom colors you can
have completely different breakdowns
showing wired active inactive I like
that sort of thing disks you can have
your hard disks their overall capacity
like we have here and you could drag
your different hard disks in and out of
here and this isn't really I guess a
tutorial on istat menus but I'm just
showing you some of the things you can
do it's not just limited to having these
colors up here now for something like
that work here I can actually change the
color of this text so I want this of
course to be white to make it nice and
obvious and you can even make them
slightly transparent if you'd like there
we go so now those are white and let's
check out the center here doesn't have
any options I guess I would almost
rather have this be some sort of
temperature or something but yeah so I
can I can put my hard drive temperatures
because i'm on a hackintosh i'm not
getting the full amount of sensors that
a normal computer would if you're on a
laptop you could customize these battery
settings pretty significantly and of
course the time you can have the time
here I can change the color make it very
white so now it stands out you can
change the the text size you can do all
sorts of stuff by adding world clocks
you can see i have a new york clock a
london clock that sort of thing and
let's say we can even add something like
tokyo or something because i like to
know what time it is in tokyo at all
times right so now we have this nice
clock here whatever but let's say you
didn't like the order or something right
let's say by default this was over here
okay well what you can do is you can hit
command and click and drag and you can
move these pretty much anywhere except
for this spotlight
and the notification bar will not move
but that works with almost all icons in
your bar here so you can really move all
of these icons except for maybe some of
these I suppose these other these
application ones you can move them all
around right and you know it's pretty
cool so that way you can have them in
any order you want and if you have two
clocks up here or two of any icon after
using istat menus then you can always go
to assistant preferences and then in
whatever section your at right so let's
say date and time usually under one of
these things there is a show date and
time in the menu bar and you can check
or uncheck that um and there's even an
app that you can get called cocktail I
believe that will turn off your
spotlight which I don't I don't even use
spotlight I use Alfred but yeah so this
is istat menus it's pretty cool you can
see this purple theme on this dark
background might be a little bit dark if
you're doing something like fire it's
gonna obviously stand out a little bit
more and because my computer is like not
doing anything right now other than
recording this video my cpu is just
chillin so I don't even have a whole lot
to see but this is istat menus i really
like it i've been using it for a long
time since like older like I version 2
or something and it's known for I
believe so check it out again don't work
for them don't have any kickbacks but
it's just an application I like and if
you like knowing about how your computer
is functioning 16 bucks is not that much
to pay so as always this is Scott would
level of Tut's if you have any questions
or comments about istat menus or
anything leave a comment the video hit
us up at twitter or facebook anywhere
let us know what you think all right in
the next level up tips video i'm going
to be showing you uh oh my z SH and just
zsh in general as an alternative to bash
on your command line so that's really
exciting it works for all sorts of stuff
and it's one of my favorite things to
configure computer so stick around if
you use command line and want a cooler
experience with it so thanks for
watching I'll see in the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
