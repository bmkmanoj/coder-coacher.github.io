up Tut's and today we're gonna continue
our mega series by going over the zones
and regions in omega it's good and this
is gonna actually be really eye-opening
there's a lot of cool stuff in here
however I must point out that it is a
little different than some of the other
themes a lot of there are themes that
have their own way of doing the zones
and regions so it may not be totally
like going into another theme but Omega
zones and regions configuration is
pretty powerful by itself so we're gonna
click appearance like we did last time
we're gonna go into your theme and click
settings and then we're gonna click sone
and region configuration and you'll
notice here that there's some things we
have three sections the sections are
header section content section and
footer section if we inspect our code
here we can look at our HTML you can see
here where all those exactly are okay
here's our header section our section
content and our section footer all the
way down here at the bottom which
there's nothing in it
so if you look at each of these let's
open this div up and you can see we have
zone user wrapper zone branding wrapper
zone menu wrapper and zone header
wrapper okay and then so it looks like
our navigation is within zone menu
wrapper or logo and and brand are within
the branding wrapper and then the user
wrapper goes above everything else okay
so this right here you might expect
these zones to mirror what's going on in
here well you'll see the users own
branding zone menu zone and header zone
cool so just like in content we have
preface content PostScript and then
footer we just have the footer zone and
you'll notice here that we have all
these zones right under here we have
unassigned zones by default there are no
honest I'm zones I'm going to show you
how to add a zone in just a second and
we do have some unassigned regions
however you might not need to use them I
also show you how to add a region
because you may need to add these you
may this may not be enough that may not
be sort of the right
the right thing you might want it to be
a little bit more semantics with what
it's actually going to be but let's say
we don't want this user zone at all
let's turn this thing off so I'm gonna
click configuration under under user
zone and I'm gonna tell it section none
okay save this save configuration and
let's refresh your page here and it's
got the same except for inside of our
header we now just have branding menu
and hit a wrapper so branding menu at
header now are the three things we don't
have anything in header yet and inside
let's check out inside of our zone
branding wrapper is our actual zone
branding so one of the things you're
thinking is we can add new zones we can
add new regions and we can turn them off
and on what about sections can we add or
change sections well the answer is no
they have it set up so that you only
have your header your content your
footer that's how it is if you need to
do things outside of that they actually
have made it really easy to do so
sometimes you might want let's say a
wrapper that extends the entire width of
the page by default every single one of
our zones here has a wrapper so this is
zone branding wrapper and inside of that
is our actual zone branding so that is
controlled by this configuration here if
we were to say configuration provide
full width web wrapper if we were to
turn that off then we wouldn't have that
full width wrapper and if you don't need
it let's say you don't need to style to
the edge of the page for this particular
zone then just check it off that's one
less div you have to have and it's one
of those things where Drupal and Omega
adds a ton of ton of divs for you and I
don't always like that many divs
sometimes you need sometimes you don't
okay and under here under configuration
you also see some other options fourths
zone to always be rendered this is even
if there's nothing in here your zones
going to be rendered whatever styles you
have attached the
zone it's still gonna be there I usually
don't have that checked because I don't
know you know it's right product the
right project might have it you need the
zone to be rendered all the time this I
can't imagine why I would for this and
customized region and positioning it
allows you to manipulate the placing of
the regions in the zone I'm not gonna
worry about that right now
and so here we have what section that's
in it's in our header well since this is
the very top one let's give this a
weight of zero or I mean we don't have
to change it because to right now is the
highest but just to keep track of things
our weight is where it appears in this
list whether it's below or above menu or
header and then the column counts 16 12
24 since our site is by default it's
gonna be 16 or it's gonna be 12 columns
this is gonna be 12 columns and the
primary region you can select a primary
region for this zone if we click here I
know expand our regions you'll see that
it only really has branding we don't
need to set this for this here you can
give additional zone classes and
additional wrapper classes if you'd like
so I would like this full width wrapper
around it I'm not gonna change anything
except for the width and let's go into
our regions and regions we have branding
okay so we want to force this region to
always be rendered is checked by default
and sure I mean this is the branding one
in particular is probably already going
to have stuff in it no matter what
because your branding information but if
you didn't want this to be rendered you
could uncheck this and this again just
like how we chose the section for the
zone this is choosing the zone for the
region okay so this might get a little
confusing there's there's layers and
layers right but your regions are the
most granular thing inside of regions is
where blocks go and insides inside of
zones is where regions go and inside of
sections as where zones go so it allows
you a ton of control over where these
blocks are and this this is our grid
functionality right here for this
particular region if we wanted this
region and
about this in a second here on another
one we can prefix it as many columns as
we like we can have it be as many
columns wide as we'd like we can have it
the suffix P as many columns as we like
and we can have to wait B as high or low
as we want here and this weight is going
to affect the media queries of this site
but we're going to go over that in the
lesson where we talk about media queries
okay so let's check out another one hour
zone which actually a few more regions
inside of it in fact let's go to our
site here and make clothes out of this
if we turn on these debugging blocks
what you're gonna see here is you're
going to see our region's themselves so
this is our region and then like we said
before the branding was taking up 12
columns it was the first one and it was
the only thing in the branding zone so
then we have menu and if you'll notice
here in our header we have a header
first in the header second well those
are a little bit more interesting right
I think this is taking up six columns
each and we can show you how to do that
right now if we come here to our header
zone under Regents head you'll see we
have two Regents now and just like
before we had one with a weight of 1 and
2 so this one's gonna be higher first
first in the line this one's going to be
second and they're both six columns and
since our rapper is 12 columns they're
going to take up the entire space here
so you could say well what happens if we
add a prefix of three columns to this
one well what's going to happen is it's
going to push the other one down in fact
once we refresh this page you'll see in
a sec
okay let's check out our blocks and now
it's all out of whack right our header
first is pushed over by three columns
and it's right here and therefore it
forces our header second down here and
what these really are this is has a
width and it's being floated and this is
just a margin on it so these are just
gonna fill in just like floating
elements like normal so you don't have
to worry about anything out of the
ordinary happening and this is based on
the 960 grid so if you use the 960 grid
it's probably gonna be pretty familiar
to you and also if we wanted to turn any
of these regions off it's just as dead
simple as we showed you before when I
turned off one of the zones in fact
let's turn off this header second region
I'm gonna turn this one off I'm gonna so
I'm gonna set the zone to none and the
header first I'm going to have this
still be six columns but prefaced by six
columns and it's going to pushed over
halfway to the right and the other one
is not even going to appear at all okay
so here's our header first we got
nothing here and if we don't need
anything there and this is great oh I
said I should also point out that real
quick that if you look at this preface
first part of a second and preface third
when we go to less columns when we go to
our one column grid layout for our media
queries they'll mostly go in that same
order 1st 2nd 3rd so that is also their
weight is going to change the order at
which they stack on top of each other
according to your media queries ok
one last thing let's show you how to add
new zones and regions so I'm gonna go to
my code here and okay and if you
remember before we went into the dot
info file and a theme and headed the
script and back when we there you saw
these regions and zones and all this
stuff and you may not known what it was
but now you do and the easiest way to do
this is just to show you here so I'm
going to add a new region and it's just
going to straight up I'm gonna call it
regions and it's venue two and this is a
terrible name for this but it's hard to
think of something on the fly menu too
ok so now we have second rent menu
region
and I'm going to add a new zone and it's
going to be let's have a tagline and
this is going to be the tagline zone so
what you really just have to do is
create a new one in this you're going to
want it to be lowercase characters
underscores no spaces and this is just a
string for what it's going to be called
on the front end and if we save this in
here all we have to do is clear our
cache on our site here configuration.you
10 oh I have it it's a visit huh I'm
gonna clear the cache
and then we're gonna refresh we're going
to come back to our grid here our zone
settings and our new regions will be
there in the unused sets section scroll
down so now we have unassigned regions
here's our menu - and here's our tagline
zone let's add this to the header and
let's give it a big ol wait so it can be
at the bottom and we'll save this and
now let's put our menu - inside of that
zone and we're gonna have it show up so
you can even see the tagline zones
already showing up here menu - we're
gonna put that inside of a tagline it's
going to be ten columns wide for some
reason and they're gonna save this
and let's check out our site when you
refresh we're gonna come to our
debugging blocks we'll click this and
you should see right here we have our
menu - it's taking up ten columns
leaving two blank there at the end and
it's coming in right where it should be
so this is perfect now if you go to your
blocks you can add blocks of content -
menu - or anything you want here any of
these places it's gonna show up exactly
where you'd expect it to okay well this
is how to add new regions and zones this
is how to KITT take complete control of
a rate your contents going and how it's
going to work within Omega as always if
