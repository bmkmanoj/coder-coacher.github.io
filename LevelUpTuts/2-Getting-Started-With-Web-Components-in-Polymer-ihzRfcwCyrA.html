love-love tutorials and today we're to
get started with polymer by adding the
necessary scripts that we have
downloaded into our project in the last
video and we're gonna get going using
our very first custom web component that
comes with polymer so check it out let's
keep going right now so in video number
one we downloaded Bower and we
downloaded polymer with Bower and it's
sitting right here on our set of our
Bower components we have polymer and web
components j/s actually make let's make
this coat a little bit bigger here so we
can see a little bit better what we're
typing okay and what we're gonna be
doing is we're gonna be adding a
component from Google's catalog of
components now we can get there simply
by going to polymers website and then
catalog you'll notice a tremendous
amount of elements here in polymers
catalog they offer iron elements paper
elements Google web components and you
can read a little bit about these
there's all sorts of different
classifications for types of custom
components however we want to be going
to Google web components because the one
we're gonna be grabbing is the google
map so we can just select google map
from this list here and it gives you a
little documentation over here on the
left hand side it gives you a bower
command so this is one of the reasons
why we've been talking about wanting to
use Bower because polymer integrates so
well with Bower here that it just makes
things quite a bit easier so if we copy
this bower install command and come to
our terminal and here I'm just going to
paste this in and then the root of our
project and so I'm going to go ahead and
click enter just copied and pasted
directly and you can see it's going to
grab this component itself now when we
head back to sublime text you'll see we
have some other folders here including
this google api is google map and we've
in addition to our polymer and web
components so the bundled elements that
come with this google map if we open up
this google map folder you'll be able to
see we have google map directions google
map marker Google Maps search dot HTML
and Google -
HTML all these HTML files are different
components since we want to just get
going basically I'm actually going to
delete some of this stuff in our body
here we don't need that we don't need to
reference any these other scripts or
this Google Analytics script right now
in fact there's actually a Google
Analytics web component that we can get
going later so looks like I accidentally
deleted the body let's we add that okay
now instead of our body we want to be
able to add a component that is a Google
- map like so and then it has a closed
bracket but right now if we save this
and head to our browser let's come back
to our project here and refresh you'll
see we have nothing absolutely nothing
well we have to start referencing some
JavaScript files and even an HTML file
to get this working so the first thing
we want to do is go ahead and add the
web components j/s to our project here
so in the head of our project we can
just have a new script tag and it's
going to be type text/javascript however
with html5 you actually don't need the
type here so we'll go ahead and delete
that and let's just go ahead the source
SRC is equal to and now we're going to
browse to the bower components folder to
references files so since we're at the
root of our document here we can simply
just say bower underscore components
forward slash web components we're just
grabbing the file path to this right
here inside of here we're going to be
referencing the web components JS file
dot J s like so now if we come back to
our project here let's refresh I'm gonna
check out the source I'm gonna click on
this link and make sure that it has in
fact found the script correctly that way
we just know that we had no typos there
and that it is in fact loading up this
web components J S which is really what
we need to get polymer going now the
next thing we need to get a custom
element from Google's catalog of
elements in polymer is to
the element itself via the HTML now we
do that with a link tag so we can do
that by typing link and you'll see that
defaults to rel stylesheet we want this
to be import instead of stylesheet and
we want no sort of type here we can just
get rid of that and we want the
reference to be a path to the Google map
dot HTML at this file right here now we
can just go ahead and start this off by
just grabbing this bower components
forward slash because it's located in
the bower components folder and we're
gonna now go to the Google - map which
is the next folder forward slash and
then we're looking for Google - map HTML
so we can just go ahead and paste this
in here dot HTML save this now we should
be free to use our new Google Map
element when our project so when I hit
refresh you'll notice nothing really
happens and it's really not showing up
strictly because it doesn't necessarily
have a height out of the box and we're
not really passing an information if we
come out our inspect element you can see
it is getting some sort of default
latitude and longitude so let's go ahead
and actually come into sublime here and
we're going to come into our main dot
CSS file because that's what's linked
here you can go into any CSS file that
you're using on your project I'm gonna
go ahead and copy this Google map
element before hand and let's come to
main and head to the bottom and let's go
ahead and just reference this as an
element because we can do that
instead of with a class or anything like
that and I'm just going to say height
and we'll just give this a height of 400
pixels for now you could give it a
height of it pretty much anything based
on what you need and we're just gonna
give it a width of
of 100% okay and let's head back to our
HTML and let's pass in some latitude and
longitude to this so one of the best
features about web components besides
bundling up sort of custom functionality
into an element is that they are able to
use attributes now so we have a Google
map element instead of having to drop in
this whole embed code we can now
actually give it
things like latitude like so and simply
by giving it an equals and then a number
value it's actually going to be using
that latitude so let's go ahead and give
it a latitude I just have one set here
and then a longitude is also going to be
needed so we can type longitude is equal
to okay and I have another value now
let's go ahead and refresh our page and
check it out now as you can see we have
a Google map being rendered and let's
get off of this in the inspector so it's
not highlighting it like crazy let's
actually close this inspect and that's
actually not where I wanted it so I just
paste in some latitude and longitude
values that I had actually had some
weird values in there before but now I
have exactly what I want
thirty-nine point seven three and
negative 104 point nine nine three we
come back and refresh you'll see that we
have a Google map and it's pointing to
directly where we want it if you can
come back here and let's modify this to
say like negative 124 and refresh you
can see it puts us in the ocean which
should be off the coast of California
here let me zoom out there we go
Northern California so as you can see we
have complete control over this map in a
way that makes a lot more semantic sense
looking into our HTML just imagine you
are looking at any sort of HTML document
and you see a whole block of embed code
it doesn't look this good this really
tells you exactly what it's doing and
that's wonderful so we've now imported
our first element using Google's catalog
from polymer and razing a google map
simply
by adding web components Jas and Bower
underscore components and then the
Google map from within our Bower
components this is all downloaded with
polymer and it was super easy so in the
next video we're gonna take this element
of part and we're gonna check out what's
going on and what it's doing we may not
understand it all until we start to
really build our own elements but it's a
good start to see how we can use custom
elements or our own projects and write
our own so as always this is Scott would
love love tutorials if you have any
questions or comments to become in the
video here - svet - where facebook at
level up tubs we love to hear from you
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
