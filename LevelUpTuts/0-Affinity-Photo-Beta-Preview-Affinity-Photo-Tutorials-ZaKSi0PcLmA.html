of tutorials and today we're going to
show you a new application that I've
been messing around with for a couple of
days now and have been really really
fond of now this is the beta of affinity
photo now affinity photo can be seen as
sort of a Photoshop competitor so it's
directly going after photo shops photo
manipulation features which is what
Photoshop is primarily used for and it's
a really great nice interface now what's
awesome about this application is though
even it's a beta I found it to be
running really smoothly and there's some
really exciting cool things about it so
now this isn't going to be totally
comprehensive because there is going to
be a separate affinity photo series
coming out once the application is
available I'm working on creating that
right now so in the meantime check out
this beta video and get excited for
affinity photo so this is affinity photo
I have booted up the beta of affinity
photo here and what's really great is
the Fantas welcome startup panel you
know that you might be used to with most
of these applications I know sched
Photoshop they all have these startup
panels right what's cool is a you know
like most you can uncheck this to show
its startup but I actually really like
it you can open a new document directly
from here you can close this whatever
but one thing I really really liked
about this beta and I'm not sure if this
will include in the standard version of
affinity photo or not but they have this
sample section right here so what we can
easily do is click samples and what's
cool is that there are three samples
created by Neil lead can who basically
is an experienced commercial designer
you can check out his a behance profile
from this link but he's created these
files and what they are essentially
really nice photo manipulations that are
done in affinity photo and they give you
an opportunity to just sort of explore
how things are done with
the photo so I'm going to go ahead and
select this first one on just really
just a it's a it's a woman here who's
the colors been modified it has a lot of
little elements motion blur some
foreground background stuff okay so as
you can see here is our document now
it's great about this application is it
shouldn't feel too unordinary to anybody
who's used to working in photoshop all
your stuff is right pretty much where
you'd expect it you have your standard
tool options on the left here now
there's a lot of tools and like I said
I'm not going to go over a lot of stuff
in here this isn't necessarily a
tutorial it's more of a preview of this
application but as you can see the stuff
that you're used to being here is here
you know our our flood tool our
paintbrush our eraser dodge and as you
can see you can get more options just by
clicking and holding which should be
something that you're totally used to I
think that might be my favorite part
about affinity photo is how right at
home it feels for those who are used to
working a lot in Photoshop things just
feel comfortable and sort of where they
should be i'm also really impressed with
how this runs it opens quickly every
sort of process I've done has been just
really smooth and quick and although i'm
on a pretty nice system here i just
haven't had any sort of noticeable
slowness or anything like that it's just
been a really nice experience now
another thing that's really great about
this application that's even better than
a sketch app which is something i've
been using a lot for as an illustrator
replacement so it was a photoshop
replacement this does a much better job
of actually being a replacement because
it can open PSD's now to illustrate that
I'm actually going to drop in this old
PSD I have essentially I turned a crew
member of mine into a Santa Claus here
by hastily using a brush tool and
drawing over and so obviously not photo
manipulation of the year I did all the
painting in one layer but as you can
the layers which are over here under the
layers tab they came in just as they
were in Photoshop we can you know
obviously deselect this layer here which
is all of our paintbrush so as you can
see it handles a PSD's just fine okay
I'm not going to save this and let's go
and check out this one of my favorite
things about this application is just
how they focused on things that make
your life sort of easier for instance
let's say we want to see this rose petal
we can double-click the thumbnail here
and it zooms us directly to that
particular rose petal likewise we can
select any of these little thumbnails
and it's going to take the viewport and
fit it to the size of the thing that
exactly we're trying to see now another
little thing I like is that in the
blending modes which are what you would
expect right we actually have a really
neat thing here which might not seem
like a big deal but I've already found
myself really really liking it when you
hover over the blending mode you're
getting a preview of what it's actually
going to look like so no more
essentially checking through blending
modes to sort of find the exact fit
you're looking for I know a lot of times
you know exactly what you want for
blending modes but sometimes it's really
nice to see this this preview and just
sort of get an idea of maybe what the
difference might be it's also a nice
tool for educating the difference
between these blending modes right as
you can see some of them are just a
little bit different so obviously darken
and darker color just have a little bit
different and so going between these two
it could be really super nice to have
that to have that preview there other
than that layers are something what you
like what you'd expect in Photoshop we
again have essentially folders of layers
that can which are essentially groups
right where you can have layers within
layers you can have blending modes masks
that kind of stuff all sorts of don
destructive editing stuff and you can
see there's a layout
tab so once we have something like this
selected let's say if we want to do have
for some reason bezel and emboss right
obviously you wouldn't want to do that
but if we want to throw a bezel and
emboss on here we could have this and
emboss this photo but as you can see
it's affecting the current layer so like
I said this isn't a in-depth on affinity
photo but it should give you a nice idea
of just how capable it is there's a lot
of really nice features in here the
interface is great everything feels
snappy and even for our beta I haven't
found a whole lot of issues that I've
had with this you can even browse stock
photo sites directly from the app using
this beta gets me really excited for the
full version that's going to be released
if you check out their website which
I'll put a link in the description you
can actually apply it for the beta
yourself so you can watch some videos on
just how cool affinity photo is and what
some of the more important features are
here now I haven't seen if there's any
pricing information yet however there
are other application affinity designer
which is a vector art application that's
also very nice is selling for 49 US
dollars so i can't imagine this
application is going to totally break
your bank like a lot of both like a lot
of Adobe products well you're not paying
for a subscription or anything so
honestly I can't wait for this
application to be released I'm going to
be a day one purchaser and as long as
things keep going the way they're going
with it I have to feel like I'm going to
be making a full time switch to affinity
photo now obviously it isn't part of my
daily workflow yet so I don't know if
that is going to be the case but I'm
really liking it and I already find
myself wanting to use it all the time so
check out affinity photo like I said I'm
going to post a link to this page where
you can sign up for the beta hopefully
you can get onto this beta so check it
out I can't wait to do a series on
affinity photo as always this is scott
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments if I come in the
video or it is up at Twitter or Facebook
ad level of tutorials we love to hear
from you thanks for watching and we'll
see you the next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
