in working and react native is an
understanding of how you work with
styling your components please after all
styling your entire application is what
gives it any sort of personality so one
thing we want to touch on is basically
the use of styles now how we do this in
react native is through two things we
have style sheet which we're importing
from react native and you can see we're
using the style sheet create to create a
style object for us and then we have
these style equals on the view tech here
where we have styles container now if
you've ever worked with CSS some of
these properties are familiar but
different for instance instead of
background - color we have background
camelcase color and align items and
justify content along with Flex so as
you see it's sort of a bizarro world CSS
where the answers are all strings right
we have to wrap them in single quotes
unless it's a number and the properties
are all in camel case rather than kabob
case or hyphenated case whatever you
want to call it now another thing that's
different is that certain properties
cannot be assigned to certain things so
let's head into our hello Jas and add
some styles to our text so the first
thing we wanted to do was import a style
sheet so just like we imported view in
text we can import style sheet now we
can create a new Const or constant
variable name styles in Styles can be
equal to a style sheet dot create okay
this is a method that takes an object
inside of this object we'll need a
property name so our property name can
be hello this hello text and inside of
here
hello is just simply an object so first
off let's give this a property can to
confirm it's working we can say the
color
is and I love these awful basic blue and
green and stuff like that so we can say
zero zero f F zero zero and now we can
give this text a style is equal to now
this is inside of curly brackets this is
going to simply just be the Styles
constant variable dot hello
so it's grabbing styles dot hello which
will assign a color to the text let's
head back here to our application and
you can see we have this gnarly ugly
green color which is one of my favorites
obviously not to use button demos
they're great because they stand out now
let's talk about a text property that
would normally work in CSS such as well
maybe when it is sensitive to be a color
of this ugly green we can have this be a
back ground color if we save this head
to our app you can see it works and
that's awesome right
actually these styles here are going to
work just like you would expect in fact
if we were to add something like font
size which is going to accept a number
we can give this something like 24 see
how that looks
and you'll notice when I tap back I'm
getting this bright red ugly screen
obviously I forgot a comma here so this
is to give you an idea what kind of
error logging you're going to get yelled
at here in addition I also have my text
editors also telling me I missed that
comma okay forgot comma we should be
back and as you can see hello from hello
Jas is nice and big okay let's try this
another way we're going to cut out this
font size from styles in our hello now
let's head to app now an app I'm going
to throw on font size 24 to the
container and here we're getting
something kind of interesting we're
getting a yellow warning saying hey in
view you gave this a font
now in CSS this works right you give
font sizes to containers all the time or
at least you are able to in this pretty
much any of the font properties such as
font family font size font style font
weight line height text align that sort
of stuff is not going to work on a view
doesn't going to work on a text tag like
this okay so let's go ahead and just
remove that font size from this get rid
of that error and we can throw it back
on to our hello J s so what kind of
properties do we have access to well if
you head to Facebook github do forward
slash react native we're going to head
to the docs here and all this font size
is really small I can bump this up for
you although you probably just want to
pull it up on your own in your own time
inside of the docs here you'll want to
click style and this is going to tell
you all about which styles we have
access to and we'll want to click this
values now in values we can see that we
have access to colors where we can give
name values such as shortened hex hex
values RGB RGB a even 4 character our
GPAs that sort of stuff we have access
to HSL hsla we can even use named colors
basically works very on the the power of
what you'd expect for CSS now if you
want to know exactly which properties
are accepted for which things you'll
have to go to that component
individually this gives you a little bit
of information here but if we scroll
down you can see text component
reference this is going to show you the
text component which is the component
we're using right now and if we were to
scroll down under props it shows you all
of the props or properties that this
component accepts now one of these is in
fact the style property which we have
set right here so by setting the style
property you can see that we have access
to any of these text Styles right
including some Android specific ones
we have include font padding and then we
have some iOS specific ones right each
thing is labeled here because both
platforms are a little bit different now
we also have access to the view style
components which we've seen by adding a
background color now let's head back to
the style page what about the view
component well the view component has
access to basic CSS properties and if
you want to see all of the properties
that are available for anything we just
need to head to layout width flexbox
go all the way to the bottom and click
where it says here the full list of
props with it is that the control layout
is documented here where we have layout
props and then we also have laying out
with Flex box right we can lay out our
application using what is essentially
flex box now this can get really
confusing if you don't understand one
flex box or two don't understand how it
works in this sort of different version
of flex box it's not super different but
there are some things so we're going to
be covering flex box specifically in an
entire video of its own we're going to
be doing some various different layouts
to try to to show you a little bit about
how that works right because you want to
have a firm understanding so Styles as
you can see function very much like CSS
camelcase
and obviously we have some separate
properties for text and then when we get
into layout you're going to see quite a
bit of different stuff when we dive into
flex box so start experimenting around
try out some of these properties and
even you can start experimenting with
layout in the next video we're going to
cover layouts in react native using
flexbox as always this is Scott would
love love tutorials if you have any
questions or comments in the comment the
video at me up at Twitter or Facebook at
level up tutorials I'd love to hear from
you also if you would like to purchase
this series head over to store dot level
of tutorials com we're going to be
teaching you how to build a full real
react native app it's going to be a
native application so check it out store
level up tutorials calm thank you so
much and I'll see you in the next one
