of Tut's and we're going to have a
really quick one today and I promise
we're in more videos this week but this
is just going to be one quick one today
and then the last Android video we got
this app all set up in our developers
council and if you'll notice our account
has now been approved and we have our
app here if we have more applications
that I'll be listed here with there of
course the information installs average
rating crashes price that sort of stuff
so we have this app name it says ready
to publish let's click this and now when
our app details like you saw before now
if we come to the top right here that's
ready to publish all we have to do is
click publish this app which I'm going
to do right now now it says your
application has been published it can
take several hours until it's available
throughout Google Play so that means in
a couple hours
or several hours or whatever you'll be
able to actually go and download this
app this app is now in the Google Play
Store and if you're charging for it
you'd be able to accept payment but
since we have ads we're be able to start
making some money on those add that ad
revenue that we're getting from people
clicking on ads and seeing ads in our
app itself so awesome we now have an app
in the market and you'll be able to see
this app in the market in the comments
so of course I'm going to link to this
in the in the information for the video
if you have any questions or comments
please hit us up at Twitter LevelUp tuts
like I said this is a really short one
nothing too crazy here we just hit
published in in the next Android videos
we're going to start really getting into
some more complex stuff some MVC pattern
stuff we're going to be using Android
studio we're going to be learning a
whole lot of new things and making some
really cool modern apps so thanks for
watching keep it going
more tuts on the way very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
