and going where we can now have our
individual goals checked what I want to
do is I'm going to write a resolver
that's going to check to see if all of
our sub goals are checked and then cross
out this one now this will be
interesting and we can talk a little bit
of the implications of this all and what
that means of for our API and stuff like
that and whether or not this is maybe
the best way to handle this or not and
the first thing I wanted to actually do
is actually give some more visual
indicator that one of these individual
to do's is done so I want to have a just
a basic strikethrough so let's go ahead
and head to our code here as we do and
inside of our name like this well we can
go ahead and actually wrap this in some
kind of a span span works nicely for the
what we're trying to do here okay and in
the span we're just going to give this a
simple style and we're going to say
style is equal to and then we're going
to have an object and this is simply
going to be text declaration sorry this
needs to be a camel cased property and
we're gonna have text decoration now
text decoration is going to be whether
or not this step perhaps that goal is
completed now I'm tired of writing this
stuff props goal so what I want to come
in here and do is actually say Const
goal is equal to the stop props okay now
we can get rid of some of this
extraneous the stop props dot whatever
okay and now in here I can just do goal
doc completed so the value of text
decoration is if goal dot completed as
equal to true then we're going to set
this to line through okay otherwise
we're going to set this to none just
like this so hopefully what's gonna
happen here is that if our goal is
completed we're gonna strike through
with our text decoration beauty okay
nice this is exactly what I'm looking
for obviously like I said we could get
fancy with this and you could do with
animated
slashing through these or something
definitely something a little bit more
fancy than a generic align through but
whatever it is like I said that's not
really the point of this course now what
I want to do is I actually next thing I
want to do is focus on this main
resolution for instance if all of our
resolutions or all of our goals for an
individual resolution are complete then
the main resolution should be noted as
complete as well and then if we add a
new goal in there it will be then set as
uncomplete or incomplete I suppose
another thing uncomplete is a word so
let's talk a little bit about how we can
get this done really what we want is a
property on our schema which is if this
resolution is completed so let's head to
our resolutions schema first and
foremost and we're going to have a new
property on here which is just completed
and this is going to be a boolean okay
and that's pretty much all we need to
have from our schema again because of
this bug in the system here in our
register API file I'm gonna make in
addition to this comment this is the
dumbest thing in the world hopefully
this gets resolved soon but as you can
see here again we now have a completed
property on our resolution in our
graphical we can say hey give me the
resolution name and if it's been
completed and we'll be able to see we
have a bunch of big old nulls for
completed now at this point you should
maybe have a little bit of an idea how
you want to accomplish this what we can
do is come into our code and we want to
head to our resolution resolvers so in
our API resolutions we're going to head
to our resolution resolvers and if you
remember we had a custom resolver for
our goals now we obviously don't have a
completed property in our database and
then I'm not necessarily interested in
making one because honestly this is
information that could be stored in the
database but it's going to sort of well
complicate things if you think about it
the only thing that's going to make a
resolution complete or not complete is
whether or not it's individual items are
completed and I don't want to
necessarily have to worry about updating
our
resolution anytime that sort of
individual gold changes right that just
is going to make all of that stuff way
more complicated so why store this in
the database if you can calculate it on
the fly a lot easier with less strife
here so let's go ahead and make our
custom completed resolver by again
heading to our resolvers underneath our
goals resolver underneath our goals
resolver we're just going to have a
completed which is simply just going to
be completed and then we can have a
colon and then we can have a colon and
again have our resolution like this with
an arrow
now instead of here instead of simply
having it just return the results of a
find I'm going to actually set up some
brackets because in the last one we did
is we said hey find me all of the goals
with the resolution ID and this one
we're going to be doing the same thing
check it out we're going to say hey give
me the resolution ID and find me all of
the goals and then give me an array at
this point I can say Const goals Const
goals is equal to goals dot find and
we're going again and give me all of the
goals with the current resolution now
we're not going to be returning
obviously an array of goals we're gonna
be returning a boolean and next we're
going to read turn something since we
are going to have the items in our array
if they are uncomplete we're going to
want to check to see if the goals dot
length is equal to zero or not if the
goals dot length is equal to zero then
we've completed everything and that the
returning result should be equal to true
now golden length is going to be
returning either 0 1 2 whatever so we
won't actually have the opposite of
whatever this is if we throw an
exclamation point on there this is going
to solve this issue for us you could
actually have this be a more blatant
conditional if you want but if this is
equal to 0 as in there's no items that
are not completed then we want this to
be equal to true which is why we have
the exclamation point in there and
likewise if this is equal to one or more
we have the exclamation point this is
going to be equal to false as in the
queer
these are not completed okay so let's
save this let's head to our graphical
and you can see here that we have both
of the children are a equal to true and
therefore the parent is equal to true
and again here we have true true true
but then false and then this one set to
false so in our interface we should be
able to do the exact same thing that we
were doing and we should be able to now
query and ask for the completed on the
resolutions on our fjs if we scroll down
here we've asking for the ID name and
goals we're now going to want to ask for
completed as well we can copy this whole
little bit from goal where we have our
style text decoration thing and again
inside of the the resolution map here we
can have a span okay span span okay
let's have this style property on the
span style now this time instead of text
instead of gold completed we're just
going to have resolution and dot
completed check it out this is gonna be
one of the cooler things about graph QL
here after this redoes you can see do
handstands is strikethrough now if we
uncheck one of these the parent is
immediately unchecked just like that and
likewise if we check this one and see
immediately unchecked now what's cool
here is if we're going to add a new one
this is cool submit we now have the
parent has been unchecked as well so as
you can see here with the resolvers we
have access to do essentially whatever
we want you could come in here you could
make a custom property that is is the
sky blue
right and then inside of our resolver
you could always just return true I mean
it's completely stupid but you could do
it so in this case what we simply did is
defined a custom resolver then we were
able to use the information coming out
of our database to determine whether or
not the value is going to be true this
is just an instance of the database not
having to match the API the API is what
that we want to easily access and what
information we want to be available in
the application the database is what
simply needs to be stored because again
completed does not need to be stored in
the database and it's going to add a lot
of complexity if every single time you
add a new goal or anything like that
that you have to come check the parent
resolution now they're totally unrelated
and we're letting our API do the work of
checking all of our goals for us and
again as you can see the results are
pretty darn slick so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials thank you
so much for watching if you want to help
support the channel hundred level of
tutorials com4 slash pro to become a pro
subscriber there's a ton of new series
available right now for pros only such
as redux and react for everyone as well
as level to react native with graph QL
is brand new as of January and this
series is all about graph QL and react
native we build a journaling app it has
authenticated in it it has native styles
it's excellent excellent stuff and
there's even gonna be a new pro series
coming in February that I'm really
excited about that I will reveal more
soon but hint hint hint it is going to
be using graph QL in some sort of
capacity so as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
