up tutorials and in this video we're
going to show you how you can start
taking custom properties into your
polymer custom elements so we're going
to make it so you can pass a value into
your element and have that interact with
the data inside of your element now this
example is going to be super basic but
it should give you an idea about how to
get started using data to come in from
custom properties so let's get started
right now the first thing we're going to
do is a really super simple property
that just allows us to add some text
essentially instead of hello world we're
going to be taking the property into our
element and we're just going to be out
putting it directly so to get started
the first thing we really need to do is
we need to add a property to our polymer
object here and we can do that simply by
saying comma after our is and we can add
another key here which is properties
like so and this is where you're going
to put all of your properties now
properties can be all sorts of things
they can be strings numbers they can be
objects they can even be bullion's and
we'll be getting into a lot of the cool
stuff that you can do with declared
properties in later videos but for the
most very most basics we're going to
start with something like in our hello
world is not going to be just outputting
a name so we can have a property be
something like first name and notice how
this is in camel case now what comes
next tier is what type of property it is
now this is going to be a string okay
now we have access now to be able to use
first name in our element itself in our
index HTML we can do so by simply typing
first and then notice hyphen name now
because we did it camel case here we
have to do it this kebab or dash case
however you like to refer to this now we
can go ahead and add my first name so
first name is equal to Scott
now if you head to our browser and
refresh you're going to see nothing
really happens yet in fact actually
let's get rid of the second hello world
it's just going to make things confusing
okay so that's gone so let's go ahead
and let's use this data just in the
element here and so we can do that
simply by saying bracket bracket and now
we can type first name in camel case
like so so now let's come back to our
page and here we have our name cool so
let's go ahead and add another property
this is going to be last name I'm
actually going to wrap this in another
tag here we're just going to do an h2
and it's going to be bracket bracket
like so and we can have last name ok now
let's use this last name again by adding
it to our properties we can do the same
thing we could say it's a string okay
like so and we can come to our HTML and
we can say last hyphen name okay let me
add my last name you spell it correctly
okay so we now can refresh our page and
we see my first name and we see my last
name now something that's interesting
here I'm not quite sure exactly what's
going on if this is I couldn't find a
definitive yes or no and then the
documentation here if anybody could find
exactly where in the documentation if
it's as a can or can't do this let me
know notice how when i take this h2 the
last name out of here i put first name
and last name in both inside of the h1
here notice how when i refresh
absolutely nothing works I have no idea
if this is a bug necessarily like i said
i revered into the doc is quite a bit
and couldn't find anything that
necessarily said this in plain english
but if anybody did see that and i'm just
miss reading it please let me know a way
you can get around this is simply by
wrapping something in let's say a span
so we can over at this in the span
like so now in refresh you'll see that
talansky is output and we would have to
of course I'll put my last name inside
or my first name inside of a span as
well I don't like this this isn't my
favorite thing in the world however this
is this is how it works now a way around
this that I do know is to use something
called a computed property so we have
these declared properties we have this
property here first name last name now
we want to use a property that's
actually using some sort of data it's
being computed when this elements
created so we can say comma and let's
add a new property so this will be full
name like so now we can do colon again
and this time it's going to be an object
instead of just saying string here and
now you'll notice that we can declare
some things inside of this so any of
these other ones first name last name
these could be written like this also if
you want to give it more options so for
this particular one we're going to say
it's a type of string okay and we're
going to say it's computed now computer
computed and we're going to have a colon
here now what we can do is pass in a
function here now this function is going
to be in quotes so let's just say
compute full name and it's going to take
first name and it's going to take last
name like so okay now we have that let's
come to outside of our properties and
we'll need to put a comma here because
we need to add a whole new key to this
object and we can actually have this
function in here so we can say compute
full name and it's going to be colon and
now we're going to have a function now
we're going to be able to pass in the
first name comma last name
and let's close this off with curly
brackets here and we can simply just say
return and then we'll just output first
name plus some blank space here and then
plus last name like so so now what's
cool is that we can actually use this
full name property up here instead of
these first names and last names i'm
going to go ahead and just do this get
rid of these spans we don't want them
anymore see you later and clean this up
a little bit okay so we now have a full
name inside of these h ones we can
refresh and here we have my full name
now there's all sorts of types that
things can be inside of this property's
object right so we have type what you
saw we have this a 2 string which also
can be set to like I said boolean it can
be set to add a number string array
object well we also have things like
value which can be given the default
value for instance let's go ahead and
get rid of last name here I'm going to
put a curly bracket and let's go ahead
and say type type is equal to string
again and now value is going to be equal
to a string which is just going to be my
last name okay and let's go ahead and
remove last name from the hello world
declaration here in our index now let's
come back to our HTML and refresh our
page and you'll see it's still getting
to linskey here even though i'm not
defining it in this hello world is
grabbing that simply from the default
value however if we come back and let's
just change this zelanski now okay
refresh you can see it's being
overridden so that's just a default
value now there's all sorts of other
stuff there's like read-only notify
there's observer there's reflect to
attribute now these are things we're
going to be going over and further
once we get started making some more
complex objects but if you remember we
checked out the google map object here
and there should be a nice one to check
out because there's quite a bit going on
here and if we scroll down you can start
to see some of these things we have a
properties where we have api key client
ID so then we have things like latitude
where it's a type where it has a default
value has this notified property and
this reflect to attribute property so
there's a lot being used in these
elements that are pre created for you
and it's going to be nice to have these
to follow along as we're learning this
stuff on our own so cool we now have
started using our first properties in
our own custom element there's lots to
do here and properties are going to make
your elements truly dynamic and flexible
