up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
the box model for CSS so what the CSS
box model is it's basically saying that
the elements on your page the HTML
elements are essentially in a box right
and this box contains the outermost
layer is the margin and then the border
then you have something called padding
and then your actual content okay so
what we're going to actually tell you to
do first off is how to control the width
and height in this video and then we're
going to go over the other elements that
are the other layers of the CSS box
model okay this is going to get start to
get into positioning elements on the
page which is something is sort of
essential if you're doing CSS so we have
this page that we have here before we're
just have like a purple color and I had
this but we don't really have it
positioned anywhere as you can see it's
sort of in the middle and it fills up
most of the screen and there's a little
bit of a margin up top here but we're
going to go over all of that stuff
creating margins padding borders any of
that stuff and everything you're going
to learn to need to position your
elements on the screen okay so the first
thing we want to show you is a height
and width if you come to your CSS here I
have this div that's the wrapper div and
then I have the body the body has this
background image in color and this
wrapper div has a background of white
but if you notice I'm not actually
telling it anywhere to have any sort of
margins or anything we come back to our
document you can see it's all pushed we
have all this margin or what it is it's
actually a browser default style if we
right-click on this I'm going to inspect
element if you're using Chrome it's
inspect element I believe Firefox is
also inspect element now Safari you
might want to be on one of those if
you're doing some of this testing out
these tools are really nice and handy to
have and as you can see here I can go
through the site here the code and it
will tell me the CSS on the right-hand
side so by default here I'm hovering
over a paragraph tag by default for it
to look normal the browser automatically
renders it with have
a 1m margin before and after and a
display of block so this is how it
default the browser default for
paragraph tags you ELLs H ones all this
stuff and you can see this h1 this will
h ones margin that's up top here is
actually what's pushing this whole page
down but what's pushing it to the side
if we come in body our body actually has
an a pixel margin all the way around and
this is just browser defaults so these
kind of things will just show up there
on you know they're good to know about
in future lessons we'll go over using
different boiler plates or anything like
that will come with a normalize or a
reset file well those are different
things and we'll go over that a later
date what it does is sort of wipes out
your browser style so you have like a
more blank starting point a normalize is
a little bit different but it's a
similar concept that your browser has
these starting styles so that's actually
where this is coming but we'll say we
want to actually give this div a whip
because right now by default it's going
to take up a hundred percent except for
this a pixel margin that's on the body
by default let's actually give this div
this wrapper div a width and a height
and that's really easy in CSS so what
we're going to do here is we're going to
type with and we're going to give this a
width of 400 pixels and then I might
type height let me get a height of 400
pixels and this is going to make this a
nice square for us so come back to
Chrome refresh and here we have a square
okay and so as you can see it's 400 by
400 pixels it takes up about as much of
the screen as it has to just to fill up
those 400 by two pixels another way you
can define width is a through a
percentage but it's the percentage in
its container okay so as you can see
there's nothing really wrapping around
this div except for the body the body
takes up this much space so if we were
to give this div a width of 80% it's
going to fill up 80% of this space right
here okay so let's come to our our CSS
here and we're going to give this a
width of 80% and you can see exactly
what's going to have that
okay so there it is we have 80% width
you know the great thing about
percentage base widths is that when you
move the browser window the percentage
since it's always a percentage and not a
pixel amount the content is going to
adjust so this is going to become really
important once we get into some
responsive web design topics like media
queries and mobile first and all sorts
of great layout things where your
content adjusts to the device or the
screen size that it's being viewed on
that way everybody gets a good looking
website no matter you know who's viewing
and on what device if it's an iPad or
you know a nexus or whatever okay so
that's how you define height and width
and in the next couple of lessons we're
going to go over margin and then border
and then padding and then by the end of
that you'll have a firm grasp on what
you can do with the CSS box and how you
can control your your divs or anything
right as always if you have any
questions or comments please leave
please liba come in the video hit us up
at twitter LevelUp tuck so let's know
what you're thinking once again this is
