of Tut's and today we're going to be
talking about textiles now textiles are
a great way to reuse your Styles they've
credit for your text across your
document and your canvas your project
whatever basically it you no longer have
to reset your type reset your typeface
your size your everything you can just
save that as a textile sort of like
almost like CSS or something like that
and then apply it to as much or as
little text in your project as you'd
like so to get started I'm going to
first create some new text with the text
tool here and I'm just going to click
and obviously I'm going to type
something because that is required so
we're going to say hello now this is
white for some reason so I'm going to go
ahead and select the color over here to
be black and we now have our hello and
you'll notice this is Roboto regular
let's actually set this to a light
italic like that and we have the size
let's say it's going to be 144 just so
we have a specific number that we can go
ahead and and jump to so now you'll see
here in the right information in our
inspector over here it says no text
style if we click that we can say create
new text style so we'll just call this
heading 1 and now we have our heading 1
textile that's a italicized light Roboto
so now we can create some more text and
we can say this is going to say yo yo I
guess it should say yo whatever either
way you'll notice how it's white it's
Roboto regular you can even see it let's
make this gray at least so you can see
it so now we have this text and we want
it to match this textile all
have to do is select in this drop-down
heading one now you'll notice that it
has the typeface it has the weight it
gets the color and it gets the size so
that's great what else can I get if we
go ahead and let's select hello again
maybe let's give this maybe let's give
this some character spacing here we can
turn out the whole thing right here just
by let's put it to like five now what
you'll notice is that our heading one up
top here is updating live while we're
updating this so if I click out of here
and then click back over to yoyoyo
you'll see that it's also received this
five in the character spacing here and 5
here 5 here and it did it automatically
likewise if you want to see a more
obvious example let's actually click on
the yo-yo and let it this to say 10 and
you would have noticed that the hello is
also changing so how do we get these
things off of a type style well if we
select this yo-yo we wanted to actually
to maintain this type we want to
maintain the typeface the line spacing
whatever but we don't want this to be
heading 1 well you could always create a
new textile with whatever changes you're
going to be making are or you can click
no textile at all now that this is
selected to no textile if we select a
yo-yo and said that the spacing to be 0
once again let's say the color to be red
you'll notice hello doesn't change at
all but any new text that we make with
our heading 1 will still be the same as
hello
now also in this menu here we have the
option to manage text styles so let's
select that and you'll see that we have
heading 1 and that's it from here we can
click it and rename it by double
clicking it or we can hit subtract to
remove it
other things we have any or group
symbols and layer styles but we're going
to talk about those later so we now have
created textiles and let's actually go
ahead and change the font size on this
one and this can be a create new textile
it can be a sub it's just going to be
like a sub header some think that okay
so we've created we've deleted we've
made new and we've edited a type style
so you noticed that when we edited the
type style we didn't have to do anything
for to update and save when you're
modifying a a text style here it's going
to make that modification to the text
style the moment that you're actually
changing your text so awesome we now
have made two textiles and you can see
how powerful they can be so what's
really great is if you're building a
website you're building an app or
whatever you set up your type styles
once at the beginning maybe you make a
kitchen sink or or something like that
what you're used to with web development
and then you reuse those throughout your
document and it's a snap if you want to
change anything you want to see your
entire project in different typefaces
you can easily do that or maybe you just
want to see the heading and all the
headings and different typefaces or
things like that so that's awesome so
embrace text styles and set them up for
your project and you'll be happy you did
because it's going to make managing your
text styles way easier so as always this
