of HUD's and today we're gonna install a
module using Drudge and it's gonna take
no time at all and it's gonna be so easy
and so nice that I can't imagine that
after seeing this you're gonna want to
install a module any other way it's just
awesome so it's really cool and its
really super easy so the module I'm
installing is custom breadcrumbs it's an
advanced bread crumb module and I for
one have been having just terrible luck
with bread crumbs on the new level of
site every single bread crumb module I I
encounter seems to have a fatal flaw
either in a bug or just not doing what I
needed to do so I've been experimenting
a lot with bread crumb modules and
custom bread crumbs is great there's a
lot of things that could be better about
it but it's an advanced bread crumb
module so of course we're gonna want
that on our site here this is our lvl d7
site that we started that's importing
our YouTube videos and stuff and just so
you can see that this magic trick is
real we're gonna go to modules and we're
going to type in bread crumbs and you're
gonna see that I just have this easy
bread crumb module I'm actually gonna
unable it right now and I'm gonna save
this it's the only one I have in here
and I just headed it in there to test
some stuff out but we don't have custom
bread crumbs you can see I'm searching
for word I don't see custom breadcrumbs
custom content okay cool so it doesn't
currently exist so how do we get this in
our site with drush so if we're in our
site's directory we can try a type drush
DL and then space and then the module
name this needs to be its machine name
so if we come back to a Drupal project
you'll see that it's custom underscore
breadcrumbs I'm just gonna copy this
most the time the module is what you'd
expect if it's two words it has an
underscore and it's just the name of it
occasionally there is a couple that
don't follow that convention but for the
most part you can feel pretty confident
andrush DL views or drush DL C tools or
something
KS tools or whatever and to get your
modules this way so we type drush DL
custom breadcrumbs enter so now this is
going to download custom breadcrumbs and
all of the modules that come with it
so of course if we come to our module
site refresh we don't have to do
anything we can just type in custom
breadcrumbs and here they all are and
that's pretty cool but now we still have
to come in here and enable them what oh
you know whatever we don't want to do
that we want to do this all in one fell
swoop we want to first download it and
now we want to enable it so this gives
you a list of all of the modules you can
see which ones you want here psycho type
drush and then we're gonna type eat in
space and then - why so what this is
doing is just saying drush enable these
modules and then once it asks you if you
really want to enable them this - why
just automatically fills in the yes for
you so you don't have to say yes it just
does it for you so we want to pick some
modules out of here there's a whole
bunch of them we don't want all of them
I'm gonna copy and paste and you can do
space just like this so custom
breadcrumbs and then we also want to
have custom breadcrumbs views right here
and custom breadcrumbs API and then
custom breadcrumbs paths and I think
that's good enough you notice I just
have a space between all these and then
I hit enter and it's gonna say do you
really want to continue but because we
had that - why it automatically
completes it and then it gives us the
information we want to here we see lots
of green okay's it says drush
breadcrumbs was enabled successfully it
says what it does and then API was
enabled blah blah blah everything's
enabled and now I'm just gonna type
drush CC all for good measure
clear all the cache come to our site I'm
gonna refresh this
and now let's look at custom and we can
see that the modules that we wanted to
enable custom breadcrumbs custom
breadcrumbs API paths and custom
breadcrumbs are already enabled so
that's pretty awesome that's pretty darn
awesome so let's use another example
let's say you came to your site and
you're used to working on a certain
workflow so you click structure and
you're good look for context and you're
like crap I don't have context installed
yet so without even leaving this page
really quickly we're gonna do this fast
we can come to I term drush DL context
brush and Y context and then context UI
and then enter and then brush cc all
enter and then come back to our page
refresh context is there we can go in
and start adding context in fact I've
had things like this happen where I'm in
a view I'm editing the view and I forgot
I didn't have semantic views install
that install it really quick clear the
cache and then by the time I click the
settings in the view the layout settings
semantic views is already there I don't
have to download anything I didn't have
to go to a Drupal project I didn't have
to move files around in directories it's
that easy
so drush is awesome and there's tons
more awesomeness to go over I'm gonna
talk about drush a little bit more and
then we're gonna get into some Omega 4
stuff so as always this is Scott with
level of tuts
