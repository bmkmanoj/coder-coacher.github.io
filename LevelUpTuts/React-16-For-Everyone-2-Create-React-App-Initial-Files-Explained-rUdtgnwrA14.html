of tutorials and in this video we're
gonna get started using create react app
which is the method that I've chosen to
show react in this series now I've
chosen that because you don't have to
deal with a build process or anything
like that you can simply just get up and
running
writing modern react without having to
think about configuration at all so
let's get started right now and set up
our project now to get started with
react we're going to be using something
called create react app now this is a
tool that Facebook's developed to allow
you to get started really quickly with
react now these videos are going to
assume that you have node j/s installed
on your computer because we're gonna be
using something called NPM which is a
package manager for node to be grabbing
all of our packages installing anything
that we need so if you don't have node
installed head to node J s's website
install node on your platform and you
will have NPM installed so that said
that's pretty much the only thing I'm
assuming that you know about react in
addition there's gonna be a lot of
fundamental JavaScript things that we're
going over here with es6 yes 2017
whatever syntax that is going to allow
us to write some really nice modern
react code so don't worry if you aren't
fully versed in the absolute latest and
greatest in javascript if I use
something that's new or different or
whatever have basically if I use any
sort of JavaScript I'm going to be
explaining why I'm doing it so here we
have just react GS org and this is a
great place to come to learn about react
you can come here and select Docs or
even the tutorial to learn a little bit
about what's going on here and it could
be a nice way to supplement these videos
so what you want to do is head to create
react apps github page now this can be
found on a Facebook incubator at github
com or you can just google create react
app and you will see here that we have
this project just simply create - react
- app now this project is a great way to
get started with react and the best part
is if you no longer need it you can
eject out of it and we're going to be
going over that as well so let's go
ahead and get started with create react
app what we can do is let's scroll down
here and you'll see that we want to
install NPM install - G create react app
now what this is going to do is globally
install create react on our computer
because create react app itself is a
command-line tool that will install
everything and get us all set up so I'm
going to head to my terminal and just
anywhere that you want because this is
installing this globally you can paste
in NPM install - G create react app hit
enter and watch as this installs and if
you are getting a an error when you run
this that says permissions required or
permissions incorrect or something what
you need to do is run sudo before s you
do NPM install - G all that stuff so the
sudo will then ask you for your password
you enter your password and you're good
to go okay so we now have create react
app installed and let's actually create
our app because what we want to do in
this video is really get started
installing our app get going and
actually have something to see so let's
go ahead and head back to the create
react github page where you can see we
have some commands now really the only
command we need to know right now is
this create - react - app and then the
name of whatever your app is going to be
now this app that we're going to be
building is going to be a movie database
like we went over before so I'm going to
call this L um DB for level up movie
database you can obviously give this any
sort of name that you'd like so let's
head to our terminal once more and type
in create react app and then give it a
name which like I mentioned is l um DB
and I can just hit enter
now watch is this gums and downloads
everything including reactor dom any
sort of stuff we're going to need as
well as our packaging system to get this
delivered for development so hang tight
and once this installs and gets
everything ready I will come back and we
will get this app up and running okay as
you can see here it's given us some
instructions it says we suggest you
begin by typing CD l um DB and then NPM
start well in reality what this did here
is if I do an LS to look at my file
structure you can see it created a new
folder which is l um DB so just like the
instructions say let's CD or change
directory into LM DB again I'm going to
run the LS command and you can see what
we have here is a host of package files
public folders node module folder source
folder and a readme now the next thing
it told us it wanted us to do was run
NPM start an NPM start is simply just
going to run a script in our package
JSON file which essentially tells our
react app to start running right so
let's go ahead and do that with NPM
start and watch as this builds and gets
our project up and running and check it
out it says it's compiled successfully
and it lets you know that you can view
this at work 3000 localhost so if we
copy this port it actually opened it up
in the browser for me but if it didn't
for you you'll want to copy this local
path here and let's go ahead and open up
this link in our browser so in a new tab
paste it in and you can see we have a
neat little react app now absolutely
nothing is going on in here yet we
simply just have a header or title some
basic stuff but luckily for us Facebook
has now made it easy to get up and
running to build a react app and that's
something that wasn't possible a few
versions ago so thank you Facebook for
creating create react app definitely a
nice way to get started
now over the course of these videos I'm
going to be using a text editor vs code
it's free it's from Microsoft and it's
my opinion the best text editor around
so if you aren't using vs code feel free
to load this up and any text editor do
you want but if you're wondering and you
want to follow along with my interface
exactly I will be using vs code so while
there's other ways do this it's nice and
easy to simply just find your folder and
then click and drag it on to your visual
studio code to open up a new project
window we close this out and let's
maximize my editor screen now before we
get started here I get a lot of
questions about themes and fonts and
stuff like that so in these videos I'll
be using the level up theme official if
you head to the extensions just type in
level it should be the second one that
shows up or around here basically looks
like this you should see the level up
tuts logo this is if you like this theme
otherwise you can use any color theme
that you'd like in addition I'm also
going to be using
Fira code for my font you can get that
at github calm /t ons ky forward slash
Fira code and this font is super nice
because it provides some ligatures which
are nice ways of combining characters to
make programming a little bit more
readable for instance if we're doing an
arrow function or something like that
it's going to make it look like an
actual arrow I really really enjoy this
this font and we'll be using it
throughout the course of these videos so
two small things there if you see those
in these videos now let's head back to
our application let's close out of this
extension and let's check out our files
if I open up my file structure let me
bump up the font size here and this is
just temporary so we can see what sort
of files exist here and you can see what
we get is first a node modules folder if
you're not familiar with node or node
modules this is basically where all of
our packages are stored so we have
packages like a whole bunch of stuff
here but most importantly the package
that we want is react and all of its
dependent
in addition anything that we install is
going to be living in here now we also
have our public folder which is going to
be basically where anything that we want
to have public maybe images or something
like that although there will be a
different way to import images here but
as you can see we have a favicon and we
have an index.html in a manifest.json
file now next we're going to be heading
into the source folder or the SRC folder
now this folder is where we're going to
be spending most of our time because
this is where your code source is going
to live let me make this a little bit
less giant here on the side and so we
can see we have a pod CSS where it's
just a basic CSS file now it's great
about this is this is going to auto
reload for us so if we make any changes
for this it's going to be automatically
refreshed into our document now I'm not
going to be getting into sass or stylus
or anything like that in this series
however we will be using a react sort of
focused way of doing CSS which is called
styled components where you're actually
building out components that have CSS in
them it's not a requirement if you don't
like it and you hate it you can always
do everything within classes and class
names with AB dot CSS and just ignore
those parts of this video series now in
addition we also have app dot j/s which
is where we're going to be spending most
of our time in these first few videos
this is going to be essentially our
basic react code that gets us up and
running now looking at this if you've
ever used HTML before you could see that
there are some things that well are
going to look very familiar we have a
div we have a header we have an image we
have a paragraph tag and you can even
see this text right here to get started
and if we were go to our site you can
see this text is the exact same text so
this HTML is essentially being generated
by this react code now there's some
differences between what is JSX and HTML
this sort of HTML like syntax and
javascript is actually JSX now what
exactly does that mean
well we'll be getting into that a bit as
we go and talk about building out our
components ok
so next we have our appetite test file
we will not be going into testing in
this video series however it's really
nice that create react app shows you
testing and it shows you an example here
about how to get started with that now
lastly we have another indexed CSS file
and we have an indexed at Jas file
now this index.js file is basically
something that we're not going to touch
it's going to simply just insert our
application into our document I will get
into a little bit more about what's
actually going on here though as we go
next we have a basic logo SVG file we
can edit that and we have register
serviceworkers now this is not something
we need to touch it has to do with
progressive web applications and not
something we're going to be getting into
in this series but if you remember in
index J s we're calling register
serviceworker so it's something that's
turned on by default for us and not
something that we need to touch next
outside of our source folder we have our
git ignore file which is going to tell
git what to ignore we have a package
lock file which we do not need to touch
ever and we have a package dot JSON file
and we have a package JSON file
now this package file is going to
include all of our package dependencies
for our application as well as well when
we ran npm start you can see we have
scripts start and so what npm start does
is it really just runs react scripts
start basically just a nice way to get
started rather than having to have this
proprietary react scripts command ok so
as you can see here this is pretty basic
if you've ever seen a package.json file
before there's nothing crazy here we
only have three packages which is react
scripts react and react dumb all of
which are needed for these examples now
we will be adding packages as we go so
you'll see this dependency list grow if
you've never seen a package JSON file
this is it right we have our name of our
application the version whether it's
private or public we have our
dependencies and we'll have dev
dependencies as sometimes where these
are dependencies that are only used on
the development environment and then we
have our scripts
so what's left well we just have this
read Mead markdown file which is really
the same markdown file that you're going
to see at any create react app that
tells you some very very basic stuff
about crate react app and how you can
get into it now we won't be going over
this readme and for the large part we're
just going to be ignoring it entirely
okay so for the next videos I'm going to
scale down this interface here for vs
code so we don't have a giant interface
and we'll be getting around primarily
through these files so in the next video
we're going to dive into the syntax of a
react component and doing so we're going
to learn how they work and how they
function and how we can build our own so
you'll be writing your very first react
component it's not going to do much but
it will show up and it will work and you
should have a better understanding of
what goes into an actual component and
maybe what it is and how and when you
should use them so thanks so much for
watching as always this is Scott with
level up tutorials if you would like to
get this entire series you can add to
stored-up level of tutorials calm and
become a LevelUp pro or purchase this
out right if subscriptions aren't your
thing you'll get all of the source code
and you'll get all of the videos in HD
so thank you so much for watching and as
always I will see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
