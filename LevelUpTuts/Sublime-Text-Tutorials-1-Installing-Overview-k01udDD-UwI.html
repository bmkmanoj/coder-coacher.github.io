up tuts and today I thought I'd talk a
little bit about sublime text 2 which is
my text editor of choice
currently you know and a lot of people
when they start making websites they'll
start on something like Dreamweaver
maybe move to something like coda which
is more of a text editor but with some
more visual aspects built into it and
then a lot of people have used text mate
which is a pretty bare-bones text editor
with a lot of really great features and
so you may have used any of these
products before but the reason why I
think sublime text 2 is better is
because it's really continuing where
text made sort of left off and if you'd
experienced using text made you would
know how great it is for just being so
bare-bones it's not giving you all this
extra crap you don't need like
Dreamweaver is an extremely bloated
application that really doesn't do a
whole lot extra for you other than just
give you a bunch of features that aren't
really super necessary so if you're one
of those people that's been using
Dreamweaver or you've been using text
mate or code up I would really suggest
checking out sublime text to and seeing
how it can really improve your workflow
so what you're going to do is you're
going to go to sublime text calm and
then it's / - so the second version
sublime text - is the first one that's
available for OSX which is probably why
it's been gaining some ground lately
besides being totally awesome so let's
go here and we're going to click this
and you're going to download it I'm on
OSX if you're on Windows you can
download the windows 64 your LAN Linux
you can download the Linux version it's
really just a great product and what's
awesome about sublime text 2 is that if
you use text mate in the past your text
may bundles are going to work with
sublime text so that's really great news
because you don't want to have to be
going and getting you know all new
bundles or let's say you color schemes
are going to work with sublime text too
so that doesn't need to be a whole lot
of new color schemes created so you know
it's going to give you this and you're
going to drop the app into your
applications okay
and now I have minded my dock here I'm
going to open it up and
and this is what I see so its bare-bones
right and this is what sublime text 2
looks like you're going to type it's
just going to be gray text however let's
say we're working in an HTML document so
let's just save this as a I'm just going
to save this on my desktop if I don't
any have in it I'm going to name this
index.html and you'll notice one thing
instantly besides saving this here you
see your title here down here on the far
bottom right you'll see that it says
HTML so this recognizes that it's an
HTML document and what it's going to do
is it's going to color code your site
you know just as you would want for an
HTML document so this because sort of
color scheming stuff is going to be
recognizing most every single document
format you could be editing in here and
if it doesn't there's a really great way
you can install packages and extensions
into sublime text so for instance if it
doesn't support sass which is something
that I use quite frequently you'd be
able to install that which we'll show
you in the future and then over here if
you click on this you can see we have
not only sass but s CSS you know there's
Ruby on Rails all sorts of stuff here
that I would want to use frequently and
it's going to start detecting those
documents for you when you install those
packages and if you've been following
along in any of my tutorials you should
be used to this interface so what I'm
going to do with this series is I'm
going to tell you why I like using
sublime text - we're going to go over a
lot of its core features in the next
video I'm going to be going over the
interface in more depth and then I'm
going to show you how do you modify
preferences because it's not as a clear
or as clean cut as some of the other
applications you've been using and if
yours looks different than mine here
visually it's probably because I have a
color scheme installed and a theme
installed these are things that we'll be
showing you how to do as well although
so go over things like project
management how you can set up your
project file structure how you can
navigate
between files really quickly we're going
to be going over the package control
which as I mentioned before how you
install packages or extensions into
sublime text - and then once we get
package control installed there's a
thousand different things you can do so
we'll go over changing themes changing
color schemes will be going over
different key commands just time-saving
things will even be going over a SFTP
application for sublime text that builds
an SFTP into sublime text itself and you
may be wondering about the price this
application you can buy it from their
site if we click buy here you can see
it's fifty nine bucks and if it's an
application that you use every day which
I use every day then fifty nine dollars
it's absolutely nothing otherwise it
will allow you to continue using it for
as long as you want just every I don't
know how long it is every like I feel
like fifty saves or every certain amount
of time it will pop up with a nil and
say you haven't purchased it yet
you can just click okay continue using
it without paying but I personally would
recommend you know put in the $59 bill
right now because you're going to get a
lot of use out of this application and
there's just so much you could do with
it okay well this is sublime text - feel
free to play around with it open some of
your HTML files and just see what you
can do it's a pretty basic text editor
however there is things like code
completion and stuff like that you'll
see here and just start typing around
and check it out okay in the next lesson
I'm going to go over a little bit more
about the interface and we'll show you
how to use some cool features in sublime
text too as always if you have any
