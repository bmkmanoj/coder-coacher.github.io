up Tut's and today we're going to be
going over a css3 property called
transition and transition is something
that's really cool it can be used in all
sorts of different ways to create many
different types of effects so before we
get going the transition I'm just going
to tell you that you can use it with any
version of Chrome as long as you have
the WebKit prefix it goes back Firefox
all the way to version 4 with the Moz
prefix and it doesn't work with any
version of ie until 10 which is really
unfortunate and then Safari it goes all
the way back to 3.1 with WebKit the
Opera 10.5 with the O and then pretty
much iOS Android so let's check it out
here and see exactly what we're going to
do with it
what transition does is it allows you to
change properties let's say on a hover
like sort of like you normally would
let's say you know when we hover over
this it adds a an underline to this link
but let's let's do something a little
bit more drastic see this white
background here that has the border
radius on it we're going to add that to
be let's say a different color we're
going to say it's going to turn it's
going to turn to a dark gray well a
lightish gray let's check it out here
and let's go to our CSS and in fact the
color grade that the background is is is
666 so I actually want to have it
disappear well let's have it disappear
to start and then on hover it's going to
show up so let's go to where that border
radius is that we have and it's this Tut
nav list item and instead of the
background that we're giving it I'm
going to give it a background of well
I'm going to give this a background at
666 so now let's come back to our page
you can see there's no background it's
just the same gray it's the same color
so it's matching right so now on hover
we're going to do something different
we're going to do a Tut nav and then the
list item and we're going to hover and
on hover we're going to give it a
background color of white I'm actually
going to just have this be background
color as well and
alright semicolon here so let's check
out this page so now when you hover over
these this white shows up okay well
that's a little drastic it's a little
shocking to see that white come in what
if we want to have this like ramped up
and wants to be a little bit smoother
well we can use CSS transition and to do
that I've grabbed some code from css3
please calm just like we had done before
I'm going to paste it in here it cludes
all the brow of browser prefixes for you
and this is what the transition looks
like for css3 we're saying what we're
going to transition how long it's going
to take and then how the effect should
look so this is what your effect will
look like this is called the timing
function and there's several different
options you can use here you can use
something like linear so that the it
linearly ramps up you can ease it in you
can ease it it you can ease it both ways
I should say you could ease it in ease
it out ease it in and out and what that
does is a slow start and slow end and or
you can have it like a Bezier curve and
we're not going to be going over that
today because it's a little you know a
little more than then this tutorial
needs but we're going to leave this at
ease out just because it looks nice I'm
going to actually ramp this up to be
point two two seconds instead of 0.3
seconds it's just a little bit quicker
and you'll notice this all right
we're only really changing things we're
changing the white color here and that's
all it's going to do but let's say we
had multiple things that we wanted to do
which we'll show you in a second you can
see that you can choose exactly what you
want to change on transition you also
notice that we put this transition Qin's
on the object itself not the hover
stator or the click State or any of that
stuff you can also actually specify a
transition delay too but we're going to
not have a delay so let's save this and
then check out exactly what it did so
refresh here and as you can see it fades
in really nice so let's add something
else let's now change the width as well
so we had
these set to be just whatever 100%
before so what if we give these with of
40 percent on hover we might want to
actually start this out at 100 percent
because it's not specified anywhere here
so I'm going to do this here I'm going
add 100 percent now you can see each one
of these is going to shrink down to a
hundred percent so you'll want to notice
that when you hover over it here it's
freaking out because on the hover state
it's changing the width of this item and
you'll notice that the when the width is
no longer on it's no longer hovering
that it goes back over it and it just
might create some problems so you might
want to keep that in mind with how you
are adjusting your properties that's of
course something to look for if you want
to make sure that your animations are
going to be looking correct well what do
we do if we don't want the color to
animate but we want the width to animate
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
change this and I'm just going to say
width here I'm going to save it and now
let's refresh our page and you'll notice
the hop up the width is changing on
hover but the background color is no
longer fading in so you can set up
different transitions for different
items okay well let's say we want to add
a transition on something else we want
to add a transition as what onto the
color as well but we want it to be
completely different well I've made
another transition here and I'm going to
paste it in just like this and what
you're going to want to do is you're
going to want to stack it here with a
comma so we're having our width is
easing out over a point two seconds and
then we have our background color over
the course of two seconds is linear so
let's save this let's go to our page
here and let's see exactly what that's
doing so you can see now that the color
is fading in literally over the course
of two seconds fading out over the
course of two seconds as well while the
other width is going at the point two
seconds so let's put a delay on one of
these let's put a delay on this width
here in fact I'm just going to put a
two-second delay and let's go back here
refresh and see what's going to happen
weights two seconds and then shrinks one
to shrink one to shrink cool so this is
really interesting result because it's
not going to shrink unless you hold it
for more than two seconds so this is the
delay and use the delay it's really just
adding a second value after the end here
so keep in mind you can use transition
on almost anything you can transition
the position you can trim so if you have
it like a top position set at zero and
then top set at 40 it's going to travel
that distance you can use it on padding
margin border any of the stuff and it's
going to be really cool as long as you
you know don't ruin the usability of
your site and you can keep things really
effective so like one courses maybe
sometimes people put this transition
with a fade to the change of color on
their anchor links sometimes as long as
it's a quick enough fade or as long as
it works with your site in fact I'm
using it quite a bit on my site if we go
to my site here scott Solinsky calm you
can see that I have a transition here on
hover on this main image I have it on
this border too I'm adding padding to a
a border bottom of these anchor links
and that padding is increasing and
decreasing which is how they are
shooting up like this so transition is
something that can be used to add some
really nice effects to your site as
always this is Scott would love love
