up Tut's and today I'm going to be
adding an image to our layout here and
eventually we're going to be controlling
the background color this the text color
this and everything is going to match so
our image is going to be seamlessly
blended into this app so to get started
what we're going to want to do is you're
going to want to have your image in your
resource files so on your right right
hand side here in your res folder we
explained that last time that this is
for your resources and we have these
drawable folders you have your layouts
menu some values folders so these
drawable folders what these are is this
is where you're going to put the things
that are drawn to the screen so it might
make sense to say it that way it might
just make sense to read the word
drawable know that and if you go in here
we already have an image in here and
it's our IC launcher and you might be
wondering why there's these different
folders well you know it different
folders with the same image in them
nonetheless well if I open up my app
right here in finder and our res and we
can check out these different icons you
can see this one's three kilobytes we
can go see the L dpi and it's only two
kilobytes it's a little bit smaller
the mdpi is still two kilobytes but it's
a little bit in between and then the X
dpi which is the largest so what these
are as you maybe have guessed from
looking at their titles is low dpi and
dpi stands for device pixels and so low
dpi medium dpi
high DPI and then X is the higher dpi so
what you can do is you can have an image
that's optimized for all these different
screen sizes so that way when Android is
looking for an image to use and it's
going to only load up the proper sized
image so phones with smaller displays
are going to be loading up a smaller
image and it's not going to have to you
know work as hard to open up that big
image however I don't have a whole bunch
of images
for this and that's really no big
problem because Android will scale it up
for you and it's just an optimization
thing so this image I have I'm going to
drag it into our hdpi folder because
it's actually a rather large image and
I'm going to want to copy this file to
that folder notice if you click this
link - it's going to link it to whatever
directory and in this case I have the
image saved to my desktop and I don't
really want to link it to that so I'm
copying it in here we have our logo
right here nice and easy so how do we
get this into our app well if you come
in here we have our palette our visual
editor of course we'll be showing you
how to do this with XML as well but
you'll see we have form widgets we have
text fields we have layouts a bunch of
good stuff and down here we have images
and media the one we're going to want to
use is an image of view so let's grab
this and we can just drag it and drop it
here I want this centered here and it's
even giving me an option to choose my
resource right off the bat here so to
choose this resource if I click OK and
you'll notice it has our giant a logo up
here and you can click and drag to
reorder it or reposition it so now if we
go to our XML you might notice something
funny
our image view is here it's down here at
our XML file it's below that the text
view and the button but in our actual
app right here it goes image text view
button but this is just the opposite and
you might be wondering where that is
it's because we're using this relative
layout and this is telling this item
here that this is the it's going to be
above the ID text view number one so
regardless if we have it down here or up
here it's going to show up above however
I sort of want this to match the
structure of my actual document so I'm
going to keep this up here and I'm going
to grab this I'm going to throw it down
here it's also telling me that I'm
getting this little this little
exclamation point and it's telling me
that I'm missing a content description
attribute on the image so let's click on
our image here
and we can add this in the XML and just
by doing Android content description and
what we can do is we can reference a
string that we're going to create a
second so if we do add string and then
we just say logo we can say this and as
you can recall it's in our values folder
we're going to go to strings and we're
going to add a new string yes new string
and this one is going to be logo and
left all up tuts logo okay so we just
saved this then we can close our strings
this is getting referenced and our
little squiggly little whip so now if we
click back here we can see our logo
shining bright up top here and we got
some text when we have this button great
well in the next lesson I'm going to
show you how to customize this layout a
little bit more and this way we can have
the colors matching this background so
it's not so you know shocking to go from
this white to purple to white and we'll
be able to also change this text color
so that it stands out on the purple
background okay as always if you have
any questions please leave a comment the

tuts let's note your thinking again this
is Scott and thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
