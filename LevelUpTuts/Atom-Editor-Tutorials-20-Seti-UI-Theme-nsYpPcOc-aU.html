of tutorials and in this video I'm gonna
be showing you the seti hit UI theme now
we showed the material theme now I'm
gonna be showing you set e which is
another popular theme so let's check it
out right now
now throughout these videos so far I've
been using the material theme now the
material theme is a great theme that
many people like to use however another
really popular UI kit and theme is the
seti UI so if we head to atom
preferences and let's come to
install let's look for SETI SETI now
you'll notice since I had my checkbox
set to packages all we have is SETI
icons if we select this you can see that
it's some icons for the SETI UI theme we
actually want to do is an install
instead of with packages check we want
to check themes like you saw in the
installing a theme video so if we look
for SETI you'll see that there's a SETI
- UI that's used two hundred and fifty
five thousand times if we could install
this you will have access to the SETI UI
theme now this is just the UI theme with
the file icons what happens if you want
to use some different things well we
have a beta release if you want to check
out the beta release which you know with
beta releases you might have some bugs
like it says this is a work in progress
if we head back to install you can see
that we have a mono CAI study so it's a
mono chi style of theme for study we can
also install that set a UI read we have
set e UI syntax which is actually syntax
highlighting for Sethi itself so as you
can see there's a bunch of Seti UI stuff
but now that we have just sort of the
basic ones and some extra ones let's go
ahead and set Sethi as our new theme you
know the themes and you can see under UI
theme we have steady
now upon selecting this you'll see a
much different looking application and
let's go ahead and select a new syntax
theme
let's choose City as well
now when we go to any of our files we're
gonna have a completely different
looking at an editor you'll notice the
top bar is different these tabs are
totally different
pretty much everything has changed here
now let's check out what this Ceti red
looks like now this theme is quite a bit
different we have a little bit of
contrast issues going on but overall our
menus and things like that look pretty
nice the tab bar is red our selections
are red so things are just a little bit
different so it's nothing totally crazy
it's just a variation of the seti UI
theme that's very popular
now we also have this mono CAI study for
our text theme so as you can see this is
the standard sort of mono CAI but said
to match the rest of Seti UI now you'll
notice that when we did set this mono
CAI steady we had some maybe weird stuff
going on this contrast isn't quite right
so I believe this mono CAI Ceti is
better working with your standard dark
Ceti instead of the study red that we
had a second ago as you can see this is
looking just fine here and it's a really
nice looking color scheme I always
really liked Timon okay you can see it's
even in our mini map over here correctly
so this is the steady UI for Adam now
doesn't have all of the theme settings
that the material theme had for it
you'll notice there's no settings cog
right here to modify things however it's
a nice looking theme and if it's one
that you're used to with sublime text
you'll be happy to know exists within
Adams ecosystem as well now I've changed
spec 2 material because it's the theme I
prefer to use and is the one that we're
going to be using through the rest of
these videos so as always this is Scott
