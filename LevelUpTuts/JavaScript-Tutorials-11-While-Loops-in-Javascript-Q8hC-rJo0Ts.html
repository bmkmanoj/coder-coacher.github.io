up huts and in this lesson we're going
to go over wild loops in JavaScript and
a while loop is just a different
approach to looping so we're going to be
using this while loop to accomplish the
same exact thing we accomplished
previously with this for loop I'm going
to comment this out and I did that
simply by selecting all of this code and
doing command forward slash and that's
in sublime text as long as you are it
syntax is set to JavaScript it should
handle that no problem otherwise you
could put these two forward slashes
before each line and it will comment it
out and therefore um you know not run
this code like we went over in the
commenting video and so what we're gonna
do to start this while loop is the first
thing we need to do is define I so if
you remember in the for loop we defined
a high within the for loop right here
for the while loop that's not how we do
it we have I and I is equal to 0 and now
we can say while and then in parentheses
and in parentheses we can say the
condition so before the condition was
the second thing passed now the
condition is the only thing passed so
we're gonna say Y while I is less than
my list dot length then do what's in
these brackets now I'm going to warn you
that while loops aren't auto
incrementing like these for loops I mean
I mean the for loops are auto
incrementing as we said I plus plus but
this while loop if we were to simply put
this council login here like this it
would output the very first item in here
from now until infinity because this is
never going to increment so it's
extremely important it's extremely
important that you have some sort of
condition that's going to update the
variable that's checking in some sort of
way so here we need to say I plus plus
and now this after it council logs its
going to increment I now like I said if
we didn't have this it would just loop
on forever and subsequently crash your
browser so don't let it do that
basically working with while loops it's
easy to make a mistake and have the loop
run infinitely and that is just going to
cause a lot of problems for you and make
things no fun so make sure before you
test this code that this condition can
be met somehow I mean it can be that I
will eventually not be less than my
length and and that just is something
that comes with the while loops so now
if we save this will ghost will step
through this so the what the program
does is it hits I and I is equal to zero
okay so now it's saying while I is less
than my Lestat length which it most
certainly is console.log the position in
my my list with the index of zero which
is going to be the first item and then
increment I by one and now it's I less
than my length okay so it's gonna keep
doing that over and over again until I
has reached until I is greater than my
length and now it looks for this in the
browser and you'll see nothing's changed
in fact you may not even know you know
anything ran because it's doing the
exact same thing we're doing here in
fact if we uncomment this code will get
the same thing twice so this is
equivalent to this now another approach
we could use for this condition is we
could check to see if I if my list at
whatever given index actually exists so
if you'll notice I'm gonna do a council
log here I'm gonna comment this for loop
back out I'm going to a council blog and
it's going to say my
and then in the brackets here I'm gonna
give it an index of 10 and they say look
for the which would be the eleventh item
in the array well there's not 11 items
so what do you think is gonna happen
well we run this you'll see it's giving
us this undefined because that that item
does not exist yet it has not been
defined it is undefined now if this
while loop if the condition comes back
as undefined this while loop is going to
stop running so instead of checking to
see if I is less than my list length
here we can actually just say my list
and then I like this because what it's
going to do is it's going to get to the
first item in the list that doesn't
exist so 0 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 so um it's
going to get to the sixth index oh I
mean it's really the 7th index but the
index 6 and it's gonna look it up and
it's gonna come back undefined and
that's gonna cancel this loop so let's
go ahead and get rid of this console.log
right here and just looking at this it
saves you a little bit of typing it's
clean and it looks nice so let's refresh
our page here and we have the same
results so that's awesome and in fact if
we I'm coming up this for loop and we
just copy this line right here this is
my list I write in here just like that
we're refresh it works there too so this
condition basically needs to come back
true for this loop to keep going because
if you remember when we did conditionals
and if statements you were checking to
see if something was true and so here as
long as this is true it's gonna keep
looping as long as this is true it's
gonna keep looping but once this is
equal to something that comes
as a falsie value like undefined it's
going to stop your loop and kick you out
so these are while loops and use them
try them out just make sure that your
condition can of course be met at some
point so that you can exit your loop and
not now have a situation where you're
crashing your browser so try them out
see what you can do as always this is
Scott with a little touch if you have
any questions or comments please leave a

Facebook we're all over the place we
love to hear from you thanks for
