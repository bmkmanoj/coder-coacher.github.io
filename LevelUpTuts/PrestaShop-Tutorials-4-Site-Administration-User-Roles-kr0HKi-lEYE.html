up tuts and in the last video we showed
you what you get when you install
PrestaShop now in this video we're going
to dive into some of the administrative
functions of PrestaShop we're going to
create a new account from maybe an
employee of yours we're going to be able
to set permission so that person can't
do everything we're just going to be
setting up some administrative things so
check it out let's get started now so we
now have a good idea about what
PrestaShop gives you on your
installation now let's get started
actually creating our store now under
the administrative section of our admin
interface right here you'll see several
options we have preferences quick access
employees profiles and permissions menus
and Merchants expertise this is the area
that we're going to be covering in this
video now administration is how you can
administer your site and this is
particularly where you will need to go
if you need to add new employees or
change what they have access to and you
can even change your own preferences so
let's actually first look at preferences
and preferences is just general site
preferences if you are going to want to
check for updates which I would
recommend you're going to leave this as
yes you can also check the cookies IP
address you can leave it as yes set a
lifetime for cookies have some upload
data quotas and stuff like that and you
can also have the help boxes turned off
and on most of these things out of the
box are set up the way you want them to
be notifications however if you need it
to come in here and turn into these
things off it's just under
administration preferences next we have
quick access which is modifying the
links which are in our quick access menu
now at the top of your admin section
here you'll see this drop down quick
access and you can see that these links
here are quickly able to get to from
anywhere in your admin panel so if you
wanted to get it to a new category you
could just go right here instead of
having to go to catalog categories and
then click a new category from there so
if you want to add links to the quick
access or modify or delete them you can
simply delete them by clicking this X
you can add them by clicking at it or
you can add a new one
by this + right here there you can give
it a name and what URL and you can
decide if you wanted to open up in a new
window or not okay next we have
employees these are the people that have
access to the backend of your site
you'll notice that all we have right now
is myself and I'm a super admin the
super admin is automatically given to
the person who creates the site now
let's say we need to add a new employee
we could click add new here so this
person could just be John Smith and they
have a new email address here we can
issue them a temporary password you'll
want to make them aware of this password
and that way they can log in and then
change their own password themselves
next we can even select them to have
their own default page let's say this
person is only going to be creating and
adding products it really doesn't make
sense for them to be directed directly
to the dashboard when they logged in
they can go to default page and then we
could choose the products page and now
that would be after they login it would
take them directly to the products page
now you can even give them a different
theme if you'd like we have several of
these themes where you could actually
check them out on your own at any time
now next you can choose if you want the
admin menu on the top or the left for
them it's probably just best to leave
these as defaults unless you have a
particular way that you like to work and
now you can make sure they're checked
yes to be an active employee and you'll
want to give them a permissions profile
now permissions profile is really just
what access they'll have not every user
on your site will need the same
information in fact you don't want a
normal everyday employee to have access
to be able to delete everything on your
site for instance or you don't want them
to be able to change certain
administrative functions that way you'll
give them a profile that you can create
or is already existing that allows for
them to only have certain access so if
we select permissions profile you can
see what PrestaShop comes with we have a
super admin which is has access to
everything we have logistician trans
you're salesmen and if you want to see
with these different permission profiles
and tail we can go into that next so
let's go ahead and just select salesman
and it clicks save it's letting me know
the password needs to be longer I should
have done that in the first place
okay I'm gonna click Save great so we
now have a new salesman but what if that
salesman do let's come here and we can
see under our profiles is next we can
see that we have our super admin
logistician translator a Salesman
however editing these really just allows
you to change the name in fact if you
add a new one it's not going to do a
whole lot what you want is actually
under permissions so in their
permissions we have our different user
roles right here and we just created a
Salesman so if we check salesman you can
see what they have access to we have
five columns here view add edit delete
and all and you'll notice that they
don't have access to do anything on the
dashboard if we were to check this they
could look at the dashboard you'll
notice they have an update successful
these little notifications pop up if we
just want them to view the dashboard we
could always check this now that they
would have access however for the most
part a Salesman is going to have access
to the catalog where they can look and
edit create delete products categories
they can look at your manufacturers but
they can't delete attributes features or
tags or anything like that
they can also come in here and look at
your orders and invoices that way they
can handle orders when they come in so
the salesman is really the person who's
handling the orders that come in and the
products as well as your customers this
person should be maybe the person who
can run the day-to-day operations of
your store but not access any sort of
administration abilities and maybe not
even see what exactly the global
overview of the store is at the current
moment and scrolling down here you can
see they don't have a lot of permissions
all of these things will be checked for
the super admin however not for any of
these other roles next we have a trans
later they have access to really just a
few things localization settings they
can change some of the CMS things so
that way they can edit pages and then
they can edit product types and they can
view search now if you were to create a
new user type you would have to come in
here and check all of the permissions
that you would want them to have this
allows you full control over who has
what access and you can even take one of
these existing roles and modify it to
your best needs next we have menus and
menus is the administration menu notice
how customizable PrestaShop is if you
don't want the dashboard up top and
maybe you don't want it at all you could
simply click and drag and move it or you
could check and uncheck it if you wanted
it gone
notice how when I checked it it's been
saved and dashboards no longer in our
list because maybe we just don't want it
there or better yet if you wanted to
move it to the bottom you could click
and drag and move it to the bottom if
you wanted to edit this you can also
give it a new name if you'd like let's
go ahead and click cancel and last on
our list is Merchants expertise
merchants expertise is a gamification
feature built into PrestaShop that shows
you things that you've done and it's
giving you badges based on what you've
done so we've gotten a badge for your
employees team account and scroll down
we haven't installed PrestaShop badge we
have first customer registered on your
store badge and these things are really
just to help you guide what you need to
learn about PrestaShop so as you can see
as you progress you get more and more
badges and you can see how far you're
getting about your knowledge in
PrestaShop so it's just a cool little
feature it's nothing crazy or super
necessary however it might give you a
good idea about what things you need to
learn more about within your store ok so
this is the administrative section of
PrestaShop in the next video we're going
to be creating our first product so
check it out thanks for watching we'll
see in the next video button</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
