of Tut's and today we're going to be
talking about alignment and distribution
in sketch three now you might be
familiar with some of these features
from applications like illustrator but
luckily for us sketch makes it nice and
easy to align and evenly distribute your
objects that are maybe related or
unrelated they makes it really nice and
easy to distribute those objects in your
document so that your designs are pixel
perfect so let's get started so here
I've created four equal sized squares
they're all 200 by 200 pixels and
they're sort of in various positions
right well let's say we wanted to make
sure that all of these were in the same
vertical alignment basically we wanted
all of these two have the same tops and
bottoms and aligned with each other
because they're all the same size if
these shapes were different size then
we'd have to choose between top or
bottom but let's just say we want to
have all of these shapes be aligned to
the top or the bottom both because
they're squares how we're going to
accomplish that well by selecting these
shapes we can select them just by
clicking and dragging here or you can
select shift all of your shapes over
here in your layers but what we have up
in the top right here is some alignment
and distribution tools so since we uh
basically these are all the same size
we're just going to click this middle
one which is aligned vertically perfect
so now what that does is it snaps all of
our squares into the same vertical
alignment let's say for some reason we
have shapes that are different size and
you can see I even moved one of these
here now we want all of these to align
at the top it's this link that's
directly next to that called align top
if you hover over your mouse over these
little icons they're nice and small and
if you're used to illustrator these
icons are going to look familiar and
you'll know what
do with them if you're not familiar
basically these icons will make your
life a lot easier and you will basically
the icons make sense the more you look
at them but upon first seeing them you
might not know exactly what they're
doing so to get an idea highlight over
it notice how it says align table we
click that and now they're all aligned
at the top just like wise if we click
align bottom they're all going to be
aligned at the bottom okay well this is
great this is exactly what we wanted
however they're all sort of spaced out
in any sort of random way well actually
let's turn on a web grid for a second
here and we're going to say we know that
this shape wants to be over here and we
know that this shape wants to line up
with this gutter so we have our two ends
in proper place we can turn off this
cutter now let's hide the grid we want
to align these at the tops first and
then we want to distribute them evenly
so how do we do that well if we want to
distribute them horizontally the button
in the far left of your distribute and
alignment tools over here was going to
be distributed horizontally we click
that and amazingly in one second
everything is evenly spaced like I said
if you're familiar with these tools for
illustrator you can breeze through this
video because there's nothing different
really here but a sketch makes these
tools nice and easy for you and if you
haven't used these tools before then
your life just got easier you're not
going to have to zoom in to line things
up to the pixel value of course maybe
you'll want this one to be in line with
the correct spot and this one to be in
line with the correct spot okay so let's
say we want to do the same thing
vertically let's say we want to
distribute these vertically if we click
this distribute vertically button now it
sort of doesn't know what to do in fact
if you keep clicking it it's gonna keep
sort of being weirder so distribute
vertically is really going to work
if your items are in a line vertically
like so we can select them just like we
did and select distribute vertically
likewise we have these same tools where
we can align horizontally and now we
have perfectly in line boxes just like
that and this is really great let's say
maybe this was a side column or
something now we can select all these
grouping together and they're going to
remain together so that's a quick one
today we have many more videos coming up
in this series so keep watching we're
going to go over all the basics we're
going to get into some really cool
advanced stuff we're going to get into
adding plugins we're going to get into
some iOS stuff and UI kids symbols just
keep it going and we're going to cover
everything you need to know about sketch
3 as always this is Scott with love-love
Tut's and thanks for watching
