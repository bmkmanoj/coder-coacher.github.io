up Tut's and today I'm gonna show you
how to easily change your theme with
themer for sublime text 2 and this is
also in sublime text 3 if you're on that
I am actually using sublime text 3
everyday in my daily work and finding it
to be quite great so I certainly
recommend checking that out if you
purchase of line text too so we're going
to go ahead and check out package
manager if you don't have package
manager or package control make sure you
get that we have a tutorial on that it's
really easy so I'm going to do on Mac
I'm going to do command shift P and then
install package now the package I'm
going to look for is themer and its
theme are so we'll not theme our s a th
TM and then R so what this plug-in does
it allows you to easily change your
theme without having to go any config
files it's quite possibly the easiest
way to change and manage your themes so
this is going to install themer themers
installed now we're going to look for a
theme to add on and we're going to go to
package control again and install
packages now the package I want to look
for is going to be called space grey
it's a theme that I've been really
loving lately there's all sorts of other
ones so if we type in theme here you'll
see that a whole bunch of themes come up
I actually use Centurion for a long time
and really liked that one in by all
means Oslo flatland
I've pretty much tried out all these
Nexis so go ahead and now that it's
really easy with themer to change your
theme go nuts download a whole bunch of
them change them all the time it
couldn't be any easier so I'm going to
scroll down I'm going to find this space
grey hyper minimal UI theme I've been
really digging this one lately the the
whole style looks great for it it also
includes some color schemes too which
you get by downloading this package so
this tells you how to activate it but
we're going to use the new method here
so I'm actually going to have this file
open just so we can see this change
now I'm going to do package or I'm going
to do command shift P again now I'm
going to type theme R and we can list
our themes or you can select a random
theme or add favorites or whatever but
I'm going to click list themes now
here's the themes I have here the 80s
variation of this is my preferred one
you can Google theme Space Gray and look
at the github they have screenshots of
it all of these look like if you'd like
or you can just go nuts and try them out
so I hit enter and you'll notice a few
things it looks sort of weird right
that's because when you make a theme
adjustment typically you have to restart
sublime text so I'm going to go ahead
and quit sublime text here now I'm going
to open up sublime text and now we'll
see that my theme is fully in here we
have this really nice hover State we
have some great arrows let's go into one
of these files and check out one of
these color schemes that came with it
also I'm going to open up several
several files here so you can see the
and if we modify a file you get this
nice Oh an X this is really just a great
looking theme so now we can come here to
our preferences and look at the color
schemes space gray let's go 80's dark
and here we have really nice-looking
color scheme with a theme it's all
complete and this couldn't look any
nicer in my opinion this this completely
changes the way sublime text look that's
just awesome so as always this is Scott
with level up tuts
