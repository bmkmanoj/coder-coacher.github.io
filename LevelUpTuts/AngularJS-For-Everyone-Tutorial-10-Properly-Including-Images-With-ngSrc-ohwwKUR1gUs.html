is going to be a quick video on how to
solve a problem using images and angular
now I've grabbed some profile faces from
UI faces it's just a website that allows
you to upload your own face or use faces
that have been approved to be used in UI
mock-ups or even actual websites so
these are the authorized faces I've just
grabbed the first four you might even
recognize some of these people I know I
have but we want to be using these
images for these names so these images
aren't going to line up with who these
people actually are but that's a-ok
so to get started I have up for images
copied and pasted into my clipboard and
I'm going to assign an image to each one
of these people so we have Scott age 29
we have a new property that's just going
to be IMG and this is going to be a
string and I'm just gonna grab the first
one which is actually yeah it's Brad
frost okay so you get their their faces
or you get their name here if you're not
familiar on his work he does excellent
excellent work look him up okay got
another one grab the next one okay so we
have these four names here and that like
I said they don't correlate with all the
names but that doesn't matter now let's
head back to our HTML and let's come to
our list so we had their name and their
age let's go ahead and put their image
in here as well so I'm just gonna make
an image tag and I have my source and
the source is going to be looking for
inside of double brackets item dot IMG
okay and now we can wrap that off just
like so and if you wanted you could have
like an alt tag with their name or
something like that that this is just
fine for right now so seeing this code
we have an image SRC it's grabbing the
item image to grab the string that's the
image path here what would you expect to
happen
well if we come to our page and refresh
me a zoom in a little bit well maybe not
too much but as you can see a refresh
refresh refresh we have faces here it
looks like I get to be bread frost here
so we have uh these four images are
showing up just fine so this may seem
like the totally appropriate way to do
images in fact it works right but let's
actually check something out here I'm
not going to my inspect element and
let's open up our council you can open
this up just by hitting escape and
you'll notice we're getting an error
fail to load image and it's looking for
an image at this URL path slash
percentage 7b percentage 7b item image
percentage seventy so this percentage 7b
is the curly bracket we have two of them
in then item damage so it's happening is
our page is loading and it's saying hey
there's no such thing as this curly
bracket dot image but then once angular
replaces that data with your actual data
then the HTML is correct in the image
loads now obviously we're getting the
images here but I wouldn't feel great
about pushing out anything to have these
kind of errors that's looking for
something and not being able to find
them so how do we go about fixing this
well luckily angular provides a
directive to fix this as quickly as
possible and now this is super easy and
it takes absolutely no thought we don't
have to modify this we still have our
strings here however we're going to be
using ng SRC on an image tag instead of
SRC for the source now what we don't
have to do is we don't have to define
any sort of source now that we have this
ng SRC what this is going to do is it's
going to wait until the JavaScript has
been totally loaded before it actually
looks for any sort of image rather than
looking for the image right away right
when it gets to this image tag okay so
with that small change we can now come
to our page we can refresh and we can
see that we have these images next
names and it's just as fast it looks
just like it did before however we have
no counsel error and we have nothing in
our application that's looking for
something that's not there so you could
pass ng source a string that's coming
from an object you could pass it a
string in an array you can pass anything
as long as it's a string and this will
work correctly okay so this is just one
more template tag that you're going to
be using all the time in your angular
projects because chances are you're
gonna be working with images fairly
frequently because I can't think of a
lot of websites that don't work with
images at all so now that you have that
tool at your fingertips feel free to go
ahead and use ng source anytime they are
using an image there's always this Ascot
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments or they come in
the video here except at Twitter or
Facebook a level up tuts we love to hear
from you thanks for watching and we'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
