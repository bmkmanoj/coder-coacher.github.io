up tuts and today we're going to dive
further into Omega and by getting into
some of the media query aspects of Omega
and what makes it really cool basically
how you can have really nice responsive
layouts without doing a whole ton of
extra custom CSS a lot of it you can
maintain and do directly through the
Omega interface which can of course save
you quite a bit of time so you don't
have to repeat things that you would
code over and over again because they
have this framework built in place for
you that can handle a lot of these more
standard things to do for you and if you
need to do some less standard things
then there are options for that in fact
things that we'll have to go over in
another tutorial because there there's a
lot of different different things
approaches you could take but for this
you can get so much accomplished with
Omega itself so before we had turned on
the grid system we left it as a default
960 instead of being a fluid grid and um
if we scroll down here you can see our
primary layout settings so our primary
layout is the normal layout right now
it's all it could be the narrow could be
the wide could be the fluid if you'd
like if we go to our documents here if
we look at our SAS files you remember
that we created a global SDSS and what
this global CSS file is is basically
this is the narrowest view this is the
mobile view and if you've uh if you
follow the mobile first anything if you
don't I'd highly recommend checking out
a book of parts mobile first by Luke
Wroblewski I'm sorry if I mispronounced
your name but this book is great no
it'll teach you a lot about the great
things of doing mobile layouts and
responsive sites but the way that Omega
has it set up is Omega is mobile first
so your global stylesheet is your mobile
stylesheet if I come in here you can see
the other style sheets that it comes
with we have narrow normal
wide and then default and these are just
getting more and more wide as they go up
so it's narrow normal wide let's go back
here and you'll see that same pattern
represented we'll have our primary
layout is normal so this is what it is
for normal this is like the main desktop
version of your site and the narrow
layout is going to be also the the
narrow layout here gives you direct
access to your media query and it says
the minimum width is 700 pixels and the
minimum device with the 740 pixels
maximum device width is 800 pixels and
orientation landscape this is all your
media query stuff so if you wanted to go
ahead and change this you wanted the
breakpoints to be at different pixel
values then you could go go to town and
change that all up what this is really
gonna do is just these media queries are
saying at what point is it going to use
the narrow layout CSS file and since
we're doing this in SAS I would make a
copy of this as an S CSS just like we
did with global and just like wise
normal layout this is the this is the
layout of the responsive grid our normal
layout and then the wide layout here
looks like it's using the wide light
layout for pixel widths that are larger
than 1220 and like we said you could
change that if you want if you wanted it
to be even less than that before it
switches over your wide or basically you
could have these be whatever you want
it's almost like you're writing the
media queries yourself but you don't
have to because the breakpoints are
already set up here for you but if you
needed to maybe turn off one of these
layouts you didn't want the narrow
layout at all uncheck it you don't have
it anymore so this is really great
because it allows you complete control
over your media queries without having
to go in there and write them yourself
so to demonstrate something real quick
I'm not gonna bother doing a sass file
but narrow since I have some of these
layouts been able I'm just going to show
some of these media queries in action
now would it
so since we have these enabled I'm just
going to show some of these media
queries in actions I'm going to do body
and I'm gonna add this background read
and then copy this normal
and if you remember we had gray being as
our our global which is going to be like
I said our mobile the smallest
stylesheet and okay so we're gonna have
all sorts of different stuff going on
here those are all saved I'm gonna
refresh quote we have yellow sewed on
what we'd expect to see at our next
breakpoint I think it's gonna be blue
okay then we should see red and then
gray
brilliant okay this is just really to
illustrate the fact that you can just
get in here to these CSS files you can
change the values and you can do all the
business you need to do to have your
site looking great on a mobile platform
looking great on the desktop platform
and follow the mobile first philosophy
start at your global stylesheet and then
work out to narrow normal wide or
however many of them you need so that's
how you control the media queries with
your drupal omega site i hope this was
really informative in fact in the next
couple of lessons we're gonna do some
more content we'll put some more things
in and show you exactly how these sites
are collapsing and expanding and you
know the media queries is built in to
Omega is just one of the aspects that
makes this framework really great to
work with as always if you have any
questions leave a comment in the video
hit us up at a level of tuts let us know
what you're thinking you can hit me up
