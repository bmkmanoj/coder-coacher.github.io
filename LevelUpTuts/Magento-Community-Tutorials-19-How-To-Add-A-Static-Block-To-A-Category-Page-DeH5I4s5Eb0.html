up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
something really cool is go ahead you
can use static blocks on category pages
it's really nice and easy it's pretty
cool shouldn't take that long to show
let's go to furniture here like I said
this is the demo storage unit of these
tutorials so here we have some stuff and
we have some grid products but let's say
you want to have a block of something
different maybe like a slideshow or just
some images or text or anything you want
here you could have just that or you
could have this and that or you could
have anything you want so let's go to
the admin section of the site and then
we'll get started okay okay so what
we're going to do first is we're going
to go to our catalog and then our manage
categories if you call this is where you
set up your categories as you see on the
home page we have furniture electronics
apparel tutorials let's click on our
tutorials 1 and let's click over here to
see what that looks like already ok it
looks like we just have this grid of
products so if you'll notice here under
display settings you see display mode
and this is products only so if you
click on this you'll see what some other
display modes are there's aesthetic
block only and static block and products
only so let's click a static block only
and then let's select a test block
because this is when we had made before
and is anchored nope and let's save this
category okay okay now let's refresh our
page and see what we have at the top
here is a recall we only selected the
the block here and all you're getting is
this test test test because that's what
we had made so now if we wanted to have
both of those we could actually say
static block and products ok so if you
want to change what type of products are
there too you can also uncheck this use
config settings and you could have a
particular one for this or you could
change it all in config you could sort
product or the default product listing
sort by price to have the you know the
top ones or the cheapest ones at the top
or name and if you also wanted to
available product
listing sort you wanted to give them
basically the chance to only sort by
certain ones you could do that here or
you could just use all available
attributes so that's pretty cool if we
select this is anchor right here and
then save this and now we'll refresh our
page it'll show all of the products here
that are listed in this category
so if you see they'll say there's two
Magento tutorials and the format so you
can actually have all these other
sorting options here if we check is
anchor know if those are going to go
ahead go away let's just know save it
back and you'll see they're gone so it's
actually nice to have those for your
main categories so that your customers
can sort through your products nice and
easily
but if that's night style if that's not
what you want to do then you know by all
means don't do it okay now this is how
you add a static block to the top of
your products as you can see you can
have or remove these you can do whatever
you want if you want to write this whole
page the content of this stuff had some
or images or text or whatever you can do
that as a static block and then choose
to print that static block right here
okay well this is how you add a static
block on top of your categories once
again this is Scott with level up tuts
if you have any questions or comments
please leave a comment the video hit us
up at Twitter our level of test let us
know what you're thinking alright cool
