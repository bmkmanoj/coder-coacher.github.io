up tutorials and today we're gonna get
going on getting our first angular
animation now what we're going to do
first before we do that is we're going
to update some of our code to version
one point four point zero now angular
changes all the time and sometimes the
changes are breaking sometimes they're
not breaking and usually it won't have a
gigantic impact on your site unless
you're say going from a really old
version to a really new version or
you're jumping from one point something
to two point something which you may
have heard by now two point something is
very different so since we're just going
from one three one five to one four we
shouldn't have to worry about too much
so let's head over to our code and since
we're grabbing all of our scripts from
the CDN already the Ajax Google API is
all we have to do is simply change the
version number to one point four point
zero and then again we want to change
the same version number on angular and
remit and ng animate so one point four
point zero now if we come back to our
page and we're refresh we're gonna see
we're not getting any counsel error so
everything must be fine so until we have
ng animate and angular up to version 1.4
what we're gonna do is now we're gonna
change how we were showing and hiding
this list here we're showing this with a
class of hidden and we're toggling it
and that was really just to show off the
abilities of Mg class well we're gonna
want to do now what we're gonna want to
use is ng if now we can keep this dirt
list toggle however we're gonna get rid
of the exclamation point in front of it
and we're gonna change this to ng if not
ng of ng if now we're gonna be saying if
this toggle is true then show this list
now when we save this come back to our
page refresh you'll notice that's here
we click hide names it's gone okay
the reason why we're doing this is
because really if we were doing this
with a hidden class you could have just
thrown a transition with your CSS and
animated
wait without using ng animate so that
would have made this whole video sort of
worthless so what we're going to be
doing here is we have ng if and let's
actually open our inspect element here
so let's head over to the ng animate
documentation now what we see here is
that we have this ng enter class is ng
enter and enter ng interactive class
that are going to be flashed onto our
property our object to let us know the
states that we're going to be animating
so ng enter is going to be first applied
to this in in this case the item with
the UL because that's what we're going
to be writing our CSS but uh this is
going to be the initial state so when
it's hidden it's going to be 0 so like
you see here opacity is set to 0 and
they have a transition of 0.5 seconds
I'm sure going to click this and I'm
going to copy this whole little chunk of
code here I'm going to throw it into our
CSS up top here remember you'll want
your CSS and an actual CSS file and not
on your page okay so we have here and
they just had a class of fade but since
this is the only unordered list on the
page I'm just going to say and when the
unordered list has a class of ng enter
then make sure that it has this
transition and give it an opacity of 0
now again let's go ahead and copy this
line and what we're gonna do is we're
going to add on the ng enter active
class so if we head back to the
documentation you can just see it's ng -
enter - active ok so we can do ng -
enter - active now for this one we don't
need the transition because it's already
going to be applied through the ng enter
class but we do want to say that at this
point we want this to have an opacity of
1 now if you'll notice we're also going
to say if it has the class of ng enter +
ng interactive then give it an opacity
of 1 this way that this property is
going to become more specific than this
one and override it okay now that we
have this ng enter ng enter active those
are our two states for this particular
animation so you notice that by default
when we hide this nothing different
happens absolutely nothing is different
but now I want to click show names we
get into fade in and since it's
happening over the course of 0.5 seconds
you'll be able to see something happen
in the classes over here but since I
want to make it more obvious let's make
this transition happen over 2 seconds
that way you can really see the classes
come and go if you look at this
unordered list here ok so I'm going to
get rid of it it's gone now when we add
it look over here for the unordered list
you can see ng animate ng Interactive
and then after the animation is
completely complete those classes are
gone so that's what we don't have to
have anything with the opacity at this
point what's great about angular so we
have this ng enter class that's being
added the moment that this animations
being triggered and then that active
class is being added so that if the
transition actually happens once the
animation is complete all the classes
are removed so let's take this back to
zero point well have it zero point three
seconds because that's typically that
time I like fading transitions and I'm
gonna actually have this as an ease okay
so now we have these two but you'll
notice that when we hide it they still
they're still just jumping away so just
like we have ng enter and ng interactive
we also have ng leave an NG leave active
so let's actually copy these here
there's going to be some similarities
we're going to keep the transition the
same so we're gonna change this first ng
enter to ng leave but however the
leaving state is going to start with a
one for the opacity and it's going to
end with a zero and it's changes to ng
leave active and ng leave active okay
so we have 0 1 1 0 so now that this
class is going to be applied the moment
that we hit the button and then it's
going to apply the active one to trigger
the animation over the course of 0.3
seconds fade-out and then the ng-if is
going to apply and remove that item from
the Dom entirely
so let's come here and refresh our page
and let's see this in action now we can
fade out we can fade in okay and you'll
know this is just a fade effect let's
say we want to say transform translate
x0
okay and now at the starting state we
want it to be negative 100% now again we
want this to be 0 at the leave state and
negative 100 percent at the the just the
at just the normal leave state so as you
can see it's like the opposites here
this is where it's going this is where
it is this is this is where it is this
is where it's going okay so let's come
here and let's see this in action now
what we're going to get on top of a fade
is we're also going to get a zoom out
it's gonna fly out to the left won't let
just like that okay and likewise if we
were to modify this and say 100% instead
of negative 100% this is gonna be coming
and going in different directions it's
gone it's entered it's gone it's entered
cool so as you can see just through
these four classes we have a lot of
control over what's happening to this
animation they don't have to be the same
you can have different exit states and
enter States as you as you've seen here
now there's a lot more you can do with
ng animate you can ng animate things
when they're added to the list you can
stagger animations for an a page loader
or something like that and we're going
to get more into those animation
features in the next couple of videos so
check it out play around with ng enter
ng Interactive and get your animations
going with your CSS right now as always
this is Scott with level up tutorials if
you have any questions or comments have
become of the video so Petra or Facebook
at level of touch we'd love to hear from
you thanks
watching and we'll see in the next one
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
