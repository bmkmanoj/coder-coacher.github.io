up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how to configure your jQuery slider and
make it a little bit more interesting
than what we had before okay so let's go
ahead and start off here and I'm just
going to remove this title here so I'm
going to click this little arrow
rearrange and it'll click remove
okay apply to all displays so now we
just have our image okay
perfect for me and let's go to settings
here under format so slideshow settings
okay so we're going to keep these as an
unordered list okay a wrapper class item
list is fine and if you'll notice skin
here to select the skin you want to use
not all widgets support skins okay
whatever we don't have any skins notice
how it just says default in fact I
personally wouldn't even use the skin I
would just maybe do it with CSS but if
you don't know CSS maybe this is
something you can look into okay so a
slideshow type this is just going to be
cycle okay what's cool about that is is
if you have other jQuery plugins that
you want to be using and they have a
drupal add-on for instance like flex
slider which we'll be using in the
future you'll be able to select it here
and this gives you the options for that
particular module if you'll notice here
these are all cycle specific options if
we want to change this effect that's
actually let's do something different
let's scroll left or actually let's
scroll horizontally this way it can be
left and right depending on we click
forward and back and we want this to
pause on hover okay and do we don't want
to pause and click because we want it to
be able to take you to that piece of
content come on click okay okay perfect
so if we click this view Advanced
Options these are similar options so
start slideshow pause if you want to
start it with pause starting the lat
none of this stuff is really necessary
these are things they just sort of hide
to just so they don't take up all the
space and slideshow after last slide but
it's good to have these options
available specifically because we're not
getting into the code we're not writing
the JavaScript ourselves so they have to
make it so that the
options are all here for us and uh you
know definitely if you're comfortable
writing jQuery modules or plugins if
you're you know let's say you're
familiar recycle you've you cycle on
other websites that's cool
ah you can certainly do that you can you
know add the the plug-in yourself with
the JavaScript and you can write your
JavaScript code it's not really hard or
anything however if you want to have it
all within you know into Drupal I found
it is a little bit easier integrating
things like this into Drupal just by
using the modules rather than going
straight to the code of course if you
want the total flexibility go to the
code by all means there's nothing
stopping you okay so uh let's just do
this let's go to Internet Explorer
tweaks ClearType okay whatever ClearType
background okay sure whatever just leave
those unchecked and now for widgets okay
so let's check this out here if we want
to add widgets here if we want to add a
pager to the top we can do that controls
or whatever and you'll notice these are
the same top or bottom I'm actually just
going to add these to the bottom I'm
going to add a controls let's see we're
going to add a pager okay and that
should be it
it's asking what they what you want them
to be we'll just say fields whatever and
controls type text sure okay
let's apply to all displays okay let's
check it out here if you'll notice
there's this previous pause in next and
now it's sliding horizontally here we go
perfect cool let's actually change this
some stuff around here let's turn off
the pager and let's make it slide
vertically okay let's apply okay
let's update our preview okay okay so
now it's sliding vertically perfect and
now as you can see it's pausing on hover
if we click down this it's going to take
us to that project okay and usually what
I would do from here is just style these
up with CSS make these buttons look nice
and that way you know you have total can
complete control over it let's go back
into settings one more time if you'll
notice there was this jQuery cycle
custom options to use these Advanced
Options you'll need to download this
package you can check it out if you want
but as you can see we've got this
working it's a slideshow perfectly it's
totally not necessary unless you need
that stuff and you know what you're
looking for so don't worry about it
and so here we are with a jQuery
slideshow we have next buttons and we
can style it up with CSS let's click
Save and see it on our page and we
should be all good here is at the bottom
perfect and like I said before if you
want to have the image size be different
you know you can go to configuration and
image styles and create an image image
style for whatever you want and if you
need help doing that we have a tutorial
on image styles it's one of the earlier
ones you can just look at our tutorials
list and look for Drupal in the styles
I'll show you how to do that cool once
