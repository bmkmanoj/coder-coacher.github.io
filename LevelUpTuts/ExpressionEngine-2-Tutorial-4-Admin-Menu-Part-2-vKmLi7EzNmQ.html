going to level up our expression engine
to skills this is especially Shinto
tutorial number five and we are going to
continue going over the admin menu and
we're actually going to stick right
inside of this channel administration on
the last video we covered global
preferences in this video we're going to
cover categories and statuses okay so
before we do that let's go ahead and I'm
going to encourage you guys to subscribe
to our YouTube channel please do so so
you can get updates whenever we post new
videos and thanks a lot to those who
have already really appreciate that okay
so we'll start the tutorial I'm logged
into my expression engine instance if
you're not again you just add admin dot
PHP to the root of your URL and it'll
ask you to login do that and then you'll
be right where I am so we're going to
click on admin channel administration
and we will start with statuses so what
a status is an expression engine is a
way for you to flag a piece of content
by default when you install
expressionengine you get one group
called statuses but you can create more
groups if you desire and the first two
inside of this group the statuses is
open and closed with expression engine
there's this idea of a piece of an entry
being open or closed and what that means
is when an item is open that means it's
available to be displayed on the website
and if it's closed that means that it's
available to be displayed however not by
default when you're running a special
engine tags within the template you have
to explicitly say that you want to show
the status of anything other than open
so but if an item is closed you have to
say status equal open or I'm sorry
status equal closed to display if it's
good
those entries that are closed open by
default like I said they'll just show
things that are open but you notice
again these are just the first two that
you get you can have more and so
typically what I do is I'll have like
open and closed and it'll also create
another one so that I can flag a piece
of content as being featured an
expression or in Drupal you can think I
sort of like liken this to the promote
to front functionality but may be named
a little bit better so we're going to go
ahead and create a new one so you can
see what looks likes we click that
button and here we give it a name some
say featured the order just just going
to show the third option there and then
the next one is you can give it a color
which you know it's not really all that
important so just give it that color
blue and then restrict the strat status
to members of specific groups of by
default only administrators can change
the status but here we can say you know
if we want more people to be able to do
that and I'm just leave it and then
that's fine okay so note that we now
have the third one the third item here
and note that we can only delete the
ones that we've created we can't delete
the the two that you start out with so
this probably makes sense for this group
so let's go back one level i'm just
going to use the breadcrumbs but you can
also just go admin channels to status it
again i'm just going to do the other way
too so you can see how it's done and i'm
going to create a second group and we're
going to go ahead and call this drafts
we may or may not use this by just want
you to see that you late you can do this
so with drafts you can open and close
but you can also say first draft
same draft and then maybe there's you
know no in review and then final so as
you can imagine what I'm built doing
right here is just building out a very
very lightweight or flow system that you
can train your users to to use so that's
pretty much all we're going to look at
for status and now what we're going to
do is going to move on to the next item
and that's categories so categories is
very similar to status because this is
another way to flag content or flag like
content with this Persian expression
engine or any version there is no
default categories so we're going to go
ahead and create our first our new
category group so click here category
group you know again this might vary
upon the type of site that you're
building you can have multiple groups of
categories so say for example you're
building a directory like a staff
directory or something so maybe you'd
have a group called staff you can
there's there's some some settings here
you know who can edit categories and you
can assign different member groups who
can delete same thing here exclude from
channel or file category assignment I
just normally normally just leave this
as is but it may differ for you so for
staff so I've now created a category a
group of staff and we're going to create
another one will say we also create news
we there's a section of our site for
news go ahead and create another
call news and it's amit but again
there's there's another level that you
can make some restrictions there so now
i've created two groups they have no
field yet we're saying this zero here
that indicates that we haven't actually
created a category for this category's
group so when we go into staff or so you
can see this and maybe there's going to
be a new category fruit it's like full
full time we can assign it now here's
where it receives that category URL
title that we talked about another video
we can upload a video on sorry not a
video but an image for that category
it's not really relevant to us there and
here's where we can have a child
category category which we'll look at in
just one second so we have a full-time
staff person maybe we'll have a time not
really in love with this example that
I'm giving but it's really just more
important that you see how the compass
functionality works so faculty again
notice that it's auto signing the
category URL title that you'll see that
you can always like name means whatever
you want but it does just replace the
spaces with dashes or dashes or
underscores based on that global
preference that you said earlier alright
so that is staff but say they want to
change the order of the sort order I can
hit custom and now i can use this so say
i want a part time to be on the top i
click it twice this is sort of a really
clunky interface but it is what it is so
I'm go ahead and hit that in an update
I'm gonna go back to the news category
and I was setting up and i'm going to
give you an illustration of what the
child
category looks like so save a news
category and you know in this example
we'll say we have will say this is like
a new site now so we'll say there's a
business category and there's balloons
maybe there's entertainment um depending
on your site you may not even this I
don't you may not even use categories it
just again depends on the size and scale
of your site we're going to add one more
and we're call sports sports and now
sports we're gonna get another one here
and will call at NHL and this one we're
actually going to assign to the parent
of sports it's submit and what we're
going to see is now we have this little
indention and this indicates that this
as a child of sports and you can have
many children let's see here will be and
your your children can have children of
course so I can say scouting baby hey
this is a baseball scouting store or
something and so on so I think you guys
get it and so right now what we've done
in this video's we set up to category
groups will you added a custom status
and an additional status group with some
custom statuses as well so that's what
we're going to cover in this video
thanks a lot for watching and again
everyone please subscribe we really
appreciate it thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
