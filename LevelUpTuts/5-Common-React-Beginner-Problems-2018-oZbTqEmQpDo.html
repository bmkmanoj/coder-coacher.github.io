is highlight some of the common sort of
issues that people who are getting
started with react
run into and there's gonna be six or so
issues here
most of these are gonna be code based
except for one and here we have our
react site it's very basic we just have
one simple component which is called it
level up where you can see it's just
test is with an h1 that says a level up
okay so this first issue that I'm going
to cover is something that you might
encounter while just typing your code we
have a couple of divs here and then
maybe we say well let's go ahead and
also include a button in this component
and you can say yo into this button and
we can save it and if you're not used to
react you might expect this to work
and if you have used react in some sort
of time you know that there's going to
be an error here now this is because you
cannot place adjacent at JSX elements
without wrapping them in something and
that sort of sucks right it's a bummer
to have to wrap things in a div
especially if you don't want to div in
there for your markup now luckily
there's a solution for this this is a
fundamental issue with how JSX compiles
down to JavaScript now luckily in the
most recent versions of react this has
been sort of solved in a handful of
different ways before you were just have
to suck it up and wrap everything in a
div okay and call it a day but the
answer for this now is to use something
called fragments we have access to a new
component called react dot fragment and
a react fragment is simply going to be a
wrapper that does not output any kind of
markup so instead of having to add an
extra divs your code you can now add
your stuff and react that fragment now
keep in mind you do need to import react
to use react dot fragment now let's
check out our site here you can see we
now have level up and yo and if we were
to check out the source there's no
additional sort of wrapping component
okay so this is the preferred way now of
getting around this rather than wrapping
your code and extra extraneous markup
however there is another solution that
is also react fragments but with react
fragments with a shorthand now the best
way to use react fragments with a
shorthand is to
have your tooling set up correctly to
use the new syntax for fragments we
simply just need to remove anything
between our JSX code and save it like
this now if we head to our site here we
can see we have a big old error now the
caveat here is that fragments are
awesome and this syntax for fragments is
awesome however out of the box create
react app isn't using the latest
versions of babble so even in their
documentation react still says to use
react dot fragment so if you want to
figure out how you can get yours
configured because I personally love the
shorthand I use the shorthand all over
my coat you keep clicking click many
tools do not support yet you can see
that to get support we simply need to be
using the latest babel 7 beta 31 and
above now babel with these version comes
with its own pitfalls you can see that
you can just simply add it like this I
honestly don't know what the process for
adding it to create react app is I
haven't used it if you're using webpack
or any of this stuff I should say that
using these latest versions of babel is
kind of a headache if you haven't done
it before but if you are on these latest
versions of babel already or are willing
to do the work using this shorthand
syntax for fragments is excellent
because it doesn't take up a ton of
space
okay i'm gonna undo that and just save
this like this so that's the first
pitfall is trying to output adjacent
elements when you could be using react
fragments instead of wrapping your stuff
in a div now the next one is going to be
fairly common as well we can do on
clique is going to be equal to and we
can say run func
okay and let's have a run func up top
here and we can say run func and run
func is going to be a function where we
do this dot set state and we want to say
let's just say like a nav open is equal
to true okay so this is a very simple
function here that we should be running
and I'm sorry this needs to be this that
run fun could not just run func so we
want to say this dot run func we're
gonna run this function and set the
state okay so if we come to our
it looks fine looks fine let me open up
my counsel here so we can see that this
is not going to work let me open up my
console there we go and the hit yo and
you can see we get a big old error and
as well as we get another big old Aran
here cannot read property set state of
undefined now typically you might think
what the heck is up with this because
this is how we have always done it if
you were to use the create element sort
of version of react however to properly
access this inside of this kind of
function especially on an on click here
you have a couple of strategies now in
the past the solution was to do dot bind
and then pass in this like this okay
that we're binding the context of this
into this function and if we were to try
this now and click yo you can see we can
get it without any errors however this
syntax to me has always been a little
bit clunky and there have been some
alternatives such as running a arrow
function in here however this is proved
to be not the most performant option
what we can do now is say run func is
going to be equal to an arrow function
just like this so check out this new
code here where we say run func is now
equal to an arrow function this will
give us correct access to state and
let's check it out when i refresh I can
select the o and if we were to do a
react dev tools inspect on this thing we
were to check it out inside a test you
could see the state has been set open to
true ok so this is a common pitfall that
this dot said state this is not defined
cannot set state of undefined okay so
this is the ideal modern solution to
this thing although the solution for
what you do in here has changed like
eight times so who knows if it will
change again in the future but right now
this is the preferred way of doing it if
you need to access this does head state
ok next we have an issue that really
stems from the evolution of react and
this is not necessarily something that
you need to worry about if you're using
the latest create react app as well as
the tools and stuff like that but the
problem here is what happens if you
start following it to tour
you come into your new file and instead
of doing a new create class we start
coming in here and we say react dot
create and then we have a function and
an object and inside of here we have a
render function and some of this stuff
looks very similar and there are some
differences of how we actually wrote
code like this and you might be thinking
hey what's wrong with this the problem
is is that this is no longer the syntax
so if you are using a react decree class
what you want to be doing is bouncing on
over to the class component name extends
component syntax where we have a class
instead of a function to create our
components so using outdated syntax is a
comment gotcha that people run into when
they see older tutorials that use things
like react create class so you always
want to make sure you're using the
latest class syntax here my
recommendation is to get a react snippet
library especially if you're using
something like a text editor here or any
of these things let me just see which
one I have installed
I have react native snippets I have es7
react Redux graph QL react snippets this
one this one's excellent because you can
come in here and I can just say RCC for
react create class and then here we go
gives you everything perfectly okay so
my recommendation is to always be using
the latest syntax to for react the last
thing you want your code to be is
out-of-date for when a new version of
react comes out and then you can't take
advantage of some of the performance
increases right so using an old and
outdated syntax is a comment gotcha now
let's talk about another one here let's
say we have a component here and let's
remove this export default here what
we're gonna be seeing here is an error
that says type is invalid expected
let's see and this error can be
manifested in different ways you might
be seeing something like it expected a
react to create element expected a
different type or something like that
now this kind of error happens because
you have issues in your exporting for
instance in this case we're importing
the default import but we do not have a
default export we simply just have the
export or if you have something like
export default class test and then
inside of here you're importing test
inside of brackets this is a fundamental
issue with importing and exporting in
JavaScript and something that can happen
all the time if you are seeing that your
component is not being imported
correctly in fact here's the error that
I'm talking about elements type is
invalid expected a string for built-in
components or a class function for
composite components but got undefined
that error if you are getting that error
that means there is something incorrect
with your import or your export so if
you are ever seeing that error where
it's expecting something different then
that means that react is not getting a
component when you're attempting to use
it down here and therefore it's going to
error out so my suggestion is to head to
your component file confirm what you are
exporting in this case export default so
head here first to confirm what you're
exporting and then come to your
component that you're using it in and
then confirm what you're importing it in
to make sure that it's correct okay so
if you're getting any sort of error that
ever looks like that
this is what you want to do to fix it
okay check out your imports and exports
now the last one is not going to be a
code issue but an issue with project
planning and things like that
a lot of people like to reach for Redux
really quickly now Redux is a library
for state management across your
application allows you to share state
all around your application in different
sorts of ways in fact there's a Redux
level of tutorials course I'm absolutely
not anti Redux I like Redux quite a bit
however in a basic application you don't
always need to use redux if your
applications going to get large in your
state's going to get potentially unruly
than using something like redux as a
library to manager state could become a
good idea and for the most part you
don't even need any sort of overall
state management however if you do need
some state management here there react
16.3 now provides the official context
api which means that you can actually
have a provider and a consumer inside of
your application without using an extern
a library allowing you to pass a state
from component to component without
having to have some sort of parent-child
relationship allowing for state
management that is a little bit more
than what react has out of the box and a
little bit less than what Redux does so
if you need some state management but
you don't need to go crazy with it
check out the new react context API for
learning that I think West boss has a
great video on that so check that out
and you can see examples that how you
can manage your state with something
like context so to write out through
these again once more it's trying to use
adjacent JSX elements without something
like fragments another solution is to
output this in a raise instead of just
in JSX but to be honest the array
solution is ugly I would always go for
fragments if I were you another one is
using this set state in a function
without properly having context to this
another one is using outdated or old
syntax so you want to be using the
latest es7 react syntax the stuff that
you get sort of out of the box with
create react app next is going to be
having incorrect imports and exports
therefore getting some sort of error
where react does not see that you have
an actual component and is saying hey
your type is invalid and the last one is
needing something like an external
library for state management way too
soon before you need it adding
additional complexity into your project
that might not need to be there now if
you have additional react gotchas post
them into the comments I want to see
what kind of standard gotchas people run
into now a lot of the stuff is people
coming to Rick because this sort of
system is a little bit different I'm
going to say then a lot of other systems
that people have worked with in the past
right so there's a lot of unusual things
that you have to do and they they become
less unusual after you do them and you
start to understand not only that but
they'll make you better at JavaScript
overall okay so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials if you would
like to learn more about react head on
over to level up tutorials dot-com and
you can check out all of these awesome
pro series I just released a new series
this month using headless WordPress
gatsby an XJS that uses react in all
sorts of different ways with wordpress
Pro Gatsby for static site generation I
also have react 16 for everyone which is
a series teaching you all of the core
fundamental skills for react so check it
out level of tutorials calm thank you so
much for watching and i'll see in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
