up Tut's and today I'm going to show you
how you can set any page to be your home
page so by default Drupal likes to have
your home page just be this where your
articles or anything are sort of pushed
to the front page whenever you click
promote it to the front page and it has
like a teaser almost like in a blog
format and so you're probably wondering
how you can get rid of that because if
we turn this Perpetua website logo
design whatever if we turn this piece of
content off it's going to say there is
no published content on your page click
here to add some and and you don't
necessarily always want that so let's
say you want to just make your own page
and have that be your home page well
fortunately that's really easy to do so
we're going to go to AB content we're
going to click on basic page and we're
going to make a page and we're going to
call this home and in the bottom text
we're going to leave this blank because
I actually don't want to have anything
here we don't need to provide a menu
link because the home menu link that we
already have is going to work
no revision okay and yeah so we want
this to be a that's automatic path is
just going to edit it to be home you
know this other stuff should be fine and
we're going to leave it published and
click Save okay so now we have this page
that's - home so if we go to
configuration under set information it's
going to ask you for a default front
page I paste this in here and just use
the the URL name for our page which you
remember was slash home this is now
going to be our default front page so
let's click Save okay this is by the way
this is just telling me I have some
modules that need to be updated and a
couple lessons I'll show you how to
update some modules ok so as you can see
now our home page is this home page
about projects at home perfect that's
exactly what we wanted
and so now this is going to allow us
some greater control let's say once we
get into things like views which is a
module to display content we can create
views to display various bits of content
on this page we can do things and just
totally have control over what this page
looks like instead of using Drupal's
defaults all right
once again this is Scott with level up
tuts and thanks for watching
feel free to let us know if you have any
questions or concerns you might leave a
comment hit us up at Twitter just let us
know what you're thinking alright thanks
a lot for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
