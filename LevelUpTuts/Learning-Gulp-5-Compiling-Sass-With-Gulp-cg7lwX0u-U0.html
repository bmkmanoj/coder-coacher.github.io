love tuts and today we're going to be
building on what we did last time and
we're going to be using that watch
script to compile our SAS code every
single time that we save our SAS it's
going to shoot out CSS and now this is
no different than what you're used to
using with something like SAS watch
however it takes care of a lot of
processes for you if you do it inside of
gulp this way we can have one command
watch our SAS watch our HTML for changes
possibly watch our JavaScript for
changes and and you can do it all within
one command instead of having separate
processes to compile your sass or minify
your javascript or compress images or
anything like that so keep watching
we're going to show you how to compile
your sass in gulp so the first thing we
have to do is install a package for
force s and the one we're going to be
using is gulp ruby sass now this one in
particular you also need to have Ruby
and sass installed so if you're already
using assess and you've used the SAS
watch command then you should be all set
so what we're going to do is just like
before we're going to run NPM install to
install this and if you need to use sudo
than use sudo and we're going to do in
sudo NPM install - - save - at dev and
then in the next space the name of the
package is going to be gulp - Ruby - SAS
just like that and we're going to enter
and it's going to install that package
for you ok now that that's been
installed we need to add it to our
project to do that we need to require it
so we can add a comma after this uglify
and we can name it SAS and SAS is going
to equal require and then inside of here
we need to just pass it in the package
name which was gulp - Ruby - SAS just
like that now there's many other SAS uh
gulp packages so if this one doesn't
work quite the way you wanted to you can
check out some of the others
this is just the one I've been using
lately so sass is going to equal require
gulp Ruby says cool so now we're ready
to start using this package so let's go
ahead to our Styles test and we're going
to delete this council log that we had
in there so that actually does something
now and what we wanted to do is very
similar to what we did with our scripts
tasks so the first thing you want to do
is have it to look in a particular
directory so we can say gulp SRC and
then in parenthesis pass it in the
directory which just happens to be in
this in this case SCSS forward slash and
then now what we want to make sure that
I grab every single s CSS file that's in
this directory so what we can do is say
asterisk asterisk forward space asterisk
dot s CSS this is going to find all s
CSS files anywhere that are inside of
this s CSS folder ok now we need to pipe
in some tasks here so we can go ahead
and say dot pipe just like before and
then what we're going to do is actually
run a sass function so just like that
we're going to say sess and now since
this project is a basic sass file I'm
going to show you it right now I have
some variables I have a map even though
this so Suzy I'm not actually using Suzy
you can notice there's no import
statements at the top here I'm not using
compass even it's just a pretty basic
sass file with some Styles in it
so we're going to go into this and
you'll notice that we're just running
the sass command without any options now
there are plenty of options that you can
put in here and to do that you can check
out the github page for gulp Ruby sass
and check out those options if you'd
like to see what involves there however
we're just going to be using this sass
function like this for now so just like
the uglify we're then going to need to
pipe in a destination so we're going to
say pipe and then gulp dot desc
now this time we have a definite
destination which is inside of a string
just CSS and we can say CSS forward
slash like that now we're going to
finish it off with a semicolon and now
here we have our Styles task so what
it's going to do is it's going to find
any of our CSS CSS files it's going to
run sass and then it's going to save the
output into the CSS folder cool so let's
actually try this out just by running
our gulp our gulp task here we can say
go and then uh Styles is the name of the
task okay we didn't have any errors so
that's good it's brand Styles and it
took 5 milliseconds and if we check out
our CSS file you can see we have it
output here now to prove that this is
actually working and that this isn't
just already pre compiled that we can
pass it in some options and let's say we
want our CSS to always be output
compressed so to pass with some options
we need to have brackets inside of this
sass function here we're going to be
passing this an object and it's object
is just one of the many options and the
option that we're looking for is style
so it's just style and then colon and
then in quotes we're going to say
compressed now the other options are the
same as normal you have nested compact
compressed 'add compressed and expanded
that shouldn't be if you're used to
using sass those options have always
been there cool so now let's go ahead
and run this command once more
Bob styles and check out our main dot
CSS and everything has been compressed
here now because we want watch to watch
this for updates let's go ahead and add
our s CSS to our watch file so I'm going
to go ahead and copy this path here
where our sass files are located and
let's go to our watch task and I'm going
to write another line which is
watch and then in parentheses here pass
in the the path to the SAS files we want
to watch and then in an array again
we're going to pass in the tasks we want
to run so just like last time we're
saying if any of these s CSS files have
been modified then go ahead and run the
Styles task so to see this in action
let's now run the default gulp task okay
and you can see it's going to be
watching for changes I'm going to make
an update to the CSS just change the
background to blue now without even
looking at the output I'm just going to
go over to our CSS and you can see that
the background has been output as blue
now and if you come over here you can
see that gulp is smart enough it's not
going to rerun everything it's only
going to run what you told it to run so
we said watch for these files and then
run this task you can see it's only run
the Styles task perfect so we're on our
way to having an extremely useful gulp
file so you can now compile sass you can
watch for changes and that's just the
start of it we have all sorts of stuff
coming up so as always this is Scott
would love love Tut's if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video and hit us up at Twitter or
Facebook add a level of cuts we'd love
to hear from you so thanks for watching
and I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
