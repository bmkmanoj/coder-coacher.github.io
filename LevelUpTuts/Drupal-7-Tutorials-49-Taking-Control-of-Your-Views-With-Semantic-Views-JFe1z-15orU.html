level of Tut's and today I'm going to
talk about a module called semantic
views while you may have noticed been
working with views that your source code
gets a little heavy there's all sorts of
extraneous divs just like a ton of extra
stuff and you don't really have complete
control over it so what a great module
is is called semantic views and I'll
show you this right now
the project is drupal.org slash project
slash semantic views and what semantic
views does is it really aims to give you
more control you can see this before and
after before here's sort of this
extraneous divs and then after it has
exactly what you want and pretty much
only what you want it doesn't solve all
of the problems with views --is sort of
extraneous code but it definitely makes
it a lot more bearable okay okay so what
I'm going to do is here is I'm actually
going to click into a view that I
already have made and I'm just going to
show you exactly how to set up semantic
views because if you used views and
everything there you know it's it's not
adding really thing extra except for
giving you a little bit more control
okay so semantic views is under format
if you click your format here and we've
gone over things like slideshow or
unformatted list we have there's also
quick tabs from when you install quick
tabs and one of the previous ones grid
our table but after you install the
module semantic views you'll also notice
this semantic views for the format okay
so you want to select that have it to be
you know all your displays or whatever
you need it to be and then you also want
a under show you also want this to be
semantic views fields okay so let's get
into the difference between what each of
these is doing and what they can do for
you if you go to settings under the
semantic views format you can see what
your options are basically it gives you
some some grouping if you want a group
of field you can group your your
grouping title you can set exactly what
you want it to be by default it's set to
an h3 you can give it a class here so
this is your list this is like the thing
above the row right if your row is going
to be a list item then you would want
this to be you know a ul
Oh al whatever so this is deciding what
that over that larger thing is you can
even have it set to none let's say if
you want each of your rows to be a div
like we have here so like I have it set
to none I have no class on it and then
for our a row I have a div notice how it
says if this is set to a list then your
row element should be set to Li so if
you choose one of these just make sure
you put Li here so it makes sense okay
and then in class this is going to be
the class you get per row if you had a
number here it's going to give it it's
going to count up or so you know what or
whatever row it is it's going to output
that number so that way if you're giving
a class based on the row number you can
just have your class be like something
like that and it's going to be like one
row to row three row okay so this first
last every nth this can be um if you
have it set to zero like it's the
default it's going to give it a first
and last okay just your first option is
going to at first in your last row is
going to have the the class of last
however if you write a let's say three
every third row it's going to have one
of these classes so since we have this
let's put this third on this first and
last let's actually save this out and
see what it's going to do you can also
see right down here you can add some
zebra striping if you want on even or
whatever class you want it to be called
it's going to do sort of an odd even you
know sort of thing okay okay so let's
save this and now let's in the preview I
know this takes an argument
I know 10 is going to give us some stuff
so I put in 10 here and here's our
preview let's actually inspect this code
and then we can see exactly what our
classes are okay so if we get in here
you can see that this first one gets
first the second one gets even okay
because we have that even odd so this is
gets first nod second one gets just even
and then remember we had every third
it's going to count to less so then it's
going to say last odd and then first is
going to be even odd and then last even
and it's going to continue doing this
first less every three times this could
be helpful maybe if you're doing a
responsive site with a grid
let's say you had a class name like grid
3 alpha grid 3 Omega so every like 1st
and 3rd one you wanted to get rid of
that extra margin on the left or right
then you know that works great
especially if you're using an admin
theme or a theme like Omega or something
okay so let's go back into our our view
here oh we are actually let's just
scroll back up here I'll close out of
this now with the semantic view fields
settings this is where you have
individual control over each field okay
so the last one is sort of the greater
row by row this is your field so your
title it lists each field right here you
have your title your content watch on
YouTube so these are the only fields
that I have but you can choose what you
want it to wrap in and if you leave it
blank it's not going to wrap in anything
because this video itself already has
the embed code
I don't want it wrapping in another div
because it doesn't need it but we're
here I want this watch I want this
wrapped in a you know div with the class
of watch I want to label but I don't you
know have a class on the label or
anything h4 for the title can be
whatever you want and then I've also
noticed that if you don't check the Skip
empty field so sometimes you get an
error I don't know if that's a current
bug with the module and who knows by the
time you're watching this that may be
fixed but if you're getting some sort of
an error with semantic views you know
check this skip empty fields box and
that should go away okay okay well that
is semantic views it really gives you a
like a more granular control over what
your views are outputting so it doesn't
have to export all this extraneous code
and you have more control over what
you're doing
once again this is Scott with level up
tuts if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment on the
video hit us up at Twitter level up
Tut's let us know what you're thinking
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
