this video is theming vs code now the
evening Villa's code has been changing a
little bit because a little bit ago you
are unable to fully theme vyas code if
we were to install any of these themes
it would sort of change this bar right
here it would change this bar would
change your tabs but the rest of this
like the toolbar on the left and the
info bar down here on the bottom would
both remain untouched now luckily they
have opened it up so that theme
developers can now add theming to these
various areas of u.s. code that's a
great thing because what we want to do
is we want to theme in vs code more than
just a you know a syntax theme so in
this video I'm going to show you how you
can change the theme of your vs code and
we're also going to go over syntax
highlighting what we can do is come into
extensions and then from extensions we
can click these three dots and you'll
notice well we don't have a good way to
find themes right we see extensions
recommended extensions but you can come
in here and simply just type in theme
now I kind of hate that that's how it is
would be cool if you had the option of
just saying hey show me all of the
themes right like if we had more show me
all the themes but that's not the way it
is
right now I'm going to click sort by
Install count to get the most popular
ones now from here you can see we have
one dark Pro which is going to
essentially be Adams one dark theme and
I really like that something to click
install now in addition we can also just
check out some of these you can click on
the extension itself and you can see
well this is not a theme itself but an
icon theme so you're going to get a
whole bunch of stuff that's not
necessarily themes themselves so you
want to check on that before you just
start clicking install all over the
place so we also have less if we scroll
down markdown theme kit and that for me
material theme kit now material theme
kit is cool because well as you can see
it's installed 85
thousand times and it's really nice
basically what you'd expect from the
material theme that you would have had
on any of the other things but we also
get something like material night 80s
which is a brighter more Minooka version
of this thing now if we click install we
can grab that one
now Dracula is a classic and you'll
notice something different from Dracula
here than what we've been seeing before
because Dracula is such a highly used
classic theme you can see that they're
one of the first to implement this new
full theming we have the tool bar over
here matches everything as well as the
bottom bar so let's click install on
Dracula as well by all means you don't
have to click install on every single
one of these I am but it's great to have
a lot of themes and it's great to check
them out theming your code editor it's
just one of those things that adds to
personalization that just really makes
you feel at home when you're working now
one of my favorite themes I've been
using lately is hopscotch
now hopscotch has a purple background
and really bright colors it says it's
for kids and that's okay I personally
really like how everything just sort of
stands out in it it's a very bright game
without being too totally black right a
lot of these themes black background
bright text and I like that too but this
looks really nice now I personally use
material theme so if we come down here
you'll notice only has 25,000 downloads
although that is 25,000 it's still less
than the other material one but you'll
notice that this theme is in fact very
modern and there's several different
versions of it all of which do include
theming the toolbar itself so let's
click install on this one as well and I
think it should be good enough okay now
one thing you may be noticing here is
that we don't have a sort of separation
between syntax themes and themes
themselves so I just clicked refresh I'm
going to close this out and we can set
our theme by coming up to code
preferences and then color theme but
again you'll notice there is no like
syntax theme we're not change
just the syntax theme and that is a
little bit different because in sublime
text and Adam you're changing both the
syntax theme as well as the theme
overall and to be totally honest I like
this way more because you don't have to
install two things and they might not be
the same color or whatever here we have
Dracula and you can the syntax
highlighting goes really well with the
toolbar the bottom bar and it looks just
great overall the Dracula theme is super
nice here is a softer version
here's high contrast which I believe
comes with vs code we have hopscotch
which doesn't yet enable theming of the
sidebar you can tell by the sort of
classic blue bar down here we have some
default ones out on this this theme
isn't doing it for me but if we keep
going down you can see material material
Knight material at-ats
but then we get into the material themes
that are more modern where we have
material theme now material theme has a
lot of nice stuff going on for it it
looks really good because it has all of
this toolbar theme now this is like I
said wasn't possible before this is
something that just came to BS code
recently and I'm really super psyched
that it did because that was one of my
biggest gripes with the general
interface of vs code before but as you
can see here we can just scroll down you
can search and we're getting a nice
little preview but other than that
there's really not much to it here if
I'm going to select material theme
darker like the way this looks but
honestly from that whole little tour I
just did I think Dracula is calling my
name so I'm going to come back here I'm
gonna select Dracula and there we go so
this is now my text editor theme as well
as my syntax theme just a small step you
can take to further customize vs code to
make it a better experience for you so
head over to the extensions panel and
start searching for themes let me know
if you find any excellent themes for
vyas code post your favorite themes in
the comments love to hear which ones
you're using and which ones you really
like or if you just in general II hate
my taste in themes that's cool too so
