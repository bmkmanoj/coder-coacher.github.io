up tuts
and today I'm going to go over how to
make a page view using Drupal 7 and
breezing views 3 so in the past couple
lessons we've shown you how to use
filters we've shown you how to use
fields and you know we showed use a
pager and those were all creating in
block views
well the page view isn't too different
it offers some cool features however
just to get started here I'm just going
to show you how to make a page view and
what you can do with it so really the
only difference between a page view and
a block view is that it creates the page
and while you don't have a piece of
content like you would when you create
content you will have a URL that you can
go to and it will take you to that view
so to get started here let's click on
our views and we'll go to our shortcut
here and looks like it says I have a
security update available on a future
lesson I'll show you how to update your
core version of Drupal for now we can
just ignore this because it's you know
this is just this isn't live we don't
have to worry too much but in the future
if you see these security updates you'll
probably want to take a backup your site
and then update core as long as there
are no issues there so let's create a
new view and let's just call this new
page like I said this is just totally a
test I'm just showing you how to create
a page view so by default if you
remember create a page was checked
before instead of unchecking it we'll
leave it checked and we'll call this new
page and the URL path is going to be our
localhost in our folder our and then new
page so this is actually how we'll
access this page after we create this
page view you're just going to type in
that URL and it's going to take you to
the content so we're going to you know
keep this a 10 inch display we're gonna
use a page or whatever so let's click
continue and edit ok cool so you know
it's giving me these arrow saying just a
security update just likes to bother you
about that still so as you can see by
default we're just bringing an all
published content and we have it
selected to show content and teaser so
it's showing the content and teaser for
all of our things looks like everything
so let's add a filter on this we're just
going to have this be just journal posts
so we're going to add this filter to say
content type or select this and we're to
say we want it to be actually articles
ok apply to display and instead of
content teaser we're going to click this
and we're going to say fields we want to
use fields for this
yeah we'll provide a default wrapper
that's fine okay so now we can add our
fields as you see there's just title
here so it looks like all of our titles
let's say let's add the post date to the
content so the publish date let's see
post date 10 - post date apply to all
displays okay long format cool cool cool
click apply and as you can see now
here's our title and our post date and
here's the title of our page which is of
course new page however if we wanted to
change that you can just click on it
right here where it says title and you
can change it here or down in your
preview you'll notice there's a little
gear here you can click on this edit
title and it's going to allow you to
edit this okay so if you remember our
path was new - page let's save this okay
now let's visit our page that we created
just by saying our normal base URL and
then new path or a new page hit go and
as you can see here's all of our content
here's the new page title that we gave
the page here's our titles and here are
their post dates for all of our articles
thus far this block is just another
block that we have displayed on all
pages so just like any other note page
this is going to show up so this X
essentially just like a note page you
just don't have a chunk of content to
necessarily say you won't find this in
find content it won't be here however
and views view pages it treats it just
like a normal page okay well that's how
to create a page view in the next lesson
we're actually going to move away from
views for a couple lessons and we're
going to come back to the more advanced
functionality in views but right now
this should be able to get you going to
create pages of creating blocks and
displaying content in different ways on
your page in the next lesson we're going
to go over date formats and how you can
create your own date format so you don't
have to say Saturday April 21st and you
know you can create your own and you're
not stuck to what Drupal has in for you
once again this is Scott with level up
tuts and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
