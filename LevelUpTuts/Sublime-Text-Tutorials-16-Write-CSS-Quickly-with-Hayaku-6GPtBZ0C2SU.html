of Tut's and today I'm going to show you
one of my favorite packages for sublime
text 3 and this package is for writing
CSS now what this is is it's a code
completer but it's a type of code
completer that's really great for people
who can't remember what the shortcuts it
should be because this thing accepts all
tons of things for shortcuts
it's called hayaku and it's it's for
sublime text 2 or 3 what's really great
as you could type in OAH and then hit
tab and it'll complete 2 overflow:hidden
right you could also type in ovh i and
it's going to do the same thing
overflow:hidden basically you'll be
amazed at what you can just guess are
going to be these shortcuts and they'll
actually almost a hundred percent of the
time work so let's get into it
we're going to do command shift P to
bring up our control here in the type in
package install packages and this is
spelled h h aya and then you can see
Hayaku and if we click on this it says
fuzzy abbreviations i mean that's really
what it is
it makes writing CSS so fast in fact I
almost have a hard time writing CSS
without this now because I want to write
much faster than unable to so a good
example would be simply let's come
inside one of these items here we could
just say C tab and it's going to
complete two color with dot FFF also one
thing I really like about this is if we
had a color like 333 whatever and we had
this in our clipboard right I'm just
going to copy this so I said command P
if you were in Photoshop or something
and you did you copy the color out of a
hex value and then you came in here and
you typed C tab you'll notice it takes
that clipboard value it automatically
fills it in for you I mean really it
could not get any easier it's it's
awesome so like my example before with
overflow:hidden we have you know Oh H
Oh V aid or Ovey Ovey H I some other
good ones I use all the time
position:relative PS r or sorry I did
the PSR PSA position:absolute BTW is
border top I mean it's just like what
you could imagine is absolutely correct
now what's cool about this is that you
can also give it values right
so you could say H 10 and that's going
to give you a height of 10 pixels or if
you wanted to use something like let's
say ml - 1.5 tab it's going to give you
margin left and then it's going to use
ends because 1.5 makes sense for M's
right so what else could we do with you
could do with 50 P and that's going to
give you width of 50 percent and you can
see how like fast I'm typing this it
really is is that that quick right and
you'll get used to stuff you need to
float something FL tab you need to float
it right
fr tab you know once you get this this
dot you know maybe like two key tab to
key tab going you'll write CSS so fast
you can't even believe it so this is
this is what I'm voting as my favorite
sublime text package of all time it's
Hayaku h eh why aku and uh go look for
it downloaded i like it way better than
you know Emmet or like eMeter Zen coding
whatever I actually use Emmet for HTML
still but for CSS I mean hi yaku's is
where it's at so as always if you have
any questions please leave a comment the
video or hit us up at Facebook or
Twitter or on the level up Tut's forum
