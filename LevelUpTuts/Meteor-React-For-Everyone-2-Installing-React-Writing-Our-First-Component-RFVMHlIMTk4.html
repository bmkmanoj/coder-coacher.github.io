up tutorials and in this video we're
going to install react into our project
and write our very first component so
let's get going on that right now okay
so we now have an a meteor project going
it's essentially blank save for a body
tag in the HTML file and I've actually
opened up my chrome I have my council
open just so we can see errors or
anything pop-up when they come up well
let's go ahead and head to our command
line because what we need to do is first
add support for NPM now to get an NPM
support we don't need to do anything to
meteor really however we do want to
let's say open up a new tab I'm gonna
change make sure I'm in the correct
directory for our actual site here I'm
using so you want to change directories
into your site wherever it may be
located and from here we can run a
command NPM in it now if you've ever
done any node work before NPM and this
should be very familiar to you what it's
doing is essentially going to create a
package file for you so I hit NPM in it
it asks for a name I'm gonna say my
resolutions because this is going to
complain if we use a capital letter in
here
and I can just breeze through these by
hitting Enter we can always update this
stuff later so now if we breeze over to
our sublime text you'll see that it's
created a package.json file now like I
mentioned in the previous video this is
something that's exclusive to meteor 1.3
and higher so make sure you're on 1.3 if
you don't know how to get there check
out the previous video and make sure
that you are on 1.3 before proceeding or
else this following exercise isn't going
to work at all so now that we have a
package file let's go ahead and add
react we can do that simply by saying
npm install - - save space react
now what this save command is going to
do this flag here is essentially going
to save this dependency to our package
JSON file so you'll notice this file
change a little bit after we run this
command so let's go ahead and enter and
it's going to go ahead and grab
everything
okay as you can see it's grabbed
everything if we head back to our code
you can see that our package file now
includes a dependencies and has added
react version at the time of this video
it's 14.7 okay so we've also been given
a node modules folder that includes
react and all of its dependencies so we
should be good to go there so now that
we have react setup we have our packages
JSON we're ready to go let's actually
start creating our project now first
thing I'm gonna do I'm actually gonna
change is resolutions HTML I'm gonna
rename this to index.html for no reason
other than I like that and I always look
for index.html to be sort of the route
index file
okay so we have index dot HTML now let's
go ahead and make a new file at the base
of our project I'm going to right click
on my folder new file and this is going
to be app dot JSX now you might be
wondering why I have this capitalized
well you'll see in a bit it's sort of
standard to have your react components
capitalized and naming your files after
the react components is also a practice
you'll see quite frequently so we have
app capitalized dot JSX now JSX is the
language that react to uses to be able
to use XML inside of JavaScript so let's
go ahead and now that we have an app JSX
the first thing we need to do it's
something you've never been able to do
in meteor before we can say import react
from and then in string lower case react
so this is now going to bring in react
from the package react because of that
we now have access to this react
variable and you may be wondering well
in the older versions of meteor for your
to use a wrapper package which is sort
of no react existed well this is
actually how things are done more
commonly in sort of the real JavaScript
world where we're importing packages so
this is less like meteor and more like
everything else and it should make your
meteor sites feel a little bit more more
standardized but most importantly this
is so
that your file knows what it needs and
it doesn't actually just assume it needs
everything
so by importing react this now knows it
needs react and if we don't import react
your file is not going to assume that it
needs it so now we want to go ahead and
create our first component by saying
class app now app is the name of our
component and it's going to extends
react sorry that needs to be capitalized
dot component now component also needs
to be capitalized and we can have
brackets here now if you know anything
about react you could say hey we don't
need this part if we add something up
here don't worry about that yet I'm
gonna show it in another video I don't
want to sort of overload these concepts
so let's go ahead and now what every
single react component needs is a render
function which is going to be what's
actually output by that component so we
can say render and then the parentheses
and then curly brackets instead of here
we can return and then parentheses now
we need to return something otherwise we
get all the code that we were to put in
our render function just wouldn't get
output so we need return and we need
this render function now inside of here
let's actually have an h1 hello world
now if writing HTML or XML instead of
your JavaScript feels weird don't worry
it's gonna feel a lot more normal once
you get used to it and you're gonna
actually really end up liking it I was
definitely one of those people who
initially saw this index and was like oh
I don't know about that and then soon
was a convert actually after I actually
started using it so we now have hello
world instead of our return know one
thing you'll need to keep in mind is
that the return statement the code
that's directly inside of here always
needs to have a wrapper element for
instance we couldn't have this this
would give us an error but what we could
have is if we were to wrap this in a div
like so this is just fine so that's one
thing to consider when returning your
code if you don't want to see any errors
this works just fine right now as is
because the h1 is serving as the wrapper
now the reason for that has to do with
how this is converted to actual
JavaScript the details I'm not going to
go into in this video okay so we now
have a very first component app and if
we were to head to our page at this
point if you don't know anything about
react you might expect this to show up
somehow but obviously we're not telling
our application to use this component
all we're saying is that this component
exists so now at the bottom of this code
we're going to have an if and then we're
going to use meteor dot is client now if
you aren't familiar with meteor meteor
is client is going to make sure that
this code runs server side now code in
files like this in your root directory
can run server or client side so it's
important that you use this is client
for this next bit of code and in future
videos we're going to show you a way
around using if is client so now we're
gonna have brackets and instead of here
we're going to say meteor dot start up
start up is all lowercase and then we're
going to have a function
and brackets now what this is going to
do is run this code on startup and we
can say react dot render this is going
to render something now we have this new
app component that we just made and you
can use your app component by saying app
like an HTML element also at this point
keep in mind that this is have a forward
slash to close this element every
component that you use in JSX including
image tags needs this closing forward
slash or else it's going to complain
okay so now we can have a comma and this
is where we're gonna be passing it in
what element we want this to render into
on our actual page now to actually make
that happen let's come to index dot HTML
and add an ID on the body and we can say
render now ok render target and so
render target is where we're going to be
inserting this code so inside of here we
want to do a standard Java Script to get
element by so we can say document dot
get element by ID and we're passing in
simply just render target so we're
grabbing the render target and we're
rendering our app component inside of
that our application then looks at the
app component heads to the render
function and renders this hello world so
when I save this by the timely tab back
to our browser as you can see hello
world and that's part of the beauty of
meteor whenever you save the auto
refresh the pushing of new code into
your browser so we don't have to always
hit refresh all the time now you'll
notice we're getting two errors I would
not worry about these errors it's saying
rekt' dot
it's saying react out render is
deprecated and to use react dumb render
okay I did this because I didn't want to
have to bring in react Dom itself for
this example and after we bring in
routing this render issue is going to go
entirely in addition it says a warning
render rendering components directly
into document dau body is discouraged
yeah
okay again this error is also going to
go away once we start routing so you can
completely ignore these two warnings as
long as you see hello world up here
you're in good shape if not react is
really super good about giving errors
that make sense
now most of the time that's the case
sometimes you get an error that confuses
you but usually if you follow the error
you will find your answer so make sure
you have counsel open to track those
errors cool so we now have our very
first component and we're all ready to
start actually getting started using
meteor and react in the next video we're
going to be adding flow router and we're
gonna get some routing going using a new
package called react mounter instead of
react flow router or layouts or whatever
exists currently so keep watching in the
next video we're going to be dropping in
some routing and we're gonna create a
new page layout so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials if you
want to get these videos early before
they're released on youtube head to
store dot level up tutorials calm and
either purchase a series for download
with code examples or sign up to be a
LevelUp pro and have instant access to
streaming right now as always thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one
