covering a couple of things the first is
basically we're going to be covering
keybindings envious code and we're going
to be doing so through a practical
example for instance if you've used any
like really nearly any application on
OSX that has tabs you probably would
expect the behavior of command 1 to
change your tab to the first tab at
command 2 to the second you'll notice
it's not and vs code the only way to
change tabs like that is through option
through command alt and then the arrows
dang so how do we get normal sort of tab
functionality going in vs code what
we're going to do so with key bindings
so what better way to learn key bindings
than to do something super practical
like fix the tab handling which you'll
see there's like a thousand issues on
the github tracker for this application
so I feel like it's just be the default
but it I'm not the developer of this so
I can't make that call obviously so what
we're going to do is head to the code
then unto preferences and then keyboard
shortcuts now you'll notice here we have
all of our key bindings and we could
click the pencil here to edit them right
you could desire your key combination
escape to cancel and so we could come in
here and change our and change our key
bindings by hitting let's just say
command C obviously you do not want to
make currency something other than copy
because that would probably drive you
nuts but as you can see here it's really
nice and easy the interface is good I
mean it works you can search for key
bindings you can edit them easily enough
you can see what it is but let's say we
wanted to go ahead and give some more
advanced customizations and kind of come
in in here and having to edit each of
these so we want to click on this open
and edit key bindings JSON now let me
close our side editor here and as you
can see we have a giant array in the
left hand column where
basically we have let meet the Fox s is
way too huge on this but let me move
this over you can basically see what we
have here is let's zoom this out just so
you can sort of see the structure of
this we have inside of the array we have
an object that basically has a key as
well as a command and then a win now the
win is optional we won't even be using
that in our current version so you could
say in Zen mode or when editor has
selection blah blah blah we want these
things to be available all the time for
us now what key bindings are we going to
be using well you can actually this is a
document right this is a JSON document
so we could actually search for stuff
for instance if we wanted to search for
command like command + the number one
right you'll see that it's currently
accessing fold level 1 when editor and
text is in focus now all we're looking
for
shift command 1 here we go we have
command 1 just by itself without a win
so this is the blanket 1 and the action
is workbench action focused first editor
group now that's a bummer that's not
what we wanted us so let me just copy
this whole line here I'm going to copy
the entire one here and now if you're
not the type to get in and want to
change this stuff I will have what you
need to copy and paste into your key
bindings JSON I'll have that just
available for you ok
so let's move over key bindings of the
link to it in the comment by the way you
can see we have an array I'm gonna paste
this in here and there's all bunch of
extra space here you don't need that
extra space some people like to keep
things sort of organized that way
whatever get rid of the last comma well
nice thing is if you have linting on it
will it blend this file as well because
it's just a JSON file so now what I want
to do is I want to actually change the
command 1 functionality I no longer want
it to be a workbench action focus first
editor group
that's a long thing to say well we
actually want to change it to is a
property that's workbench action but
then instead of focus first editor group
we want the property to be open edit or
at and then index the number so open
edit or at index one okay and you can
find all of these properties in this
default key bindings now keep in mind I
found this just online as a snippet so
it's not like I knew this offhand or
something and you can save this now
thankfully my linter took care of some
stuff for me now let's actually move
this over I'm going to click over here
I'm going to click on just any one of my
files and now if I hit command one
you'll see it successfully jumped us to
AB dot test now when I hit command add
to it obviously does these sort of
default functionality which is jumping
over to the second group the good news
about this is that it's really super
easy to duplicate this we can hold shift
we can old option or alt they're the
same key and we can hit down now by
holding shift option alt whatever it
copies and moves aligned down the same
thing works with the up arrow it's a
super handy handy handy little keyboard
shortcut there and we have command to to
okay I'm going to do this okay let's
jump down we got number three keep in
mind we have to do this all the way to
nine although you probably don't if
you're watching this and you just want
to copy this from me then you don't have
to do this all the way to nine no biggie
okay boom okay I'm into these next few
off camera and then fade into it okay
just like that I have every single
command one through nine jumping to a
particular index here I left zero blank
because
I don't really want to go to 10th index
or something like that I don't even know
if you can to be totally honest but as
you can see we have command 1 through 9
we have index 1 through 9 hopefully I
didn't duplicate any of those and now if
you wanted to you could remap the
previous one the focus first editor
group to maybe let control +1 or
something like that in that case you
would just change the command to ctrl +
1 and then the command is whatever we
copied over originally I don't need to
do that because I honestly don't jump
between groups that often and actually
let's do that I take that back I'm
totally thinking I would actually do
that let me come in here and paste this
in and Boop move this over here so
instead of command + 1 we can have CTR L
plus 1 control 1 is now going to change
us from the second group to the first
focus group and we can do the same thing
with ctrl 2 we can change this to second
I don't know it's kind of interesting
that it's a second editor group but over
on the other one its index 1 like I feel
like maybe they could have done focus
editor group 1 you know that's just me
whatever okay now again we can change
control 3 to 3rd again should it just
use the number whatever okay ctrl + 3
now so this is the contents of this file
like I said I'm going to make this
available for you to just copy and paste
and turn your keybindings JSON important
information is that there are brackets
here so you need these array brackets
you need your JSON file to be valid and
this will work if it doesn't have these
things it will not work so make sure
it's totally valid and works so now we
have our key bindings I'm going to move
this over here so I can illustrate my
new control group and I can hit control
1 to hop back over to this group
controlled
to to hop back over to keybindings back
again we're going to command to command
three and then I just had five instead
of four or five whatever but as you can
see here these are now the default tab
functioning that you would typically
come to expect from an application on OS
X so not only did we explore custom key
bindings in vs code but we also made the
app a little bit handy or to use if you
are used to stuff like this cool so this
is deep so this is customizing key
bindings and OSX tab is in that vs code
I'm going to keep on coming out with
practical vs code tutorials here stuff
that you're going to want to do all the
time I was planning on recording a few
more today ran out of time
I was busy editing a podcast West boss
if you are familiar with the West boss
he and I are stirring a podcast called
syntax FM where we're going to be
covering tons of web development topics
the first three episodes are being
edited and should be out really really
soon so if you're a fan of mine or a fan
of West bosses or a fan of both of ours
you should enjoy this podcast it's going
to be a lot of fun and so far we've had
a great time recording it so head over
to syntax dot FM and maybe there will be
a website up by the time you're watching
this if not check back in a couple days
or follow us on twitter at syntax FM
we're going to be having a lot of great
content there also if you would like to
learn how to build native apps using
JavaScript head over to store level up
tutorials calm and purchase react native
for everyone you do not need to know
react you do not need to know react
native but I will teach you to make
native applications with react native
from scratch by the end of it you have
an actual APK and whatever the iOS
packaged file is that you could upload
directly to the App Store so head over
to store that level up tutorials calm
react native for everyone thanks so much
for watching and I'll see in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
