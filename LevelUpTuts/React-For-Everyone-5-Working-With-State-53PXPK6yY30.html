up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna continue talking about our react
basics by introducing another key
component into using react components
which is going to be state now in this
video we're going to show you how to set
the state for a given component how to
retrieve that state how to modify it
we're also going to be showing a very
basic and a very important life cycle
method that's going to be triggered once
our component has rendered so let's get
going on that right now okay so this is
one of two more videos before we start
getting into building sort of a
real-world application and this is just
going to round out sort of our
foundation so that once we get into
building we can concentrate more on what
we're building and less about maybe some
of the techniques right because now we
know that you can create new components
with this create class method inside of
here we can have props we can have
default props and we can render our
component right here now in this past
example we saw this return statement and
we passed in a greeting and that
greeting then returned a person's name
if that name exists now in this video
we're gonna be talking about state now
state is on a per component basis and
that state is within the component
itself so let's go ahead and actually
just show some basic stuff about scope
we're gonna be just setting and then
resetting sort of scope here so what we
can do that is inside of our create
component we're gonna do this inside of
our hello world component now we can set
this after our prop stuff right down
here we can simply just say get initial
state and this is in camel case like so
now we can simply just have a colon and
we can have a function and inside of
this function is going to just
essentially be an object that's being
returned so just like our get default
props we can just return and then have
some brackets here and we're just
returning simply an object this is an
object is going to each have a property
and a value so let's say for instance we
want
to have the value be equal to one okay
so this is just a basic initial state
and now we want to render that value
onto the screen and instead of our
return function I'm going to essentially
have double brackets here like so and
inside of these brackets I'm going to
say this dot state now we had this dot
props before now we have this dot state
and we want to return value so we can do
that simply with this dot state that
value like so now when we save this we
head back to our page we're going to get
an error I'm going to refresh it things
aren't gonna work now you might be
wondering why that is because it looks
like we had everything fine basically
the big problem is and it looks like I
made a mistake in addition to the one
that I meant to make so let's come back
up here we need a comma after this get
initial state like I said before this is
an object so this is an a property and
an object here and we need to have a
comma because render is also the next
property in this object okay now that
that is fixed we can come here and find
the error that I wanted you to find
basically it's having a problem here now
you might be wondering what the problem
is we did everything right well you
actually need to wrap your components in
another div at this point oh or just
some sort of wrapping character because
we're returning here if you're using JSX
you need to have at least something
wrapping around it so we can say div and
inside of this div we can just put our
stuff now this worked fine before
because we had an h1 and that was
wrapping all of the content however now
that we have this additional state here
we need something wrapping that like so
okay so now we should be able to refresh
and see this hello world and then we
have a one right here so we're now
setting the state now let's say we
wanted to actually get the current state
let's say we wanted to modify it and
have it read on the screen so right now
we have this hello world and then one
we're going to be using a new lifecycle
method that we haven't seen yet
we're gonna go over in much more detail
once we're actually building an
application but this is going to be the
component did mount now component did
mount is basically going to say well the
component mounted now we can do some
stuff now keep in mind that that is a
very sort of basic understanding of it
but really this is going to run once the
component has mounted so we can say
component did mount so keep in mind that
this is only going to run once so we
don't have to worry about this firing a
whole bunch of times it's only going to
run at the moment that the component
mounted okay so in component did mount
now we do have a function just like we
did before now let's go ahead and get
the state and let's modify the state so
to first modify the state we need to set
this that set state in camelcase and
this is a function that takes an object
and inside of this set state we're going
to want to pass in value spelled
correctly and we're gonna pass in a new
value so once this components mounting
it's resetting the state to value of 2
or refresh this you should see that
hello world is now set to 2 and we never
actually even see the one so when the
components mounting it's setting this to
2 but let's say we wanted to instead of
just saying this directly we wanted to
increment on the original value well we
can simply just call a state just like
we did down here and we can say this dot
state that value and we can say plus
let's say 19 so this should give us a
value of 20 because we have 1 plus 19
equals 20 there you can see we now have
hello world 20 so this dot set state is
going to allow you to reset your state
and this dot States dot value allows you
to get your value whether it's on the
template or in your JavaScript now
that's an important part to realize in
react is the stuff inside of these curly
brackets is just JavaScript since we're
inside of a script file the things that
are weird here are sort of the
HTML right the fact that we have HTML
but simply having brackets at all is
letting us use JavaScript for instance
this bracket and then outputting the
variable here is just outputting the
variable and that variable is just equal
to either world or another component now
inside of this this dot props that name
is just the JavaScript value for this
dot props that name along with this dad
state dot value so that's something too
important to recognize when writing this
code I know can sometimes seem abstract
you're just typing things if you don't
necessarily understand what why you're
doing it however it's important to know
that this that state value is just
outputting the value of this JavaScript
and you can of course use that up here
as well and all this stuff are just
functions inside of an object which is
this react that crate class hello world
okay so in the next video we are going
to create a click function and that's
going to allow us to actually increment
the state so as always this is Scott
with level up tutorials if you have any
questions or comments leave a comment
the video hit me up at Twitter or
Facebook a level up tutorials also next
level CSS animations and transitions is
now available for purchase at Stewart
out level up tutorials it's the first
premium tutorial series from level up
tutorials it's two hours and a little
bit more of animating with CSS it
teaches you how to make performative
animations how to make practical
animations and how to sort of replicate
some popular animations already it even
includes an easing file which contains
it some really basic easing that you can
drop into your CSS preprocessor or just
CSS in general along with code examples
and templates for each lesson so as
always this is Scott and thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
