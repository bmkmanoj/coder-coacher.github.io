up Tut's and today we're gonna be
talking more about the underscores
starter theme now you saw in the last
video we installed this theme we created
it using their generator and enabled it
and as you can see there's not a lot
here however there is more than meets
the eye for instance underscores has
included a little bit of JavaScript that
when your page is the right width it
hides your menu and in return gives you
a menu button
but you couldn't click to show and hide
your menu now what this is is really
just a shortcut because most responsive
sites need a way to show and hide the
navigation so this is really just taking
care of that for you and it's really you
know while it's super bare-bones and
doesn't look like anything like the rest
of the theme it's totally open to
customization and it really just
requires you to use CSS to create it now
we have our theme here and it looks
pretty similar to what we saw before we
have our our site title we have our
tagline we have our main menu and then
we have our posts now we also have these
widgets showing up and you might be
wondering well how are these widgets
showing up well it turns out that our
widget that we created in these videos
was named sidebar and of the widget they
include in this theme is also named
sidebar so these widgets just happened
to transfer over if we come here and
disable them they'll be gone however we
can throw something in here just so we
can have something in the sidebar and if
you'll notice the sidebar isn't on the
side that's because this theme assumes
nothing about your layout but if we
inspect this element and let's look down
here you'll see that we have our content
area then we have a primary content area
and then a secondary content area so if
we were to have the primary content area
let's say hey width of
70% and we want this to float right now
in our secondary we can say float:left
and with of 30% and you can see our
sidebar is going to tuck up in here like
you would expect a sidebar to likewise
you could have this flow right in the
other way and the node show up on the
right side but what's nice is basically
it gives you nice clean HTML that you
can absolutely customize and change with
your CSS and further HTML and PHP
customizations so let's take a look at
the files here to see what you actually
get sooner files here we have this Inc
folder and the Inc is basically just to
include some things that might help us
out like we have some custom template
tags of course these things are for the
more serious PHP developer if you are
using PHP then by all means
pause through these and see exactly what
they're doing we're not going to go over
them just quite yet next we have j/s
which gives us some custom JavaScript so
we had this navigation j/s and this is
basically what's showing and hiding our
menu that we saw using the width of the
web page to make a mobile type
navigation so it's basically just
handling the toggling cool so we also
have some this customizer theme
customizer makes for a better user
experience right so basically theme
customizer allows us to customize the
theme without actually writing any code
we can do that using the WordPress
interface using customize now we could
say background color be this color right
save and publish however I would
honestly totally recommend against this
especially if you're using a starter
theme to build your theme out-of-the-box
you know if you're using your theme to
like this then you might as well just
write your CSS now in the languages
folder we have at this languages this
word press dot P ot file and we're gonna
go over more about what exactly this is
doing but it's for translating your
website now we have our page templates
like you've seen before
so we have our 404 page which has
actually been customized to have a
search form let's you say that you know
hey there's there's nothing found on
this page it's actually a nice little
404 page likewise we have what you'd
expect from articles comment none page
this sort of stuff basically our
templates like you would see them
normally but what's really nice about
these templates is that they've been
crafted to use really nice semantic
html5 and I believe 2014 has nice html5
as well but you know who knows with some
WordPress themes what you're getting you
might be getting some old HTML or
something and what we see here is pretty
much what we'd expect to see within
these templates now if we come into our
functions that PHP you can scroll down
and there's going to be lots of comments
here so you can read about what these
are doing these functions right
but some things might look familiar
right like if we scroll down here you're
gonna see a register sidebar with the
name of sidebar and an action that hooks
into widgets in it so this is the type
of thing that we went over in the past
couple of videos how to write this
yourself and here you're seeing it in
action in a theme that we've just
downloaded so that's pretty cool
this is a great place to learn about
some things that you can do in these
functions files just to see what other
people are doing now you can see it's
adding these custom template tags and
it's grabbing some custom functions and
then grabbing the customizer stuff so
basically it's just making a nice little
additions adding our widget area and
basically setting up our site with a
menu
now the header file is going to be also
looking familiar and we have a under ink
we have a custom header dot PHP and it
says you can add the optional custom
header image to header dot PHP like so
so it's basically saying hey you can
grab this code right here and throw it
into your header dot PHP if you'd rather
use the header image instead of no
header image so that's nice that they
include that for you in case you wanted
to go that route so you don't have to
write that code yourself now everything
else should also look pretty standard
and we have a nice little readme that
basically just goes over some of their
features it tells me how to manually
create a theme in case you didn't use
their generator and let's just take a
look at the styles now the Styles the
style that CSS files is actually really
nice because what it does is it contains
just enough CSS for the site to not look
terrible but it doesn't contain too much
to where it's going to get in the way
another thing that I really like is that
it sets it up in a really nice structure
now I personally structure my CSS files
differently than this so I would change
some things however they certainly do a
nice job of organizing things by giving
it you know the correct theme settings
and and you have your description text
down here but they also have a table of
contents that shows you the different
sections of the CSS with proper headings
here so you can find things really
easily
now I also make a table of contents and
most of my CSS files and I would
recommend you do too as well for even
larger medium sites sometimes I don't
bother with really small projects but
most of the time anybody if anybody's
looking at your CSS afterwards the table
of contents is really helpful for them
to be able to know exactly where to find
things and it also makes things
searchable in case you wanted to find
navigation you could just command F and
search for 5.0 it's gonna take you
directly to the navigation
now you'll see here that we don't have a
ton of CSS but sometimes they just give
us classes right so if we want to style
specific things like the anchor tag and
the main navigation when you hover over
the classes were already here and you
just have to add in your CSS now this
might save you a little bit of time I
personally would probably just rather it
be blank
however if if you're the type that you
know you don't want to look that stuff
up then it's all here for you and it's
really nice because like I said there's
nothing really crazy here it's just some
basic CSS to make your stuff look a
little bit better and it also organizes
it so that you can just start adding
your code and having this document
structure already made for you now what
else do we have it was we have this
layouts folder and you'll see we have to
sample layouts content sidebar and
sidebar content and now these are just
two different sample layouts but you'll
see they're not really doing a whole lot
it's giving some margin floating and
giving a width and this one is likewise
doing something very similar now if you
want to use either of these themes I
mean one thing you could do is are these
layouts is you could copy this code
directly from this content sidebar look
at your CSS file find where we want
maybe maybe we can have it in in content
or we might maybe even make a new
section that says layouts or something
but let's look at ten point oh let's
find that
and since this is a I mean that guy says
it's technically a layout we're just
gonna post this here save this and now
let's refresh the front end of our site
and you'll see we do have a sidebar
layout already initialized so that way
we can just do more styling to take it
from there now I personally would write
my own and I would probably use a grid
framer or something to align these divs
to a grid however if you don't like
working with the layouts or anything
like that it's there for you just to
paste in okay so this is the basics of
underscores from here
all you really have to do is modify your
CSS and modify the PHP templates like we
showed in previous customizing videos
and you can be on your way to coding
your theme as always if you have any
