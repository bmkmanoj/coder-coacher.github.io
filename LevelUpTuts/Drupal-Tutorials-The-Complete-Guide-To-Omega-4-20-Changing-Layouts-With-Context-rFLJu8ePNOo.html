tuts and in this video we're going to
contextually change our layouts and
that's really exciting because we can
make a whole bunch of different layouts
and apply them various different ways
using context now you need this module
for this to work and this particular
module is context omega so in the past
there have been other omega solutions
for context such as Delta before in the
past this is a way different approach
and it's way more simple so the module
is drupal.org / project / context
underscore omega so it's on this context
underscore mega well that we can used
rush to install this so we might as well
let's go ahead and I'm gonna
CD into my directory where we have our
project which is in my sights and bubble
up and then Drupal okay okay so I'm in
the site now I can type drush dl and
then context underscore omega just like
that okay looks like it was downloaded
now we can say drush and hyphen why
context underscore omega great cool so
we now have this module enabled and it
looks like it's requiring ctools so it's
now downloading and installing see tools
and that's the best part about rush
because otherwise if we were to done
this without drush we would i had to go
get all of those modules but now i can
type in two commands and it downloads
CTools all of these modules and enables
them for us that's the best part about
drush cool okay so let's get out of here
and we'll just refresh this modules page
make sure that they're in fact working
let's go ahead and search for context
mega okay and so we have context omega
but actually do we have context and saw
GUI we're going to need context as well
it looks like we have context it must
have pulled that in there from drush but
we want the UI installed and let's do
context layouts as well so we have
context omega context layouts context
you I and context perfect and if course
if you're doing this without drush you
would need the modules that you saw that
of course you would need to have for
context to work in the first place like
see tools and stuff but of course you'd
be getting those notifications when you
try to install context in the first
place so let's go ahead and add a new
context the thing we want to think about
here is that we are using the interior
layout for most of the site in fact it's
only the homepage that we're having the
homepage layout for
so let's go to our settings and let's
change our sidebar to be the default
layout because this is going to be the
layout that's used most often now it's
really easy to key off of the front page
in Drupal so we have the front page here
you can see it's getting this sidebar
you can tell just by having the sidebar
there at all and the easy way to do that
so we're going to go to structure and
then context and let's add a new context
and the name is just going to be front
and tag it to be front whatever
description changes layouts to home page
well it'll just be home because we don't
have a home page okay change the layout
home on front page now we want to add a
condition and since this is the front
page this is really easy we can key off
of the path and we can just say the same
way that we would say in blocks in uh in
brackets here we can just say front so
now sins going to say if it's on the
front page do something keep in mind if
you look at these other conditions you
can cue off of all sorts of things like
node type taxonomy pretty much anything
user role user page you can give all
sorts of different types of layouts
based on user role and stuff like that
that's how awesome this is so now we can
come to reactions here because we have a
condition and the first one you see is
blocks and Omega now typically this
would just be a way for adding blocks
but they've inserted at the top here
choose Omega layout now if we come down
to here we can just simply say home so
now on the front page we're going to be
using the home layout let's click Save
okay and let's go to our homepage we're
refresh and we're now seeing that we're
in fact on the homepage we can verify
that by let's actually modify this home
tpo to say home in big letters and now
refresh and it says home in big letters
up top here if we went to our other
piece of content wherever that is let's
go to test page one we're not going to
see that home and we're seeing this two
column layout so now the home page has a
one column layout in fact let's make
that even more obvious I don't want this
no actually this this is bothering me
the colors bothering me so let me just
say body background and let's make this
I don't know we can make this the level
of Tut's purple and that way it's not so
hideous they're cool and let's give the
main column something so we can see that
it is in fact one column here let's go
to not L page we want L main and we can
say hell main let's go to home level
level / level hyphen home that way I've
done scss L main we're going to make
this background white we're going to
save it and we're going to actually just
make this we're going to give it a
height of let's just say 300 pixels I
don't know minimum height of 300 pixels
there's no content in it yet so we can
say they know no height of 300 pixels
and actually I think we still need to
define this level hyphen home in our
theme info file like we did before if I
am correct yep and so we still have this
lab Styles here to edit paste in there
and we just change this to home and
let's just change this to home as well
and under layout we want to say of
course to zany hum layout so layout home
is using layouts in home level home and
now let's clear the cache we're going to
do to dress this time what's going on
fine terminal here let me just say CC
all enter it's going to clear the cache
easy refresh okay so now this is
obviously our homepage because we have
our white background here and again if
we go to our test page we have our two
column layout home page two column
layout so these are layouts with Omega
so now you should have a good
understanding about how you can create
your own layouts you can start building
at your CSS you can make them portable
you can change between them based on
context you should be able to do a whole
lot in fact everything that I've shown
here is what i have used to make the
current level of touch site this site
was built in omega for this is a home
page one column layout as you can see
here and then the inside pages is a two
column layout using context and Omega
cool so as always this is scott with
love love Hut's if you have any
questions or comments leave become of
the video or hear stuff at Twitter level
of Tut's let us know what you think you
would love to hear from you thanks but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
