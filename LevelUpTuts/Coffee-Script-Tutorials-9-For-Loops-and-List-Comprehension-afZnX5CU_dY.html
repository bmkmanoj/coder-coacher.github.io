up Tut's and today we're gonna be
talking about for in loops with
CoffeeScript and this is really cool
Ivan personally really like this a lot
it's sort of like how you speak almost
and it's very nice and clean so what
we're going to do is we're going to
iterate over this list type here so we
have or this array called type that we
have and it's just going to print out
all of these so what we're gonna do is
we're going to declare a variable that
it's going to assign each of these two
and then it's going to print that out so
each time that loops around it I'll sign
it to the active variable turns out that
active variable and then change that for
the next one in the list so to do that
we say four and then this is where you
pick up your new variable or whatever
you want to call it so for item in type
and then now we hit enter and right here
on the second line we say what we want
to do to each item in type so if you
remember from what I just said
item the first time is going to be
rights the second time crab and the
third time cucumber so if we want to
just say alert item it's going to alert
rice then the crab they then cucumber so
let's save this and see what javascript
outputs so it's creating a for loop here
so it says for I is equal to zero and
Len is equal to type dot length so as
long as I is less than the length it's
going to iterate through this and here
it's going to set item is equal to type
underscore I so the first time it's
going to be zero and then one and then
two it's gonna alert that item so rice
crabbing cucumber exactly how you expect
a for loop to act so what's really cool
about this is it so easy I mean this is
so short to write that and if you wanted
to write this in a different way we can
actually copy this or just cut this out
here alert item so we can alert item for
item in type so this is called a list
comprehension what you're doing is
you're going through this list and
you're signing item just the exact same
way we were doing before if we save this
and we look at our Java Script
you'll notice nothing has changed so in
reading this as a sentence almost sounds
like something you would even say so
we're an alert item for item in type
well that's awesome if we wanted to add
some sort of filter to this let's say we
want to alert all of them except for
rice we want to say alert item from our
item in type and then you can use win
and then item isn't and then whatever
you don't want it to equal to we'll save
rice so now it's going to go through
this list and it's going to alert the
item crab and cucumber because it's
going to be checking to make sure that
the item is not rice so of course if it
is rice it will not alert it so let's
say that the Java Script of this outputs
here so it's the same for loop that we
had before but the only difference is
it's wrapping the alert and it if item
is not equal to rice then alert it so
this is great I mean just reading this
here it's pretty complex for what it's
doing and this is really simple okay so
let's do a little bit more let's modify
these items in this array okay so now
we're going to say instead of a learning
item we're going to do quote and we'll
put quotes around the item here and
they're going to do a string
interpolation will do pound and then
bracket so what we're gonna do is we're
just gonna add an S so we're gonna say
crabs cucumbers and that's going to
change this array for anything that's
not rice so let's save this let's see
what it does so now it's concatenating
an S onto the end of this item string so
it's gonna find this it's going to make
sure it's not rice and it's going to
output crabs and then it's going to go
through again and output cucumbers if
you wanted to completely replace the
current array that you have all you have
to do is do type whatever your current
array is named and then you just do
equals and then you're going to wrap
your for statement in parenthesis what
the for statement does is it actually it
makes sure that the for statement runs
first and then assigns it to the array
and
instead of just running the for-loop
once and then setting that first value
to type running against something net to
type and then running a third and then
just keep overriding itself every time
so if you do this you're for your for
loop will run before and then just save
that array to the array name okay
so let's save that out and we can just
look at it down here and you can see
it's pretty complex now but we haven't
really done very much so it's going to
go through here it's going to run this
for loop it's going to set the item is
equal to this if and it's going to push
this item on to your array well that's
great this is just really awesome stuff
that this you know what is this ten
lines here and you wrote this in one
line you could even do something like
when item is rice so that's really great
you can just basically see how this is
such like a sentence for item in type
when item is rice okay so now it's only
gonna output Rice's because we have this
s here or whatever okay so let's say we
wanted to have a new array and it's
gonna have both of these that crab and
cucumber
they aren't rice so we want both of
those two things and we want those in a
new array let's just say we wanted to do
type two and this is going to equal this
is going to equal a for loop or a list
comprehension so in parentheses we just
have to say item for item in type when
item isn't and then in quotes rice okay
so this is going to iterate through this
for loop and when the item isn't rice
it's going to add it to a new array
called
type two we say this we can look at the
JavaScript and scroll down here and you
can see it's pushing it in whenever it's
not rice it's pushing in our item which
is set to whatever it's iterating
through at that time okay so this is
list comprehension if you have any
questions or comments please leave a
comment in the video we're going to go
into some really
cool stuff for the next couple lessons
uh I you know just I think we're going
to just flats in the next one finally
and I'll show you what that does and how
they're useful in your list and this
comprehension okay so once again this is
Scott with level up Tut's and thanks for
watching
