up tutorials and in this video we're
gonna be talking all about menus I'm
gonna show you how you can manage your
menus what they are where they are and
how you can get to them to easily change
or modify them so we've talked about
menus a little bit but in this video we
can go a bit more in depth about what
we're actually looking at when we're
looking at a menu so as you can see we
have a menu already we have this home
and about us you can see here that when
we hover over this we do get this pencil
that gives us the option to not only
configure the block but also edit the
menu we also see the same sort of thing
at this top navigation here you'll see
the same sort of thing in this bottom
footer navigation here edit menu so as
you can see menus exist all over the
site and if we come into structure in
our sidebar we can get to all of our
menu simply by just clicking menus here
now from here you can see that we can
add new menus we can look at the current
ones notice how we have the
administrative menu the footer menu the
main navigation menu the Tools menu and
the user accounts menu now let's look at
the main navigation we can get there by
coming to this edit menu you'll notice
we also have an add link here so we can
add a link directly to this menu without
having to go and edit if you wanted to
go ahead and add another link let's go
ahead and click Edit menu now from here
you'll see both of our two links we have
home and about us if you remember who
you'll see in the footer we also have
contact which is a page that exists
already for us including a feedback form
now let's say we wanted to add a contact
to the menu here you'll notice that the
path URL is just slash contact I'm gonna
copy this just the forward slash nod and
from here I'm going to click add link
now the link title can be anything you
want it can be contact us if you'd like
and you'll notice it's asking us to
enter the path such as node slash add or
external you also see this little circle
right here in the far right when you
select this what this means is that when
we hit forward slash
and you'll see after putting in contact
this link is going to go to the contact
page now what's interesting here is we
can have items in the menu that maybe we
don't want in the menu right now let's
say we want to build this out and have
contact in the menu but just not quite
yet you can uncheck the enable box and
it'll keep the item in the menu for you
but the users won't see it now the
description is something that it shows
when you hover over the menu link we can
just say contact us now this isn't
really something that's super important
and we also have show as expanded and
that's if there is children of this
particular menu item in the next video
when we create our own menu create a new
menu just for the fun of it we're going
to be diving into children and things
like that now you'll notice that the
parent link is the main navigation so
it's not going to be a child of anything
it's going to just be in the main
navigation and the weight is the
position that's going to have in the
menu now you can think of weight like we
described before as and the larger the
number something is the heavier it is
the heavier it is the more it sinks so
if you have a zero it's going to be
light obviously a negative number would
be lighter I typically like to keep
everything at zero and use zero as the
highest that way it doesn't get
confusing and then one would be
obviously heavier too heavy or three
heavier and for heavier than that since
I almost always want contact to be at
the end of the menu I can assign this a
weight of ten and I can be assured
essentially that if I create any new
items into this menu contact us we'll
always be at the bottom now simply by
adding that our menu has been saved
you'll notice we can also drag around
these to change the weight if you'd like
and after you do so you'd want to click
Save let's head back to the front of our
site and click on level up you'll now
see we have home about us and now
contact us we can click contact us and
you can see it correctly takes us to the
right page so we've now modified this
menu by adding a new item to the menu so
you should now be able to come in and my
by any of the menus that are in the site
in the next video we're going to create
a menu from scratch and then the video
after that we're gonna show you how you
can place it anywhere on your site using
a menu block so as always this is Scott
