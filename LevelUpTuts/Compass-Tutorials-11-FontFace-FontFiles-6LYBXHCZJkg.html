up Hut's and today I'm gonna show you
how to do quick and easy at font face
declarations using compass and a helper
called font files so to get started here
I just wanted to quick show the original
app font face code as you can see it's
not a whole ton of code but every single
format that you have you have to specify
the URL of the font and then the format
for every single one which is you know
pretty cool whatever it works and it's
fine encompass doesn't really save you
that much time but it saves you enough
where it's worth it so to give you a
quick example about how to use font face
here what I've done is I have a fonts
folder and it actually just has this
chunk 5 and it has 4 different versions
of it and so I'm gonna throw that in my
style sheets because that's where
compass is gonna be looking for it so
I'm gonna keep it here if you want to
change the config RB file you can go on
compasses website and see exactly what
the reference for that is and that you
can actually specify where your fonts
file is personally I don't mind having
my fonts here in my style sheets so I'm
just gonna leave it as it is so I'll
leave this open here so I can grab these
font titles in a second so what we're
gonna do
let's delete this real quick is we're
going to use a mixin called font face
and that mixin is going to be using a
helper called font files to grab your
font files when all you basically have
to do is include the font title and it's
going to auto generate the path for you
so you might be familiar with helpers we
used helpers when we were making sprites
so far so when we did our sprite work in
one of the previous tutorials that was a
helper we'll get into more helpers in
future tutorials but for right now you
know you just have to know that they
exist you can check out the
documentation to read a little bit more
so let's get started by the same way we
add any mixin we're just going to do add
include and then we're going to font -
face and then in parentheses and then in
quotes we're going to
of the title that we're going to use
throughout our CSS as you can see I've
already written this font family chunk 5
in here because that's the font we're
using so our font file a front face
title is going to be chunk 5 and then
here you're just gonna say comma and
then we're going to use our helper
so it's font files and then parentheses
again and here's where you're going to
want to specify the path to your files
if these files are in your fonts folder
where your config RB is specified then
you don't have to put anything but let's
say inside of our style sheets we had
another folder you would have to say
like ok here's a good example let's say
if we had a file folder and then the
fonts' were living in here you would say
file - and then your font title but
since ours are just in the fonts folder
we're not gonna do that
pull that out delete this ok so I'm
actually just gonna copy some of these
titles here cuz I don't want to type all
these up leave this right here so this
is where you put your font files so we
need to wrap this in quotes and then the
title of our font file and then we're
going to do a comma and then the same
thing for the next one this one is a
WOFF and then inside of this parentheses
again comma quotes paste and we have an
SVG and then comma quotes paste and e OT
ok so now if we save this it's going to
write all our format code for us it's
gonna add the path to this file let's
check this out
ok now let's look at our CSS actually it
looks like there's a problem and valid
CSS okay maybe I might have had an extra
quote or something let's check this out
so we have quotes comma quotes got my
quotes comma quotes
oh we needed a semicolon at the end here
my bad there okay let's say the
okay now let's look at our CSS okay no
problems as you can see we have our font
family and then the source path is the
URL it's style sheets fonts and then our
web font which is exactly where it is
and then use as you can see it fills in
the format for us yeah everything so it
actually writes us this format code it
brings in the path URLs and if you
wanted to change it of course you could
change it later and then can change it
in your config RB let's say if you move
it so that's really great because then
you wouldn't have to go through and edit
all these paths every single time you
know if you changed it and I'm gonna
guess that's four paths that you don't
have to update so here's our font face
it's finding everything so now the body
has a font family of chunk five I'm just
gonna say this once again for good
measure and then actually it's exa this
let's refresh the page as you can see
all of our text is now chunk five and
it's looking awesome uh-huh yeah so as
you can see this font face works really
well it saves you a little bit of typing
and it's you know it's pretty painless
all you have to have is the font file
names and know where compass is going to
be looking for them so that's compasses
ad font face mixin using the font files
