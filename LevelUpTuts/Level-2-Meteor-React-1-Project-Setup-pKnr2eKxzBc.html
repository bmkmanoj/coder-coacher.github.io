up tutorials and in this video we're
going to basically get started with our
new series we're gonna grab our code
which is actually the code that you left
off with from the meteor 1.4 in react
series however if you did not do that
series you can just download that code
simply off of github and get started
from there so you do not have to
complete the other series to get started
with this one however if you want a nice
framework as to how we got to where we
are it's a great place to start so fire
it up
download this code and get ready because
we're about to build a next generation
real-time web app with meteor and react
okay so in this series we're going to be
covering a lot of the concepts that make
react and the media are a little bit
more viable as a large platform for
building larger sites I mean really in
the basic series we built a cool little
app but you know there's a lot of
potential for it that's not necessarily
realized yet so in this series we're
going to be taking that code and don't
worry if you didn't work on that series
we have the code right here for you
we're gonna be taking that code and
basically expanding on it in all sorts
of ways with both add techniques that
are going to make the application better
for your users but also techniques that
are gonna make it more viable to scale
for you to scale upward in terms of
components or or just making things a
little bit less likely to break at some
point and all of these skills in this
series are gonna be entirely necessary
for getting them better at both meteor
and react so to get started what we want
to do is we want to head to this repo
I'll make this link available to you but
really we just need to clone if you are
not familiar or not download with github
or you don't know essentially what to do
with this you can always click the
download zip and you'll have a folder
however I'm going to be using the clone
method so I'm going to copy this link
and I'm going to go in my directory
where I keep my websites and I'm going
to say git clone and then I'm going to
paste in the repository okay so you can
now see we should have this if I change
directories into
intermediate - meteor okay all this big
long path name
you brought change this cuz this is kind
of obnoxiously lung but for right now it
doesn't really matter okay so here we
are inside of our project and we're
gonna get our app started and we're
going to simply just say meteor now
check this out we could just hit enter
here and this is going to be fine but
here's a quick little easy tip if we
wanted to have multiple meteor sites
running at once
you'll notice I'll try to run on port
3000 so if you ever need to run multiple
sites you can always do - - we'll save
port - - port space and then the port
number we were to put 3200 in here enter
you can see it's gonna start up and it's
going to grab everything but the site
will be available at 32 let me once this
starts up and you can see we're getting
some crashes and you might already know
exactly why these crashes are well these
crashes aren't because of the port
basically we're not using our NPM
packages so we pulled all this stuff
down but what we don't have is we don't
have any of our NPM stuff installed so
in a new tab I'm using high term I just
hit command-d if you're using anything
else just make sure you're within the
same directory that you were and we can
type in NPM install
now in a later video I'm gonna be
showing you how we can use Facebook's a
new package manager called yarn and
there are some little benefits to using
yarn but essentially it's the same as
NPM okay so as you can see after running
our npm install we should have our up at
localhost port 3000 and 200 right now
give this page of refresh and here is
our app nice and perfect
you'll notice that we no longer have any
database items right we no longer have
anything if you're coming from your
previous version of this series you
should have all of your voting items in
here still because this is a new install
entirely we don't have that but if you
also remember we need to actually log in
before we can anything so I'm gonna
click create an account now I'm going to
just simply add we can have coffee verse
tea there we go cool so we're in line
here to be ready to go I'm actually
going to stop this server really quick
and fire it up again at port 3000
actually take that back we're just going
to say meteor kind of type it correctly
meteor with no ports just so it's not
confusing and let's come back here
will change this port to 3000 otherwise
once this is all up which it should take
a second should be the exact same place
we were in okay so like I said we now
have a project up and running we have
some voting options in here if you're
not familiar with this application
because you did not take the previous
series we basically have two text boxes
that say two items we can add the items
and this is all once but when we're
logged in that is and basically we can
vote on them
so if I click T it's gonna apparently I
logged out when I changed the port let
me resize in okay so now that I'm signed
in we can essentially click one of these
items in boom I'm voting quote so we
nice had this nice little voting app if
we were to have more items let's go
ahead and say
mints verse gum you'll see that it only
gives us one at a time so we can say
vote for mints now we get a vote for tea
now we get a vote for gum you can see
how this application is set up I would
definitely recommend pawing through the
code if you haven't taken the previous
course it should be pretty
straightforward though so this is our
project we are ready to go in the next
video we're going to actually get
started with routing we're going to
install react router create a layout and
then we're actually going to start
routing between things so it's going to
be really really cool
reactor route or something you're gonna
want to definitely use if you're using
reactant meteor so as always this is
Scott with level up tutorials thanks so
much for watching if you want to get
access to this entire series right now
head over to store that level up
tutorials comm and purchase this entire
series or subscribe to level up
tutorials you'll get access to this
entire series and I'll even have some
bundle deals with this and other meteor
series so check it out thanks so much
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
