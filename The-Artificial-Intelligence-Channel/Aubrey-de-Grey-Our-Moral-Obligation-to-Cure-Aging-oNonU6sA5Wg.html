visit us online at y radio show org hi
I'm Jack Russell Weinstein host of why
philosophical discussions about everyday
life on today's episode we are asking
are buried agree whether aging is a
disease that could be cured while it may
sound like an odd question what would
happen if we were to consider aging as
an illness instead of a fact of life
what if we regard it not just as a
conglomeration of sicknesses like cancer
Alzheimer's disease or arthritis but an
illness in itself what if we ask whether
we can make our bodies younger again is
this craziness or would it be worthwhile
this idea has its precedence humans have
been socially constructing sickness ever
since we developed the concept of normal
homosexuality was once considered
diseased but now it isn't addiction on
the other hand was regarded as weakness
of will but it is now thought of as an
illness with neurological components in
short what we call healthy is really a
set of expectations about how much we
weigh how far we can walk and which food
we can digest there are two advantages
that come from pathologizing aging the
first is that it becomes a potentially
solvable problem we generally regard
getting older as a simple indisputable
fact of life it is the precursor to
death after all the partner of taxes the
other human certainty by making aging
into a problem we give ourselves
permission to think about it
intellectually to talk to others about
it without having to undermine our own
interest and to devote resources to its
cure philosophy is often attacked for
creating problems where they are none
but identifying new controversies is
essential to progress you can't solve a
problem if you don't know it's there the
German philosopher Martin Heidegger
famously called humanity the being unto
death he argued that what makes us
unique is that we are the only animals
that know we die and that this
pending death gives our life meaning but
what if instead of seeing death as an
unavoidable ending he saw it as a human
challenge something to overcome how
would his understanding of human beings
change if he defined us in terms of our
possibilities rather than our
limitations I bring this up because
Heidegger was certainly on to something
death does define a great deal about how
we see ourselves parents work very hard
to teach their kids to be independent
they can manage once their parents are
gone the ideal marriage lasts until one
of the couple dies people scrimp and
save to retire they can spend a few
decades free of work responsibilities
what would family life look like if your
child always expected you to be by their
side would people still marry if they
were expected to be gather for 5,000
years instead of 50 what happens to the
idea of retirement if people are
able-bodied enough to work well forever
the latter the work thing is pretty
horrifying thought even for me and I
like my job
aging is so intertwined in the human
experience that if we cured it we would
have to rethink everything else we'd
have to restructure the way we work play
love and lament maybe then the refusal
to think about aging as an illness to be
cured is not a lack of imagination but a
fear of no longer living a life that is
comprehensible to us but if this is the
objection we need to remember that our
own lives would be largely
incomprehensible to Thomas Jefferson to
William Shakespeare to Joan of Arc in
fact most of my own life was
incomprehensible to my own grandmother
and she was only 99 when she died not
990 this doesn't mean she couldn't have
learned the things she needed to it just
means she didn't have the time the other
advantage of thinking about aging as an
illness is that it shifts getting older
from being a literary concern the
purview of poets and novelists to one of
science the medical industry has long
seen itself as managing aging it is
focused on figuring out how to make
getting older more pleasant or making
dying less traumatic for morphine to
hospice medical science has advanced
palliative care immeasurably but it
considers immortality anons
starter the same non-starter I suspect
that people thought going to the moon
was or curing polio or cloning those two
required an optimistic view of human
capabilities and a faith in human
knowledge what do we have to lose other
than death
today's guest approaches the question of
our aging from both the philosophical
and the scientific perspective he sees
it as both a problem to solve and a
perspective to overcome this makes him a
compelling advocate for a project that
almost nobody believes will work it
makes the search for the cure for aging
possibly the most important underdog
story that was ever written if aging is
an illness it can be cured and it can be
cured well let's find out what's next
and now our guests are buried a grey is
a biomedical gerontologist and the chief
science officer for the Sens foundation
in Mountain View California he's the
author of ending aging the rejuvenation
breakthroughs that could reverse human
aging in our lifetime Aubrey welcome to

won't be taking any questions but if

so I had a lot of questions Aubrey that
I wanted to start with including some
that I ran by you when we contacted each
other over email but as I was driving
here I I wanted to ask what amounts to I
think the first question that comes to
mind in people's as people think about
immortality and and I want to do it by
channeling my best friend's mother who
was born and raised in the Bronx what
are you crazy
is this just insanity are you taking the
the greatest fantasy of human beings and
taking it seriously in a way that nobody
ever actually wanted you to do whether
I'm crazy I guess my first response my
first answer is to come back with
another question which is do you mean am
I crazy too
view aging as a potentially solvable
problem or these mean am I crazy to
think that it would be a good idea to
bring aging under medical control now I
think from the elaboration that you gave
there your main thinking is the first of
those am I crazy to think that aging
could in principle be brought under
medical control and you know it's a
reasonable question because of course
first of all people have been claiming
since pretty much the dawn of
civilization that aging already could be
brought under medical control by some
kind of magic bullet some kind of
Fountain of Youth and secondly because
you know at the moment there are not
very many experts like myself coming out
there and saying that yes this is within
striking distance however the first
thing I want to point out is that the
number of experts who are saying things
that sounds suspiciously similar to what
I've been saying for the past 15 years
is growing you know people are beginning
to say yeah well you know there is a lot
of progress and we do understand the
nature of the problem pretty well now
and yeah well you know I mean we're
gonna carry on making progress and
eventually you know aging is a very very
difficult problem but it's only finitely
difficult eventually we're gonna get
there
not very many experts are willing to
talk in terms of any kind of timeframes
yet and I think that's a big problem I
think that's a failure of responsibility
on the part on the part of most of my
colleagues because I feel that unless we
do stalk about timeframes albeit of
course definitely very much hedged but I
am phasis about the speculative nature
of those predictions you know other
people are going to say well yes it will
happen a thousand years from now it's
not a problem for me today and that will
slow down
but no so I think that you know it's
reasonable to wonder whether I'm crazy
but to actually onto the question one
has to look at the details of not only
what I'm saying but of how what I'm
saying is being received by other
experts and then one comes to the answer
you know it's it's interesting because
you are featured in a documentary called
the immortal lists and then about six
months ago I think there was an article
about this aging research in The New
York Times Magazine and and a lot of the
media coverage of you focuses on and and
and the people you're working with focus
on the psychological motivations you
know why does the person do this you
know what is the secret that they are
trying to you know overcome how are they
eccentric or or and and and it seems
that these are just ad hominem attacks
against the against the project that
that very few people are really taking
you on you at your word as a member of
good faith and let's talk about the
science let's talk about the philosophy
do you find that do you find that the
debates are as much about you and and
and and discrediting the the you as an
agent as opposed to handling the project
in itself and dealing with the project
on its own terms
there is a lot of that there's a lot of
looking at motivations looking at
credibility looking at you know as you
say at hominem aspects of the question
and I think you know it's important to
point out that these things are
happening and that the real meat of the
question is often ignored but actually
at the same time I have some degree of
well it's not sympathy at least
comprehension of where that's all coming
from the fact is that nobody really
wants to get their hopes up on all of
this
there is a huge terror of age
that pervade pretty much all of us of
not necessarily even of death but of the
suffering that precedes death from aging
and that is a huge psychological
challenge for anybody it's something
that most people can't stomach and
instead they only they have to find some
way to put it out of their minds and the
best way to do that is when they
encounter someone like myself who we've
actually bring this to the fore they
have have on the one hand a great deal
of fascination and interested in
understanding the plausibility of what
I'm saying but on the other hand they
also have a compulsion to maintain some
kind of if you like emotional distance
from the question from the issue and the
best way to do that it is to put
themselves in a position of some kind of
ambivalence with regard to the
credibility of the messenger what was
the point in your research what happened
when you moved away from just this is
something that you're interested in -
this is something that I can do was
there
discovery and innovation a conceptual
shift that allowed you to say hold on a
second this is real um not really
the way worked for me was actually that
I started out from I know my earliest
years knowing perfectly well that in
principle aging was a medical problem
that could be solved that eventually we
would bring aging under justice the same
degree of medical control that we
already have the most infectious
diseases the thing that I didn't know
was that most other people didn't think
that way it was such an obvious fact to
me that I had never I never did the
experiment of raising the topic with
other people and thereby discovering you
know that they thought differently they
thought that aging was some kind of
inevitable fact of life it was only
after I met and married a biologist who
was what older than me and already a
senior professor at UC San Diego
though I discovered that no she was
actually not very interested in aging
thought it wasn't very important and
then I discovered that other biologists
thought the same and then I discovered
the people in general thought the same
and I was completely horrified by this I
had gone through until my late twenties
just not knowing that fact so that
basically made me feel that I had to
switch fields now in terms of your
question really when I switched field it
wasn't a case of knowing that I could do
something
it was the case of knowing that I need
to try to do something having been for
several years by that time a researcher
in a completely different field in
artificial intelligence I knew on the
one hand that I was pretty damn good at
working on very hard problems because I
had been quite successful in my
artificial intelligence research but I
also knew that by definition very hard
problems the ones that you might or
might not succeed in solving or someone
else might succeed or whatever I just
knew that by switching fields by
becoming a researcher in this area I
would have some chance of making a
contribution and therefore I would
improve the the expected time that it
would take to actually for the humanity
in general to actually achieve a
solution to this problem I didn't know
how important my own contribution was
gonna be but I didn't need to know I
just need to know that I had some
significant probability of making some
significant contribution so I'm
interested I brought up a lot of ideas
about death in the way the death figures
into human understanding and and and
literature and things like that but
aging and death are not the same thing
so I how do you conceptualize aging when
you imagine yourself stopping aging is
it just putting aside diseases people
are no longer being a cancer people are
no longer gonna get Alzheimer's disease
or do you really see the body not
getting older I really see the body not
getting older I see the body as a
machine a really really really
complicated machine whose detailed
construction and mechanics we are still
very very poorly knowledgeable of
but nevertheless a machine and therefore
an entity that is whose function is
defined by its structure therefore I
understand that if we can engage in
comprehensive preventative maintenance
every so often just as we would for a
car or an airplane or whatever then we
can preserve and maintain the function
of the body both mental and physical of
course as long as we like you know so I
was concerned that it's a perfectly
perfectly valid to look at vintage cars
for example these are cars that are more
than 100 years old they were absolutely
never designed to last that long they
were designed to last maybe 10 or 15
years and yet by virtue of comprehensive
preventative maintenance here they are
working just as well as when they were
built that is the goal so is the process
to prevent the younger from getting
older or do you think that the
discoveries that you make will also help
the already older get younger there's an
interesting section of the the
documentary where you are in an aging
clinic and you compared your
chronological life with your biological
life and this is something I know that
on the Internet I've done and other
people have done can you make people
younger and if so what do you mean by
that
absolutely the idea is to make older
people younger again as well as to stop
younger people from getting older in the
first place it's really again just the
same as it is for a simple man-made
machine like a car you can take a car
that's got a lot of rust and you can
remove the rust and you can generally
put it back into better condition better
function than it was before you started
the process so yes absolutely it's the
process of rejuvenation that we're
talking about now that actually if you
think about it makes makes the problem
easier than it would be if we were
talking about stopping the process from
happening we're not talking about
altering the way that the body works in
such a manner as to stop it from
damaging itself by the side effect of
its normal operation instead what we're
talking about is letting that damage be
created either side of
active the body's normal operation but
then periodically eliminating damage so
that the overall load of damage does not
increase long-term and in particular so
that that load is maintained at a level
that is tolerable by the body the body
is set up to tolerate a certain amount
of damage and all we need to do is keep
the overall amount of damage below that
level in a in a little bit after the
break I'll ask you to talk a little bit
about the genetics involved and and the
way that you're actually trying to solve
the problem but before that I want to
talk about a concept that you yourself
bring up and that is the notion of
ageism I want to ask you sort of in
advance what is the ideal age what do
you think what age do you think people
should remain at biologically or
physiologically to have a good life but
but if I ask that then aren't I in some
sense devaluing the older folks and and
and suggesting that there's something
wrong with being old you you you accuse
your critics of engaging in ageism by
expecting people to die at a certain age
I'd like you to address that but also
isn't is being old a value and an
experience that maybe we shouldn't get
rid of if we want to answer that
question carefully then we have to
distinguish between being
chronologically old and being
biologically old I am certainly in no
way against people being chronologically
old in fact I plan to develop
technologies which will a lot more of us
to become chronologically a lot older
than that people do today but
biologically old absolutely I am all for
denigrating in deprecating Alzheimer's
disease I am not in favor of it I don't
want to get it and I don't want anybody
else to get it either and the same
applies for absolutely every other
aspect of the diminished performance
both mental and physical that we see
associated with all day
it applies to all of the things that we
called his easiest we really shouldn't
call diseases like most cancers
arthrosclerosis and so on and it also
apply to those aspects of aging that we
tend not to give disease like names to
like declining function of the immune
system or a lot of muscle or frailty you
know things that are much more nebulous
but nevertheless just as real when it
comes to decline in what we can do you
know that's a really interesting
distinction that you're making there is
trying to figure out how to phrase this
question do we take that I want to say
do we take for granted the process but
but but that's not right
why isn't the degeneration of muscular
ability why isn't the weakness
inconsiderate of disease why is it just
regarded as something that happens and
we're not going to address it what is it
about that amorphous idea that human
beings get weaker as they get older that
really isn't a focus of serious medical
research well first of all there is more
medical research in those areas than
there used to be so the news is not all
bad but really your question is why do
we carve out certain components of Aging
and call them diseases and leave other
parts as what we think of as quote a
ting itself unquote thank you that's a
that's a better phrasing yeah so my take
on this is it's purely part of what I
was saying earlier the process of
putting aging out of our minds and not
not letting it destroy our equanimity
essentially for me you know there is
absolutely no biological basis for that
kind of distinction it is in fact very
counterproductive that we make the
distinction because when we call a part
of aging a disease we make ourselves
think that we can cure it in the same
way that we might be able to cure an
infection and that results in huge
amounts of money being spent
totally inappropriately on
research to achieve this so-called cure
which can't be done because these
so-called diseases are actually start
effects of being alive so and if the
rest of aging is but why we do it I
believe yeah it's a case of we know that
aging is horrible if we take bits of it
and we call them diseases we're allowed
we allow ourselves to think that those
bits are horrible and that kind of makes
it easier to have some residue left that
we can kind of make excuses for and
pretend it's a blessing in disguise of
some kind thereby allowing ourselves not
to think about it to mark and to get on
with our miserably short lives and make
the best of it when we come back I want
to pursue this question obviously in a
variety of different ways including
talking about the biological components
and the genetic components but I will I
will ask you in advance it's we have but
another minute or two what do we have to
know what do we have to get before we go
from the conceptual discussion to the
scientific discussion is there something
that we are doing wrong or a way that
we're thinking other than just the the
shift into the disease vocabulary that
we need to get past in order to really
grasp the potential of the genetic
research I would say one thing that we
need to get past if the idea that aging
is some kind of mystery anything it's
simply not a mystery it's not an enigma
at all not only do we understand a load
of the molecular and cellular details of
what changes in the body what eventually
causes the and contributes to the
decline in health in old age but also
there is a whole bunch of stuff that we
just know that we don't need to
understand because we have ways to
sidestep that ignorance so to speak
essentially you know the demystification
of aging is a huge part of what I have
to do
to engage in I need people to understand
that the analogy with simple man-made
machines like cars is truly a valid
analogy the fact that the body is alive
and cars and not alive does not does not
change the validity of that analogy the
fact that the human body is much more
complicated than any man-made machine
does not change the validity of that
analogy the fact is maintenance works
the body is a machine
therefore it's functionally determined
by its structure therefore if we can
restore even approximately the structure
of the human body of an older person to
something like what it was as a young
adult
then we will restore its function as
well well you've certainly whetted my
appetite I'm very excited to figure out
what the next steps are and the science
behind it we'll get to that in a moment
you're listening to Aubrey de Grey and
Jack Russell weinstein on why
philosophical discussions but everyday
life we'll be back right after this
you're back with Jack Russell Weinstein
on why philosophical discussions about
everyday life we're talking with Aubrey
de Grey about aging and whether it's a
disease that can be cured I just had my
birthday a couple days ago I turned 48
years old
and my experience of birthdays an age
has had two parallel paths although at
least that's how I talk to my students
about it the first was I remember when I
turned 40 really didn't mean that much
to me and I didn't have any deep problem
with it but then about six months later
I went to the eye doctor and discovered
that I needed bifocals and that just
threw me and that really put me in a
sort of oh my god what's happening to me
attitude and then I began to notice as I
progressed in my 40s that my body began
to betray me in ways that it never did
before at the same time I talked to my
students about how difficult and
angst-ridden their twenties are and how
they're not going to know where they are
and there's gonna be all this drama but
that in general the 30s are actually
wonderful that the 30s you have a sense
of who you are you have a sense of what
you want often you're you found a
community of friends if not a partner
and there's a there's a confidence and a
stability of the 30s that make it a very
satisfying decade
I use those two examples because there's
two very different experiences of Aging
there one is the mechanical breakdown of
things and the other is the experience
of wisdom and life and what we're doing
here today I suspect is breaking those
two things apart and so operate I want
to ask you is there a direct connection
between the physicality of aging and the
psychological experience of learning and
and wisdom or as a scientist can you
just focus on the Machine and leave the
experiential elements to other folks I
would call myself a technologist more
than a scientist in other words someone
who wants to manipulate nature more than
someone who wants to understand nature I
can indeed leave the psychological side
to other people at the end of the day
you know so much of our psychology is
determined by our physical health anyway
you know by what we find ourselves able
to do and in particular by what we find
ourselves unable to do that we used to
be able to do so I believe that I am
already making the job of the
psychologists among us a lot easier just
by bringing greater health to physical
health physical and mental from Canales
ii to older people so let's let's dive
in and ask how that happens I think most
of my listeners like like me really
don't understand the basics of genetics
but you've had a lot of practice in this
so I wonder if you could give us a
primer on just what the problems are and
how you plan on solving them on the
biological and genetic level with the
preventative maintenance of a simple
machine the first step has to be to
characterize what kind of damage is
accumulating as you know by-product as a
side effect of the machines normal
operation
and you know somehow getting a nice
comprehensive catalogue of all those
types of damage so that one can then
develop a corresponding catalog of ways
to eliminate the damage so as to restore
the structure of the machine to how it
was earlier and the good news of course
for me was the but by the time I started
in this field in the mid to late 90s I
know people have been studying aging for
rather a long time and there was a
pretty good catalog already of what
those changes were and indeed the good
news for me at that time was they had
already been well over a decade maybe 15
years since anybody had come up with
anything new any new aspect of molecular
or cellular changes that would occur in
the body as a consequence of the
metabolism and that appeared to
contribute late in life to the decline
in health so that was pretty good news
and I basically took this catalog I mean
the catalog was not like generally
viewed as a catalog but nevertheless I
was able to make such a list pretty
easily just on the basis of what I had
learned from the literature and her
conferences and so on and in the year
2000 when I had been in the field for
only about five years I began to realize
that none of these various types of
damage was really off limits that all of
them had potential ways in which we
could actually not simply slow down the
rate at which they were created but
actually repair the damage that had
already been created in the body and the
reason why this had not occurred to my
colleague studying the biology of Aging
was largely because a lot of the most
promising ways to go about this process
were based on technologies that had been
developed in other areas of biology not
for the purposes of challenging aging at
all
and of course therefore these
technologies were simply unknown to my
colleagues who
the biology of Aging so um last part of
the reason why over the subsequent maybe
five or ten years I had to work quite
hard to get my ideas taken seriously
we've because in order to take them
seriously my colleagues had to learn a
lot of stuff that they had not
previously viewed as remotely relevant
to their own work when when you're
looking at the literature and you're
looking at the people who are who are
engaged in it they're there's two sets
of conversations one is again on the
cellular level and in a minute I'll ask
you about tilt allah tala marie's i
can't remember what the how to pronounce
it but the the end the the cellular
structure but then there's the other
aspect which is the basic physical
fitness you ride your bike you eat
healthily you take care of the machine
how much of the preventative stuff
happens behaviorally and how much of it
is the advanced medical science and and
eventually we'll talk about nanobots
that that that are in the that art
discoveries waiting to happen how much
of aging is about what we do and how
much of aging is the machine itself
I'm all for a healthy lifestyle not
smoking not getting seriously overweight
you know generally living the way your
mother told you to I'm over that but we
must at all times keep a sense of
proportion with regard to how much
difference that makes a lot of people
will say to themselves well you know a
bad lifestyle bad diet and so on you're
shortening your living a lot less long
than if you behave right and that is
true but what people are often thinking
is well therefore if I you know I take
advantage of all the latest knowledge
and I eat and unusual diet that's
particularly well informed so and then I
can I might be able to live a lot longer
like twenty years longer than I would if
I only did what my mother told me to and
that simply isn't true there
absolutely no evidence for that it seems
that the basics the real basics that we
all know already almost the best we can
do we we can hardly provide anymore
increments on top of that just by doing
something particularly special you know
no one lives all that much longer there
are certain regions of the world that
have particular lifestyles or particular
diets and they live longer than the
surrounding areas but they don't live
much longer you know a year or two now
that's all very well I no reason why I'm
all in favor of this it's because every
day
is better than nothing but what we need
to avoid is getting too fixated on that
and forgetting that the real damage to
aging so to speak the damage to damage
will be done by developing medicines
that can truly transplant
anything that can be achieved by simple
lifestyle or indeed today's medicine so
what kind of things can we do with that
medicine you talked about cleaning up
the garbage and and the preventative
aspects of it what
what does biological garbage look like
and how do we get rid of it
are there limits to how clean they can
be and then and then I guess the other
question is are there limits to what the
machine can do can cells only divide so
often is there just a point where the
pieces are just out of the necessary
energy or matter to do what they need to
do okay that's garbage is a fine example
of a type of damage that I can talk
about and explain in pretty
non-technical terms so the so every cell
does a lot of different things to do its
job and to keep itself alive and so on
and these processes create byproducts
that are not necessary for the the
function of the cell but they still
created now if those byproducts are
created at a rapid rate then they will
just accumulate and accumulate and kill
the cell pretty quickly and that would
be bad and you know we wouldn't live
long enough to have offspring and so
natural selection would would not look
favorably all of that therefore
evolution has created systems that
eliminate garbage like that they you
know they destroy the garbage or the
system may just arrange for the garbage
to be excreted from the body however the
thing is that there are some types of
garbage some kind of by-product of
metabolism which are created really
really slowly and they are the problem
because if they're created really slowly
then they don't accumulate to a
problematic level a level that gets in
the way of the operation of the cell
until late in life and late in life
evolution doesn't care about us anymore
we may already be dead because we got
eaten or we starve to death or whatever
or any rate we will have had our
offspring so you know we'll have done a
bit so there's not enough selective
pressure on evolution to generate the
corresponding machinery to destroy or
eliminate this type of garbage and sure
enough when we live long enough in the
so called captivity that we have created
for ourselves um we get into a position
where those types of garbage do reach a
level of abundance that impairs cellular
function and that is the main driver of
a number of the most important diseases
so called of old age such as
atherosclerosis of course the number one
killer in the Western world the driver
of heart attacks and strokes that caused
by the problematic accumulation of
oxidized cholesterol
another example is macular degeneration
which is the number one cause of
blindness in the elderly it's caused by
the accumulation in the back of the eye
of a particular type of derivative of
vitamin A that's responsible for the
chemistry of vision so yeah so these
things accumulate and our approach to
eliminating those things is to introduce
into this into it the human cell new
enzymes found in bacteria that are able
to break down the stuff that we
naturally breakdown and these enzymes
are quite easy to find they do need to
be modified in quite tricky ways in
order to still work in a human cell but
we have successfully done that in both
the cases I've just mentioned
atherosclerosis and macular degeneration
and indeed the projects of both gone far
enough that we've been able to spin them
out into startup companies so this is
definitely a viable approach but as you
can all probably already tell it's
technically quite challenging it's not
like popping a pill we have to do things
like gene therapy and you know cell
therapy to actually introduce these new
enzymes into the body and to have them
go where they're needed so when you're
talking about these enzymes I have a
vision of an analogous process tell me
if this is right as I've gotten older
it's become harder for me to digest milk
I've become lactose intolerance so I
take when I want to these little pills
that provide the enzymes from my stomach
that allow my stomach to digest the milk
and not have bad things happen obviously
this is on the cellular level but is
this the same sort of process that
you're talking about that what we're
doing is we're taking foreign enzymes
and putting them in there to do a job
that our body can't do it's very much
the same the fundamental the main
difference between the situation that
you have with lactose intolerance and
the situation I'm talking about with
those two aspects of aging is that you
were not lactose intolerant at a younger
age this is an activity that you have
lost as a side effect of other things
that are going wrong in the body whereas
the accumulation of oxidized cholesterol
in the artery or of this derivative of
vitamin A in the back of the eye these
are things that happens throughout life
because they recently don't have the
genetic machinery at any age to
eliminate these things and eventually
their accumulation has knock-on effect
very much as the other changes in the
body in your body have had that knock-on
effect of lactose intolerance
but yes we have to introduce these
things in order to give ourselves
capacity and functionalities at the
informatica ville that we never had even
in a minute I want to ask you about some
other things but you you used a phrase
or you made a comment that my
philosophers ears are really picked up
on you said that that after a certain
age evolution doesn't care about us
anymore
and so I guess the the first general
philosophical question is does that
suggest that the stuff that you are
doing is in some way and I know this is
a really problematic concept but in some
way unnatural but the second is that do
you think that this would have such a
profound effect on the human experience
that it would alter evolution and human
beings either wouldn't change or would
change in a fundamentally different way
than the the evolution seems to be
moving now let's look at the question of
whether unnatural so on the one hand I
could say well obviously it's unnatural
but so is the whole of Technology you
know the wheel is unnatural
you know all of medicine is unnatural
and there's nothing wrong with that you
know technology is considered a good
thing another way of saying the same
thing is that technology is natural in
other words that it is natural for human
beings to alter nature in their own
interests so that you know if we're
doing things to preserve our health
beyond what nature allowed us to do in
other words beyond what evolution
bothered to arrange then so much the
better it's just like the wheel it's
just like antibiotics you know I think I
think that's really the straightforward
answer and do you think that it's a
powerful enough change that it would
alter evolution itself or do you think
that well I think that's also kind of
the wrong way to look at it
a good way to explain why we mustn't be
too parochial and about to like
simplistic about evolution is to look at
our immune systems so it's perfectly
clear a widely understood
that the immune systems of typical
people today are weaker than they used
to be a hundred years ago so we may ask
well first of all how did that happen
second of all does it matter and what
what happened by evolution evolution
over a period of only a few generations
underwent our genetic the genetic basis
underlying our immune systems underwent
a significant shift and the reason it
went through that shift is because
historically in pre-medical times so to
speak before modern medicine came along
if you had a weak immune system you
tended to die before you had a chance to
pass on your genes by reproduction
whereas now you can get away with it
because we've got hygiene and vaccines
and antibiotics and all that kind of
stuff um so that's one reason why the
Selective pressure went away on top of
that it turns out that women who have
weaker immune systems tend to be more
fertile because they have a lower risk
of immune rejection of the fetus so that
has further accelerated the process of
shifting our immune systems to a weaker
State now we may say this is a bad thing
you know we we would prefer to have
strong immune systems but why I mean the
fact is we have these technologies the
medicine that we've developed over the
past century is not magically gonna go
away at any point so it's fine really
and there will be other examples in fact
I believe that that it's pretty much
certain that evolution as defined by the
change in the genetic composition of the
population is going to enormous ly
accelerate really well soon simply by
virtue of the development and
implementation of high quality high
volume somatic gene therapy in other
words alteration of the genetic
composition of people who are already
alive of course that allows an enormous
acceleration because it doesn't involve
this terribly time-consuming
reproduction step ok so then the next
step is did the enzymes added to the
cells do the whole
or there are there other things we need
to do as well job normally what I how I
described the phenomenon of aging is by
breaking me down into seven categories
of damage and the accumulation of
molecular West products within the cell
if just one of those seven categories so
for example another category is loss of
whole set of entire cells so dying and
not being automatically replaced by the
division of other cells clearly if if
that process happens and it continues to
happen then the number of cells in the
affected organ is going to continue to
decline and eventually there won't be
enough cells for the organ to do its job
so the you know that's definitely part
of Aging we can identify can point to
particular components of aging that are
fine examples of that Parkinson's
disease is one of them it's caused by
the loss of a particular type of neuron
in a particular part of the brain and
you know the right way to fix it of
course is by replacing those cells can
we do that yes we can we've got this
concept called stem cell therapy which
involves injecting cells into the body
that are pre-programmed in the
laboratory to divide and transform
themselves into replacements for the
cells that the body is not replacing on
its own and I could go through the rest
of the list but you get the idea there's
a variety of different types of damage
and corresponding ways to repair that
damage and and for those people who are
interested all of this is described in
the book ending aging with great detail
in a very accessible way although the
science stuff I sometimes have to pay a
little closer attention to just because
of the nature of my mind um I want to
ask if we are stopping aging does that
mean that in theory we are preventing
cancer that lack of aging means also
necessarily lack of disease or are those
different systems lack of aging does
necessarily mean lack of age-related
disease
mean lack of tuberculosis Oh like HIV or
whatever but of course you knew that it
certainly means lack of all the diseases
that are associated with old age that
younger people don't tend to suffer from
and actually will have knock-on effect
on diseases that younger people do
suffer from just because of the
reusability of certain technological
advances but yet cancer for example
absolutely most cancers are the result
of the accumulation in just one
individuals now of a particular
constellation of mutations that cause it
to misbehave in this or that way and
resist the ability of the body to get
rid of it and those mutations happen
independently of each other so it takes
time for any cell even even though we
have many trillions of felt in the body
it takes time for any one cell to get
into that particularly aberrant state
and that makes it part of aging and the
individual mutations that the drivers of
cancer are damaged is how closely does
the community the anti-aging community
work together I know that there's other
technologies that people are talking
about to try to again I alluded to these
before try to make cells split
indefinitely to to lengthen the the
teller me a lot telomeres can't say that
word telomeres and and then and then
there's some discussion of advanced
technologies like nanobots that can can
target particular illnesses disease
genes damaged cells how much are you all
working together are there regular
conferences are there I mean now I'm
going to sound like an academic are
there listservs I mean to what extent is
this a group activity and to what extent
is this a lot of people individually
working and then coming together
periodically to just sort of exchange
research it's a pretty good group effort
I mean the community has historically
been a little bit too balkanized people
not talking to each other
and a large part of the contribution
that I've made has been to to change
that to bring people together who
wouldn't normally be talking to each
other but who are addressing different
components different facets of the same
problem and therefore who would benefit
from talking to each other and maybe
find ways to to to put two and two
together and make more than thought you
know to synergize but yes certainly
within the community that recognises the
kind of things I say the fact that aging
is a unitary the complex problem and
therefore that the components that it
consists of them if they interact and
they need to be considered as a network
you know those people certainly
understand the vital importance of
continued communication of course there
is a certain amount of working
independently that's in any research
area but communication so let's let's
assume that that we can do it that the
research is fruitful that that in the
next couple of decades you have the the
discoveries and the revolution that you
actually predict there is a whole set of
objections that people have not that we
can't do it but rather that we shouldn't
do it that the carbon footprint that the
of people the overpopulation the damage
that human beings do to one another with
war how do you respond to the people who
just say ok but just because you can do
something doesn't mean you should I have
a variety of different responses to
those kinds of positions one when I'm
feeling in a good mood I will tend to
give the you know the detailed sincere
answers to do with why these problems
and how these problems can be addressed
for example problems to do with well we
put all the people or will be too much
environmental damage and so on the right
answer to those questions is to point to
all the technologies that we are already
developing to minimize and to you know
eliminate those problems for example the
rise of solar and wind energy renewable
energy so as to minimize fossil fuel
utilization you
whether it's desalination artificial
meat all of these technologies that are
coming along really rapidly not even
just in order to solve the environmental
issues that humanity creates but just
because these waves are actually ending
up being more economical than the old
ways of doing things you know these are
things that are going to increase the
carrying capacity of the planet much
more rapidly than the elimination of
aging would increase the population of
the planet so you know it's easy to it's
it's basically impossible to argue that
things would not go that way that the
overpopulation problem we have today
would actually get worse in the longer
term it's definitely going to get less
bad whenever we do about aging um but
also there are general answers there
which may sound a little bit more
dismissive but I think are just as
important one simple answer is look a
sense of proportion you know yes in
principle we might end up in some kind
of outlandish worst-case scenario in
whereby we were for example increasing
the population of the planet faster than
we were increasing the carrying capacity
of the planet but so the hell what all
that means all that would mean is that
we would be in a position of having to
choose between either carrying on the
way we are today everyone getting really
sick when they get older and eventually
dying but before they die having to go
through a lot of suffering and a lot of
expense and so on or alternatively
choosing to have fewer kids than we
might like to have you know that's the
choice that we would ultimately be faced
with and you know it's a pretty easy
choice to make
you know kids nice to have but
Alzheimer's is also a nice thing not to
have you know and then you know beyond
that we can say well okay even if you
dare to be uncertain about that even if
you dare to think that well actually I
would prefer to get outside as then not
to have a lot of kids then we have to
ask whether it is today
the population that exists today who
should be making that choice to me it's
very clear it's completely unequivocal
that the moral obligation on humanity
today is to develop these therapies as
quickly as possible so that humanity of
the future let's say 20 years from now
has the option whether to use these
therapies how to use them which they
would not have if we didn't develop the
therapies in time we have no right it's
perfectly clear to me we have no right
to condemn some cohort of the humanity
of the future to an unnecessarily early
and unnecessarily painful death just
because we thought oh dear they're not
going to be able to fix the
overpopulation problem you know it's
interesting you say that because there
is a there's a component that I didn't
even realize I was thinking about which
is that nothing you're saying in invites
taking away the choice from people right
just because you can live forever
doesn't mean that someone who doesn't
want to doesn't have to right no one is
going to be forced to take the medicines
presumably correct I mean you know if
these medicines are available and
they're made available you know for free
you know irrespective of ability to pay
which I firmly believe they will be even
in really tax averse countries like the
USA nevertheless you know it's that even
if that happens um you know we've got to
ask you know what will society think of
people who choose to get old and sick
and and frail and eventually dead anyway
and I think actually to be honest we're
gonna call those people suicide all the
way that we call people today who want
to die sometime soon when they don't
have to win that still where I have the
option to continue being physically and
mentally healthy so what probably can I
try and change those people's minds in
very much the same way that we try to
change the minds of suicidal people
today but you said the thing that that
actually my wife wanted to bring up
which is wouldn't this end up being just
for the rich and you said you said just
now that that you think it would be
given to everybody
free regardless of their ability to pay
and so I guess the towards the end of
this conversation I want to ask
is this really just a question of
optimism versus pessimism you seem to
have a very optimistic attitude about
human beings that they will give this
stuff for free that this can happen that
we will solve the problems and I think
that our age right now is a very
pessimistic age we had Steven Pinker on
the show quite a few years ago when his
book better angels of our nature came
out and his argument is that we are
living in a less violent period than any
time ever before and were less likely to
die by violence in any time ever before
and that and they're actually the the
left the liberal community was really
upset with us and found it objectionable
and there was a fundamental pessimism
that people wanted to think that the
world was worse off than it is we live
in a fairly pessimistic age is part of
the disconnect and part of the reason
why not everyone is responding as
positively to your research as you would
like and I think I would like at this
point that that you're just an optimist
in a way that people aren't used to I
mean Pinker will of course completely
correct do not lie it's absolutely clear
that we live in a far less violent world
and in general a world with far less
suffering than we did even fifty years
ago
no question yes I mean of course the
danger is that if I allow myself to be
called an optimist then people will
think that I'm an over optimist that's
true I think that the pessimists are the
unreasonable people who are not looking
at the data when I say I'm sure that
these therapies will be available to
everybody a respective ability to pay
even in the USA I'm basing that on the
simple economic logic the fact that the
expense the money that we spend today on
people who are not getting these therapy
because they don't yet exist is
astronomical and therefore that these
therapies even if they end up being
quite expensive at first well
Ginobli pay for themselves many times
over very quickly
in other words from from the point of
view of the the the economy of the
country that any country that did not
make these things available free of
charge basically to anybody who was old
enough to need them would go bankrupt
really quickly by virtue of failing to
compete with countries that were doing
so it's you know it's just
straightforward mercenary economic logic
now I don't pretend to be an economist
this is very simplistic economic logic
but I have talked to plenty of
economists and challenged them and fed
and fed this thing and nobody has come
back and said no Audrey you are wrong
actually for this there is reason and
that reason these think that this logic
will not work and these therapies will
not be made available to everybody
nobody's done that so until somebody
does do that I think I'm entitled to
point out that nobody's done that and
that you know the knee-jerk presumption
that these therapies are going to
increase our inequality if complete
nonsense you know it's a theme has
developed in this show over the years
and it's emphasized by what you're
saying now and the connection to our
show last month with Rutger Bregman who
was arguing for everyone getting a
universal basic income and his argument
was that giving everyone or the people
who need it this money is cheaper than
the welfare system and then pond cheaper
than poverty and you're saying the same
thing and and and it's just astonishing
that over and over again we get this
argument that it is cheaper to help
people than it is to ignore people and
right I mean the point is we don't
actually ignore people right well it's
cheaper to help people soon early than
to help people late prevention is better
than cure I mean it's not exactly a new
idea so would it then and I guess this
will probably the last question would it
be more accurate for me to have asked
the question not can we cure aging but
rather can we prevent aging is that a
more accurate description of what your
long
golus well of course words are always
dangerous you know the word immortality
is a word that's associated with my work
all the time and it's really problematic
of course you've not made that mistake
thank you very much
but it happens all the time and it
really annoys me because you know it's
got an established meaning and even the
word disease and the word cure are
difficult words for me because you know
when you use those words it kind of goes
against what I'm emphasizing that the
thing the so-called diseases of old age
are actually parts of aging then not
like infections they can't be cured in
the same way that an infection can so I
try to avoid those well I really you
know to be honest the my preference
would be to make all of my statement
without using the word aging at all so
it's not to introduce all of these
ambiguities but at the end of the day
it's all about treating aging and as a
medical problem something that can be
addressed by pretty obvious measures
that uh well obvious in the sense of how
we can describe them obviously they
haven't implemented them all yet so yeah
you can understand what I'm saying and
the terminology gets in the way a lot
absolutely and the terminology also
hides or privileges certain
philosophical issues that I actually
think you've done an outstanding job of
bringing out to us in a way that we can
all understand and I think that a way
that makes us hopeful I've been looking
at your stuff and and I am excited about
the prospect and I really hope you are
right so Aubrey de Grey thank you so
much for joining us on why thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
