this podcast produced by the
International Monetary Fund in this
program inventor and futurist Ray
Kurzweil talks about how artificial
intelligence is helping overcome our
human limitations that's the purpose of
technology and we're the only species
that creates technology that was enabled
by this expansion of the neocortex two
million years ago we use that official
neocortex to invent technology the first
technology was language so we could
share ideas but technology is a body and
brain extender
Ray Kurzweil has shared some of his own
ideas over the past few decades his
famous music synthesizer in the 1980s
was the first to accurately recreate the
complex harmonic structure of a grand
piano he invented speech recognition
machines and the flatbed scanner but
Kurzweil is also an entrepreneur and was
invited to the IMF World Bank annual
meetings to join in a panel discussion
on how new technologies are shaping the
global economy I began our conversation
asking mr. Kurzweil if intelligent
machines or AIS as they're called will
mean fewer jobs well I have a different
vision of technology it's not us versus
them I think we're already merging with
intelligent technology you know these AR
futurist movies you've got the AI versus
the humans for control of the world and
that's not how it's rolling out we don't
have one or two AOS in the world we have
right now two to three billion and they
are making us smarter you know I had to
take my bicycle to the computer at MIT
when I was an undergraduate now we carry
them in our pockets and they kid in
Africa with a smartphone and has access
to all of human knowledge with a few
keystrokes very few of us could do our
jobs without these brain extenders which
is what they are and that's how we use
our tools we couldn't reach fruit at
that high branch so invented a tool that
extended our physical reach who of us
could build a skyscraper
with our bare hands so we have tools
that leverage our muscles and now they
leverage our minds to extend the very
nature of our thinking but this whole
does this concept of overcoming you know
human limitations did you think that
that is in fact a natural process
well how many natural limitations have
we already overcome I mean we we've
doing planetary wide engineering and we
can solve problems it would be
impossible without our machines and so
that's the purpose of technology and
we're the only species that creates
technology that was enabled by this
expansion of the neocortex two million
years ago we got these large foreheads a
cave a Sun we were already doing a great
job being primates we used that
additional neocortex to invent
technology the first technology was
language so we could share ideas and
we've created more and more powerful
means of creating and sharing language
and scientific ideas and but technology
is a body and brain extender that the
ends we're getting more and more
intimate with it but as we you know as
the machines become smarter and and do
things better than humans what will
become of the workforce we've done that
already how many jobs circa 1900 exist
today
the Weaver's in England in 1800 looked
around and so my goodness these jobs are
spinning thread and weaving cloth and
our jobs are gonna go away and they did
our impression features to 1900 I'd look
around and say well two-thirds of you
work on farms and factories
that's not down to less than 10% people
go oh my god I'm gonna be out of work
and I'd say well don't worry you're
gonna get jobs doing podcasts and
creating web applications and mobile
devices and websites and data analytics
nobody would have any idea what I'm
talking about
the political problem is this people can
look around and see jobs that are gonna
go away because of emerging technologies
like self-driving cars
happens to be true but employments gone
up you know we have greatly multiplied
employment in the United States even
percentage-wise in the last century
we've gone from 30 percent something
like 43 percent and that new jobs pay
more than ten times as much in constant
dollars and they're more interesting
we're redefining the nature of work but
isn't you know redefining the nature of
work seems like it's a luxury that
people with jobs and/or money have and
all those people that haven't been
exposed to sort of the opportunities of
the new economy like what happens to
them the idea of a job is not an end in
itself it's a means to an end so it's a
means to redistribute wealth perhaps
it's a means to actually do something
that's gratifying that you have a
passion for and we're in the process of
redefining that musicians now have
employment because websites need music
and videos need music and graphic
artists are in great demand and so it's
it's enabling creativity it's enabling
communication it's enabling easy access
to markets if you're a musician you can
put your music out there for free and
the economic statistics are that
employment even defined the
old-fashioned ways at an all-time high
and more and more of the jobs are jobs
that give us gratification not everybody
and I'm and there are dislocations and I
think there's a lot of anxiety about
this and I think that's fueling some
unrest but people actually think that
things are getting worse I commented on
this to me in the panel at the IMF today
and that's absolutely not the case
poverty is down on education sway up all
of these statistics are moving in the
right direction even war and peace which
is the most peaceful time in human
history and you know you listen to the
public airwaves when people talk about
the most violent time in human history
well our information about violence and
about what's wrong
with the world is expanding
exponentially but the reality is the
world is getting more prosperous just
since World War two
poverty is down 80 percent worldwide and
there's many statistics like that hmm so
I mean the IMF released its projections
this year for you know the world economy
and and again it showed that generally
growth is low and it's been low for
several years now with with all that
technology offers in terms of innovation
why do you think we're not seeing that
economic growth or is it is something
that you raised in the panel discussion
as well today was that suggested that we
perhaps aren't capturing that this well
we're absolutely not capturing it in
information technology I mean you can
buy an iPhone or an Android phone that's
twice as good it's a one two years ago
if I have the price but when I spend
$200 for smartphone that counts for two
hundred dollars of economic activity
despite the fact that it's thousands of
dollars of information technology circa
a few years ago and billions of dollars
circa a few decades ago we don't capture
that so then it kind of say okay that's
a strange world of information
technology that's a little bit different
but you can't eat it you can't wear it
you can't live in it all of that is
gonna change as well and and is in the
process of being changed and we already
see some benefits of that you can buy
very high quality clothes for very low
prices because of the automation that's
come to creating textiles that'll become
supercharged when we have 3d printing of
clothing and modules to snap together
housing and there's a whole new
automated agricultural revolution called
vertical agriculture coming with AI
controlled buildings and none of that's
captured because a dollar is of goods
it's still a dollar of goods even if
it's equivalent to thousands or millions
of dollars of products you know a while
ago I was very excited as a teenager
after having saved up from my paper
route for years to spend a few thousand
dollars to get in cyclope
right Anakin here were these 30
beautiful volumes with thousands of
entries and I loved information well now
you have a much better encyclopedia and
there's just one of thousands of free
information services which counts for
nothing in economic activity because we
don't pay for it and we completely
ignore that and overlook it that's very
interesting it's it's sort of like with
technologies sort of driving this new
economy we haven't really sort of sorted
out how we measure the new economy right
well correct I mean information
technology right now has approximately a
50 percent deflation rate that is by the
way why I think we're keeping inflation
in check not necessarily smart policies
by the Fed it's this pervasive deflation
rate and the influence of it is
expanding so there are industries like
manufacturing is not quite an
information technology but we use so
much information technology in it that
it's become so efficient that costs are
coming down and it's subject and so this
deflationary force is keeping inflation
in check and provides fantastic value I
mean this kid in Africa who spent $50
for a smartphone has access to
incredible resources more computing than
the NASA space program a few decades ago
and information services that didn't
exist at all just a few years ago and we
completely ignore that we don't factor
that in economics was based on the
economics of scarcity which in fact
described the world economy centuries
ago and we have this emerging
information technology which is an
economics of abundance where we get
twice as much for the same cost each
year and we need different economic
models for them thank you very much my
pleasure
