which Ben asked me to provide and this
would be the fun part but we can skip
that integral a few minutes so there's a
picture Vernor Vinge
in the 80s when I was a young man seems
unbelievable today but there I read the
novels of him about the technical
technological singularity so the idea
back then of Bernardin was accelerating
progress gets faster and faster and at
some point becomes income principles and
you have this thing that's called the
technological singularity and press to
publish that in forensic science fiction
novels and I read so many science
fiction novels back then and these were
one of the and most of them were really
bad but it was really interesting stuff
I thought and then later I read in a
book like great quest house that
actually is the first guy who came up
with this idea of a converging history
singularity probably perhaps I know what
Sun is la una and and this guy here at
very bench though is probably really the
first one who elaborated on that concept
in many many ways not only inside
fiction novels but also in scientific
complications now I ask myself is it
really true is there such a pattern in
history that fits the fee that fits that
the idea of a single energy historic
singularity and yes there is one and
it's amazing how simple it is it turns
out if you take as a basic interval a
human lifetime which takes one would say
80 years then the ends main chapter of
history in the history books in just
only the history book is 2 to the N
human lifetimes before oh my god so
Sigma I team which is for some reason in
2014 and let me show that in videos so
only guys 2014 many people are coming up
with a number like that into the
vertical I take that as well I take one
lifetime is 80 years and
through that always to have been
lifetime like fast and the average
lifetime of previous Malaya was shorter
mostly because of the high infant
mortality to 80 years all it was a good
lifetime and my arrow bars are not in
most cases they are really much smaller
than 10% now to to the nine lifetimes
ago forty thousand years ago Homo
sapiens sapiens comes into existence and
in colonizes the world and we take half
of that and we hit neck exactly as far
as we know the invention of long
distance weapons like bow and arrow and
the hunting revolution and we take half
of that and we hit exactly the
beginnings of civilization the invention
of agriculture the first permanent
settlement and and the first wall etc
and you take half of that and it's
exactly the first high civilization in
Sumeria and Egypt and the most important
invention of recorded history the ones
that made recorded history possible
namely writing 5,000 years ago then it's
not that quite clear in some area or in
Egypt and we take half of that and it's
exactly the peak of the ancient world
under the great
factoring there was there was a huge
Empire the Persian Empire which in many
ways was much more remarkable than the
Roman Empire but it's not as much
covered in Western history books but it
had probably have almost half of
humanity and in that and probably
clearly more than than half of the world
economy and it existed two thousand
thousand years ago and at the fringes of
the empire exciting things happened
especially in Greece in Greece that
during that time all the basic Western
values were created democracy was
invented philosophy as we know it the
first form approves appeared perfect
anatomically perfect sculptures were
made four percent engines were created
the steam engine is a
invention but was not commercialized
back then harmonic music was invented
the basis of all Western music when I
sports the the Olympics and things like
that and at the same time the old
testament was written the basis of the
three Abrahamic religions and at the
same time and the other part of the
world in India the Buddhism was created
and Greece was not the only technically
technologically advanced part of the
world in China first calculation tools
emerged India invented the serum so that
was an amazing time back then and we
take half of that and is exactly the
Golden Age of the of the Islamic world
the Islamic Golden Age and at the same
time the most important invention of the
past 2,000 years took place namely the
invention of book print in China Omega
minus one thousand three hundred and we
take half of that and is exactly it
exactly
the beginning of the of the New Age was
a peak at the end of this almost right
now the right at this point here the
Mongolian Empire was the largest empire
ever and contained most of the known
landmarks and the two major
civilizations of that time were within
its borders and and the Chinese invented
guns and gunpowder and buckets and did
the first exploration so saying he he
explored from China the east coast of
Africa and Australia and slightly later
fifty years later maybe the Europeans
went the other way around and discovered
the rest of the world or I think that
they discovered the rest of the way
yeah like this picture here tell us the
14:20 that is the ship satsang he used
to explore large part that was on one of
the ship to use and then it's a Santa
Maria 50 years later
that Columbus used to rediscover my iPad
another oh yeah I I can't anything hey
but I don't know when is the real
connotation for Joe Mahalo I'm sorry so
I don't know Jon Hamm with the Columbus
try again and then the best book friend
which some people called the most
important invention of the past 1000
years and the Scientific Revolution
starter we take half of that
and exactly the age of enlightenment and
the first steam engine the first
commercial steam engine unlike the old
Greek steam engine the new common engine
was really used and and Leibniz invented
the binary arithmetic and build
computers like this one and you wouldn't
revolutionized physics and this is one
of his college course and the
fundamental theorem of calculus was
published by lightness and you'll notice
that we also had found that and we take
half of that now we are two lifetimes
before Aragon and it's exactly what many
people call the Second Industrial
Revolution when ought to invented the
gumline Engine and all these combustion
engines the diesel engine that cetera
were created and in diamonds then came
up with a car is a replica of the first
car of this reminder of something this
reminds us something you know that Obama
is extremely popular in Germany did you
know that when he went to Germany there
were 200,000 people who cheered him but
the other day he is something shocking
to many Germans because he said the car
was invented in America
he didn't say by whom maybe by Abraham
Lincoln but now many Germans are worried
that next time you will say our wrinkled
Lincoln also invented lederhosen and
thought wrong but then also maybe the
most important invention of that time
was the germ theory of disease which
saves hundreds of millions of lives and
rounded modern medicine chief
electricity became available modern
chemistry so and many of the big
companies that are still existing today
they were founded right there and the
highest building ever was birthday
Eiffel Tower was right at that time and
we take half of that and you see I'm
always missing that the other part of
world history I'm always missing things
like the Second World War
Thurs right in the 60s oh my god mine
has one lifetime
and what make starts the Space Age and
Apollo lands on the moon and DNA is
discovers or get to leave the million
Nobel Prize for the discovery reading
and one of pop culture emerges the
computer was invented long before that
but for the first time it became a
commercial important commercially
important saying hydrogen bombs give a
new quality to the concept of war and
again whatever think people think things
are going forward they build the highest
building ever and that was the World
Trade Center and the the population
explosion of the Train century probably
the most outstanding feature of the 20th
century was at its peak it was triggered
in 1980 by Fritz Haber who came up with
artificial fertilizers and then within
one century the population went up from
1.6 billion to 6 billion DM but the
highest derivative that was right there
in six years which in many ways defines
the world as we know it today and we
take half of that and this is now of
course and again people buying the
highest building ever since I think
twice as high as the water
they're billing that include blinds and
the monitors transformed again by
networks so the world wide web was
created Sen given T a picture of the
CERN where Tim berners-lee created the
www and and the cell phones of course
and angular and the GPC is a transformed
industry and private lives and a party
in mathematical theory of optimal
University and I emergency right at this
time and so how is it going to go
continue well many say claims that in in
2021 forth lifetime before our meager PC
pcs will match the rock and potentional
power of a human brain and then ten
years before our meager who knows what
going to happen in five years and two
years and then you know obviously is
converging histories converging you see
yet another one that shows that history
is converging now it's not based on
human lifetimes anymore but on the main
breakthroughs in computer science 1623
shaker builds the first computer two
centuries later Babbage comes up with
the with with program control computers
so shikha's computer you couldn't
program you could just do certain simple
arithmetic operations it didn't work so
because maybe the one for several
reasons and then one century later the
first really working computer was
vilified tools in 1941 what in a decade
and the thirties everything changed you
used to be inside invented the patented
first transistor Google founded the UN
computer science and together with
touring came up on the Turing machine
and by the end of the 30 is the the
field as we know today was more less
established and then half century later
1990s wwws created and within a few
years change the world
and of course you you know something
about statistical machine learning you
know if you've got three data points
then you can extrapolate without
obsession assume Accenture is once a 1/2
century and obviously it's going to
converge again exactly then in 2014 just
for fun just for fun let's redefine
Omega naught is not 2040 anymore but 15
14 15 14 now 96 years before warming up
which is now 15 14 the most important
thing in the time-life list of the top
events of the previous millennium
happened India the invention of or the
reinvention of foreign spy equipment
40.1 48 years later the second most
important event in the time like list of
the most important events of the past
millennium happened Columbus discovered
America rediscovered the night maybe it
was - yeah yeah yeah what and so on
you're totally right so maybe a Chinese
has a very different opinion about that
and of course Columbus did not become
famous because he was the first to
discover America but because what allows
to his government
and then 24 years later the third most
important event in the timeline lifeless
the most important event of the last
1,000 years happens then we Newton
started to recommission now our Chinese
friends will maybe not be convinced that
this was such an Americanism but but did
you see that happen 96 Fourier
transforms it's converging right there
in 1514 and that's one of the reasons I
think why we never had a shortage of
profit claims at the end is near you
look at the data point you look at the
logarithmic plot there is always some
way are fitting a straight line through
all these data points especially if you
ignore the data points and don't you
should you should take all of these
predictions with the brain on a saw and
maybe maybe actually the reason why it
looks to every subject and if history is
accelerating dramatically look at
yourself
most of your memory space is allocated
to the most recent event you'll still
know what you did yesterday reduce it do
you know what you did one year ago and
exactly this point in time so the first
you probably go back in time for the
less the smaller subtraction of your
memory space probably that you allocate
to to this time and maybe the same is
true for history books most history
books today have written about events
that happened a few decades ago and the
bulk of all the history books is really
concentrated on recent events and not on
very distant events so maybe there's
just like an inverse speed prior where
you are allocating memory in proportion
was exponentially in proportion to the
size of the previous time intervals that
are
and to be distant of these previous time
intervals as you go back you allocate
less and less memory to the events but
even that if that is so it's still clear
that we are living in exciting times and
I think it's a privilege to be a part of
that and let me finish by saying one one
more thing thank you very much for your
attention
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
