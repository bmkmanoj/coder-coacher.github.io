industries and Ari will be leading the
discussion this afternoon she's the
director of emerging technologies
experiences at IBM and spends her time
identifying and enhancing scientific
breakthroughs I'm extremely excited
about this panel I hope you are as well
and I will ask you guys to take the
stage thank you thank you hi welcome
everybody and good afternoon
so I'm also excited with the panel today
I think I'm gonna start by asking our
panelists given that machine learning is
really everywhere so that's almost a
commodity how do you help or in your own
jobs or help others understand what
intelligence means in this context who
would like to take that hard question
great so whenever I think about the
intelligent applications the thing that
comes to my mind is you know it's a way
that application developers or
applications think about how to take
advantage of both historical data as
well as real time data whether it is
structured data or semi structured data
or
structured data and then be able to
process the data to help make decisions
and predictions that is gonna enable
people to be able to deliver
personalized rich adaptive experiences
for users no matter whether you are a
consumer or an enterprise user so I
think from an investor perspective you
know we look at it almost from the lens
of what problem why this company this
entrepreneur going to go solve for for
an enterprise or a consumer being an
investor for a large technology
corporation and we also have the
advantage of a lot of very smart people
internally a lot of whom are working on
either hardware implementations of
classic machine learning models or the
software stack that sits on top of those
so a particular application feels like
computer vision sensor fusion and where
these software pieces on the machine
learning side add a lot of value we do
have some internal competency that we
can use to sort of peel the onion and
understand if a team truly has something
unique and differentiated or if it's a
you know paper where type reproach two
things well if I were to leave the stage
right now the average IQ of the stage
would increase so given the given that
my background is in steel and mining and
metals you know I often find machine
learning artificial intelligence and
deep learning to be words where I think
people confuse each other and trip up
quite a bit and often enough at least
from my end user perspective it's hard
enough to teach human beings you know
think about teaching machines but let me
get back to the real sense of machine
learning itself I think there is so much
talk and so much hype around this term
now you know artificial intelligence
being here for at least 60 years machine
learning is a portion of artificial
intelligence to be to be precise it's
it's a part of it and there are elements
of which we can apply today the elements
we can apply in 10 years or 20 years
from now and the elements that you could
never potentially apply and so a lot of
what my background being being being
from one of the larger steel companies
in the North America in a former life is
to distill what's going on in academia
and
in technology is looking for use cases
is to come at it from the other side
where you know what's the use case and
what's the right way in which you
address that use case and that's where I
think that that's my perspective machine
man right you know we also think about
machine learning from a practical user
perspective you know how can we deploy
it in our system and I guess a useful
discriminator for us is we ask ourselves
the problem that we're facing whether
that's you know to help a car detect a
pedestrian on the sidewalk or did to
help a car decide when to you know
travel through a yellow light we ask
ourselves can we model this using other
tools can we write down equations that
precisely describe this phenomena if we
can that's usually a good way to
approach the problem you know we just
describe it mathematically and off we go
if we can it's often because the
phenomena that we're talking about is is
so complex or rich or inherently
unmodeled believe a form expression that
describes that phenomena and in that
case often a useful way to to tackle the
problem is by looking at data and to use
methods like machine learning that are
often
data-driven and can through some magical
process generate these complex models
that can help us explain our phenomena
so we again think about it more from the
end-user phenomena and you know I come
at learning methods with an era of
skepticism because of AI don't
understand what this thing is but I do
know that it works and sometimes that's
good enough right yeah that's great so I
think that right from the user
perspective that's the interesting
situation because it could be what we
call it it doesn't really matter anymore
to the user but what matters is the
interaction and what they get out of it
so how do you see the current trends or
machine learning in particular how is
that affecting how users interact with
machines
that's a great question I think we track
a couple of things very very closely and
there's some interesting developments
we've seen in sort of both consumer and
enterprise in the last 18 24 36 months
that we think are indicators of how
technologies like this are starting to
percolate into you know stuff that we
all touch and interact with every day
I think self-driving cars is a perfect
example right if you talk to a computer
science professor here at MIT 10 15
years ago they would have told you that
problem is probably intractable never
will be solved but we've seen companies
like Utah to me and others make great
strides and you know we were and you
guys are driving a ton of his cars in
various jurisdictions now so that's one
place we'll all see a lot of interaction
going forward it's just with the way we
interact with machinery in general
whether it's a very tactile physical
thing like transportation or something
like Boise ux/ui you know Amazon has
stolen our March and a lot of people
with this amazing Alexa platform they
sort of pulled out of their hat in the
last two years and it's fascinating to
think about how that ability to interact
in a very seamless natural way with
technology becomes this ubiquitous
magical technology layer it's pretty
exciting ultimately when you interact
when you go to sort of amazon.com for
example or when you go to Netflix or
equal to a dating website right any of
any of these sort of you know consumer
facing properties that you access on a
day to day basis you are starting to see
smarter decisions that somebody is
making on the back end because they know
you or they get to know you they learn
about what you like what you don't like
they understand you're sort of buying
patterns they understand your habits and
they are trying to be smarter about what
recommendations they can give you that's
one place sort of now you you we all
encountered a day to day I think in
autonomous car is a great example but
probably it's going to be another three
four five six years before a lot of us
here are going to get a chance to be
able to directly experience the the
benefit of that but if you take an
enterprise scenario right now here I
flew Alaskan airlines to come to Boston
and I like Alaskan airlines but whenever
they sort of surface offers for me I
want them to be smarter about knowing my
travel patterns knowing my likes and
dislikes and give me offers that matter
that's there's a lot of machine learning
that goes into
them having to deliver that to me so
those are like you know sort of
day-to-day experiences that we are all
starting to see what the power of the
machine learning could could deliver for
us from a that's a great point so from a
user from a user perspective as I see
the adoption of machine learning in
different technologies or different use
cases the way I kind of try to distill
it into something that you know somebody
like even as Damas me can understand
simplistically is on one axis if you
think about you know the downside risk
of things going wrong it's somebody
gonna lose their life or am I gonna get
a pepperoni pizza versus cheese right on
one axis is the downside risk of machine
learning going wrong on the other axis
and the vertical axis is the element of
human control on that decision-making
which means is it giving me a
recommendation of the five people you're
you're young Sloan folks I'm sure you're
all probably dating at this point of the
five people I could go out on a date
with well you have the ability to
control that decision that saying this
is the person I choose versus the other
extreme so I'm making it really absurd I
think this is the person you have to
marry in a court date for getting
married is tonight you know so that's
the other extreme where you don't have
control on the system just giving you a
sense if you if you distill it there's
still every every application and those
two kind of parameters or those two axes
machine learning becomes extremely easy
to understand where the adoptions gonna
happen and where it's not gonna happen
so I give you a simple example I know
you know crowds here and calls the
expert or not you know autonomous
driving I take my personal example if I
were to be driven in our driverless car
I would think twice and my kids are
being driven on driverless car I would
think twice for stepping in that car
because the downside risk is pretty high
for me having an accident and maybe you
know whatever is the downside from there
but having said that you know think
about a city like Bombay or Manila or
Mombasa for that a chronic parking
issues right so people keep drivers in
these cities or employ drivers because
they want to get off of their location
and let the driver drive itself to a
parking lot and then call the driver say
bring the car back I'm done with my
appointment for something like that you
have the control on the system or a non
autonomous and yet the risk is low
in terms of the dancers at least to
yourself forget about the societal part
of it now that's the most apparent way
as I see it so as you can map one
application you're trying to write on
that matrix and map it against is my
user ready to adopt it and that same
matrix you get to see where you can
actually get user adoption for machine
learning type applications but that's
the apparent universe the invisible
universes think about technologies like
fly-by-wire or auto pilot these
technology has been existing for a long
time
the only problem is our only difference
between a car being driven autonomously
versus a plane is you know in a plane
when you get in you're out of control
the pilot is out there he's guiding the
plane and he's got a door between you
and him and if you try to get into that
door he'll end up in Guantanamo right on
the other side of that door so the
difference is since you've lost that
control anyways maybe that's some place
where adoption has become easier versus
not so think about as you've you know it
is what I would encourage the students
to think about is as you think about
applying ml or AI or any deep thinking
or neural network or genetic algorithms
or whatever you're thinking about
applying think about where you fit in
those squares and whether it's
applicable whether it's usable and
what's the lack of controller you know
the sense of control you give to the
end-users right so we've discussed
earlier where the technology might be
ready but are we ready to use it in a
way that we feel safe and that enhances
our experience as opposed to freaks us
out right and self-driving car is a
great example what are other really good
use cases that you see that are just
perfect for the current state of the art
of machine learning this is so really I
think important point yeah I don't know
that I could make it any better I mean
we I can I need just to go back to that
for one second you know we we have
competitors in this space of automated
cars that would argue that you can stall
the entire problem through a machine
learning approach you can basically go
from sensor inputs through some learning
process to some control outputs and I
you know I strongly believe the real
fallacy there is that if something does
go wrong and this is I would say one of
the weaknesses of machine learning is
that it's very difficult to interrogate
that system to understand why it made a
particular decision the end result of
this machine learning process is
typically a black box
right and so it gave you an answer but
why did it give you an answer well it
just did right it's hard to know why and
in many application domains that may be
insufficient so to you know kind of
paint with a broad brush safety-critical
domains and machine learning methods I
think it's probably a fairly complex and
delicate marriage there for these
non-state to critical applications
convenience applications applications
that require adaptation customization
for the the end user you know those are
potentially fantastic applications so
that's where I that's where I mentally
draw a distinction I kind of hinted at
the outset that I'm inherently
suspicious and this is one of the
reasons why because I think about the
prospect of deploying machine learning
at the heart of our driving stack and I
get very nervous we don't do that today
now do we deploy it in other parts of
the stack where we can tolerate this
inscrutability the answer is yeah so
just to build on that a little bit I
think you know one of the there were the
ways to think about this there that we
use is we do a lot of investing in what
we think of as applied robotics
companies so taking you know some
hardware software a combination with
some machine intelligence on top to to
solve some interesting problem and you
know if you reduce the world down to two
by two matrices like all the consulting
firms like to do you can sort of think
about sort of low cognition jobs high
cognition jobs and sort of low
repeatability high repeatability where
sort of activities and enterprises and
sort of value creation points fall and
that matrix sort of drives a lot of the
use cases around machine learning we
feel that if you have a sort of super
low cognition job which is highly
repeatable like think about accounting
you know what counties are essentially
been automated by these smart sort of
software backends you get to something
very complex like a hotel maid you know
folding a hotel towel in a bathroom
that's a really challenging thing for a
machine to do right now so I think
there's gonna be a continuum of
opportunities as entrepreneurs look at
these these fields or you can find good
places and bad places to put machine
intelligence to work that reminds me of
maybe we it would be worth talking about
what is what are the difference between
the things that machine learning and
systems that use artificial intelligence
can do today versus the ones we that we
keep seeing in movies we keep getting
excited about and dreaming about but
really
we're not gonna see in the streets for
another 10 or 20 years like what's the
your take on that
oh there's I mean the nuance here that I
think has been brought out is very
importantly is whether or not something
can be done or whether it should be done
so whether machine learning should be
used for this particular application and
not necessarily it can it be used I
think you know there's there's lines of
research fairly recently into trying to
develop methods for actually
understanding the thought process if you
will behind the machine learning
algorithms to try to interrogate that
black box and so in some kind of quasi
forensic way understand why it made a
decision that it did I think if
researchers you know people down the
street here can make progress in that
domain I think it unlocks potential in
these safety critical environments that
I was mentioning earlier right yeah I
think what distinction we draw is
between you know I think the perfect
example of an application or a use case
that I would love to see but I don't
think I will in my lifetime is anybody
was a fan of the Jetsons you know that
the robot made who did everything in the
house from you know picking up the
laundry to making the dinner to
hoovering the floor that's a super
challenging problem because it is such
an unstructured you know so many
different things in terms of the
interaction with the physical world I
think you know the machine learning
algorithms can probably handle sort of
atoms to bits we're going from bits back
to atoms again is a really challenging
thing to do so that's I think one area
where we'll see it from like an
artificial intelligence sort of research
domain perspective this concept of a
specific intelligence versus of general
intelligence I think you know specific
problems will be solved but general
purpose you know helpful machines will
be a lot more challenging I think
another challenge I think that we will
see that machine learning will have to
overcome is the environment of
irrationality right think of ourselves
trying to hail a cab in New York City at
5:30 in the evening and you're in
downtown Tribeca and trying to get up to
say upper Upper West Side right after
choices I have an autonomous car and I
have you know one of the yellow cabs
obviously the cab is really dirty but
guess which one I choose in this hybrid
environment where humans exist along
with you know autonomous you know
driving techniques I would choose that
yellow cab any day
especially if I want to miss a flight or
an important appointment why because he
drives irrationally and I think about
the playing chicken thing right
pedestrian crossing they're already
looking at him and saying let's see who
plays chicken here you know you know my
autonomous car is always going to take
the safe route so until the point of
time so admitting with two hours with
the autonomous car will take me 30
minutes but yeah I might have a heart
attack on the way with the yellow cab
but I'll still get to my appointment I'm
just trying to make the point here
drawing out the absurdities of faith and
what the the thing that we're trying to
see here is the environmental conditions
that that surround the problem that
you're trying to stall as long as we
live in a hybrid environment the
complexity involved with our machine
learning techniques have to be even
higher than one where everything is
connected and everything is very
rational those are much easier to design
but unfortunately we live in a world
where we're beginning with a much higher
you know problem to solve and then
scaling down right and Karl used to a
touched on something that we've
discussed - that's very interesting it's
like should we build these systems even
if we can so that's when epics kind of
comes in and some I was talking about
that earlier so I I mean clearly there's
a technology piece that either it will
be ready or not then there is the human
piece like can we tolerate it and then
there is the ethics right so maybe you
want to say what's your take on and what
should we be thinking about or what
should companies be thinking about when
taking these on one of my fears is I
think the technology is sort of
advancing at a pretty fast pace and I
think the policy issues related to
ethics and other things are sort of not
keeping pace with the technology
advances right you know we talked about
the the classic trolley problem right
you know in an autonomous driving
scenario somebody is gonna the system is
going to make the decision and somebody
is going to feed data to train the
system to act in a particular way what
is the right decision here right and if
I sort of you know use a system that is
built by Newton of me
will it work the same way as a system
built by somebody else should it be same
should it not be the same whether you
want to have some level of policy
control to decide what action should be
taken
versus where you let like the different
technology providers in the different
sort of you know
models that are being trained to make
the right to make the so-called right
decision for what they seem is right
right I think there's a tremendous
amount of work that needs to happen and
I don't think we are spending enough
time thinking about those aspects of
what it means to live in a world where
there's gonna be more machine learning
or a lot of intelligence driven systems
there are going to play a critical part
in our fundamental day-to-day activities
yeah I think it's a really valuable
point by Silla I think as humans we
struggle with exponential change right
and it's very hard to internalize that
technology is accelerating every year
and as sort of capabilities are put into
play by you know infrastructure vendors
like Qualcomm and Intel and NVIDIA and
others it just enables a whole host of
applications to become solvable that
maybe weren't solvable twelve months ago
24 months ago it's on this constant you
know 18 to 24 months cycle just
unstoppable and I think one way to solve
that might be or sort of get around
those those those thorny issues might be
the concept of augmenting humans right
so it's not a purely standalone machine
intelligence making life-and-death
decisions it's helping humans make
better decisions with the ability to
this you know massive super intelligence
which can spawn powder and is making for
instance from incomplete data helping
them to make those decisions yeah we
certainly adhere to that we we cannot
augmented intelligence as opposed to
artificial intelligence for that reason
because we with our point of view is
that it shouldn't really be artificial
and independent from the human but it
really should be supporting and
augmenting that whatever we're trying to
do and that I think that's an ethical
point of view right that we're taking
right there yeah did you so you're
building autonomous cars right so cool I
mean it's a really interesting topic for
discussion at the moment it's it's kind
of a parlor discussion because you know
we don't really have good techniques or
you know reasoning about complex ethical
scenarios from a machine intelligence
point of view you know it's not clear
that machine learning per se would be
the right tool to use in those cases I
mean machine learning is good at
observing imitating and adapting ethics
is something of a different topic I
think when we think about that from a
naive
we might think about codifying a set of
rules that a machine would follow in a
complex scenario the difficulty today is
that you know it often implies that
we've got sufficiently rich information
to make a complex judgment in the case
of a car in this trolley problem example
for those who aren't familiar it's this
scenario where you know if you had to
get in an accident should you turn right
and hit the elderly grandmother or
should you turn left and hit the school
bus full of children and how do you
weigh these two options the fact is we
we typically lack the inputs required to
make such a decision in other words when
we look out at the world we can't tell
if that's person is an adult male female
elderly a good person a bad person an
atheistic Christian you know any of
these inputs we might want to have
somehow and then even if we could it
really places a very high bar on the
Machine I mean to be totally Frank the
whole conversation makes me a little
nervous
from a from now from a technical
perspective he doesn't engineer because
I think boy this is a really high bar to
place on the technology we as humans in
a scenario like that I would say
virtually none of us would be able to
make a reason principles ethically
correct in some sense choice in the
fraction of a second you would have to
make that judgment by as a society kind
of this conversation implicitly putting
that burden on the machine intelligence
you know I think we're setting ourselves
up as a community for disappointment I
do think it's a valuable conversation to
have I just think we have to be
realistic about how this will be
deployed in products over the coming
years and it and it comes back to the
point about sense of control or loss of
control there so I saw one of the
startup pitches of drones for Humanity a
very interesting idea right and the
thought going in my head was if it's
going to do visual recognition or vision
based recognition of how many people are
in distress in one place versus another
if you have one place which has got five
people which are on top of a roof
needing help and it needs to make
payload drop versus another world place
towards there 500 people in far more you
know challenging conditions which one
were to choose will you just drop it at
the first one or not so that's where
you've given up control to the machine
to make that drop or it has to be
controlled somewhere in the backend so
somebody to make that judgment call this
is what I mean by the sense of control
on that one axis of where should I be
dropping that payload so I give you a
simple example so we come from Union
environment so you know some of our
unions of the UAW the United Steel
Workers and that's kind of Detroit you
know you know that's nice muscle city
you know Motor City whatever you want to
call it but the big question when we
were designing our product was from an
ethical perspective was saying Sokka
that's great that you are able to warn
people when somebody gets into an area
which they're not supposed to be in
restricted access area or somebody as
high gas levels in their environments or
somebody just had a fall but I don't
want my supervisor to have the ability
to know how long has you know has been
been smoking or how long of a break has
you been taking in the restroom and now
where do you have the ethical lines to
design the system you do because you're
capturing that data anyways now how do
you firstly handle that data how do you
suppress it how do you bring it out
those are questions that from an
engineer's perspective is as hellish to
determine I imagine adding a machine
layer and machine learning complexity on
top that's going to become a whole
different level of you know a whole
different level of hairball that you've
got to deal with when you when you take
it to that level of understanding that's
a good I think a great point and to kind
of follow on as I circle back to another
point that was discussed earlier you
know think we think about the worst case
there is when something happens where
the machine didn't behave as it would an
injury results whatever the case may be
no there will be a need they'll be in
it's a human instinct to want to
understand why it happened why did in
the case of a person you ask them well
why did you do that why do you do the
thing you did in the case machine you
want to do the same thing you want to
understand why it did the thing it did
you know we live in a world where all of
us fly airplanes you know in our case
every other day or frequently and planes
crash you know they fall out of the sky
but we do it anyway
because the risk is below some threshold
and I think also because when accident
happen there's a international effort
and interest in understanding well why
did that happen I think as people we can
take comfort in the fact that if we can
understand why it happened we can
correct it so it doesn't happen again in
the case of machine learning in the
absence of that ability to really
interrogate those systems I think
there'll be a lot more resistance to
putting these systems in positions where
they have to you know reason judge make
safety critical decisions exactly I mean
I think that's so what I was trying to
get to when I asked what are the types
of use cases or what are the
intelligence that we're gonna be really
delegating to machines right because we
don't want to delegate the decision we
make that very clear but so can they do
the understanding of huge amounts of
text for us can they reason on them tags
and then provide that evidence right so
that we humans make the decision so I
think that we can still have all agree
that that would be a pretty good set of
use cases right there so maybe back to
the technology now since we've been
talking about the human side and the
ethics so what are the exact existing
limitations of machine learning methods
that we currently have at hand so I
think I will take a stab at this and the
kepi interesting for you Carl as well
like one question we think about a lot
is sort of the system architecture
between stuff that happens in the cloud
with all the processing that's there and
stuff that happens on the edge of the
network so if you think about a
self-driving car which you know what the
best will in the world connectivity to
car is you know it's okay but it's not
great a lot of the time if I'm relying
on the centralized command and control
to control my driving and make decisions
for me if my radio crops that that's
kind of a bad situation to be in
so the ability to build sort of
lightweight smart you know possibly
resource constrained processing models
that sit in very distributed computing
architectures think that's that that's
something we think about a lot
interesting Qualcomm makes those chips
yep
yeah the other thing to think about is
in that in that context just like cars
think about a mine or a steel mill or
aluminum roof you know
an alumina refinery for that matter now
or a petroleum refinery I think of the
amount of metal in these environments
and a lot of the traditional IOT big
data models fail in these environments
because first of all you're not allowed
to carry your cell phone in these
environments because you know these are
intrinsically unsafe which what means is
it can cause it a spark by the fact that
it's an electronic device and hence
cause a bigger explosion if you have the
traditional channel missing in these big
environments of mining steel and so
forth then your device is automatically
a hybrid model where it's you know the
design itself has to be a lot of the m/l
components of it are lightweight amount
components of it have to reside on the
edge device on the wearable or on the
whatever is the device and the front end
so while there's a lot of talk off late
of taking everything back to the cloud
I think our the form believe that there
are certain industries where latency
requirements network requirements demand
that the mo light versions gets pushed
out back to the client it's like the old
IBM vs. so my excuse me the Microsoft
Intel debate of IBM when I was in XIV M
or push everything back to mainframe vs.
and then you know forget about the
powerful Wintel platform and now I'm the
other end saying no push a little bit
more out to the smart in the front and
because the other thing about ml that's
interesting is at some point of time
we're gonna run out of pipe capacity
right just just to give you a sense our
hard hats generate 17 megabytes of data
or uncompressed data without audio and
video every eight hours shift now
assuming that NS in a sample refinery
have 3,000 people working in a shift
with another 4,500 contractors I think
of the amount of data that's hitting it
now ml can actually be under the radar
it's not visible to the human the human
interaction where you say let me figure
out how I optimize what goes back and
through so I can optimize pipe you know
pipe for lack of a better word so those
are other areas to think about where the
limitations could be and what you need
to design around but you know I love
what Paul said about if you cannot at
the end of the day do that postmortem as
to why things went wrong and if it
remains a black box
it remains a black box one on one
decision modeling in business school
where if you can't explain your model
I'm sorry mate doesn't that doesn't make
any sense right yeah I think you know
this black box nature I would add
scalability you know we want to apply
machine learning to increasingly complex
problems the more complex the problem
the higher the dimensionality the longer
it takes to train models for these
problems you know we've got a lot of
compute power in the world so these days
we can tackle quite complex problems and
reasonable lot of time but there's
another kind of dimension to that is
kind of the scope of the problem so for
example the limitation inherent and
machine learning by the very nature of
the fact that it's data-driven so by
that I mean machine learning can be very
good at learning models based on the
data that it's seen it's not very good
at generalizing two scenarios that it
has an encounter before data of
hesitating and that's you know that can
be that can be tricky what you'd love to
do is be able to give the technology a
few examples and have it learned general
enough models that it can then apply
those examples to scenarios that had
never been trained on more commonly the
case is if you wanted to recognize you
know dogs you give it examples of every
type of dog you can find and you're
confident that when it sees those types
of dogs again it'll recognize as a dog
but I would say today there's
limitations there it's not the case that
you can expect the system to generalize
robustly right perfect
so I think I'm gonna I'm gonna make sure
that the you guys have time to ask
questions since I've been asking a lot
of questions anybody there's someone in
the back okay
so I'll repeat the question for the
video is asking about bias and what are
the implications on systems that is
machine learning
right so I would say that like them it's
a classic problem of like now hey the
person who's feeding in data what bias
they have what they don't have and how
does that translate into it because it's
all about like 'no as you feed in
massive amounts of data to train the
models if there is any bias that is sort
of you know whether advertently or
inadvertently introduced into that and
not that bias is going to show through
and it's going to get replicated and the
decisions that get made are going to be
a reflection of that right there have
been sort of you know classic reports of
what like in a hey you know when google
surfaces ads right somebody has done a
study to figure out that like 80% of the
ads that gets are phased for high paying
jobs or surface - men why did that
happen
like did somebody like you know
consciously make a decision that that's
what they're going to do or was it sort
of some you know inherent bias that got
injected into the system without people
realizing that I think those are all you
know I sort of think about them as like
in the same context of ethics that we we
talk to put in the past care nothing
right how do you make sure that the data
that sort of is used to train the model
is as unbiased as realistically possible
knowing there is lot of human beings
involved in sort of you know that they
are getting fed into the machine
learning models I have more of a macro
question based on the upside and
downside risks were discussed today how
do you see this trend towards machine
learning and AI playing out in emerging
markets where the infrastructure of
course is less develop as it is here in
the US and the regulations will adapt
even more slowly that they could be
adopted here
that's a great question
yeah you've stopped me on that one Mitch
but when you think about it these
emerging markets are always the place to
leapfrog right think about connectivity
issues in the mid 90s and how now mobile
medicine is so prevalent in these you
know sub-saharan you know India Pakistan
you know South Asian markets per se with
mobile connectivity is certainly
becoming the bridge so I think you would
see these markets in itself evolve on
their own organically you know just to
give a simple example I think it'll be
very difficult and very presumptuous of
us to say okay this is the model that
fits these emerging markets that goes
back to the example of the Whirlpool
washing machine er know if you ever
heard this example you know back in
India when whirlpool was launching its
washing machines they thought you know
this markets gonna be on fire people are
gonna it conserves less water and
suddenly they realize people don't use
it to make you know wash clothes anymore
happen the northern part of India they
use it as a continuous yogurt store for
last see you know in our last year's so
it was just sugar being fed in yogurt
and the next things coming out of the
pipe is nasi so that's exactly what
you've got to be aware of like any
machine learning technique that you
think you can come up here and out think
people from there they'll out think you
better than there because they're know
the ground conditions they're better
than anybody else can presume it and you
have to just let that organically come
up on its own
so you may see a lot of heavy machine
learning on the client side because of
the lack of good connectivity right so
this could be certain certain
presumptions you can make but believe me
you'll always be surprised when the end
results come out you have an eager
question over there so like you said
machine learning can encompass quite a
few different use cases so I had a
question on the competitive landscape
for a machine learning right now because
you have really large enterprise
companies like Google IBM kind of making
their play in the space and you have a
bunch of small startups so where'd who
do you think will ultimately lead in the
space is it more of an enterprise play
or tiny startups so I can give you I
think two years ago three years ago you
asked me I would have said the data
aggregators the big guys to Google's the
Facebook's they had an inherent
advantage just because the amount of
data they could gather I think my view
on that has changed in the last two
I believe startup companies can be very
successful because no techniques have
evolved to where you don't need to have
you know Google's hundred zillion hours
of training data you can actually build
very effective models with much more
sparse data sets so I see a big coming
we funded a number of machine learning
based you know computer vision image
recognition companies we're competing
directly with the Facebook's and oodles
and we think they'll be just fine yeah I
agree I mean there's techniques for
synthesizing data for example techniques
reasons partial data sets I mean the
currency is really you know the smarts
behind the algorithm the team I think
what we're seeing in across space is
often is that the team is valued as much
as more or more as the technology
whether that persists is a little bit
hard to say if the technology all starts
to plateau maybe maybe not but at the
moment I think for the foreseeable
future I wouldn't expect that to change
sorry just a round up one last thing on
that I do agree with both these gates
but also say that legging on there is
they're gonna be like you know probably
a smaller number of machine learning
platform folks and then a lot of people
who are gonna use machine learning
platforms and models and algorithms and
feed their own data for sort of no
specific use cases or industry specific
things I think there is a tremendous
amount of opportunity for all kinds of
companies including startups to be able
to like have a meaningful impact in this
space exactly I was gonna say like the
platforms are lowering the bar and so
for entrance it's much easier for anyone
to get to these machine learning models
and even data alright so there is a
couple like thank you very much but to
be here is that allow it to take any
more questions ok all right
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
