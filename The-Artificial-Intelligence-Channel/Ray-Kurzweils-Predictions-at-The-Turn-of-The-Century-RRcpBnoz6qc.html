ignition which is part of artificial
intelligence where we try to make
computers recognize patterns which is
actually the heart of human intelligence
and I had a system that you could feed
in melodies of a human composer
and it would recognize patterns and then
create original melodies in the same
style so in the melodies were
recognizable as as sort of as being a
student of that composer so the
compositions would sound like a
third-rate Mozart and yeah they won
first prize in the in the international
science fair and Westinghouse Science
Talent Search was one of the winners and
you know went on I've got a secret I I
went on played a piece of music and then
whispered in Steve Allen's ear I built
my own computer and he said well that's
impressive what's I have to do with the
piece of music he just played and said
well the computer composed the piece of
music and then best Meyerson it was a
former Miss America with stumps but then
Henry Morgan who was a film star
actually guessed it which was pretty
insightful computers were not that
well-known at that time that was my
first exposure and so being able to
communicate with a large audience and
gave me some of the excitement of
inventing being able to move people with
projects that didn't directly help
people in their lives but that's the
exciting citement of inventing as
opposed to discovering science
technology builds on science but it
really applies it to a way that that
moves people and it is a form of of
magic you take just a mundane set of
materials or a mundane set of computer
instructions but in just the right
combination it does something that that
delights people or maybe even help them
or changes their lives and that's the
exciting aspect of inventing for me
I have tried to pick technologies and
applications that would have a impacts
on people's lives whether it's creating
music or helping overcome disability is
that that's what really excites me is
that again that linkage between DRI
formulas on a blackboard and the power
of these ideas to transform people's
lives and it's something that you know I
enjoy contributing to and working with
my colleagues to to accomplish that the
reading machine for the blind actually
started out as a technology a solution
in search of a problem we had this omni
font optical character recognition that
could recognize print in any type style
we didn't really know what it would be
good for and I haven't to sit next to
this blind guy in a plane and he
explained about the blind the reading
problem that blind people have that very
little is available in Braille and
talking books and he'd like to be able
access ordinary printed material and so
that that then seemed like a very
exciting like wow we could actually
apply this technology to that problem
and Steve wanted happiness see me on a
TV show and the Today Show demonstrating
this when we announced it and just
literally dropped by and picked up our
first production unit and that's done
that was a quarter of a century ago was
1976 and so we've had a long-term
friendship and he's actually quite
sophisticated about technology and he's
the one who articulated the problem in
the world of music that led to my
starting personal music systems that on
the one hand we there were these
exciting control techniques computerized
methods where you could computer could
remember what you play and you could
play multiple tracks and play a whole
Orchestra by yourself but the sounds
that yet to work with a very thin at
that time 1982 when you've selected
piano it didn't sound like a piano sound
like an organ he selected violin sound
like
organ wouldn't it be great if we
combined these very powerful control
methods with the beautiful rich complex
sounds of acoustic instruments and I
felt that again signal processing
pattern recognition these fields could
could solve those problems and Stevie
Wonder agreed to be our musical adviser
and we started crystal music and in 1984
we had an instrument that when you
selected pan I really did sound like a
piano and we were able to fool concert
pianists so whether they were listening
to a piano or or crystal 252 and I've
continued to collaborate with Stevie
Wonder over these several decades on
different technologies both in the
disabilities field and the music field
both areas that have where technology
has played a strong role
what I see is is quite different than
what a lot of people see because I think
a major failing of even some very
thoughtful observers is the real
implications of the acceleration of
technological change if you say the
technical change is accelerating people
work are quick to agree with that it's
just sort of motherhood and apple pie
but people don't really incorporate that
and I call this the intuitive linear
view versus the historical exponential
view people assume that in the next 50
years we'll see 50 years of progress at
today's rate of progress and I've had
these arguments people will say oh well
we won't seem down Oh technology self
replicators for a hundred years I'd say
well yes a hundred years at today's rate
of progress which will take 25 years
we're doubling the paradigm shift rate
every 10 years I mean that that's
something I pulled out of the air I've
been studying this and have models of it
that means the 21st century will not be
a hundred years of progress it'll be
twenty thousand years of progress at
today's rate of progress and the 20th
century was not a hundred years it was
25 years at today's rate of progress
because we weren't going at this rate of
progress for the whole century so the
21st century will be a thousand times
greater in terms of technological change
than the 20th century the 20th century
is pretty profound and that's that's
quite a different view than if you just
think in linear terms which most people
do despite the fact that they live
through this this acceleration but they
assume that it's going to stop or they
just don't think about it and we're
going to be profoundly redefining our
own bodies our own brains we're going to
be expanding our and our intelligence or
intimate connection with intelligent
machines we're going to be spending a
lot of time in virtual reality which
will incorporate all of our senses and
because it's complicated to explain all
of that but I do see the future will be
very different but it will be a
extension of human civilization it'll
all be derivative of human intelligence
and will reflect human values and it'll
be index
and continued expansion really because
we've been growing exponentially our
knowledge is growing exponentially and
we will continue that through the 21st
century and it's really the next step in
in evolution technological evolution
actually continued biological evolution
you can see that very clearly we first
paradigm shifts took billions of years
and sped up and was taken over by
technological evolution and now paradigm
shifts take just a few years time and we
the next step in evolution will be our
enhancing our own intelligence through
intimate connection with machine
intelligence we see very powerful trends
and we see that for example computer
powers from growing exponentially and if
people say okay but and wars law is
going to come to an end but in fact what
I've seen is that every time one
paradigm comes to an end we replace it
with another one we've done that already
five times in computation so we can I
think anticipates enormous power in all
of these technologies what they'll be
applied for we can't imagine all of the
innovation that will occur but I see it
is fundamentally a spiritual process and
the word God has is really an ideal of
and has been described as infinite
intelligence creativity beauty love
all-knowing and what we see in evolution
is that intelligence beauty creativity
grows at an exponential rate and gets
greater and greater never becomes
infinite but becomes enormous ly more
powerful growing exponentially
therefore becoming closer or more
godlike but never really reaching that
ideal so it's moving in that spiritual
direction so I see evolution as a
spiritual process and I see technology
as the cutting edge of that of that
process and it is it is the human
species which is different from any
other species and that other species
that use tools but they don't evolve
over generations the way ours do taking
the next step in evolution by merging
with our technology and continue
to grow in this sort of exponentially
accelerating condition
that particular writer I think is
dealing with the issue consciousness
which is a supremely subtle slippery
issue ultimately the most important
issue I don't think it's a scientific
issue and I don't and it's saying that I
don't mean to dismiss it I really mean
to say that there's room for or
importance to fields of philosophy and
religion that go beyond science
they really do deal with these issues of
who is conscious and and and deep
respect for consciousness so the
ultimate reality and Western thinking
has been that this is all the swirling
mattered and finally evolves to be
complex enough and you get entities that
are conscious whereas for the risk of of
simplification that Eastern and Buddhist
ways of thinking of very often started
with the premise that consciousness is
the ultimate reality and that
consciousness basically creates the
world of of of energy and matter in our
thoughts and we think things and and
those thoughts then be manifest
themselves and what we consider to be
physical reality and I think in fields
such as quantum mechanics we're finding
there's a blend of both and that there's
some interaction that's deeply
mysterious between consciousness in the
material world I don't think there's
anything is a consciousness detector I
mean I think we will have machines that
have the complexity richness and
subtlety of human behavior I mean right
now it's very easy to dismiss machines
because there's still a million times
simpler than human beings so they don't
have all the endearing qualities if you
have a virtual character that claims to
be conscious and have feelings so
quickly reach the limits of their
performance and they lack the subtle
cues that we associated with really
having consciousness and emotion that
it's not it's not an effective
impression but we will reach we will
achieve machines in a few decades that
have the complexity and richness of
human thinking in many ways they'll be
derivative of human thinking
even copies of human thinking in a
different medium and they'll have the
richness of behavior and when they claim
to be having feelings and being
conscious people will believe them if we
don't believe them they'll get mad at us
but there'll be philosophers who come
along and say yes that entity is a
really great simulation of a human and
it really does is very convincing but it
doesn't squirt neurotransmitters so it
can't be conscious and there's no way to
really settle that argument there's no
machine you can put it in and a light
will go on that yes this entity is
conscious it becomes fundamentally a
deeply philosophical issue but I think
the reality will be that we will accept
the consciousness of these entities and
there won't be a clear distinction and
we're gonna have human minds brains that
have non-biological thinking processes
melded with biological ones we'll have
fully non-biological thinking processes
that that seem very human life because
they're derived from human thinking and
it's gonna be many different subtle ways
of interacting of the two worlds
interacting and it's not going to be a
clear distinction between human and
machine if you describe today's world to
people a hundred years ago they were
they would find many things we talked
about totally mystifying even people
from 10 years ago but we don't we don't
wake up suddenly in the year 2040 we get
their day at a time and it's actually
interesting how quickly we adjust to new
developments that that seem remarkable
we kind of hear about them before they
happen and when they happen they don't
really happen because they don't quite
work yet then they start working a
little bit better by the time they work
well it's not news anymore because we've
been hearing about it for many years and
we kind of get used to these you know
gradually evolving changes we have a
great deal of plasticity as a species
and what we can accept so and I in each
we get there a step at a time and each
increment makes sense as it happens so I
think it'll be part of everyday reality
I think what's a machine achieves a
human level of intelligence
it'll combine it with some natural
advantages of machines have machines can
share their knowledge my knowledge of a
subject is you know a pattern of energy
and matter pattern of internal
connections and neurotransmitter
concentrations and I can't take that
pattern and download it to your brain
I can maybe take months to explain
something and you can explain things to
me but it's a very slow process but
machines can instantly share these these
patterns and they're ultimately much
faster or we use this chemical
information processing that's ten
million times slower than electronic
circuits and we can't remember things
very precisely so a machine will be able
to once it actually achieves some of the
subtlety of human intelligence based on
our chaotic massively parallel thinking
processes it'll be able to combine that
with some of these natural advantages of
machines until machine intelligence the
machines will continue to evolve
exponentially the word never is also
subject to the law of accelerating
returns it used to be when people said
things will never happen it actually
took 40 or 50 years before they happened
and now when people say things will
never happen we see them in five or ten
years so it's also an accelerating
process and deep-blue use only one
narrow technique in artificial
intelligence which is a recursive search
just brute force of looking at all the
different possible moves and then
counter moves and building up this tree
and there's a few other tricks to it but
it it's not it was not using pattern
recognition which is a sort of chaotic
highly parallel self-organizing process
we have in the brain but that that's
actually my field and that's not
exclusively a human province we can
create machines built on those same
principles and they'll have some of the
same properties they won't be perfect
but they'll be able to see insights and
recognize patterns that are extremely
subtle and once we combine that kind of
thinking with some of the logical
analysis that computers have always been
very good at that that'll be a very
powerful combination and you know
Kasparov is commenting on this one
machine that he
encountered and then thinking that
that's never going to change and well
that machine may be able to play chess
but really can't talk about chess and
doesn't really understand some the
context of chess and historical level
but that doesn't mean that no machine
ever will
well first
kind of an urban area Jackson Heights
and then we moved to more suburban area
I went to public high school although
actually it was a very good science
program there we had more Westinghouse
winnards and any other high school in
the country actually I always had a
project I was working on I always had
one good friend I had some intense
friendships I wasn't good garius but I
wasn't a classical nerd either and I
knew I wanted to be scientist from age
five but actually they're nice
understand what a scientist was and what
I really wanted to do was be an inventor
I mean I liked creating things some kind
of magic you put materials together and
something happens that goes beyond what
you put into it if you get the
combination just right for some reason I
decided I wanted to build a rocket ship
and it was amazing to me that you could
put these ordinary materials together
and then take a trip to another world
didn't work but so I learned that lesson
but I kept I kept at it discovered the
computer at age 12 and that did bring me
to other worlds or subjective worlds
there was a fascination with science
then that emerged this was the 1950s my
parents found it surprising they were
both artists but they courage it because
science was the thing to do so my father
was a musician he always felt actually I
would combine computers and music
because he felt there was a natural
affinity and he actually had an interest
in the 1960s and some of the early
synthesizer work
her mother was was and still as a visual
artist but I had a lot of scientists in
my family actually my grandmother was
believed the first woman in Europe to
get a PhD in chemistry and she lectured
in Europe and she also ran a school for
girls and so I came from an intellectual
family
he sort of foreshadowed my combining
computers and music he had a fascination
with some of the early synthesizers in
the 1960s he died 1970 and he said that
someday you will combine computers and
music and he saw an affinity both the
ability of computers to create sound and
the ability of computers to control
sound he saw that there was a natural
affinity there for those two worlds
he felt that music has always used the
most advanced methods available in 19th
century the the ultimate in the crafts
wood making crafts and and metal crafts
were used to make instruments like the
piano there was the piano action is a
very complex mechanical linkage and it's
the ultimate in 19th century technology
and so we've always used advanced
technologies and in all of the arts
particularly in music and since music
has a relationship to mathematics it has
a has a linkage to science and
technology
remember math teacher mr. Ewan actually
a math teacher in eighth grade mrs. Matt
well who got excited about my Diaz
wanted to listen to them and my mother
actually was kind of a fan of my ideas
and would listen to them Marvin Minsky
actually communicated with in high
school and came to visit him came up to
Boston and to my delight you know it
took me a high school student there
serious lazy we take a professor I mean
that is his approach he took treats
everybody the same I think he really
doesn't care if somebody's a professor
or high school student or he's very
excited with ideas and very honest with
his reactions but that that
encouragement was important to me I've
always been very relentless and managed
to find a way to get the resources the
hardest one of which is my own time to
get ideas to see ideas through and
that's an important aspect of success
it's just not to recognize failure I
mean failure is just sort of success
deferred just mean it's gonna just take
you a little bit longer but where an
idea becomes so real to you that it
absolutely is real even though it may
not be real to anybody else and then
it's just a matter of carrying out this
plan that has emerged in your head and
you work backwards from this vision from
this fantasy that becomes very real and
then imagine well okay how how can we
act how can we work backwards if that
word exists what would have had to have
happened and then it lays out a path
that you kind of work out in Reverse and
then you just follow it and you have to
be very very persistent in doing them
but persistence you persistence towards
our vision usually works that's been my
experience
at age 12 I discovered the computer
which was not as a bit Kurtis as it is
today but I had opportunity through my
uncle to get access to a computer its
affiliated with New York University and
and then discovered the ability of
computers to kind of model reality and
that was very exciting you could create
the world in a computer admittedly
crudely back then but I think I sense
the potential to do that and really
recreate any aspect of reality and that
has been a theme of my thinking and I
think we'll see that emerge in the 21st
century where it really can recreate our
experiences and recreate the world
through virtual reality and that'll be
the nature of the web in the 21st
century but that that's kind of kind of
had a hint of that at age 12 and got
involved in computer programming
actually did some statistical
programming there was distributed sort
of as shareware
built the computer back then that did
some was able to do some calculations
got really interested in pattern
recognition the power of that because
that's really the heart of human
thinking is our ability to recognize
patterns in high school
I was probably influenced buying the
popular culture which I think in the 50s
began to discover science as important
and that that built that I guess in the
60s with the space race and all of that
there was a real public emphasis on
science and but it was never abstract an
abstract issue for me it was really the
ability to to create create new worlds I
actually had an interest in magic as a
young child also from the age of five I
mean traditional magic tricks and
sometimes we would sort of invent my own
little tricks based on some of the
principles I learned from tricks I had
bought and I just acquire lots of magic
tricks and put on magic shows for my
family and so there was something
delightful in fact again you took
ordinary materials just mirrors and
things and if you did things in exact
sequence people would be intrigued with
that it would have an effect but quickly
realized that that was a superficial
form of magic because once the secrets
were revealed the magic would disappear
and the profound aspect of technology is
that once the secrets are revealed the
magic doesn't disappear in fact it
provides knowledge and power to create
the next generation of technology which
will be even more powerful so in a sense
the computer and Technology were more
meaningful forms of of magic but there's
still that magic of getting materials in
just the right sequence to create an
effect that can be very profound and
change our lives and not just the
technology I would create but I became
interested in technology in general and
I've been a student of technology trends
very interested in technology even of
the future which gives me the
opportunity to invent with materials
that don't exist today alan kate says to
anticipate the future you need to invent
it and
but you need to have some sense of what
will be available in the future to
invent with so a kids new opportunity
actually invent things 20 years out
through through writing which gets to be
more abstract you're not dealing with
actual materials I mean my first
inventions were physical and then moved
on to software which is more abstract
and then to really the world of ideas
which is more abstract yet but ideas are
very a very powerful of those really the
most powerful entity that we that we
have and just take the concept of money
it's an abstraction it's just an idea
and yet everybody respects it even if
they don't respect the concept at some
level everybody agrees to this elaborate
system but it's all an abstraction it's
all an idea that's just one example of
the power of ideas and that's something
unique in our species that ideas have
this kind of power over us and then
there's things that we come up with and
the ideas evolved that's something that
that we don't see in other species
that was my first business we matched up
high school students to colleges by
computer we built this database with
several millions of pieces of
information about the several thousand
colleges and we would students would
fill out of three hundred questions
questionnaire and we would match them up
not tell them where to go but tell them
okay his fifteen or twenty schools that
you ought to narrow your search down to
that these are really appropriate for
for you to research further well just
having been through the the process of
applying to college I saw it as a need
and so I could feel viscerally the need
for that kind of information and I could
and I saw among my fellow students how
difficult the process I was and today
there's much better information
available with the web and you can visit
colleges on the web and and get there's
just much better information back then
none of that existed and we really was
very difficult to find out about what
schools matched your interests and we're
appropriate and I just saw lots of
students struggling with that and making
the wrong decisions and felt that
computer could really be a powerful tool
for making that connection providing a
little bit of intelligence based on this
information and it really did work quite
well we sold it to our corporation world
now Harcourt brace jovanovich the New
York publishing company
I think school was always just an
environment when I got to MIT that was a
there was a more satisfying environment
and that you had some really stimulating
professors and and students with whom I
could share ideas and a few of my best
friend's still stem from that early
college period and you had tremendous
resources and you had a flux of ideas
and yet other people who were excited
with ideas and pursuing them and it
wasn't so unusual to do that so it was a
supportive environment courses
specifically they were interesting but I
mean that I felt I could learn as well
on my own as I could in a course and of
courses were useful to structure
material there weren't actually that
many computer courses when I entered MIT
they're only eight or nine of them so I
took them my first year or a year and a
half and then I majored in literature
didn't have any more computer courses
sometimes I felt different in that I
always felt I had this mission from when
I was young and so when I saw other kids
struggling and they didn't really know
what they wanted to do and I didn't look
down at that but I really felt that was
different than I was and that I knew
what my direction was well some people
are talented in many things or their
interests are more spread out they're
not sure how to apply their their skills
and I kind of knew what my mission was
my father was was very talented I got a
lot of recognition as a really brilliant
musician but was very busy and they
struggled financially there were
refugees having fled Hitler during World
War two
I was on my own a lot I think at a very
young age even before five I would I
remember building a go-kart when I was
three or four years old so I had to find
ways of sort of occupying myself with
with ideas and but I'm not sure I fully
understand the genesis of it I just know
that I've been that way there's a sense
of defiance in me and if I have
confidence in an in a set of ideas to be
resolute in that to be very questioning
of of assumptions I mean I'm always
questioning it really take nothing for
granted
and a lot of common wisdoms even what
people think are the wisdom beyond a
common wisdom I'm constantly questioning
my own assumptions and looking for some
deeper understanding or more
comprehensive framework and a feeling
that applying human thought can overcome
any obstacle and a real confidence in
that but it can take a lot of effort but
there's the confidence in the power of
just applying your attention to any kind
of problem from an interpersonal issue
to solving some of humankind's major
challenges not just myself but I believe
that our species has in
talent is really just one prerequisite
to successes a lot of other factors
certainly luck has something to do with
it and and a lot of factors beyond our
own efforts in terms of having the right
types of support and opportunities and
also picking the right problem
I mean 19 after a few successes picked a
problem that we now know he was destined
to to fail out so we brilliantly
pursuing a problem that you can't
succeed in it's to pick the right
problems at the right time but most
importantly I think is its persistence
and we see again and again whether it's
in the political sphere of or science of
people who are really relentless about
their mission and and and can see the
end result even more real than what we
consider concrete reality and follow
that mission with great confidence
succeed very often people give up too
quickly they meet a few obstacles I
think oh well that didn't work
but that confidence doesn't come from
just sort of mindlessly plowing ahead it
really comes from really being able to
envision a reality that doesn't exist
and seeing the benefit of it and so
imagination is is important
if I sort of commit myself to a
particular project or vision I I can't
recall ever really dropping any of those
commitments I mean it's it's kind of a
profound commitment I make with myself
to to see something through that doesn't
mean that there won't be tactical ships
and certain specific little projects
might get dropped but I do ultimately
try to see these projects through and
it's kind of a great adventure you don't
know what you're going to find probably
the biggest thing I struggle with is
just you know the triage of these ideas
because haven't really accelerated my
own thinking process and those of my
colleagues sufficiently yet that we can
pursue all of the exciting ideas that
that that come our way so that's one
interest I'm actually interested in one
reason I'm interested in writing about
other people's work because I can't get
them excited about the accomplishments
of others and and see other people who
are pursuing exciting ideas and don't
feel that I necessarily have to be
involved in everything myself I can
share in them by being a student of
technology
it doesn't really bother me I mean I've
I've been thinking about these ideas for
decades really they're not just idle
thoughts I've pulled out of the air I
mean there's a whole theory behind them
and sometimes we'll look at one aspect
and I think very often the biggest at
issue that will cause someone to reject
something I've said is that they're not
really internalizing and in realizing
the implications of the acceleration of
technical progress its how well that's
going to take hundreds of years not
realizing they're going to see hundreds
of years of progress in decades because
of this acceleration it just don't
really incorporate it into their into
their thinking so and you know I I'm not
saying I have a perfect crystal ball and
there's good ideas that come along that
have cost me to readjust my thinking and
criticism ultimately is more useful than
than praise I mean praises is nice but
it doesn't really cause you it doesn't
give you the ingredients to improve your
thinking even if there's a criticism
that I don't accept I'll think about
okay how does one deal with that
criticism how do you address it and that
may lead to some other useful ideas or
the or there may be some validity to a
criticism that will also cause a an
improvement or summat increment of of my
thinking about an issue so the criticism
is really quite useful and we do that
actually in our projects as a
methodology to not just sit around and
praise ourselves but you know what what
could be improved
what's wrong with with this how
technology never emerges perfect it's
always a glass half full so try to fill
it more artificial intelligence has been
called the field of computer science
dealing with problems that haven't been
solved yet every time I mean we solve a
problem people go well yeah that was
really easy to begin with and now we
understand that it's lost its mystery
and well computers still can't do X
y'see and that'll always be the case
until computers fully reach human
intelligence by that time this issue
will be put to bed but until that time
people are always going to be pointing
out something it doesn't do alright so
it does play chess all right so it can
guide cruise missiles all right it does
do medical diagnosis all right it can
predict financial markets better than
human analysts but it still doesn't
can't tell the difference you know dog
in a cat oh there's a new system that
can do that well alright it can't deal
with human language and give us a
synopsis of a part of a movie yet when
that happens we'll find some other
things computers can't do but criticism
is useful to really point the direction
how we can improve our thinking
not really but
I hope that doesn't sound arrogant
that's that's just really a personal
commitment to to a personal program and
to a set of ideas and I think if if that
kind of confidence would lead someone to
be arrogant to dogged ly pursue the
wrong ideas I think that would be that
would be unfortunate so I mean I had to
try to listen to criticism and not with
the idea that criticism is you know
necessarily wrong but feel that there's
there is value in some goals that I've
set and to try to stay on that that
course but to really keep an open mind
you know any of the ideas that I have or
that others have and a lot of the common
wisdom that we all share that's very
often found to be wrong so I keep keep
questioning everything
that's probably different ways I'm in an
ended up very often we don't understand
the significance of something until
generations after the person has
departed us but I'm I measure it in
terms of impact on on people's lives and
we could certainly see that in
technology and I think technology is a
double-edged sword I think there dangers
is a whole issue there but I think on
balance we have really raised our
species ability of as see really see as
part of evolution the sort of evolution
of our own cultural knowledge and
science and technology is part of the
evolutionary process on this on this
planet and we have overcome great
suffering if you compare our lives to
the lives of most humanity several
hundred years ago we live longer many
more people can live fulfilling lives
and pursue careers that give them
gratification that wasn't true most
humanity centuries ago and that's really
science and technology that enables us
to do that so we can measure this in
concrete ways seeing the impact these
things have on people's lives but it's
true also cultural expressions music
moves us as do all the arts and gives us
greater insight into the human condition
so at different levels of our existence
these different intellectual expressions
from art to science to technology having
a direct impact on human beings
well I think technology has always been
a double
I mean its power and its power to
advance all of humankind's varied
objectives and certainly the
destructiveness of human conflict has
been amplified by human technology we've
seen that in the 20th century I think on
balance the the benefits outweigh the
the dangers and the actual destruction
that the technology has made possible
and I think confidence is probably the
wrong word I'm hopeful that that will be
the case in 21st century the story of
the 21st century hasn't been written yet
and we have much more powerful
technologies that will emerge in the
next century and the opportunity to
really overcome age-old problems but
also exacerbate our our conflicts and
destructive potential as well and so I
think the moral dimension and ethical
issues are are also very important in
that regard and it's something that
concerns me as well I think we have no
choice but to proceed I mean there been
calls recently and they have actually
ever since the Luddite movement emerged
in the English textile industry two
centuries ago calls for a languishing
technology that it's just too dangerous
and I think we have no choice because
there's a great economic imperative to
move forward and it's a road paved with
gold and and we have received tremendous
benefit from technology and short of
creating a totalitarian system that
would ban any form of economic incentive
we're going to be advancing technology
and I think the right way to deal with
it is to be very concerned with with the
ethical dimension and with the
application of technology and I think
it's not something that's done in one
field of technology ethics I think it's
something that everybody and not just
the technologist needs to be actively
concerned with because we are we have
the power to actually create our future
world very literally
including the really redesigning our our
bodies and brains and our experiences
very profound levels and so it's
something that everybody needs to
understand and contribute to that
dialogue to make so that we do advance
our human values not that we have a
consensus of what those are but I think
there is at least at some levels of
emerging consensus on what human values
are
to an individual I would say to follow
your passion because
the greatest value we have is ideas and
knowledge and new knowledge which is
really I think the purpose of evolution
and the purpose of the human
civilization comes from passion it's not
a matter of learning Drive formulas
creating something new has to come from
some passion and passionate devotion to
an idea and so if you're passionate
about music or graphic arts or writing
or science and technology that's what
you should pursue that's how you will
contribute and we can clearly see in the
era of the internet that for example
graphic arts suddenly become enormous ly
valuable all of the different ways of
expressing ourselves have tremendous
value this tremendous thirst for content
of all kinds on the Internet and that's
going to be deepen as that technology
gets more sophisticated so follow your
passion and if you if you become
committed to an idea then then go with
it and secondly question all assumptions
not to the point of inaction I mean we
have to make certain assumptions just to
get up in the morning and go through the
day but reserved part of your thinking
for questioning the common wisdom in
every sphere not even outside of your
area of expertise there's always a
deeper wisdom if we can break through
certain assumptions something I would
say in general is to appreciate what a
remarkable time lies ahead
one of the things that's actually
growing exponentially is human lifespan
and I've got charts that show that and
we're actually adding today 120 days
every year to him in longevity 8 19th
century is only a couple of weeks a year
and now we're adding a third of a year a
year and within 10 years it's actually
going to be adding more than a year
every year and most of these the vast
majority of these
young people here will see the 22nd
century and by that time we'll have even
other things so they'll see the 23rd
century and and that century that this
21st century will be a thousand times
more profound and see a thousand times
more changed in the 20th century and
that was pretty significant
and they can contribute to that and this
going to be no shortage of opportunity
to be a player in the sort of next stage
of of evolution
the American Dream is pushing beyond our
our boundaries and to new frontiers and
those some of those new frontiers
centuries ago were conquering new land
masses but now our frontiers are
intellectual and in the area of
knowledge and in all of our cultural and
scientific endeavors there's a respect
for taking risks there's a tolerance and
even respect for failure which some
other cultures have some difficulty with
for experimenting and for and for
learning and the the trial and error
that goes with that a respect for the
individual that we're all different and
all have a contribution to make and
respect for diversity and tolerance of
of differences even though we see a lot
of prejudice and intolerance our ideals
reflect our tolerance for diversity and
I think we'll see greater diversity in
the century ahead so that's what the
American ideal the American Dream means
and I think it's a perfect set of ideals
and philosophies for this for this new
era</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
