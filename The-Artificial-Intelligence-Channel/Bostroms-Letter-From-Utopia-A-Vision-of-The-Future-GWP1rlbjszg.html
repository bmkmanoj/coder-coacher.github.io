and may this letter find you at peace
and in prosperity forgive my writing
tear out of the blue though you and I
have never met we are not strangers we
are in a certain sense the closest of
kin
I am one of your possible futures one
day I hope you will become me should
fortune grant this wish then I'm not
just a possible future of yours but your
actual future a coming face of you like
the full moon that follows a waxing
crescent or like the flower that follows
a seed I'm writing to tell you about my
life how marvelous it is that you may
choose it for yourself although this
letter uses the singular I'm really
writing on behalf of all my
contemporaries and we are addressing
ourselves to all of your contemporaries
amongst us are many who are possible
futures of your people some of us are
possible futures of children you have
not yet given birth to still others are
possible artificial persons that you
might one day create what unites us is
that we are all dependent on you to make
us real think of this note as if it were
an invitation to a ball a ball that will
take place only if people show up we
call the lives will lead here utopia how
can I tell you about utopia and not
leave you nonplussed what words could
convey the wonder what inflections
express our happiness what points
overcome your skepticism my pen I fear
is as unequal to the task as if I try to
use it against the charging elephant but
the goal of understanding is so
important that we must try even against
long odds maybe you will see through the
inadequacies of my exposition have you
ever known a moment of bliss on the
rapids of inspiration maybe where your
hands were guided by a greater forest
trace the shapes of truth and beauty or
perhaps you found such a moment in the
ecstasy of love her in the glorious
success achieved with good friends or in
a splendid conversation on a vine
overhung terrace one-star appointed
night or perhaps there was a song or
melody that smuggled itself into your
heart setting it alight with a
kaleidoscopic
emotion or during worship if you have
experienced such a moment experienced
the best type of such a moment then a
certain idle but sincere thought may
have presented itself to you Oh heaven I
didn't realize it could feel like this
this is on a different level so very
much more real and worthwhile why can't
it be like this always
why must good times end I was sleeping
and now I'm awake yet behold only a
little later scarcely an hour gone by
and the softly falling suit of ordinary
life is already piling up the silver and
gold of exuberance lose their shine the
marble becomes dirty every way you turn
it's the same suit casting its veil over
all glamorous and revelries despoiling
your epiphany sorting up your white
pressed collar and shirt and once again
that familiar be dis audible or the beat
of numbing routine rolling along its
tracks
the commuter trains loading and
unloading their passengers sleepwalkers
shoppers solicitors the ambitious and
the hopeless that contented and the
wretched like human electrons shuffling
through the circuitry of civilization we
do so easily forget how good life can be
at its best and are bad at its worst the
most outstanding occasion barely is it
over before the sweepers move in to
clean up the rice yellowing photos
remain and this is as it should be
we are in the business of living and the
show must go on special moments are out
of equilibrium experiences in which our
puddles are stirred up and splashed
about yet when normalcy returns we are
usually relieved we are built for
mundane functionality not lasting bliss
so the door that was ajar begins to
close disappearing hopes sliver behind
an insensate scab quick stop that door
look again at your yellowing photos
search for a clue do you not see it do
you not feel it that touch after
possible you have witnessed the
potential for a higher life you hold the
fading proofs in your hand don't throw
it away in the Attic of your mind
reserve a drawer for the notion of a
higher state of being and in the furnace
of your heart keep at least one aspiring
member alive I'm summoning this memory
of your best experience to what end in
the hope of kindling in you a desire to
share my happiness and yet what you had
in your best moments is not closed what
I have now a beckoning scintilla at most
if the distance between base and apex
for you is 8 kilometers then to reach my
dwellings would take a million light
year ascend the altitude is outside moon
and planets and all the stars your eyes
can see beyond dreams beyond imagination
my consciousness is wide and deep my
life long I have read all your authors
and much more I have experienced life in
many forms and from many angles jungle
and desert gutter and Palace Heath and
Suburban Creek and city back alley I
have sailed on the high seas of cultures
and swam and dived quite some marvelous
edifice built up over a million years by
the efforts of homunculi even as the
humble polyps amass a wreath in time and
I have seen the shoals of colored
biography fishes
each one a life story scintillate under
the heaving ocean waters the whole
exceeds the sum of its parts what I have
is not merely more of what is available
to you now it is not just the particular
things the paintings and toothpaste tube
designs the record covers and books the
epochs lives leaves rivers and random
encounters the satellite images and the
collider data it is also the complex
relationships between these particulars
that make up my mind there are ideas
that can be formed only on top of such a
wide experience base there are depths
that can be fathomed only with such
ideas you could say I am happy that I
feel good you could say that I feel
surpassing bliss but these are words
invented to describe human experience
what I feel is as far beyond human
feelings as my thoughts are beyond human
thoughts oh I wish I could show you what
I have in mind
if only I could share one second of my
conscious life with you but you don't
have to understand what I think and feel
if only you bear in mind what is
possible within the present human realm
you will have enough to get started in
the right direction one step at a time
at no point will you encounter a wall of
blinding light at no point where we have
to jettison yourself over an
end-of-the-world precipice as you
advance the horizon will recede the
transformation is profound but it can be
as gradual as the growth that made the
baby you were into the adult do you
think you are you will not achieve this
through any magic trick or hokum nor by
the power of wishful thinking nor by
semantic acrobatics meditation
affirmation or incantation I do not
presume to advise you on matters
theological ire chon you nothing more
nothing less than a reconfigured
physical situation
that challenge before you to become
fully what you are now only in hope and
potential new capacities are needed if
you wish to live and play on my level to
reach utopia you must first discover the
means to three fundamental
transformations the first transformation
secure life your body is a death trap
this vital machine and mortal vehicle
unless it jams first or crashes is sure
to rust and on you're lucky to get seven
decades of mobility eight if you'd be
fortunes darling that is not sufficient
to get started in a serious way much
less to complete the journey maturity of
the soul takes longer why even a tree
life takes longer death is not one but
the multitude of assassins do you not
see them they are coming at you from
every angle take aim at the causes of
early death infection violence
malnutrition heart attack cancer turn
your biggest gun on aging and fire you
must cease the biochemical processes in
your body in order to vanquish bind by
illness and senescence in time you will
discover ways to move your mind to more
durable media then continue to improve
the system so that the risk of death and
disease continues to decline any death
prior to the heat death of the universe
is premature if your life is good oh it
is not well to live in a self combusting
paper hut keep the flames at bay and be
prepared with liquid nitrogen while you
construct yourself a better habitation
one day you or your children should have
a secure home research build redouble
your effort
the second transformation upgrade
cognition your brains
special faculties music humor
spirituality mathematics aratus ism art
nurturing narration gossip these are
fine spirits to pour into the cup of
life blessed are you if you have a
vintage bottle of any of these better
yet a cask better yet a vineyard be not
afraid to grow the mines sellers have no
ceilings
what other capacities are possible
imagine a world with all the music dried
up what poverty what loss give your
thanks
not to the liar but to your ears for the
music and ask yourself what other
harmonies are there in the air that you
lack the ears to hear
hot vaults of value are you witless
Leedy barred from lacking the key
Sensibility had you button inkling your
nails would be clawing at the padlock
your brain must grow beyond any genius
of humankind
in its special faculties as well as its
general intelligence so that you may
better learn remember and understand and
so that you may have pre hend your own
beatitude mind is a means for without
insight you will get bogged down and
lose your way and your journey will fail
mind is also an end for it is in the
space-time of awareness that utopia will
exist may the measure of your mind be
vast and expanding Oh stupidity is a
loathsome coral you know on target the
post and you will slowly loosen them up
one day you'll break the fence that kept
your forebears captive keen on tug
redouble your effort that third
transformation elevate well-being what
is the difference between indifference
and interests boredom and thrill despair
and bliss pleasure a few grains of this
magic ingredient are worth more than a
king's treasure and we have it aplenty
here in Utopia it pervades everything we
do and every
thing we experienced we sprinkle it in
our tea the universe is cold fun is the
fire that melds the block of hardship
and creates a bubbling celebration of
life it is the birthright of every
creature
I write no less sacred for having been
trampled on since the beginning of time
there is a beauty in joy here that you
cannot fathom it feels so good that if
the sensation were translated into tears
of gratitude rivers would overflow I
reach in vain for words to convey to you
what it amounts to it's like a rain of
the most wonderful feeling where every
raindrop has its own unique and
indescribable meaning or rather it has a
scent or essence that evokes a whole
world and each such evoked world is
subtler richer deeper more
multi-dimensional than the sum total of
what you have experienced in your entire
life I will not speak of the worst pain
and misery that is to be got rid of it
is too horrible to dwell upon and you're
already cognizant of the urgency of
palliation my point is that in addition
to the removal of the negative there is
also an upside imperative to enable the
full flourishing of enjoyments that are
currently out of reach the roots of
suffering are planted deep in your brain
weeding them out and replacing them with
nutritious crops of well-being will
require advanced skills and instruments
for the cultivation of your own neuronal
soil but take heed the problem is
multiplex all emotions have a natural
function prune carefully lest you
accidentally reduce the fertility of
your plot sustainable yields are
possible yet fools will build fools
paradises I recommend you go easy on
your paradise engineering until you have
the wisdom to do it right oh what a
gruesome not suffering is pull and tug
on those loops and you will gradually
loosen them up one day the
soils will fall and you will stretch out
in delight pull and tug and be patient
in your effort may there come a time
when rising Suns are greeted with joy by
all the living creatures they shine upon
how do you find this place how long will
it take you to get here I can pass you
no blueprint for utopia no timetable no
roadmap all I can do is give you my
assurance that there is something here
the potential for a better life if you
could visit me here for but one day you
would henceforth call this place your
home this is the place where you belong
ever since one hairy creature picked up
two Flint's and began knocking them
together to make a tool this has been
the direction of your unknown aspiration
like Odysseus you must journey and never
cease to journey until you arrive upon
this Shore arrive you say but isn't the
journey the destination isn't utopia a
place that doesn't exist and isn't the
quest for utopia as witnessed
historically a dangerous folly and an
incitement to mischief my friend that is
not such a bad way for you to think
about it
to be sure utopia is not the location or
a form of social organization the blush
of health on a convalescence cheek the
sparkle of the eye in a moment of wit
the smile of a loving thought utopia is
the hope that the scattered fragments of
good that we come across from time to
time in our lives can be put together
one day to reveal the shape of a new
kind of life the kind of life that yours
should have been I fear that the pursuit
of utopia will bring out the worst in
you many a moth has been incinerated in
its pursuit of a brighter future seek
the light but approach with care and
swerve if you smell your wingtips
hinging light is for seeing
not dying when you embark on this quest
you will encounter rough seas and hard
problems to prevail he will take your
best tines your best technology and your
best politics yet each problem has a
solution my existence breaks no law of
nature the materials are all there your
people must become master builders and
then you must use these skills to build
yourself up without crushing your cores
what this tragedy in Utopia there is
tragedy in mr. snowman smelting mass
murders we have found are not required
what is weakness in Utopia weakness is
spending a day gazing into your
beloved's eyes what is imperfection in
utopia imperfection is the measure of
our love for things as they are
what is dignity in Utopia
dignity is the affirming power of no set
discriminately what is suffering in
Utopia suffering is the salt trace left
on the cheeks of those who were around
before what is courage in Utopia courage
is the monarchy of the self here
constrained by a constitution
what is solemnity in Utopia solemnity is
the appreciation of the mystery of being
what is body in Utopia body is a pair of
legs a pair of arms a trunk and head all
made of flesh or not as the case might
be what is society in Utopia society is
a never finished tapestry its weavers
equal to its threads the parts and
patterns and inexhaustible born of
beauty what is death in Utopia death is
the darkness that enshrouds all life and
our guilt for not having created utopia
as soon as we could have
we love live here every instant every
second is so good that it would blow
your mind its amperage not been
previously increased my contemporaries
and I bear witness and we are requesting
your aid please help us come into
existence
please join us whether this tremendous
possibility becomes a reality depends on
your actions if your empathy can
perceive at least the outlines of the
I am describing then you're engineered
they will find a way to make it real
human life had its best is fantastic I
am asking you to create something even
greater life that is truly humane you're
sincerely your possible future self</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
