AI we will be left behind by a lot that
is Elon Musk the inventor and
entrepreneur behind such futuristic
endeavors as Tesla SpaceX and Hyperloop
and as you heard Elon Musk has AI
artificial intelligence on his mind
these days
he says AI machines could soon outsmart
us all and his philosophy is if we can't
beat him we should join him by
implanting AI computers directly into
our brains one of the solutions is to
have an AI lair
if you think like you've got your limbic
system your cortex and then digital
layer a sort of third layer above the
cortex that could work well and
symbiotically with with you
of course turning humans into cyborgs
may sound like the stuff of science
fiction but then again that is Elon
Musk's forte so would he develop this
kind of technology himself somebody's
got to do it I'm not saying that I will
but I'm somebody's gonna do it I mean
III mean I somebody should do it and I
mean if somebody doesn't do it then I
then I think I should probably do it
well it appears he has later this week
Elon Musk will be letting the world in
on his latest venture we do know that
it's called neural ink and for more we
are joined by science journalist and
futurist George divorce kee who has been
covering this for Gizmodo George divorce
key is in Oakville Ontario hello hello
thanks for having me this morning so
what are you expecting Elon Musk to
announce later this week well I
certainly expect some more details right
now the so called neural link is quite
vague in terms of what this is what this
is supposed to look like what it's even
supposed to do the site of course from
some of the comments that musk has made
in recent months specifically though
what I am expecting to hear though will
be I guess the initial approach towards
achieving this you know this these you
know chips that will be implanted in our
brain and what we hope to accomplish
with them initially it's it's quite
conceivable that neural link will be
working not to enhance or to even you
know add AI to our brains initially but
you actually become therapeutic these
these same technologies can be used to
treat say Alzheimer's or Parkinson's
or even seizures for example and I think
that's a good pathway into this
particular area but knowing musk of
course and knowing them the kinds of
visions that he has he's not going to be
content to stop there and with the same
sorts of technologies you can now start
to perhaps modify other aspects of
cognition things like memory and
intelligence even for example
transmitting thoughts to and from a
computer just with you know with your
with just thinking about it you could
transmit your you know your memories and
your thoughts to a computer it's
difficult to say if musk will get to
that level of specificity in his
comments later this week but that's
certainly what I would probably looking
out for this week
well George that his ventures to develop
something called neuro lace can you help
us picture what that is because he used
the word lace there I'm imagining that
it is going to be a kind of mesh that
will be overlaid over certain parts of
the brain as we know the brain isn't
just this big piece of much that that
does everything and anything everywhere
we our brains are broken down into
different modules so for example if you
put this mesh or a area around the motor
cortex the area that controls movement
then this lace would pick up those
signals when we say for example I want
to move my finger or I'd like to move my
leg the lace will pick up those signals
and it will then transmit those signals
I would hope wirelessly because no one
wants to have wires sticking out of
their heads and we already do have chips
and animal models for example that can
transmit a wireless signals to a
receiving device namely a computer hence
the list which is why we're using the
word into interface here so basically it
would look like that kind of a mesh if
not a mesh or the lace could also
conceivably be a literal chip a literal
brain chip that's set again rests at a
specific area of the brain what we're
talking about something surgically
implanted though eventually absolutely
in order to get the kind of fidelity the
kind of you know this is the power of
this the signals to you know move let's
say an artificial arm or to even
transmit our thoughts we're gonna have
to get right there into the brain I mean
we do have what are called EEG
technologies today which is like a cap
you can wear on your head but the amount
of information that can be extracted
just through your electrical
externally is extremely minimal very I
mean you might be able to make a gesture
like you're thinking of moving to the
left you're thinking of moving to the
right but no no if you if you want to
get down to the to the levels that musk
is talking about we've got to get right
into the brain itself well you know
we've got somebody waiting in the wings
who's already using technology where the
brain can control a limb through you or
the brain can control movement of a
machine so what would be different with
this technology what would he really
want to use it for well I mean he wants
to save the world apparently and I mean
right now he as I mentioned earlier
there's going to be a therapeutic aspect
to it that's gonna be wonderful and he
has listed this company as a it is
listed as a medical firm so they are
going to be producing medical devices at
first and of course there this is a
multi-million dollar industry so he
knows what he's doing by you know
becoming one of the first to market here
but s musk has said you know artificial
intelligence is progressing rapidly and
we're getting to the day maybe 20 years
from now maybe 50 years from now but we
will get there eventually when
artificial intelligence exceeds human
capacities in virtually every way and
musk solution is an interesting one he's
not the first to suggest this other
creatures have also suggested this is
that the best way for us to for us to be
able to control and contain our
artificial intelligence is that if you
can't beat him join the mentality and we
will merge with our machines so the idea
here that he literally believes that we
can kind of save ourselves from perhaps
subjugation or some kind of an
artificial intelligence disaster by
augmenting ourselves along with our
artificial intelligence and that way we
kind of keep up with them should
anything go askew in the future do you
see any resistance to this as most
forward I most certainly I mean as I'm
sure that your listeners are aware that
this issue is fraught with ethical
difficulties everything from how do you
find test subjects who are willing to
have chips implanted into their brain or
these meshes implanted into their brain
what kind of levels of consent can you
get I mean at this point are humans
being treated as a means to an end in
order to let's say stave off that the
threats posed by artificial intelligence
what kind of animal motley at testing
would be required you know through these
kinds of experiments and of course
there's a broader
or philosophical question as to what
this means to our humanity what does it
means to us as as humans you know for
example this these sorts of technologies
don't just stand to improve our
intelligence to let's say Einsteinian
levels where we are these mathematical
logical geniuses these technologies they
they have the potential to utterly
transform what we are as humans and
enter into the realm of the so-called
posthuman in other words this kind of
entity that exists after humans and at
this point we're talking thousands if
not even millions of times you know
greater levels of capacity than current
humans so we have to ask ourselves right
now how will these technologies alter
who we are as humans in what ways could
that be a benefit in what ways could
that be detrimental so it opens up a
whole you know whole area of discussion
first well well keep the discussion
going George divorce key thanks for your
thoughts my pleasure
George divorce key science journalist
and futurist he's in Oakville Ontario
brain to brain our brain to machine
interaction maybe Elon Musk's latest
passion project but my next guest has
been doing pioneering work in that field
for decades Miguel Nicolelis is a
professor of neuroscience at Duke
University he also runs a lab in Sao
Paulo Brazil and that's where we've
reached him today hello oh hi good
morning
um how soon do you think we'll be
connecting our brains to computers well
we have been connecting our brains to
computer for a while you know for you
know since the late 90s at least but
what I have heard so far you know either
in the announcement and the comment area
that we just heard you know is really
far removed from reality and far removed
from what we consider you know as a
scientific field of brain machine
interface is the name of this field
basically we cannot download our
thoughts or upload you know all the
works of Einstein in our brains and
suddenly become theoretical physicists
that can win another prize this doesn't
exist and probably will never exist
neither should we be worrying about the
possibility that artificial intelligence
which is all totally based on digital
logic may one day overcome the human
condition that is also preposterous
because we don't work based on digital
logic and we simply cannot be threatened
by machines that never ever will acquire
the notion of what is to generate
knowledge or to process information the
way we do so this is these are all
scenarios that the sounder beyond
science fiction it sounds pretty
preposterous to me tell us what you're
doing no you because you're working with
monkeys and they are actually able to
move things what is your work do you
know we have been working with monkeys
in humans for a while now and we can
exactly using brain machine interfaces
we can record motor intentions and allow
subjects animals or humans to control
the movements of robotic arms robotic
legs even virtual bodies through this
brain machine interfaces but we're
talking about movements and simple
movements we are not talking about as I
said downloading our memories which can
not not be done because these memories
are embedded in the tissue of the brain
cannot be extracted by the any recording
device that we have so far and I don't
believe whoever will have anything that
can do that so I think in the
application of what you're doing would
is for people with that this would be
reparative right this would be about
quadriplegics paraplegics who can
suddenly move limbs that exactly we have
developed first of all in the 90s we
developed our brain machine interfaces
to study the brain to investigate the
basic principles of physiological
principles of how brains operate and
then we suddenly realized that we could
apply this into to rehab patients that
have suffered devastating lesions of the
central nervous system and that's
exactly what the food has done our lab
has shown first with upper limbs and now
with locomotion that in fact you can use
the EEG in the case of locomotion to get
paraplegic patients to control
Adso skeletons and to walk and and this
effort the most important aspect of this
effort has been that you can induce
partial neurological recovery in these
paraplegic patients by letting them use
this brain machine interfaces in a
routine kind of training so exactly
everything that is work is working
really in this field is geared towards
medical applications and the fact that
someone is considering the hypothesis of
implanting healthy human beings crosses
us a variety of ethical boundaries that
I think will never be accepted by any
board anywhere in the world okay so let
me ask you just a few more questions in
the limited time we have so the machine
to you you're working with now you brain
signals are sent to machines to move
them to move the limbs then yes what
about the reverse can machines feed
information directly into our brains
well in animals we have shown that you
can send signals back to me from robotic
or a virtual arm back to the to the
brain but this is a very limited kind of
information that you can send we are
just learning how that can be done we
also have shown that you can exchange
information and you can combine
information from multiple brains to
achieve a particular task we call that a
brain net but again the amount of
information the quality and range that
you can send back to the user of a brain
machine interface system is very limited
and it's nothing close to uploading a
thought uploading a language or any kind
of knowledge that doesn't exist are you
at all worried though about the
unintended consequences of that
technology oh my I'm very worried I'm
worried about this type of announcements
they seem to be just self promoting
marketing tools and to take us a few
that is this was very serious and it has
put a lot of effort to you know proposed
things that are not even science fiction
they're bad they're really not well
taught and this mesh that the mr. mask
has been talking about has been try once
in
mouths preparation any it is several
decades from being using humans so it's
very concerning is very worsen and so
are you but given how much you have
advanced with your research is it is it
totally off the charts to say that the
research could get to the point in the
future where we're the kinds of
scenarios he's talking about could exist
with our brains
well this scenario is a rehabilitation
of course they will come and they
already here in and we will see more of
it I have no doubt about the futures
progressing very nicely and will help
millions of people in the future and
have no doubt talking about augmentation
of healthy human beings a lot of what I
heard both from an announcement and from
what the media has talked about it's not
real it's not very happy besides the
Russian now force suggesting the
creation this company is bogus is
baloney machines are not going to
supplant human beings this is this is a
kind of hype there has been going on for
a few years they look funny in the
beginning but now it's time to look
pretty dangerous to the point of
suggesting experiments in healthy human
beings they are basically unethical
Miguel Nicolelis thanks for your time
today
thank you a pleasure Miguel Nicolelis
professor of neuroscience at Duke
University we reached him in Sao Paulo
Brazil where he runs a lab on this very
issue well when you start down the path
of boosting brain power through
artificial intelligence or even just
musing about it you arrive at half the
ethical considerations
James Giordano is a professor in the
department of neurology and biochemistry
he's chief of the neuroethics Studies
program at Georgetown University Medical
Center he's in Washington DC hello hi
annamaria how are you sir
well I'm curious to know what you're
thinking what are the ethical
implications of this technology first
when it comes to safety well I think you
know mr. divorce key has raised an
interesting question is this safe and
clearly there have been ongoing studies
looking at brain machine interfaces and
brain implants and it is a neurosurgical
procedure so I think all of the
necessary safeguards that go into
neurosurgery are necessary but
that brings us to the next point which
is who are we doing this in are we doing
this with people who have a pathological
condition for example a neurological
degenerative disorder or brain trauma
that would necessitate the implant and
the answer there is no so we have to
balance safety with need at but how
would that be ethically different from
other surgery well in many ways it isn't
I mean the idea of neurosurgery carries
within its own ethical burdens of course
all the necessities that would go with
any medical consideration but as mr.
Devore ski has mentioned that of course
is Professor Nicolelis had mentioned the
intent here is not necessarily at least
completely for therapeutic benefit it's
towards some form of competition with AI
and or some form of human enablement or
enhancement and then you have to really
take a look at is this necessary or not
and I think the jury is still out on
that I tend to side with professor
Nicolelis and saying you really don't
see such a threat coming from AI at
least not one that's realistic with
regard to being able to threaten or or
put at risk the human condition if we
get to the point where this could
actually be something and I'm saying if
because professor Nicolelis has made the
point this may just be fantastical who
would even have access to technology
like this well this is a huge question
anamarie I mean the question here is is
who's going to get it and who isn't in
many ways what you're really seeing is a
broadening of the gap between the haves
and have-nots and this would then be the
neurologically enhanced Tabs versus the
non neurologically enhanced have-nots
so characteristically you would then say
that those individuals who could afford
this type of enablement or enhancement
would be the ones to get it whereas if
you're looking at a therapeutic
situation it would be those that may
have the greatest need and of course
here too you're looking at a variety of
issues such as insurance capabilities
standards of care etc you're involved in
the adaptation of this technology for
the US military how is it being used
well we're really not looking at
implantable technologies is being able
to create some capability with AI what
we're looking at here is a capability of
implantable technologies such as deep
brain stimulation and even the type of
thing that mr. musk is alluding to where
we have an interface between the
superficial levels of the brain
and a computer interface or machine
interface mostly to be able to
compensate for neurodegenerative
diseases injuries to the brain etc now
that's not to say that this cannot be
used to perhaps augment or enable
individuals to engage information
processing process information more
quickly and more efficiently but we're
really not looking at the implantable
technologies to do this as much as the
non-invasive brain stimulator II
technologies for that very reason
they're non-invasive they tend to be far
safer with regard to the surgical
procedures that aren't needed and also I
think we're able to modulate the level
of the input in different ways without
having to worry about using surgery to
get these things in and access to the
brain do you have concerns about how
this could be abused oh of course I
think as with any type of Science and
Technology
it is highly Mis usable and in some
cases abusable I mean obviously we're
also dealing with a technology that is
very new and so we're having to open the
door questions of the unknown we don't
know what this technology is going to be
able to do and in many ways that's part
of the reason that we're going forward
with us experimentally because we're not
only learning about the technology we're
learning about the brain and then in
learning about the brain we're adapting
our methods and technological tools but
I think when it's very early in its
development clearly one of the things we
have to look at is do we really
understand the consequences of what
we're doing do we understand that there
may be some unanticipated effects and
are we prepared to consent patients to
do that and if we are prepared do we
also have the continuity of care and
research in place so as to be able to
take care these individuals if and when
something were to go wrong
okay well James Giordano thank you for
your thoughts on all of this today my
pleasure ma'am thank you James Giordano

Neurology in biochemistry and chief of
