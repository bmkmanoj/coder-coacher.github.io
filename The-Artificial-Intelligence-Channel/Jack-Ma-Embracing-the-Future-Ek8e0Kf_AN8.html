and I think everybody knows who he is
everybody knows what he has accomplished
so far what we don't know is what he is
going to do down the road but this is
one of those people that are
transforming the world and we're lucky
to have him come Jack I'll wait until
you speak and I'll come back on
yeah good morning mr. president
Clinton might your Excellencies and
French
I'm very honored we might call me say
there is a fallen here in New York that
to share our ideas and the thinking's
about the future I'm extremely excited
and honored I'm not a politician I'm not
a scientist I'm a business people I
would be very happy to share some of the
thought that we as a entrepreneur what
we learn from our lives what the things
what the attitude we should face for the
future and I think I sent reproduce the
leadership if we'd lose our vision our
company will go nowhere when my company
is very tiny where every day we're
looking for opportunities to make our
company big now today my company is big
every day I worry about what are the
risks what are the things that are going
to stop us that's going to be the cancer
of the company and when we figure out
the problems we have to think about one
thing how we can change these problems
become opportunities in this world very
most of the people by seeing is
believing but only those great leaders
when they see when they believe the
future then they see the real stuffs so
I think today people worry a lot but I
think we are much under estimate the the
huge technology revolution that it was
going to bring to the world the impact
we are entering the world that is full
of opportunities and full of challenges
and this kind of error in a human lives
we have seen very few of them and I
think in the past of 300 years we only
see three times and I think the big the
problem of today is so big and too big
now not even one government or any
business against off so we have to work
in together
if we do not work in together I think
the world is ganna being more tough a
much more frustration the world is
moving from IT to DT a lot of people
don't know what is DT and it's just like
a lot of people don't know what is IT
the idea information technology is
shifting
to the data technology this is not about
the technology upgrading it's about a
philosophy about the way we're doing
things the wilder needs focus used to
focus on twenty eighty percent they just
to focus on twenty percent as I say a
lot of financial institutions they focus
on supporting twenty percent of the big
companies and by making eighty percent
of the profit but the world should be
8020 in the future we should focus on
the eighty percent of small business
eighty percent of the young people
eighty percent of developing countries
and the world is looking for more
inclusive sustainable and happy and
healthy environment I think the world
not only need g20 be twenty we need G
two hundred and be two hundred and I
think our kids also changed the kids
they do not want to get informed they
wanted to be involved in the past 200
years we human beings always wanted
using the knowledge to predict the
future but today we are entering into a
new world nobody is the expert of future
and we have a so limited and knowledge
about the digital time so I think we are
into entering a world that everybody
start to worry and today those people
say I believe the future they're
considered as some crazy guys and also I
would like to say that people worry
about a big data artificial intelligence
and computing and cloud computing all
these things I think these Warriors are
very normal and when two hundred years
ago the steam machine comes people
started worried about that they think
that steam machine is going to take a
lot of jobs a hundred years ago when
electricity comes people worry about
electricity is gonna take a lot of jobs
but I believe human being have solutions
if we don't have the solutions our kids
will have the solutions in the past of
ten years just like our company five
years ago we noticed that a big debate
in our company we think the online
shopping the e-commerce was shifting
from PC to mobile phone nobody believed
because most of people say hey Jack how
can you shopping on a mobile phone the
screen is so tiny but
we proved today 87% of the shops on our
site are from the mobile phones not
because the screen sucia
because our eyes is too shot we are
getting old young people never get out
and we get used to the waiting for
government to find the solutions but
actually the solutions are everywhere
the wisdom of human beings are
everywhere and I think we should human
being should have confidence in
ourselves and the new technology will
destroy a lot of jobs but also will
create a lot of jobs so when we start to
lose vision when we start losing
imagination we start to worry and I
think because we lose the vision for
future because we don't have imagination
we start to worry too much about the
future today we see the steam of the
steam machines bring lot of jobs for the
for the world and electricity also bring
lot of jobs for the world the DT the
data technology is going to bring a lot
of jobs for the world the question is
whether we are ready and whether we are
qualified for these new jobs and by the
way a lot of people talking about a
manufacturing I think manufacturing will
never bring a lot of jobs in last 200
years manufacturing bring jobs but today
because of the artificial intelligence
because of the robots manufacturing is
no longer being the main engine of
current jobs service industry is going
to be the main driver for job creations
so talking about manufacturing which are
not talking about made in China made in
America it's going to be made in
Internet most of the small business is
going to be powerful
most of the small business is going to
be global so in the past of 30 years 6%
of the business in the world
big companies they've been affirmed
globalization in the next 30 years I
believe and we believe from the data
shows that all the small business will
say at least 60% of the small business
will be global will benefit from
globalization globalization is nothing
wrong
we need improved globalization we need
to making sure globalization is
inclusive and people worry about the
Machine is going to control human beings
I think people should have confidence
human beings should have the self
confidence here
we have the wisdom machine does not have
the wisdom him we should have never I
think we we should not think about
artificial intelligence we should talk
about machine intelligence I found a lot
of a scientists that we start to think
about the machine think like a human
brings human only no less than 10% of
human brains if we want to make the
machines think like a man
we're being big troubles so the other
thing is that we were one I don't like a
lot of scientists and engineers talking
about is that the business leader scare
people away about the technology I'm a
non technology guy I've been the only
thing I know about a computer is send
and receive email and browse I don't
know what is coding but we can lead that
technology and the and the thing is that
in the past of 30 years we make people
like a machine next to 30 years we will
make machine like a people but the
difference that machine should be
machine like people should people like
and talking about the machine is going
to be bigger
is it being smarter or powerful than
them human beings this happens in the
past of 300 years machine always run
faster stronger than human beings when
computer is designed we have to be sure
that machine is going to be smart than
human being they remembered because they
never forget they never get tired they
never sleep there were drinks so this is
the technology unstoppable unstoppable
and we should know that the machine does
not have a heart machine does not have
so and machine does not have a belief
human being have the souls have the
belief had the valley we are creative we
are surely that we can control the
machines so the technology is
unstoppable we don't have the answer for
the future but there is answer for the
future that is why we should stop
thinking point each other by working
together solve the problem so what is
the solution for those challenges I
think we should change our self embrace
the future those people worry about
tomorrow and those people who are
successful
and those people who are about fifty
years old it is so different most
difficult thing this work is to change a
successful people and the other thing is
our young people never worried those
people who are over 50 years old they
worry a lot
young people never worry for the future
they worry about us
they war about us that make the wrong
policies wrong decision wrong judgement
for the futures so the best way to to
using the technology is using technology
to solve the problems instead of
stopping the technology and the I think
we our generation were lucky we are
above 15 years old so next to 20 years
there's no big problem for us but but we
should not make problems for our kids
and that for the kids issues we have to
pay special attention to the education
system this is everywhere I go to the
different countries talking to the
Statesmen government offices pay
attention to the education system the
way we teach the things we teach today
is is going to be making our peace
losing jobs next 30 years because all
the things we'll learn about remember
knowledge calculation all these stuffs
machine can do better we have to teach
the kids the machine cannot do better
like a human beings so this is what
worried me for the president of McCrone
talked about we should reaching our
people that's supporting people like us
today 3040 years old but what about our
kids so we have to rearrange into
education because of artificial
intelligence because the machine
learnings because of computing we have
to change the education system knowledge
and know-how and bye-bye we have to
teach our kids to be very very
innovative very creative in this way we
can create jobs for our kids by the way
I think if you want in this world IQ EQ
and lq if you want to be successful you
should have IQ but if you should have an
EQ if you don't want to lose quickly you
should have two EQ IQ but if you want to
be respected if you want to survive keep
on sex successful you should have B have
the L Q what is
lq the cue of love which machine never
have that so finally by closing that i
think we we are optimist as a business
people i'm optimistic positive for the
future for the technology but we also
have to be very very careful that the
first the technology revolution caused
World War one second technology
revolution cost of World War two now we
are the third technology revolution the
World War three should be against the
poverty disease and environment
pollutions otherwise human being will
have a problems this is what I want to
share with you thank you very much
Jack thank you this is going to surprise
everybody in this room but I am a little
on the other side of 50 my daughters are
on the younger side of 50 when I listen
to them there are lots of simple
solutions to complex problems
unfortunately they never seem to get
there I happen to be one of the people
that agree couldn't agree more with you
machines are not going to take over the
world
it's judgement and understanding and
treating people as human beings that
really is what matters and it matters in
business and I was fascinated to learn
that you had in Amazon you guys have
created something like 30 million jobs
have been responsible for that that's
really amazing we have to do the same
thing in our country there you are a
special ambassador to the UN on trade
and small business and entrepreneurship
congratulations the new SG really needs
some help and he is thrilled to have you
who talked about it
why didn't when you meet all of these
heads of states what do you tell them
yeah I think first when I go to a lot of
countries especially developing
countries the government a stud worried
well we don't have an infrastructure of
telecommunication we don't have
computers we don't have this and that so
we cannot do internet but I tell the
Internet is going to be the
infrastructure if we don't have the if
the people are not connected to internet
next to 30 years it's just like 30 years
ago people are not collected in a
tricity Alibaba grow fast in the past 18
years 18 years ago there's no
infrastructure of Internet of ecommerce
in China we build from scratches so I'm
telling a lot of governments and
officials that pay special attention to
the next of 30 years every technology
revolution takes about 50 years the
first 20 years about technology next 30
years about application of the
technology electricity was not invented
in America is invented in Europe cars
was invented in Europe not America
but America using cars electricity
better than the Europe so what I want to
say pay special attention to the next of
30 years making sure your people get
rich to the Internet and Internet can be
can be a info
of your country the second is a pay
special attention to those people who
are below 30 years old because they are
the main driver for tomorrow they have
the confidence and pay special attention
to those companies who are the young who
have a less than 30 employees because
small business is going to be powerful
last a century manufacture make
large-scale standard and in the future
the world is shifting from standard
large mass to the tailor-made to the
small size so I'm a believer of small as
beautiful as small is powerful and
lastly how does business and government
work together to bring innovation what's
the secret sauce the different cultures
different ways of measuring success
different ways of getting promoted
different ways of getting compensated
and yet this conference is all about the
fact that they just have to work
together and you have a very successful
company in a country where the
government is communist government and
how do you blend the two you've got as
much a problem as the rest of us have
not more yeah I think first that we
should stop bringing a complaint each
other government is always tried to I
think today lot of ganon to worry more
than the business this is business
weak people like us we are optimistic
about the future we think there is
opportunity that that's that because
there's worries because there's
complaints there's opportunity so our
opportunity comes from this complaints
and this kind of worries so the if we do
not working together there would
probably there is a story I want to
share with you 9 the 1865 the UK had the
first Mumbai came the cars a lot of you
went to the government say well this is
going to destroy a lot of jobs for the
host MIT because host man at that time
is the white collar job it's a very
skillful jobs so they push the
government say stop automobile stop this
all the UK government at that time
passed an act caught red flag act
every card there is a flag in the front
no car is allowed to drive seven miles
per hour
no car is allowed to drive faster than a
horse men that stopped because if you
drive your car faster than a horse your
license of automobile will be taken away
so this is called red flag act and I
think today a lot of governments is
thinking about that making more X
because for they have a great higher
saying I want to helping create you know
keeping this job by killing tomorrow so
I think as a business people like us we
have to tell the government what is the
confidence why we believe future is
better and government should working
with us listen to us and in this way we
can build a future listen thank you very
much you've done an amazing things keep
up the good work and we have a lot to
learn from you America has a lot to
learn from China and vice versa and I
think the real message from what's
happening in the world today is we need
each other more than ever before and
pulling countries apart just is not good
for either for any of the countries the
only ways we're gonna grow is if
everybody else grows thank it will be
right back with another great speaker
thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
