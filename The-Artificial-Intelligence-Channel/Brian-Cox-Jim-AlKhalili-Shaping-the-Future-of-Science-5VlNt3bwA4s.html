and those watching online of no I were
just saying no idea how many people are
watching this online well we'll assume
there are millions out there absolutely
fascinated so a case we open to the
second part
I'm Jim al-khalili my my day job is
professor of physics and chair and the
public engagements in science at the
University of Surrey but I'm here this
evening in my capacity as a member of
the case board and I'd like to well
essentially for the next hour I think
will will it be not quite same format as
the last last session but we're going to
have a discussion I have a load of nice
interesting questions to ask but we'll
also open it up to the audience and
we'll have roving mics we'll see what
will will give you more time to quiz
these two gentlemen I guess better in
this essence we're going to be
discussing the future of Science and
Engineering and Technology in the UK and
not just 30 years from now although that
is sort of the theme given this is our
30th anniversary but also in the nearer
future one year two years from now but
let me first introduce my two guests to
my left the right honourable Joe Johnson
has been Conservative MP for Orpingtons
since May 2010 he was head of the
number-10 policy unit from April 2013 to
May 2015 he became Minister of State for
Cabinet Office in July 2014 and he's
been the Minister for universities and
science since May last year Joe I think
it's fair to say comes from a remarkably
high achieving family of course we know
he has an older brother who is our
current foreign secretary Joe doesn't
have a science background he studied
modern history at Oxford but as we in
the science and engineering community
have I guess realized this is not
necessarily it doesn't mean that he's
not qualified to fight our corner in
government we saw it I'm very very
successfully by his predecessor last but
one David now Lord Willits who's who's
currently the chair of the British
Science Association so I think our
science minister who has to go to to the
Treasury and argue for funding of
science and engineering funding for
universities
doesn't neccessarily himself or herself
have to have a science background but
they need to to get what we're at and
what we need with briefly Joe's career
before politics includes working for
Deutsche Bank and the Financial Times he
was I gather named foreign journalist of
the year in India in 2009 I mean yeah
qualifications qualities I'm sure they
will they will come in handy my my
second guest describes himself as a
simple-minded northern bloke from Oldham
yeah yeah you do that's that you keep
saying all oh I'm a simple I can't do
accent of course others might describe
him as the Peter Pan of science
communication and broadcasting an a-list
celebrity ex popstar keyboard player who
now infuses us on our TV screens about
the wonders of the universe
neither description of course nearly
does him any credit he is of course
Professor Brian Cox FRS OBE professor of
physics the University of Manchester
he's professor of public engagement in
science for the Royal Society and indeed
he has played a big part over the last
few years in making science not just
accessible making it sexy I guess
boosting certainly application numbers
to universities certainly to read
physics it's a well-known at the Brian
Cox effect is oh is a well-known effect
we've all benefited from it yet to be
established just take it take it
in 2005 Brian was awarded a Royal
Society research fellowship for his work
at at CERN and the LHC and soon after
that he began his dual career as both an
academic scientist and as a broadcaster
writer and popularizer of science but of
course he is also if people don't know a
great advocate for rationalism and
evidence-based science policy in
government and that's sort of part of
the the issues we want to be discussing
this evening right then ok so we will
start we will mention don't worry we
will cover Trump we will cover brexit so
that
have no fear but I do want to start off
relatively gently Joe I'm told your kids
are big fans of Brian's so so firstly I
hope being on stage with him gives you
brownie points in the Johnson household
but I also wonder what excites you I
guess about some of the things that
Brian
for example talks about on his TV
programs well thank you German good
evening everybody it's great to be here
at the 30th anniversary of case I was
lucky enough to be asked to participate
in the launch of the 30th year
celebrations back in January and it's
good to be with Brian ihu Jim as you say
is a bit of a cult figure in our
household it's not easy to get my kids
to focus on programs that I want to
watch but when it is forces of nature as
it has been over the recent weeks it's
something that they've turned to with
great enthusiasm and I hope it will
encourage them to get much further in
their science studies than I got when I
was their age and you know I'm obviously
a bit embarrassed that I can't claim to
be a science buff I am though through
the months that I've been doing this job
I hope acquiring the status of amateur
enthusiasts and you know at the very
least and I'm sort of learning my
science now in mid middle age on to
track on two tracks first of all at the
feet of all the eminent scientists that
I'm lucky enough to meet in my job as
science in universities minister meeting
you know the likes of Brian Cox it's the
Venki Ramakrishnan and all the sort of a
municipal nurse all the eminent figures
that I kind of interact with on it more
or less daily basis and that's fantastic
but I'm also learning it through the
eyes of my kids because I do homework
with them at the weekends and I see what
it's like to be learning it at the
grassroots and if you're a school age
and you know I do sometimes feel there
is in that respect something of a
disconnect between the massively
exciting research discoveries that I'm
sort of witnessing as I go around the
country
and the extraordinary things that
scientists are exploring and examining
and sometimes the rather dry
backward-looking
material that my kids are working their
way through in the science textbooks and
you know I do definitely believe in all
of the benefits and opportunities from
research-led teaching as a result
because nothing brings home the power
and the excitement of science for me
than being in labs and seeing the
exciting things that our brilliant
scientists are all doing and then
nothing sort of costs me back more
rapidly to you know the difficulties I
had as a teenager Lea then plunging my
head into biology textbooks so there is
a bit of a disconnect and I think that's
something of an opportunity for the
sector as it thinks about stem
engagement and how to get more young
people actually pursuing the kinds of
careers that we all want them upon them
to do um and do you think it's a case
that what captures the imagination might
be you know the big the big event
CNET chris hadfield I think that the
last time we met was at the Science
Museum Chris Hadfield going off blasting
off to the space station of thousands of
school kids waving Union Jack's before
the most Canadian Tim Peake well there
you go see thank you the Tim Peake
phenomenon is almost as big as the
phenomenon in terms of the impact it's
going to have on people studying STEM
subjects and that was it that was a big
moment and you know we as a government
are trying to put some additional
resource behind it with a three million
pound Principia fund to try and build on
the buzz that Tim Peake generated but
there are other examples the kinds of
big science events that have really
excited me I was involved very closely
in our polar research ship project which
I think as a stem engagement vehicle has
achieved global success I'm going to
call it success
the very few stem engagement projects
were actually managed and some of it was
obviously inadvertent and unintended tip
but for most successes in this role
never asked a question to which you do
not already have the answer and also you
know I think on a more serious note if
you're doing stem engagement and if you
ask a relatively superficial question
you'll get a lot of very superficial
answers so you've got a and you won't
necessarily generate the kind of depth
of engagement that you want and just
soda to recap for those of you who
missed
boaty mcboatface we asked in a online
poll for members of the public to
envisage their suggestion branded on the
name of the ship and we got a huge
number of suggestions both he was the
lead contender and in the end we arrived
at what I felt was a reasonable
compromise whereby we named the main
research ship after Sir David
Attenborough and we named a subsidiary
autonomous submersible vessel after
Beatty but but so yeah the polar
research ship is another example of a
piece of science infrastructure which on
the face of it you know might have gone
relatively unremarked upon generating
global interest and it truly was global
I mean we had newspaper editorials all
over the world about boaty we had TV
coverage all over the world I don't
think there's a country that doesn't
know that Britain is planning to be at
the forefront of marine science for for
decades to come so that that was another
example of one which I was pleased
inadvertently to have caused a global
sensation with Brian of course I mean in
last few years there have been the big
headline news grabbing science stories
from discovery of the Higgs boson even
before that the turning on of the Large
Hadron Collider itself generated so much
interest even in tabloid newspapers
talking about whether create a black
hole whatever they've been so that the
fillet landed a landing on a comet's
they've been things
like the Tim Peaks mission we live in an
increasingly technological age things
seem to be happening faster and faster
what what do you foresee are that the
challenges I mean do we are we doing the
right thing by publicizing these the big
exciting science stories to promote
science and engineering yes yes I would
pick up on something Jo said though cuz
I'm about the the way the students in
school do science because what one
example I give a personal example is I'm
a patron of a school in Tower Hamlets
kasam Paul's way and they've had great
success at engaging the students with
UCL actually in diabetes research
so because partly because diabetes is
one of the big problems there so all the
students and their families tend to have
an experience of it and therefore it's a
I think that is of interest to them but
then of course as Joe rightly said once
you start doing science whatever it is
then that's when you get the bug for it
and they've been tremendously successful
and with the several pieces of good
practice I think they're what one is the
engagement with the universities and the
research centre so so so UCL the
University of Warwick actually also and
Queen Mary that are very engaged in that
school as a prototype really is one of
them there are no there are many others
around the country but that's one that's
working very well and we're trying to
roll that out now - cumbria and there
that it will probably be nuclear
engineering because it'll be something
that's of relevance and direct interest
to that community and and it's a way in
I I don't think actually it's that what
particular science that you do in a
school that matters so much or whether
it's one of the big sexy projects at
Large Hadron Collider or the
International Space Station or it's a
it's it's some science that solve local
interest but it's the the act of doing
science in school I think brightens it
that makes it much more exciting for the
students I mean John you mentioned that
there's this exciting the science is
going on that it's quite distinct from
the nuts and bolts stuff that you have
to learn at school which of course
science and engineers will always say
yeah but you know for the future
scientists and engineers you'd have to
teach them the nuts and bolts you know
is there is it a case of finding the
balance between the exciting the new the
inspires that gets kids wanting to do
science and engineering but not doing
too much of that because you got to make
way for them actually learning how to do
science now of course there's no
substitute for the hard grind of
learning the nuts and bolts but I was
lucky enough to visit the school which
Brian mentioned and with with Brian in
Tower Hamlets and it is extraordinary
the results that they're achieving there
and demonstrating that when you can get
the engagement through the direct
practical experience of the kinds of
experiments Browne was talking about it
really does have remarkable results for
children not necessarily from you know
privileged backgrounds but from all
backgrounds and that's what's so special
about that kind of institutions now I
think I mean I would regard myself as an
optimist but like many people I guess
I've been the recent political events
have along with uncertainties about the
the challenges that lay ahead for
Humanity
I guess shake that optimism we know that
30 years from now there's a 60th
anniversary of case our world and our
lives will be unrecognizable compare me
to people in the panel Phil Smith and
the last session talked about it painted
a picture of a future world you know
we've had the internet and World Wide
Web the quarter of a century the next
quarter of a century will bring in
changes even more dramatic than we've
seen so far given the the uncertain
world we live in now many people would
say that to some extent we are concerned
that power may be in the hands of people
who don't care as much as we do about
scientific evidence evidence driven
policy whether you call it a post truth
world
are you concerned that science and
scientific evidence and and and
rationalism are threatened by recent
political the the flavor of what what
the wider public seem to on have we
misjudged what what what they really are
passionate about well I mean I don't
think we should jump to the conclusion
that just because the referendum result
didn't go in the direction that the
science community wanted which I hope
that's not too much for over
generalization meant that science is
being disrespected
I just don't think science was really on
the ballot on June the 23rd for the vast
majority of the the voting population
obviously you know the fortunes of our
universities and the competitiveness and
success of our science base was very
much at stake but it wasn't something
that was going to be a dominant factor
in the voting intentions of a you know
vast majority of the voting public so I
don't think we necessarily you know have
to say that science was therefore being
disrespected and expertise was being
disrespected you know insofar as
evidence-based policy is still in a
vital that's absolutely recognized by
government you know the government chief
scientific adviser mark walpert some are
walpert plays a important role as do all
the chief science advisors in the
various government departments you know
their job is to help ensure that the
best science is used in formation of
government policy and that's a we're
real well respected part of the policy
making process and leaving them to one
side I mean our civil service continues
to ensure you know on a daily basis that
policy is evidence-based rigorous and as
well thought through as it can be so I
don't you know I think it's an
exaggeration to say we've left we've
left evidence-based policymaking behind
we clearly haven't that's not to say
governments don't get things wrong and
the political
pulsus don't come to play you know from
time to time but the general intention
is to have evidence-based policy whether
that happens in the u.s. of course is it
is another matter when we're dealing
with issues like climate change for
example
Brian and I mean I take Joe's point that
and and I think you know you would agree
with that that the referendum certainly
wasn't about whether the value of
science and technology to society but
there certainly seems to have been a
backlash against globalization for want
of a better word now you know you and I
work in in in research areas nuclear
particle physics and not include
astronomy as well which are truly
international collaborative affairs now
whether its concerns about our our role
if we if and when we come out of the EU
or whether it's our role more
internationally are you concerned that
there's a threat to house big science
can be done if we retreat back into our
shells yes but I would say that for me
the the you're right and Joe's right
that the public didn't really vote one
way or the other about science said I
think that wasn't as Joseph entirely
right wasn't on the ballots it wasn't a
big issue in the in the referendum we
tried and people tried but it just
didn't it wasn't one of the big issues
and what worries me now is the I think
the problem has the rhetoric from
government is is one of the big problems
I think so I think with reference to the
experts thing that they're essentially
blew up by one lazy phrase from Michael
Gove that may or may not have been lazy
I don't know they planned it or not he
might have just said him had popped into
his head with that idea that I think
people are pretty sick of experts has
become a you know the rallying cry in a
sense and perhaps a lot of the
discussion is framed around that one
phrase he shouldn't have said it it's
not right other thing but the thing that
bothers me more we probably will talk
about brags it and of course we've been
criticized in the scientific community
the university community for focusing
too much under underfunding aspects the
funding aspects are obviously clear
I think what's the number of that 11
billion has come in over the last five
years or so or six years from the EU so
that's a big issue but but I think that
the rhetoric from the from the Prime
Minister has been intensely problematic
as the Vice Chancellor of Sheffield
pointed out in India so there's nothing
to do with Gregson this is in in India
the idea that the universities and
science and academia and Britain is is a
is an open welcoming country full of
opportunities for others in this country
to collaborate with everybody else in
the world is absolutely critical and and
it's not clear to me that the the
rhetoric is necessary I've interested to
know what I don't put Joe on the spot I
suspect he might agree some level but
I'd like to you know that it seems to me
that there's a there's a the I don't
think my pants my opinion I don't think
people voted to restrict the ability of
universities to recruit students or to
reduce recruits academics or to
collaborate with people from all across
the world I don't think people voted for
that I think it's a misunderstanding on
the part of government of certain
members of the government to think that
that's what people voted for and I think
the language has been unhelpful and so I
I wonder what what Joe thinks about that
well here here is well
thank you thank you for the opportunity
Brian no I mean I was I was in India
last week at the same time as the prime
minister and you know I was glad to have
the opportunity for many opportunities
to reiterate the government's
long-standing position on international
students which is that you know there's
no limit on the number of genuine
international students that we want to
offer a warm welcome to at our
world-class higher education
institutions and there's no limit on the
number of such students who can switch
in to work provided they get a graduate
job so that's two components of what
should be a very compelling message in
India as it is in other countries around
the world now there is certainly a India
specific issue because we have seen
numbers fall in that country in a way
which we haven't seen in other countries
around the world that are big sources of
recruitment for our higher education
institutions so overall since 2010 we've
seen international student numbers at
our institutions go up by 14 percent in
India they've moved quite steeply in the
other direction and it's important we
try and look at the very specific
factors that are clearly at work in
India and the seemingly greater
sensitivity in that country to some of
the post-2012 changes that have been
introduced and we need to understand
what steps we may need to take to to
remedy that but it is on the face of it
a sort of an India specific issue rather
than a a general problem because the to
keep components of our long-standing
policy remain in place there's no cap on
the overall number of students and no
cap on the number who can switch in to
work provided they get a graduate job
and you know we shouldn't cast ourselves
into a sort of a slough of despond about
it because we're still second in the
world after the u.s. in terms of our
overall share of the international
student market we're still seeing
numbers
increase year-on-year many will argue
though we are still in the EU so that
hasn't hit us yet yeah that's correct
Jim but I'm talking about the non EU
international students so the EU
students don't need visas so they're not
counted in these numbers I'm talking
specifically about the non EU
international students where we're
second in the world and you know the
Vice Chancellor Sheffield key sir Keith
Burnett a great guy he was with us on
the delegation as well and I have huge
respect for Keith but the the Russell
group of which Sheffield is a member has
seen its application Surratt's
enrollments from international students
increased by almost 40 percent since
2010 so this you know doesn't strike me
as being a crisis obviously there are
opportunities to build on what is a
strong market position and the
government wants to support our extant
higher education system in recruiting
genuine international students there are
specific issues in India which we need
to think about the solutions to the
India problem do not necessarily lie
solely in our hands I would love for
example the government of india to
acknowledge and recognize our one-year
master's qualification which the indian
public sector does not recognize given
the important weight of the indian
public sector that ripples across
private sector employers who are also
less likely to give credit to a
potential employee with a one-year
master's from one of our institutions so
there are steps that I'd like India to
take to facilitate that sort of great
because although there isn't it's the
government state there isn't a limit on
students there is that they are of
course included in the immigration
figures on which there is a very strict
target and that's what's the Keith
pointed out I think quite clearly I mean
I think it's it's a it's a it's a
bizarre policy to my mind and so I think
that's one of the examples of
ever signal the center and I think that
I go back to that idea the points I made
earlier that I think there is a
certainly in Germany as well I mean I
collaborate with and I have colleagues
from across the EU and elsewhere and
that does seem to be a genuine there is
a genuine feeling that Britain has taken
a rather inshaallah turn let us say
since the referendum and that's about
language and it's about intention and
it's about perceived intention and and I
I do think that some of the language
that's been you by government which was
probably for different audience I don't
know what audience is for it doesn't
seem to be to the public either maybe
it's in the internal Conservative Party
audience I can't quite understand what
why but that that language is unhelpful
I think and that that's one of the key
things to send out that signal that we
are not we're not I don't want to use
the word but we're not as nfo bit
country it's probably too strong that
it's a loaded word but that messaging
needs to come out very clearly I think
in statements and one very clear
statement would be to remove students
from the from the immigration figures
where she seems to be a bizarre choice
to me
I mean nevertheless I think Jo you it
was just a third referendum you raised
the issue of potential discrimination on
the part of EU countries against British
scientists and engineers I'm thinking of
you know the EU horizon 2020 for example
but even when it comes down to sort of
hard cash
you know I will know the figures for
every pound that the UK government
spends on science and technology here we
get something like is it twenty
something pence so something for me
immaturity in perpetuity
now the government have acknowledged
that or agree that they will make up
that shortfall
well hold on things up I mean they're we
believe public investment in science
generates a 20 percent return in
perpetuity yes yes that's one thing with
respect to EU time I I'm thinking of EU
funding yeah but what the government has
said and we put out a import
statement from the Treasury in the
middle of August on August the 13th that
said that for projects whose payments
might run beyond the point of brac said
the Treasury will be good for the
payments that fall to you after we have
left the European Union assuming we've
left and in that timeframe and that was
intended to give confidence to other
European institutions in collaborating
with British institutions that they
wouldn't be at a financial disadvantage
from doing so because the Treasury would
be good for the payments that fell to
you after the point of brexit and when I
asked the community to come forward with
examples of discrimination or concerns
that they had about brexit and we made
public in an email in the Department of
Business as it then was this was with
the intention of flushing out these
kinds of issues and about from
recollection I think about two-thirds of
the concerns that were brought to our
attention related to fears that people
might be asked to step down from consort
here were those sorts of things after
the August the 13th announcement by the
Treasury that the Treasury would be good
for these payments that might fall to
you after the point of brexit those
concerns of our large fallen away the
remaining concerns that we had related
to European nationals living in the UK
academics of institutions for example
asking about their residency status and
some of those concerns have fallen away
because the government has been actively
providing a number of assurances we've
had the Prime Minister herself say that
she has every expectation of being able
to guarantee the residency rights of EU
nationals living in the UK so long as
there was a reciprocal treatment of
British nationals living in other EU
countries and we've also had the brexit
Secretary of State David Davis
on repeated occasions make clear that EU
nationals who have already been living
in the country for five years have
already acquired indefinite leave to
remain and if they've been living here
six years then they have a right to
apply for citizenship or dual
nationality if they want to so those
sorts of statements have seen the number
of concerns that we've been picking up
about residency start to die down
obviously we recognize the outstanding
concerns on these issues and
particularly the more forward-looking
questions about what about prospectively
what we do about our institutions
ability to continue to attract people
from EU countries and there you know we
have to fall back on the prime
minister's statements which is the we
welcome the contribution that EU
Nationals make to our institutions at
all stages in their lives when they come
here our students when they stay on to
do postdoctoral work early career work
and then when they contribute to our
students at other levels and we want
that to continue but we can't get into
the nitty-gritty of status until we're
further down the line in the rest of our
discussions with our EU partners okay
well I mean I there may be the audience
might want to carry on asking questions
on this issue but I want to move on and
sort of be a bit more optimistic and
positive forward thinking but there is
an issue Brian I mean would you agree
that as we develop new technologies and
we're increasingly we're seeing changes
in the way we live our lives dependent
on on technologies that does
by-and-large
tend to widen the gap between the rich
and poor simply because the rich are
better able to take advantage of of
technological advances is this something
that should be of concern to the
scientists and engineers well yeah as
citizens whether you're a scientist an
engineer or not yes I mean we heard I
think in the previous discussion the
economists say that this is one of the
central issues now isn't it about the
way that wealth and opportunity
distributed what I would say and it's
kind of I've I haven't really thought
you know I'll put it out there is and I
died I'm beginning to see just
personally I'm beginning to consider
education is a is a national security
issue as well as a redistribution issue
and a redistribution opportunity issue
it if you have and it goes to the heart
of the issues that were talked about in
the last panel I think about when we're
talking about you know how do it how do
people value things how do people value
science and engineering how did the
people value the Arts
well it surely comes down to to
educational opportunity educational
achievement in a population that's also
linked of course to economic growth and
and the redistribution of wealth as well
and and so it seems to me that we've
perhaps the you know that someone may
disagree in the that someone may have
some better data than I do but it seems
to me that there we perhaps neglected or
have neglected education as a across the
country in all areas no best schools but
but some of our schools are not
achieving and I said I I what when I
started working in the school in Tower
Hamlets that Joe visited it was it was a
failing school and it's been all all
schools have great raw material there is
no doubt and you see it in the couple of
schools I've been involved with the the
the students respond the raw material is
there it's about investment and about a
sense of opportunity and possibility
engagement with universities and a
friend of ours a lot Lord and remorse
and who'd worked very closely that
school said it was a school that it's in
sight of the City of London that school
they can see the spires of the bit one
of the be great financial capital of the
world there and yet it was like another
country and never went there never
engaged and not in some of the
businesses there have been engaged in
school as well but I think that key
point that we've seen if the election of
Trump if it goes badly and who knows you
know some people say give him the
benefit of the doubt I don't know how
it's going to go if it goes badly you
see that what that was it was a national
security issue if that goes badly
because it's possible that
that Europe will fall to bits as
possible you'll see radical government
selected in in France or in Italy or
that their release
you know movements that we would
consider to be problematic for the
future security of this continent and
and that's why I say that that
investment in education I think there
needs to be a step change in it it's as
important as investing in in some sense
if it's a national security if you're
the fabric of your size he can crumble
because enough voters half the people in
the country feel that they've been left
behind then you have a problem is the
existential problem and and although we
mentioned it's not seen for example the
referendum vote wasn't about science and
engineering or engineering but but but
you're right in terms of people who feel
disconnected disenfranchised or simply
not seeing themselves as being able to
get hold of the this this modern
technological world is it to do with how
we teach STEM subjects to school and we
are we not teaching them the right way
to prepare the young people for the 21st
century or is it more about educating
communicating science to a wider
population no it's not even about stem
as such I think it's just in general you
have to be you have to be taught how to
think then you have to be taught how to
take advantage of the opportunities that
are out there in the 21st century so I
think it applies to arts teaching as
well it's about that that great
enlightenment project of allowing people
to acquire knowledge of exciting them
about acquiring knowledge so think we
can get too caught up in the in the
nitty-gritty really it's about having
really very very good schools and very
good teachers and and and making sure
that everybody has the opportunity to
require that that bug I'm trying to
grasp onto something that we can you
know have rather than be too broad and
too motherhood and apple pie I'm trying
to grasp all I'm saying very
specifically I can have an argument the
neat no I'm saying specifically that we
could see one of the solutions to this
great malaise Daz effect in the West
the moment is to serve a step change in
investment in education what do you
reckon generally well I obviously agree
with that and I think as the
University's Minister our universities
have a big part to play in this country
in that respect - and I think that's why
widening participation is such a strong
and important part of the government's
agenda for its higher education reforms
and we've set ourselves a big target of
doubling the proportion of people from
disadvantaged backgrounds going to
university by 2020 from the levels we
inherited in 20 2009 10 does taking it
from thirteen point six percent to
twenty seven point two percent we are
slightly behind the run rate at the
moment we need to redouble efforts in
the last three years or serve this
Parliament and the reforms at which
we're taking it through partner - the
moment will certainly be helped in that
respect
but it's undeniable that we do need to
make sure that more people particularly
for disadvantaged backgrounds have an
opportunity to benefit from higher
education because when you look at where
the jobs are going to be created over
over half of them according to the UK
Commission on employment and skills are
going to require level six graduate
skills these are the jobs which are
going to provide you know very
fulfilling lives to people and we want
to make sure that you know an
opportunity to have a crack at these
jobs is fairly distributed that means
more people having a chance to go to our
universities so the reforms we're
putting through will help in in a number
of ways I hope we're putting a
transparency condition in the on all
universities which will require them to
fully disclose their offer to acceptance
data so they'll have to be transparent
about who applies who they make offers
to and who actually enrolls broken down
by all manner of
demographic ethnicity and so on that
will be of interest to researchers and
help inform policy we will be
mainstreaming equality of opportunity in
the new regulatory body which will be
called the office for students when I
say mainstreaming that'll be because it
will have a duty as a as a board to
promote equality of opportunity and
everything that it does taking on board
a function which is presently primarily
the responsibility of the office for
fair access and the director of fair
access less abdun so our principal
regulatory body will have a equality of
opportunity as one of its main legal
duties and we're also taking a number of
other steps to promote equality of
opportunity in the bill we're
introducing for the first time an
alternative student finance system this
will be and this will mean that for the
first time the Secretary of State will
have a power to offer a non-interest
bearing financial product to enable
people who for religious reasons can
take on interest-bearing loans to go to
university and we think this will be a
help to some Muslim students who present
are for various reasons unable to do so
so for those reasons we think the higher
education bill will support and promote
an equality of opportunity Thank You M
Braun I guess the remit of cases that we
we talked to government we we advise
government we lobby government on behalf
of science and engineering not just
academia but across the wider society
but but looking back towards wider
society what what do you feel I mean we
talk in the UK about science
communication public engagement in
science in the UK is second to none in
the world and I would argue that and I
would back that up we know that the just
the rise of just things like science
festivals and and and and and the way
the broadcast media cover science are we
doing enough I mean are we again I
returned to the the you know the has
there been a
a backlash against against science or it
is it disconnected from some recent
political upheavals are we doing enough
in convincing wider society of the
importance of science and engineering
even that there are several questions
there I mean I I think Jojo was
absolutely right right at the start of
the discussion that the it's I don't
think we can link Bragg's it and from to
a reaction against science at all it
sorry I really genuinely believe it's a
reaction against something else which is
lack of opportunity actually and and a
fair distribution of wealth can you say
but I mean in terms of them the what we
do here one of the I thought I you might
say I would say this but I think one of
the key components has been the the
BBC's engagement over the last few years
10 years let's say in signs in the sense
that it's it's created people a lot of
people like us so so the you can list
them there Alice Roberts Helen cherski
Chris Ling taught and Maggie Darien poco
on on on and on there's a list that Adam
Rutherford says so that the idea that
you've got an institution which is not a
commercial institution which has seen as
its duty and needs to continue to do so
by the way to take academics and work in
academics and put them on television and
radio and let them open act as a bridge
for it from the from the universities
and the research sector to the public is
extremely important and and and I think
that the the real value of the BBC's is
when it acts as an institution and when
it understands so it's a public
institution then its principal role is
to is to act in the interests of the
country and and it is a supremely
effective bridge to what it whatever
their number is 98 percent of the
population I think per week access some
kind of BBC service or other so that I
think that's the that's the advantage
we've got in this country that you're
right that we were envied across the
world the advantages that we have
institution whose Duty it is to act as a
bridge for ideas I think I'm in danger
of using up too much of the time here so
I think we should stop our discussion
and open up to the audience now as so
again I think we have roving mics and
mainly because I can't keep too many
questions in my head where maybe we
should have two questions at a time
rather than three or four and and then
both of you if you want to address them
okay so so one question over there and
then a lady sitting in the red jacket
towards the back Thank You professor
my name is either Tucker I run a company
called box which is involved with
improving the quality of practical
science education at primary schools and
one of the biggest issues that we've
found that there is empirical evidence
that if kids are taught practical
science every week for a sustained
period they really do progress
dramatically two to three times the
speed that they might normally be
expected to progress but the biggest
issues that schools face and it's across
the board in almost all state schools is
lack of funding to cover science
resources because they're under
tremendous pressure in terms of their
budgets with the deficit financing all
the various other things so what does
the panel think of all three of you
think about government actually
hypothecated funding specifically for
science resources at primary schools to
add our schools to be able to undertake
practical investigations all the time on
a consistent basis and develop the
independent thinking that Adam was
talking about as being so important and
as the kids grow through through there
thank you
well we'll check our second question and
then welcome to the panel
um hello i'm lopat Patel and I think we
can't celebrate 30 years of case without
asking this question and I'm sorry if
it's the wrong question but can we talk
about girls for a minute please
in stem particularly and also what are
the suggestions and why have we not been
as successful as we ought to be about
keeping girls in science
Thank You Bryan do you want to address
them
but both I mean to address your question
I mean I am on the one of the judges has
something called the Queen Elizabeth
Prize for engineering and that that was
one of the central aims of that is to
address the particular problem with
women in engineering this is it's
important to say though and it was
realized at the time that when you say
stem so I as far as I know there is not
a problem in in bio sciences of life
sciences or not as much of a problem as
there is in physical sciences and
engineering and I think we heard one of
the questions earlier one of the
chairman of Cisco said that it was
something as simple as a Job Description
I think and I think some of the research
if I remember rightly some of the
research that was done for the Queen
Elizabeth Prize suggested that there are
there often
unconscious biases such as those and
grim from parents actually as well as
from teachers in in encouraging young
women to go into specific bits of stem
and that's a difficult thing to address
of course it's unconscious bias usually
as far as I remember that's what one of
the interesting things that caught my
eye in the research suggested so
therefore what you're saying is that you
need to parents and edge let's say
educating parents in the opportunities
that are out there is perhaps as
important as the focus that we put in
schools on to the students but that's
just one suggestion I'm not an expert in
that area but that's something that
caught my eye as I remembered I I know
I've heard it said that you know women
who've made it to the top in
saying subjects like physics invariably
you find out that they went to an
all-girl school because physics wasn't
deemed a boy subject that is just
another subject and they did it but I
mean you're right certainly in terms of
going into the life sciences the the the
gender imbalance is nothing like it is
in electronic engineering or computer
science or physics but it soon gets
worse as you move up the the career
ladder and and you still have that
incredible imbalance when you reach the
top of you know professorial level for
example so there's still a wider
societal issue
I don't know Joe whether you have no I
think that's right I think making the
most of female role models in science is
also an important part of it you know we
venerate our eminent scientists very
often they are men but we've got to take
care as I didn't in my case speech back
in January to also refer to the eminent
female scientists who've contributed to
our standing around the world and I was
I was hauled up for mentioning ten
scientists all of which when all of all
of whom were men and quite rightly I
should like there was a careless
careless bit of speech writing on my
part it is important to make sure that
you know the likes of rosalind Franklin
and and others who've contributed to our
extraordinary standing get the
recognition they deserve and so you know
making the most of the role models that
are available is one thing making sure
that the stem engagement activity that's
going on in schools is sensitive to this
issue is obviously structure of a
fundamental through our stem ambassadors
program or it's parts I'm just inspiring
science program you know we can we can
try and tackle this problem at source to
you mentioned leadership Jim we I have a
set up a diversity steering group that's
looking specifically at the issue the
under-representation of women in
leadership positions across our research
system and there were members of the of
the steering group in the room and that
is looking at issues that are you know
pretties endemic and the system
on lower rate of applications for grants
lower success rates all of which can
pound over time to you know amount to
substantial differentiation in outcome
based on gender and these are things
which were thinking very hard about in
the department on the primary school
what one thing that I've been doing
recently with the Royal Society is we're
making a series of videos in primary
schools basically and we'd help the BBC
actually to just focus in on the
practical experiments that they do and
one of the ideas is to is to use use
them as a resource to encourage teachers
to also value the practical work that
can be done and also expand the I
suppose the the the understanding of why
the particular experiments have been
done so it so I've had a bit of
experience that going into primary
schools but what I would say recently is
that the the students have a terrific
terrific time and so I think you're
absolutely right that it's one of the
probably one of the most cost-effective
things we could do is to and I hear that
I've been to about ten primary schools
over the last sort of eight weeks
actually filming these little videos and
without exception every teacher says
that this is the this is the way to
infuse these these six seven eight nine
year olds in science it's absolutely
clear so it's quite interesting actually
there I think you're absolutely right
the oh no I think it would be I said I
think one of the most cost-effective
things that the government could do
there we go really write that down
well no it was simple things like this
one of the experiments was required
torches LED torches and I'm in the
school we were in the teacher in both
the torches because it's it's you know
what is it 20 20 pounds or something but
the 20 fans wasn't available so the
teacher did it so I mean it is amazing
that we worry about
practical work in a level science
subjects and have there now no longer
part of the examined part of a levels
but I think most university science
departments are asking for the practical
endorsement but there's still practicals
that carried out a level but but they're
not part of the the grade so they're
making as a part of the entry
requirements to study science at
university it's quite it's quite
advanced as well I was quite surprised
that there's much more importantly a
primary level but the curriculum seems
quite good in the sense that there was
there was a very keen focus on things
like they call it fair testing which
I've not heard the jargon word before
but it's this idea that you you change
one thing at a time change one thing at
a time see what he does and these are
six and seven-year-olds and I thought so
I thought the actual that the framework
that was given was quite an advanced and
and I was quite impressed with it but
it's that idea of having the relatively
small amounts of money to buy the
infrastructure necessary which was it
seemed to be at one of the blocks thank
you okay you have a couple more
questions so we have lady at the front
and gentleman there yes on the aisle if
you keep your hand up and that
microphone coming away we'll try and get
through a few more I'm have a Siddiqui
from the US Embassy but I'm not going to
be speaking through my personal compared
to my official capacity but speaking via
my personal capacity my question is
basically regarding the strong parallels
that we can draw between the US and the
UK
when the remain campaigners were
concentrating before the president um in
campaigning they concentrated in the
Golden Triangle of London Cambridge and
Oxford but ignored massive areas in the
Midlands and basically you know in the
US as well it was the Rust Belt that was
ignored and what most of the people in
the US and the UK who have been
disenfranchised or who had the
perception of being disenfranchised
believe is that most of the matter of
fact most of the manufacturing jobs are
being outsourced there is also
focus towards education but that's
long-term investment return on
investment it's not necessarily
short-term what steps is the UK taking
in basically skills development and for
vocational skills and thinking about
bringing back jobs via the manufacturing
sectors thank you yep
Richard Joyner I was lucky enough to be
chairman of case in its middle decade of
its existence from that time public
understanding of science has become a
serious growth industry it's predicated
on the idea that if the public
understands science they will support it
and if the government understands
science they will put more money into it
a recent political events and more
importantly I think some of the very
serious issues of the previous panel
raised suggest to me that there's an
important issue in that scientists need
to put more effort into understanding
the public would the panel agree and if
so how do we go about doing it who'd
like to start
I can kick off with the the science
funding one and Brian you can maybe time
tactical the other one about brexit I
mean I think but I think you know the
government does support science I mean
we always we all wish there were more
money to spend on priorities and science
is certainly a priority and we will wish
that we weren't in a position for much
of the last Parliament of having to make
you know significant savings across all
areas of public spending you know in
that environment the science budget did
relatively well in the sense it was one
of the protected areas of spending
against all the odds frankly when you
look at you know how few votes there are
in science as you know you've all been
commenting on with respect to you know
the the brexit phenomenon there aren't
many votes directly in science yet the
last government took the decision to
protect the science budget in cash terms
in the spending review settlement that
level of protection was bumped up a
notch so that it became a real terms
protection for the duration of the
spending review period which means that
the least the science ring-fence holds
its own in and is approved against
inflation of course we all wish there
were more money for us to be able to
allocate towards science the government
understands the high returns that it
generates this public spending as we've
already mentioned 20% in perpetuity and
we also recognize the important role
that public spending has in Craiova
sector investment and we genuinely
believe you know the calculations that
suggest public investment generates a
further one pound 36 very precise figure
of a private additional private sector
investment so you know we see the role
that there is for the state in making
sure that we are you know a society
that's generating scientific discovery
and that importantly is able to
translate those research that research
into into useful commercial applications
and that's why we also managed to
support in cash terms the innovation
budget over the course of the spending
review period Brian are you able to also
reject because also that the gentleman's
point was also about with communicating
science talking to the public rather
than having the public listen to
scientists I actually I don't I set the
premise of the question I think if you
look at I can't remember the exact
numbers but if you look at surveys a
trust across society scientists come out
pretty much top I think it's certainly
in the high 70s as far as I remember it
so I think that as we said before I
think the the problems we have in our
societies and Ananse I think because of
a lack of respect of scientists there
may be particular problems in particular
areas I don't think I'm being complacent
so for example I mean climate change
what do you have there you you have a is
it lack of trust in scientists so we're
fighting against extremely powerful
lobbies for powerful political lobbyists
powerful lobbies in the press and when
you get to those issues then of course
we have difficulty standing up and
making our voices heard because we're it
we're up the
against very very loud and powerful
voices but in general I think that the
standing of scientists in society as far
as the data I'm aware of who's concerned
is high so if I wonder whether we we
need to be so worried about that and I'm
not sure what maybe you could come back
on bit on the question yes I think we're
talking at cross-purposes you're saying
that scientists have respect often it
may be the case that they have respect
because they don't necessarily publicly
age with the the use of of the
importance has taken a very long time
for example for the the Royal Society to
attempt to engage publicly with many of
the issues that were raised previously
well I mean we I think you're right and
I think so Paul nurse has a lot too we
should thank cEPAL nurse for really
putting it up for the the front of the
agenda so now for example the Royal
Society I'm chairing them actually
around the country so we're deliberately
in inverted commas controversial issues
not just really scientifically
controversial but controversial in
society so we we had a panel on climate
change we have anyone on GM crops there
are the reports the Royal Society
putting out so I think they are now
making steps as a result of the the
encouragement from cipolla in particular
followed on now by Venki so yeah I take
the point it took a while but I think
the the the trajectory is positive I
think you're right I mean I think it was
about 15 or so years ago and there'll be
others who know exactly when we we made
this shift from what was called the
deficit model the public understanding
of science where the scientists were the
experts and they stood and they just
that the public were the empty vessels
that we would fill them with our
knowledge and expertise and we moved to
public engagement in science I mean I
guess that's the title of both them
you're all started chair my chair is
sorry their public engagement science is
meant to be a two-way dialogue but for a
few years that really was a term that
many in the scientific community felt
uncomfortable about because they weren't
quite sure how to carry out this two-way
dialogue but as brian says you know
uncertainly on issues where science the
scientific
we've had to be more transparent on
climate change in GM for example those
are two very very very important issues
I think things are changing now and I
think there is much more to weigh
discussion and and and and scientists
listening and and I'm feeling that
they're they have to they have a moral
and ethical obligation to to justify and
explain what they do so hopefully things
that things are moving in the right
direction did either of you we haven't
addressed the question well you do that
to Brian what are we doing on skills was
sort of the nub of the question and the
answer is a huge amount we've got a
schools reform agenda and that's been
underway since 2010 with Michael goes
reforms and now more recently with the
new Secretary of State's education
Opportunity Zones with putting in place
significant reforms of how we do
technical education and vocational
education and how we deliver
apprenticeships with the new
apprenticeship that we're putting in
place a new system whereby employers
play more of a role in skilling up our
apprenticeship system those are just
some of the many many ways in which
we're addressing our skills challenges I
feel we're sort of running out of time I
don't know whether should we be we
should yes yes yes Sarah tells me we
should we probably should wrap up and I
know that I'm sure there'll be many
other questions but we wouldn't exhaust
them anywhere if we had a few more so
I'd like to draw this discussion to a
close and I would like to invite some
graham Reid who is the chair of the case
board to give the vote of thanks
yep
I would just like to say a few words of
thanks to some of the many people that
have made this evening possible and so
if I miss you right then I apologize in
advance but I'm going to do my best
now first of all I should thank the
University of London for making
available this wonderful accommodation
the seedings proceedings have been done
in a partnership between case and our
main sponsor Elsevier and as well as the
discussions that we've enjoyed this
evening
case are producing a series of 30
articles for the 30 years of case Joe
Johnson has written one already and
we've selected ten of these to put in
this publication and you'll be able to
collect a copy on your way out if you've
not got one already and we produced this
publication in partnership with Elsevier
and so I'd particularly like to single
them out other sponsors for the evening
and we really couldn't have done this
without them but other sponsors for the
evening include the Open University who
are live-streaming this as we speak and
also the Royal Society of Chemistry the
Royal Commission for the Great
Exhibition of 1851 web platform company
figshare and immigration lawyers Fraga
man so I'd really like to thank all of
them now now I'd like to turn to the the
people who have made this evening I
think such a rich and enjoyable
experience first of all we had the panel
chaired by Sarah who I thought were
drawn from a wider population than you
sometimes get sitting talking to science
audiences about science and that
diversity in the panel for me was one of
the great sources of richness we had you
know we had everything from the chairman
of a large corporation to an author to
an eminent
economists and to life scientists we did
very well with that panel and then of
course we got on to the second part of
the evening where I think perhaps
uniquely we had the pleasure of an
hour's discussion with Brian Cox Jim
al-khalili and science Minister Joe
Johnson and I felt that no punches were
being pooled we we talked about some
really pretty delicate stuff and we
heard a candid discussion from all three
of them and I felt that that really made
that this evening something a bit
special and so that concludes the second
of the two parts of the evening and I'd
like you to join me in thanking all of
the people I've mentioned so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
