revolution estimates nearly 42 percent
of jobs are at a high risk of being
affected by automation in the next
decade or two we're gonna see more and
more things that look like science
fiction and fewer and fewer things that
look like jobs welcome back to automate
this this is our deep dive into the
future of work in an artificially
intelligent world last week machine
learning expert Michael Osborne told us
that almost half of all US jobs could be
at risk of automation including a few
you might not have considered white is
in waitresses Economist's fashion models
and machine learning isn't stopping
there according to Toronto's Brookfield
Institute we already have the technology
to automate more than 40% of the tasks
Canadian workers currently do their jobs
put another way today's robots aren't
just pushing buttons or building car
parts they're learning how to navigate
rush-hour traffic in a blizzard and if
you have a hard time wrapping your head
around the idea of autonomous vehicles
try autonomous surgeons this week we're
digging into the ways AI and machine
learning are transforming the world of
medicine healthcare is one of the
fastest growing sectors in the tech
industry and yes even surgeons may not
be immune to job disruption more on that
later the technology of the future could
cost some hospital workers their
salaries but it will also save lives in
2011 I was diagnosed with a form of
cancer that proceeded to reoccur
over the next five years and I think my
treatment was considerably changed as a
result of these technologies
that's Christa Jones describing how
machine learning technology helped her
become cancer free
she says AI technologies are far more
advanced today than when she was
diagnosed and that gives today's
patients a huge advantage probably would
have saved me two surgeries four years
of heartache and
much more of course radiology
departments aren't the only place where
smart machines are being put to work in
today's hospitals so once the robot arm
pulls the medications for one patient
it's gonna slide it over to the side
where is gonna bind it with a plastic
ring this is Rita jewe director of
pharmacy at the UCSF Medical Center in
San Francisco and she's describing one
of the robots responsible for putting
together her patients daily medications
on a front page for the MIT of the
medications with the patient's name and
all the medications that I do according
to the time
Rita's robots don't just dispense pills
they can also mix IV medications and
when it comes to mistakes
she says the robots have a far better
track record than their human
counterparts the chances of the wrong
drug that is put into the wrong package
is almost zero if you're curious to see
these robots in action check out the
video we've put up on our website at
cbc.ca slash day sex of course most
pharmacies still rely on flesh and blood
technicians but Rita says it's just a
matter of time until automation is more
widespread
I think introducing automation and
robots to the pharmacy industry is the
only way we can get as close to making
zero errors as possible Rita's pharmacy
robots do not come cheap each one costs
more than a million dollars but my next
guest says that by 2030 Hospital robots
will be doing a lot more than dispensing
pills they will be operating on us and
they will be totally autonomous dr.
Peter Kim is a Canadian surgeon and the
associate surgeon in chief at Children's
National Medical Center in Washington DC
he's also part of a research team that's
building an autonomous surgical robot a
robot that he says could eventually
outperform human surgeons for some
medical procedures dr. Peter Kim is in
Washington Peter good morning welcome to
day 6 good morning
Peter we just heard read at you
describing the robot employees at her
pharmacy in San Francisco but you want
to take things a fairly gigantic step
further because you're part of a team
that's developing a fully autonomous
robot that could perform surgery all on
its own what techniques do you think in
the future could be done more
efficiently by a robot surgeon that are
still being done by humans now I think
the answer is all of the above a lot of
tools we have are really dumb and then
they are simple extension of smart
humans surgical robot is a very good
example the robot itself isn't aware
where things are in three-dimensional
space nor is it able to distinguish any
tissues when it's actually not operative
setting but in the future smart
technologies will be built within those
tools it will not only be aware where
things are in three-dimensional space it
probably will be aware of how things are
doing the fact that these machines can
perform more precisely more accurately
and at the same time you can put a lot
of information in other it has a more
bigger memory capacity so you can
imagine in the future if you happen to
need a surgery you can potentially
program the very best surgical
techniques and judgments into a machine
and have it available for everybody
actually democratizing surgery so tell
us about the robot that you are
developing the robot is called star what
do you hope star will do so star is a
smart tissue autonomous robot so this
machine sees little more than a human
visual spectrum would permit and at the
same time unlike what's available
currently in the surgical suites this
machine is aware where things are in
three-dimensional space so it has a
situational awareness and by programming
intelligence for instance how to do a
particular surgical task in this case we
happen to choose what we call
anastomosis that is putting together two
ends of an intestine and then we added a
little bit of a touching or sensing a
capacity to that sort of machine and
when we compare this machine doing an
anastomosis in a live large animal model
to the same procedures done by very
experienced surgeons using open surgical
tools and current robotic tools to our
surprise this machine performed better
than current human surgeons in that test
was the star robot
acting autonomously or was it acting
with guidance from surgeons so a 60% of
that was done completely autonomously
and 40% was done supervised meaning that
robot would make a decision and then
wait for a human supervision but since
then we've done fully autonomous
anastomosis as well so you know you can
imagine that you can expand into
different parts of surgery where you
require precision including the sessions
opening and closure and so on
do you imagine a day when an autonomous
robot could do open-heart surgery I do
as and there are a couple of reasons why
I'm very interested in this number one
that even with the best intentions today
there's a fairly significant incidence
of complications and medical error and I
think this is one way to mitigate that
at the same time I think there are
places in surgery where humans can work
with machines to have a better outcome
less complications and then greater
safety not everyone who is working in
this field is convinced that the medical
robots we already have are as effective
as they're made out to be dr. Marty
Macari is a professor of surgery at the
Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine we spoke to him he has some
concerns about the way hospitals are
using the non autonomous da Vinci robot
for some laparoscopic procedures those
keyhole procedures let's hear some of
what he had to say then we'll come back
and talk I think we saw too rapid and
adoption of robotic surgery early in its
introduction no one really asked the
question is it better than standard
laparoscopic surgery for a long time and
only after 15 years or so of the robots
use did we really start to understand
its benefit and its benefit is limited
to a subset of operations but there are
a lot of areas where it's overused so
how can we justify rationing healthcare
and at the same time using lavish
expensive devices that yes have amazing
technology but have not been shown to
benefit patients over the standard
minimally invasive surgery dr. Peter Kim
how do you respond to what dr. Macari is
saying here that we might be rushing to
adopt technologies without assessing
their real value I think his point is
well-taken and it
true many of the things he mentioned and
that the current state of Technology
although it has been very unable in four
small sections of surgical specialties
the the actual cost of the technology
itself is very prohibitive having said
that I think it's a very good first
generation enabling technology as we
move towards the future I think that
more and more practitioners are thinking
in a more selective applications come in
a places where it does what it does
better but it really does look like
there could be especially if the rate of
technological change is fast that there
could be a revolution in medical
technologies and patients aren't the
only ones in this equation those
technologies will affect hospital
workers so you are a surgeon are you
worried that there come a time in the
future maybe the near future that robots
like the one that you're building could
put people in the medical sector out of
work you know I look forward to it
actually if we can improve what I do as
a surgeon I welcome the opportunity of
having smarter and smarter technologies
that can enable me to provide a more
consistent more effective outcome
including smart surgical robots so we
are talking about robots and surgeries
now but what about family doctors do you
see robots and AI replacing family
doctors and in the future now I'm not
sure about replacing but I think that it
enhances us and providing better care so
it's very difficult being a family
doctor because you have to know
everything about everything
all the time and the map keep up to date
with it so the notion that some of these
knowledge azar within individual human
beings not being able to be programmed
and being able to be available for
everybody I just think that's a sort of
poor way of not only building knowledge
but transmitting it so to provide a sort
of a if a universal care of a highest
quality a technology is really an
equalizer democratizing agent here do
you think about the rate of change do
you do you when you when you're working
on your robot do you imagine what is
going to be need to be done ethically in
order to introduce those kinds of
surgeries to a human patient absolutely
I mean how our intentions always sort of
honorable and clear that we want to sort
very best benefits you know if you just
look back it's only been 10 years since
the phone you know the iPhone came out
and then that revolutionized how we live
life and Internet's been only around for
what 20 30 years so rate at which things
are changing I think is just
unimaginable and and I think for
instance the star robot was selected by
NASA as a one of the technologies that
would like to acquire in the future and
you know they are planning to go to Mars
in 13 years 2030 I just can't imagine
what it will be like even 5 10 years
from now do you think you're going to
send star to Mars when that mission
happens in 2030
well they'll need it you know you can't
come back if you've got some surgical
emergencies and and you can't phone it
will take you half an hour to call
somebody so I think in their wisdom it
would be smart for them to get one of
them one of ours you better get stars
consent first yes dr. Kim thank you for
being with us my pleasure dr. Peter Kim
is a Canadian surgeon and the associate
surgeon in chief at Children's National
Medical Center in Washington DC if you'd
like to see the robot pharmacist at the
university of san francisco california
in action we've posted a video of the
robots on our website for that and much
more from our series automate this head
to cbc.ca slash day6 if and when we all
lose our jobs to machines we can always
take up painting but even the creative
sectors aren't immune to the changes
that are coming okay hands up if you
think home one was written by human
computer programs are already capable of
writing haikus composing beetle style
pop tunes and even building convincing
cgi movie stars in part three i've
automate this we're asking how AI could
reshape the media from pop music to
blockbuster films you can imagine a a I
taking a movie and editing 500 different
versions of it and a B testing those in
real-time so that they can see which
version performs the best that's coming
up next week on day six and if your job
is changing thanks to robots or anything
else we want to hear about it subscribe
