whoever servants understand shondaland
um give me that thank you very much and
good morning as I gather with the pose
still to say in Spain
I shouldn't be speaking in this session
I was originally scheduled to be
speaking tomorrow and I have been thrust
into this session because my friend dr.
Pedro de magalhães cannot be here today
and is only arriving tomorrow so we have
been swapped but the result is that my
prepared remarks are actually not about
cryopreservation they are about
longevity so I my talk is more of an
extension of the previous session
however I have decided to change what
I'm going to say a little bit and to
shorten my prepared remarks to maybe 10
minutes for the second half of my my
time so that I can spend the first task
talking about cryopreservation a little
bit and since dr. carbo started the
session by being proudly provocative I
thought I would do the same thing and
say what I think of what dr. Carver said
because I I feel that it's rather
important to give a counterpart the
counterpoint to some of dr. Carver's
remarks I believe that the discussion
that dr. Kawa gave about the viability
and the feasibility and the way we ought
to be thinking about the
cryopreservation of brains or of whole
bodies rests on two very serious mistake
and these are very common mistakes
mistakes that many people make including
scientists and also including medics but
medics especially should not be making
these mistakes I am myself biomedical
researcher I am a PhD not an MD but of
course dr. Cabo is a surgeon and I think
it's important to highlight these two
mistakes the first one is with regard to
the nature of death dr. Cabo was very
clear in his view that if somebody is
cryopreserved when they are dead then
they will continue to be dead even if
and when they may be revived and I feel
that this is a distortion of the real
situation
because we all know and medics know
better than anybody that the decision as
to whether somebody is dead at a
particular point is not perfect that
medics get it wrong sometimes and that's
why there are quite a lot of people
walking around today who were once
declared to be dead
we know that the conventional definition
of death the criteria that medics have
to investigates in order to make that
pronouncement has changed over the years
as a result of medical progress that has
allowed people who might previously have
been thought to be dead to be actually
revived so we must be very clear that
death is not this certain instantaneous
process that society and the law
pretends that it is we must remember
that all biologists and all medics know
that death is actually a gradual process
which involves a period of time during
which we cannot really say whether
someone is dead or not and the whole
point of cryonics is to exploit that
uncertainty there is absolutely no merit
no legitimacy in saying that somebody
who has been cryopreserved when they
have been declared to be dead if
actually dead nun and I think it is very
important to remember that the other big
mistake perhaps an even bigger mistake
that dr. Kaaba made in my view is he
made a confusion between science and
technology what is the difference
science is the attempt to understand
nature better and better technology is
the attempt to manipulate nature better
and better and medicine is not a branch
of science it is a branch of technology
but of course the two things are related
but here is the way that they are
related every medical procedure that we
have today every medical procedure that
has ever been invented began as a
scientific experiment the first time
that it was done the scientific
experiment was designed and we had no
evidence as to the efficacy of the
medical procedure until that scientific
experiment had been completed and yet we
still did the scientific experiment now
a scientific experiment whose results is
a medical procedure in other words a
scientific experiment whose results can
eventually save lives may or may not
save lives the first time it is done we
just don't know until the experiment is
over and the thing about cryo preserving
brains or whole people is that the
scientific experiment the first
scientific experiment is still ongoing
it isn't over yet so dr. Cabo was
completely correct to say that we have
no scientific evidence that's the
revival of cryopreserved people whether
cryopreserved as whole bodies or as
brains will be an effective medical
procedure
but that isn't a reason to ridicule it
that is not a reason to compare it to
science fiction and I firmly believe
that is extremely irresponsible for
senior credentialed medics who have
influence over people's thinking to view
it and describe it in that way so that's
the end of my rants now I'm going to
talk about no now I'm going to talk
about longevity I'm going to say some
remarks which you will see have a lot of
similarity to some of what you heard
this morning especially from dr. Blasco
and dr. Belmonte you will see that there
is a lot of coming together of opinions
and thinking in this area now we should
really start by by agreeing on what
aging is and this doesn't happen enough
we don't talk about aging enough about
what it is and if we don't talk about
that then often the conversations about
how to do anything about aging become
unproductive because they are confused
by terminology so I'm going to tell you
what I say aging is it is simply the
accumulation of damage that happens as a
result of the way the body works and in
that sense it is really the same process
for a living organism like you or me
though it is for a long living machine
like a car or an aeroplane eating is not
a phenomenon of biology it is a
phenomenon of physics it is a fact that
any machine with moving parts is going
to do itself damage when it operates and
that damage eventually becomes too
abundant there is too much damage for
the machine to tolerate so that's when
the machine starts to work less well and
eventually not to work at all now in
biological terms that just comes down to
three words metabolism which is the
network of processes keeping us alive
creates damage throughout life even
starting before we're born and
eventually late in life there's too much
damage and we get sick so of course what
we want to do is
slow down those arrows we want to flirt
we want to combat the process that goes
from being alive to being dead and we
haven't been very successful we've been
extremely successful over the past 200
years or so in developing ways to
eliminate the ill health of early life
200 years ago more than one-third of
babies even in the wealthiest countries
would die before the age of 1 and now
hardly any of them do and that was done
really easily just by figuring out that
hygiene is a good idea and you know very
simple medicines we have made very
little progress against aging why well
most people would say aging is just very
very complicated you know you're not
supposed to be able to read this slide
by the way you know it's just like yeah
there's just so much going on that it
has overwhelmed the ability of medical
researchers to bring it under control
and that is part of the answer but it's
not the whole answer the main answer is
that we have been thinking about aging
wrongly just as dr. carbo thinks about
death wrongly we have been thinking
about aging in a way that is bound to
lead us to to make unsuccessful attempt
to bring medicine to bear on it in
particular if you ask most people and
that includes most medics to classify
disease to say in what ways can we be
sick they would say something like what
I am showing in this table they would
say well there are infectious diseases
that's column one there are genetic
diseases that's column two there are the
chronic progressive diseases of old age
like Alzheimer's or most cancers or
atherosclerosis that's column three then
there is this other completely separate
thing out in the stratosphere called
aging itself which consists of these
very nebulous pulley to find things like
frailty or the loss of muscle mass as we
get older that's what sarcopenia is
things like that they think of these
things as not diseases and this kind of
implies that they are off-limits for
medicine and that they are kind of
natural and inevitable and we shouldn't
really be thinking about controlling
them with medicine it's nonsense
the correct way to think about
the ways we get sick is like this all
the columns are just the same as before
but the big black line is in a different
place
to emphasize the fact that column three
is nothing like column one the things
that happen in old age are not
infections they are side effects of
being alive and the difference between
column 3 and column 4 is purely semantic
there's simply you know column three is
the aspects of aging that we have chosen
to give disease like names to and column
four it's the ones that we have for
dance that is all once we remember that
it's easy to see the geriatric medicine
is never going to work very well if you
try to attack the pathologies of old age
as if they were infections in other
words attack them directly and try to
eliminate them from the body you're
never going to get anywhere really
because metabolism is still occurring in
these people so damage is still
accumulating so any therapy that tries
to attack the consequences of damage is
bound to get progressively less
effective as the person gets older now
of course people realize this a few
people realize that's a long time ago
more than a hundred years ago
and that's why there is a field called
bio gerontology that's the study of the
biology of aging people realize that you
have to be much more preventative and
intervene at an earlier stage in the
chain of events and the inspiration was
the observation that in the living world
we see huge variability in how rapidly
aging happens some species just age a
lot more slowly than others so maybe the
idea is we can understand this really
well and then we will be able to use
that understanding to influence how
rapidly we age the idea is that we could
somehow clean up our metabolism make it
generate damage more slowly than it
naturally does unfortunately this was an
example of dr. Cabos other mistake of
confusing science with technology
understanding something does not
necessarily lead straightforwardly
to a way to manipulate it it just
doesn't and sure enough in this case
this is the thing that gerontologists
decided they need to understand
metabolism and metabolism is
rather complicated put your hand up if
you write software for a living or
anything like that okay there are a few
programmers here anyone who writes
software will recognize immediately that
this is the ultimate nightmare of
uncommented spaghetti code there is no
way in the world that we are ever going
to be able to tweak this system to stop
it from doing the thing that we don't
want it to do the creation of damage
without at the same time stopping it
from doing things we needed to do to
keep us alive not going to happen and of
course actually the problem is much
worse than that this is a simplified
diagram of a small subset of what we
know about how the body works the amount
that we don't know about how the body
works is far bigger every biologist will
agree with that and that's ignoring even
the stuff that we don't even know that
we don't know so you know it never gonna
happen
no I haven't got really time to talk
about the next mistakes that biologists
made it gerrant ologists made which was
in the early 1990s to try to emulate the
way that organisms respond to famine
that doesn't work either
basically because long-lived organisms
don't respond very much to famine
instead I will go on and talk about the
approach that's actually going to work
which is damage repair I'm gonna call it
the maintenance approach the idea here
is that our goal is to slow down to
weaken the link between metabolism and
pathology between being alive and being
dead but we can do that without
weakening the link between metabolism
and damage or the link between damage
and pathology we can leave those links
intact and if we can just separate them
from each other and that's what we do
with the maintenance approach the
maintenance approach just means we go in
and periodically repair damage as it
happens and thereby even if damage is
being generated at the natural rates not
being slowed down nevertheless the
damage does not reach the level of
abundance that is bad for you that
causes pathologies and that is huge as a
way of doing technology rather than
science what it does is it sidesteps our
ignorance
if we're not proposing to slow down the
rate at which metabolism creates damage
then we don't need to understand
metabolism very well or we need to do is
understand damage and characterize it
and figure out how to repair it
similarly if we can repair damage we
don't need to understand why having a
lot of damage is bad for you
why pathology happened because we're not
going to let there be a lot of damage in
the first place we're going to keep
damage lot and of course it works this
is common sense because we already
successfully do it for simple man-made
machines remember what I told you at the
beginning that aging is fundamentally a
phenomenon of physics not biology
therefore we can look at simple man-made
machines and see whether the maintenance
approach works and sure enough it does
here is a car that's more than 100 years
old
now that's impressive and what's even
more impressive is that this car is
working every bit as well as when it was
built
fantastic but here's the most impressive
thing it's not doing that because it was
designed to this car was not designed to
last a hundred years it was probably
designed to last ten years but it's
still going why because comprehensive
preventative maintenance works it really
works if you can restore and maintain
the structure and composition of a
machine however complicated the machine
is then you are also going to restore
and maintain that machine's function so
what does this mean in terms of biology
well of course the question I have not
answered yet is can we actually do this
is the body simple enough that we could
actually implement this maintenance
approach it may be common sense but it
still may be very very very hard but
actually because remember what I just
told you about sidestepping our
ignorance of metabolism and so on we
actually don't need to worry about how
complicated the body is we only need to
worry about how complicated the damage
is this set of intermediate between
metabolism and pathology if we can
characterize and repair that damage
we're done and it turns out that things
are looking pretty promising if you look
at the left hand
side of this table this is my
classification of the types of damage
that occur in the body there are many
many many many types of damage but I
claim that they can all be fitted into
this seven-point classification all of
them are in one way or another examples
of one of these categories look at these
categories there are very clear concrete
well-defined things for example the
first one cell loss what is that it's
just cells dying and not being
automatically replaced by the division
of other cells if that happens then
obviously the number of cells in the
affected organ will go down and
eventually there won't be enough cells
for the organ to do its job and you get
some kind of disease or disability an
example would be Parkinson's disease
which is caused by the loss of a
particular type of neuron in a
particular part of the brain and if we
look at the right-hand side of this
table the good news of course is that
there are entries in it for every row in
other words for each of these categories
we have a generic approach to
implementing the maintenance strategy we
can in the case of cell loss simply
point to stem cell therapy that's what
stem cell therapy is right we just want
to restore the number of cells in a
given tissue to what it was at an
earlier age and we do that by preparing
cells in the laboratory into an
appropriate epigenetic state so that we
can inject them into the body and they
will divide and differentiate to form
replacements for the cells that the body
is not replacing on its own that's all
that stem cell therapy is and sure
enough stem cell therapy for Parkinson's
disease is extremely promising even 25
years ago when we didn't have much of a
clue how to manipulate the epigenetic
state of cells in the laboratory still
when the first clinical trials of such
therapies were done a few patients got
lucky they got some of the right type of
cells and those patients 25 years later
are still completely free of Parkinson's
symptoms despite having had no other
therapy for the past 20 years that's how
good it is and lots of clinical new
clinical trials are now starting up
because of course now we're much better
at that
genetic manipulation of stem cells now
in this short talk I don't have time to
go through the other categories here but
let me simply say that the reason why
sense Research Foundation exists is
because much more work is needed in all
of these areas there are mostly not
nearly so far along in terms of research
and development as the stem cell world
is and therefore it's necessary to do
the really early-stage proof-of-concept
work that demonstrates that these things
are feasible but all of these things are
going really rather well I think I might
have a I haven't got time to talk about
the life stone but here's just a summary
of some of the papers that we've
published over the past few years in
this area making real breakthroughs that
have unblocked logjams that have stalled
research in very important areas of
damage repair for upwards of 10 or 15
years these areas are now moving forward
very effectively and of course other
work done by other people has done the
same thing has actually also helped to
advance this and that's really why the
whole idea of rejuvenation biotechnology
has become a mainstream concept it
really is mainstream this is our
scientific advisory board these are all
real world leaders in this area
v the people who have put their names to
the rejuvenation approach and they have
reputations that they could lose if they
were putting their names to things that
didn't make scientific sense and
technological sense but they do here's
someone whose face you may recognize dr.
Blasco whom you met this morning she's
been on our scientific advisory board
for a long time she's a good friend of
mine and her work is very much an
example of the kind of rejuvenation that
I'm talking about here is a picture that
you've seen a couple of times before in
the previous session this is actually
the kind of headline figure from a paper
that dr. Blasco was a co-author on as
you know but as you also saw people who
had nothing to do with that paper are
using it as a way to describe why their
own work is relevant this has kind of
become the touchstone of the legitimacy
that the
what constitutes legitimate bio
gerontology research that is leading to
potential medicines and you may have
noticed a certain amount of similarity
between what this diagram depict and
what I have been talking about earlier
and of course you might say that it's a
bit of a shame that sense Research
Foundation doesn't get the credit for
having said more or less exactly the
same thing ten years previously but
that's okay because now you know we've
got 15 years ago when I started saying
these things I was pretty much entirely
ignored
whereas now this kind of thinking is
getting huge amounts of attention this
paper is probably going to become the
single most highly cited paper in the
history of biomedical gerontology within
the next few years it's still being
cited maybe once every two days and
that's what matters that's what matters
people are really paying attention you
say that these people have chosen to
divide Aging into nine pieces rather
than seven and they've got their
corresponding interventions it's exactly
the same idea that I've already put
forward so this is really a good thing
now I do want to close by emphasizing
one very important feature of what we do
which is something that journalists
constantly downplay or ignore which is
that we are doing medical research all
of the work that you're going to hear
about during this conference whether in
longevity or in cryopreservation is
straightforward medical research and it
is not some kind of separate thing
now most people who write about my work
and the work of cents Research
Foundation in the media they tend to
emphasize the longevity side effect they
emphasize that if we can really cure
aging as they like to call it then we
will live forever
now it's true that medicine that this
medicine is likely to have a big
longevity side effect it's likely to get
people to live longer on average because
let's face it most people die of being
sick and most people are sick because of
having been born a long time ago but
that doesn't stop
that alter the fact that it's a side
effect and all medicine have that same
side effect it helps people to live
longer the side effect in this case is
going to be a lot bigger than any
medicine that have come before but that
doesn't change the fact that this is
just medical research and I personally
believe that this community that
supports this work should say that thing
a lot more I think we should move away
from language that tries to emphasize
how dramatically different the world
will be when we don't have aging yes it
will be different in a number of ways
but if we scare people by saying the
world will be completely different then
we will flow down the efforts to
actually get there because people will
not support the idea of giving you know
the resources that are needed to do the
medical research we need to emphasize
than the continuity of this kind of
research with the research that people
are already comfortable with research to
actually get people to stay healthy when
they get older I will stop there and I
will just mention that I wrote a book
about ten years ago on this which will
which covers the biological details of
it all in great detail and luckily I'm
pleased to say that a couple of years
ago a very inspiring and visionary
publisher from Madrid was able to
sponsor the translation of this book
into Spanish this is the version that
exists in Spanish it's being relaunched
this week and I'll be doing a book
signing I think it's a or two I forget
the details of when but yes so this is
now available for those of you who don't
speak English thank you very much and I
have over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
