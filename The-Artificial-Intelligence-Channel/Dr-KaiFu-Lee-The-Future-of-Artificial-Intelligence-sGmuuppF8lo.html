Christian is one of my most respected
colleagues in the industry and I'm
pleased to see that he's going to spend
more time in the greater china
area a lot of you probably know me
through Google or my books or salivation
ventures transient town as our incubator
for young entrepreneurs but today
actually I want to tell you what my real
background was which sometimes I omit I
actually smile school I was an
undergraduate at Columbia and I wanted
to attend and get a PhD in computer
science and this is what I wrote this is
the actual application I sent to a
number of universities that ended up
going to Carnegie Mellon this was back
in 1983 when I thought really the final
frontier
will be to understand how our brain
works and if the computer could become
our brain be connected to our brain we
understand how the human thinking works
this is the final frontier that we could
conquer little did I know that this
field would end up becoming so hot and
so hot so quickly even though it's
30-some years later and that my original
aspiration would become completely
different so later I will tell you what
actually happened with me and with AI
and why we're all in in artificial
intelligence in salivation ventures when
you come and visit us in Chongqing
hometown there are no more incubator
companies we do not do angel investments
anymore so I talked about you know with
many of my friends how are you going to
talk about how to start a new company I
think there's a much greater thing that
all of us have to understand and capture
and and use because it's just like the
Internet I think early days and Andrew
Andy Grove set any company that doesn't
understand the internet is going to be
perished because of it and it has
everyone has to embrace it and I think
AI is something much bigger than even
internet so something everyone has to
understand
it's a great investment opportunity for
us and is a it's going to impact not
just technology companies it's going to
change every traditional company change
education change society change the way
the government's think so it is
something so big that we are no longer
doing incubation sound of ancient been
Church we haven't changed our name but
we are completely into artificial
intelligence and I want to tell you why
and also you will learn that my original
aspiration turned out to be a little
naive that AI today is not at all about
taking the human brain or connecting to
it and anyone who tells you so is
perhaps overly optimistic or overly
naive and I will proceed to explain what
AI is so actually before I went to Apple
I actually did a lot of work involving
computer gaming actually developed the
first program I wrote the code myself
that be the world champion not go but a
fellow and I also wrote the first speech
recognition system that we could
understand speaker independent
continuous speech so that was my work
before I went and became a technology
executive and the venture capitalists
but this is these are the memories that
will always stay with me and I think the
fundamental understanding of these
technologies makes us better off in
terms of investor and the company that
we do so really this is the history of
AI in the 50s people said we're going to
figure out how the brain works and then
we're gonna solve it in ten years and
then all the expectations got built up
and then of course not did not deliver
and people said you liar and then
funding stopped and again right after my
PhD thesis people said Wow
AI is going to change the world it's
going to be not through expert systems
but through neural networks and then of
course it also failed to deliver and now
we're at even a higher level of
expectation than ever so I think a fair
question for people people to ask is is
this for real or are we going to be
facing another hype and and I think if
there's one single most important
message is that this time it is for
real and the most important thing that
happened is something called deep
learning now a is bigger is big it
includes a discipline called machine
learning and machine learning is big it
includes a discipline called deep
learning now
however deep learning turned out to be
the biggest discovery that is really
reshaping many aspects of our society
and this is not a technical talk so I
won't go into a lot of depth in fact
I'll try to give a most simple to
explain explanation of what is deep
learning you've probably heard this a
lot of places I see a lot of
entrepreneurs put deep learning into
their into their project proposal a lot
of people put deep learning on their
resumes but really what is deep learning
it is basically like Excel so all of you
know Excel right it's this spreadsheet
you put in a bunch of numbers you click
magic happens right you put in all your
quarterly numbers salary taxes expenses
income revenue taxes you click your
quarterly earnings comes out that's
Excel and that is what keep learning
does so you feed in lots of numbers you
click something some answer comes out
and that answer can be a perception a
prediction a classification so in the
case of alphago you feed the lots of go
positions and you the current position
outcomes the best move that you can make
you feed a lots of people borrowing
money and either defaulting or repaying
out comes a prediction about this
individual person whether that he or she
will repay or default you feed it lots
of stock prices it will tell you which
one will most likely go up tomorrow and
and you feed it lots of products into a
table a user and out comes the one that
this user is most likely to buy if you
show the ad in front of the user so that
is like Excel lots of numbers going in
you click one answer comes out it's not
always right but this may be the most
likely and your maximum here is doing an
optimization it's giving you the
predictions so that over a large
number of data set you minimize the
default rate you maximize your
investment return you maximize your ad
click-through and that is all and you
can go to more advanced applications
where the output is where they're my
autonomous vehicle should turn left to
buy one degree or two degrees or turn
right or should I press brake or
accelerate so these are basically the
output of this mineral Network which can
be thought of as an Excel spreadsheet
now that's a similarity that's where the
similarity ends it differs from an excel
in the sense that as you know excel
cells are programmed they have formulas
that people go into program like right
like the monthly revenue is the sum of
all the daily revenue okay in this
there's no such work no such humanly
programmed formula the formula is
magically derived by a blackbox called
deep learning so you feed it lots of
things so that it will learn what is
right and wrong so in the case of long
default you feed it lots of people who
have applied for loans and then you
teach it in each case whether this
person is likely to default or now so
immediately you think okay it's about
credit rating is about a human banking
expert marking this person as a high
highly suspect of defaulting or not no
cannot do that because if you have human
label going into the deep learning then
you're bound to not exceed human
performance
we're here to dramatically out
performance so that's what alphago
cannot just learn a human play it's got
a period itself so similarly what should
you teach a long approval program a long
underwriting program you need to teach
it by data with actual people who've
borrowed money lots of data about
themselves and the actual facts of
whether they defaulted or not so when
you have that data it becomes grant
truth because it is based on reality of
the person defaulting or not your goal
positions are based on reality of
whether you won or not your stock
positions are based on the reality of
whether the stock went up or not and it
will crunch through billions of data and
determine overall the decisions you can
make how to
maximize your return so that is the
magic behind deep learning the excel
part is simple the computation is simple
coming learning the formulas by itself
is magical so that is the short tutorial
on deep learning and a lot of people
think you know deep learning that's a
long ways from us but actually it is
here today we saw just in the last few
years and these are four examples in go
and in Texas Hold'em where deep learning
based algorithms or other AI algorithms
have completely be the world champion be
the very very best of humans based on
with the algorithms I just described on
the bottom you see something even
tougher it's perception it's about
recognizing speech and objects at the
level higher the human performance and
you can see deep learning was invented
about ten years ago but most people
didn't understand the paper too much
math and then it was really about seven
eight years ago people started applying
it and every year it got better it's not
them it's not as magical as I described
you actually have to go in and tune a
lot of things so people figured out how
to tune this mathematical theory into
real practice so with the tuning you saw
that the jump in terms of object
recognition went from 70s up to over
human 94% performance and then speech
recognition also went below a human
error rate so in both cases there are
now better than average human
performance in terms of recognizing the
words I speak and recognizing about a
thousand objects not anything but not
not full seeing understanding or speech
understanding but enough enough so that
it's beating human at a very tough
recognition tasks so you might say well
that's still very far away from us but
actually it really isn't because if you
open up your phone you are using AI
every day you just don't know it at
least twenty apps on your phone are
using AI so whether you're using the
American Facebook Google or the Chinese
Tencent and Taobao it's all AI in the
background or if used in May to is AI in
the background so did you I'm sure many
of you used how about right is Taba how
many have you noticed over the today
when Taba recommends
thing to you it's much more something
you're much more inclined to buy than
five years ago
if you feel that when you school to talk
about the ads were random five years ago
now you see something you're tempted to
buy it right and that why is that
that's because Taobao gathered all the
people's buying pattern and they're
predicting on an individual basis what
my new body
similarly you guys use may to I won't
ask you to raise your hands because I
know the men will not raise their hands
but you know who you are but did you
know this may - doing a much better job
today than five years ago back then you
know you probably have to go in and you
know make your eyes just the right size
make it all the shadows and nose perfect
so that it look more beautiful but no
one thinks you've messed with it but
today I would bet and again I won't ask
for a show of hands I would bet the
great majority here use an automatic
beautification right I know I do
my wife and kids do it's one click and
how is that done it's because may 2 has
a eye in the background every time you
save a photo or if you delete a photo
right you take a selfie and you save it
it's a signal - may - I like it
and every time you delete it is a signal
to me - I don't like it so it just has
to make make a big deep Learning Network
that learns let's do more of the people
things that people like and do less of
what people don't like so that's how may
2 uses they are and then all the other
examples you know dd to find the matches
total how to give you you know total is
an example mostly we probably used hotel
so that was an example where the news
has there's no editors it's all AI doing
the editorial they have I think 50 or 50
a are scientists they're hiring 200 this
year right so pretty much all these
companies they just have AI in the
background running on the data you just
don't know you're the user who thinks
the service has improved but it improved
not because some programmer came up with
the algorithm but because it's learning
on its own with the data that we
contribute every day we are guinea pigs
to the be eighty and Google Facebook
Microsoft and our data is being used to
refine their AI learning results so AI
will be used in a lot of places I'll go
into this more later but I think
fundamentally the first
placing which AI will get used is
whoever has lots of data because it
requires lots of data to work and that's
going to be in you know internet trading
finance banking applications and also
supply chain
ERP CRM whoever's got all this data you
can use it today immediately extract
economic value and that's why a I is
going to make lots of money for lots of
people very quickly the next level will
be when they I new uses of AI generates
data that was never there before
for example amazonica right before there
was never anything that could collect
all the noises from our living room and
make use out of it quite scary actually
but but it's there today at least in
American families and who knows what
Amazon will do with that so new data new
applications and then the third level of
AI is when AI starts moving all over the
place and this is actually tougher
because then you're not dealing with
spreadsheets you got to deal with the
mechanical engineering Industrial
Engineering all the difficult issues
with control that's actually tougher to
do but when that happens that will go in
and change our factory or our factories
or robots or security and and we'll have
robots that you know walk around and do
our dishes and cook our food for us and
then we'll have autonomous vehicles
everywhere that's far that's probably
ten years from now but these three
phases will will happen and they will
create huge changes in our society so
make it more concrete I'll give you two
examples some of the actual companies we
invested in that are doing AI today and
making a huge difference the first one
is called mega V or face plus plus when
you're walking through a lot of the
airports in China this technology is
installed and it has the ability to
recognize any face from a database of
three million faces so think about human
capability we talked about human speech
and object recognition anyone here can
recognize three million faces maybe
three thousand right so here we have a
computer algorithm that's three orders
of magnitude better than us and imagine
all the world's criminals most wanted
criminals and terrorists that's there's
hardly three million
of them so with this installed in every
airport this could prevent the next
9-1-1 from happening because those
terrorists will not be allowed to enter
the airports the detection rate is
incredibly high and there's no human
police who can know all the names so
that's one application
another application you probably saw
Jack Ma at in Germany like four years
three years ago demonstrating to premier
Merkel with the face recognition
technology like if you use the Ali page
the football sometimes it would not
trust you think hmm this is a new phone
are you sure you are who say who you say
you are it will ask you well show me
your face
front side open your mouth just to
prevent you printing of large photo of
someone who hasn't holding it like that
right so it will make a dynamic capture
of your face and determine if you are in
fact who you say you are and if you are
it will let your banking transaction go
through if not then no this is much more
advanced than credit cards you know my
American credit cards are terrible
because somebody's always in Minneapolis
using $30 this paper next day and every
time I call in they send me a new car
that have no card for a month is
horrible not this technology is much
better and also in fact AI can make much
stronger predictions about fraudulent
use as well but this face recognition
can be used this technology is used by
90% of FinTech companies for similar
transactions like that it's used in
security applications and this is a very
fast-growing company that's well beyond
the peoples capability in recognizing
faces its core team is a bunch of gold
medalists engineers from Chinua
University and then this chief scientist
was the one who actually broke through
you remember seeing a few slides ago
where the image object recognition broke
through the human result that was
Professor Dr Spungen who actually did
the work and he's their chief scientist
so this is a billion-dollar company that
we've invested in and it's creating
value increasing security and making
economic sense in our daily lives
another example is smart fineness they
build an app called um bomb and this
product is a simple app you can down
you one click and you download it
another click you want a thousand yen
it's here yet
ok a thousand MMB and within eight
seconds usually a lot faster it will
send the money right to your phone so
that's how easy loan has become and of
course you have to enter your name
address and ID number and it will use
that information plus any other
information on your phone that you agree
to send it up like your contacts your
apps list of apps similar to the way
Facebook takes up things from your phone
and it uses all that data into deep
learning network and determines should I
lend you the money or not
and it has an a main it has a default
rate which I cannot disclose publicly
but it is much lower than people can
achieve even if people spend hours on
each case and as you know it doesn't
make economic sense for a thousand yen
loan it doesn't make sense to have any
human work on it if the human spends an
hour you've already lost money because
your interest rate is not as much as the
labor cost so the AI does the complete
approval process and it replaces the
human completely and this company is
going to underwrite about thirty million
loans this year so if you think about
the thirty million loans that's probably
more than all the Hong Kong banks can do
together probably larger than almost any
other bank in the world and and when
this starts going beyond small loans
payday loans when it goes into a regular
person alone small business loans larger
loss industrial loans this will replace
pretty much all the loan officers in in
the in the world we have just invested
another similar company that is doing
customer service rapid replacement and
if you look at a highly recommend if you
guys are interested in my talk I would
highly recommend a study in 2013 by
Oxford University that studies the rate
in which people jobs will be replaced by
AI and they list telemarketing as the
very very top and the good news is and
we're all sick and tired of the phone
calls that bug us to sell stuff the good
news there is there will be no more
humans calling you the bad news the bad
news is the robots will be calling
with much higher accuracy we have a
company replacing the telemarketing and
customer service we have another company
doing much improved telesales
prospecting so that the conversion rate
can go up 60 70 % so in all these
examples you can imagine when you
replace a thousand customer service reps
how much money are you saving for the
company when you increase the conversion
rate by sixty percent for a bank
how much more revenue you're generating
so all this is Right direct to the
bottom line and then there are other
applications IBM Watson is working on
medical applications they're matching
human capabilities in terms of cancer
detection certain types of cancer there
are also new publications in Nature and
Science starting to show that four
different types of cancer skin cancer
melanoma machines are doing better than
some of the best of the doctors this is
not a full medical diagnosis but
specific types of recognition there
patterns that can at least be a strongly
assistant to them to the human doctor
professor chair mentioned about Donald
Trump's impact to the world but we might
want to trace back and see what God had
elected there are many factors but one
of which is actually an AI program
there's a company called Cambridge
analytical and again you can google this
and find it on the Internet this company
does targeted political campaigns very
powerful targeted political campaigns
take an example if you're a Facebook
user and your clicks are recorded by
this company and if if the political
campaign wants you to be pro-gun okay
this is the second Amendment rights in
the US if you are a paranoid careful
introverted let's say let's say lady
with no intent on sexual discrimination
just say that's your profile okay that
profile will cause it to show a
instantaneously created YouTube video
that shows a mask terrible person
breaking a window and then showing a gun
on the bed up next to the bed and out
comes the words
Second Amendment and gun your last
protection okay
vote vote a second amendment vote for
Trump and if you were a let's say an
extroverted highly confident outgoing
man let's say the ad that you will see
is the during the American Revolution
these Americans carrying guns to the to
the bath of the British and then with
all the you know patriotic music behind
it and out comes the words the write
that your forefathers fought with their
lives do you want to give it up you know
both Second Amendment both Donald Trump
so that is the targeted advertising
that's using AI to deliver this
capability much more on Cambridge
analytical online obviously a is a
weapon that can be used for different
political campaigns and different banks
and so on but in this particular case
one could argue many people might not
like the way in which is used but this
is going to be the political camping of
the future it's going to be fought on
the Internet using targeted campaigns so
it's really impacting all parts of our
lives so is AI all capable let me be
very clear that AI is very very very
narrow okay despite all the great
examples I gave you AI works under five
conditions only today you have to have a
huge amount of data in you have to pick
a singular domain it cannot work cross
domain it's one domain lots of data lots
of data objectively tagged and then huge
amount of supercomputing power and with
top scientists who can tweak the
algorithms it then and only then will
you get any of the applications I
mentioned above from Cambridge
analytical to IBM Watson to May 2 2008
Hotel all of them satisfy these five
conditions when you go beyond that AI
just doesn't work and over time each of
these constraints might be loosened but
today they're all required otherwise AI
doesn't work and then the biggest
confusion on the right side is I think
today the tube the two biggest mistakes
about AI one is that
always very far is very complex it
doesn't affect us hopefully I've already
dispelled that false belief the second
false belief is AI science fiction is so
scary it's going to come in my kids are
going to fall in love with robots and
you know robots will be malicious and
control humans they have self-awareness
and we're going to become their slaves
or that's also completely fallacious
there's no no possibility for that to
happen in the next 20 years can it
happen in thousand years well who knows
anything could happen a thousand years
but it is not there's absolutely no sign
that any of the achievements under our
belts of AI can be extrapolated to such
outrageous capabilities it's only
because we humans exist for our
self-awareness and with all our desires
that science fiction writers project
those desires onto robots and machines
but it is just not true the computer
algorithms the AIS that we use today has
absolutely no desire to preserve their
lives they don't have any self-awareness
there's absolutely no emotion when
alphago beats
aku Gaea it feels no joy doesn't want to
hug in Okocha is you know crying we're
all sympathize with him but alphago is
not gloating or laughing or smiling or
happy and doesn't want to hug anybody
and and then when it's done Google shut
it down it's done right so AI is just a
tool for human use for the foreseeable
future so let's just focus on that and
not not be misled by the many science
fiction that's not gone crazy
so can oh I I get better of course AI
will be more diverse it will be not just
deep learning these are a bunch of tools
that will be available to the scientists
AI will start to work on fewer data and
then that's what a lot of these transfer
learning types of capabilities are
trying to do AI are going to try to
cross domains maybe one domain at a time
ai will become more accessible to
engineers and not just be required
scientists so all these things I think
we'll see but but where I stop and
I will you know even be able to produce
very high quality art for amateurs you
know we see poetry one of our students
just wrote some songs with AI it's all
sounds pretty good too
you know average person but but I think
the highest barrier the where AI will
just not overcome is beyond the tool in
all of these cases is just our tool we
control it we tell it what to optimize
and it has no creativity and no social
capability and no self-awareness so it's
important for those of us who are
concerned about AI to recognize that
there is absolutely no path crossing
these three capabilities despite what
many of the futurists say they are just
wrong okay
and it's not just me if you ask any AI
scientists I was just on a panel with a
Turing Award recipients I was talking to
some of the top five or six AI
scientists they agree with this point of
view so there's no confusion despite
what you know famous futurists and might
say about dangers of a is that AI can be
very dangerous but only in the hands of
the wrong people just like any
technology in the hands of wrong people
but not by itself okay so I mentioned
there are three chapters of AI first
using existing data secondly create more
data and thirdly AI starts to move
around and become robotic and all three
are happening simultaneously but the
first one obviously is mature where
we've we've got so many low hanging
fruits and in my company San ovations
ventures we're just looking for anyone
who's got lots of data and we're saying
can we help you make more money out of
it and then we'll split the profit with
you or can we start the company to help
someone to do that and the biggest area
with the largest amount of data that's
easily accessible is actually financial
so financial data you can imagine stock
market insurance banks they've got lots
of data and it's just ready to make
money for them immediately
health care is another really good one
but a little tougher because there the
data is in silos
okay and then the second category and I
talked about Amazon echo what else is
possible well new retail new health
supply chain new ERP CRM
there's a lot of data there that gets
co-created and then values created
throughout imagine if you will let's say
we open you know 3,000 convenience
stores inside China right not only are
these convenience stores that can sell
you things you know traditional
convenience stores in Hong Kong or us
much more well developed or Taiwan or
Japan much more developed in mainland
China but you just know what merchandise
got moved and it's all blind
other than that but if we had AI
connected to it you will know who with
what profile bought what almost bought
what and didn't buy what when and you've
got the customers profile online offline
fully integrated so imagine the magic
you can do in the background imagine you
can magic and do in the foreground
using face recognition automatic
recognition of objects they took you can
remove the cashiers you can remove the
workers and gradually move towards an
autonomous store so that kind of
capability is somewhere between the
fully robotic future and then the merely
existing data you're creating data
combining data while creating value
that's the second category and the third
category is autonomous robots and
autonomous vehicles and and we have a
very specific roadmap on which this will
develop a lot of people believe you know
the Softbank pepper will come to our
homes I'm a strong disbeliever in that I
think humanoid AI is 15-20 years from
now because there's so many more complex
issues the deep learning is largely a
solved problem can be applied just
waiting to be applied how to move
gracefully like a human on various
terrain is a completely difficult
problem that's going to require
multidisciplinary to solve for many many
years to come so humanoid is going to be
very late and also as our brains got
washed with the science fiction people
have high expectations and compare you
with a human when you build a humanoid
robot plus in the consumer environments
people don't want to pay for any money
don't want to pay very high prices and
all these devices and sensors are not
mature so I am very very bearish on the
future of humanoid robots
at home if is ever happens it'll be 15
years maybe 50 years from now who knows
but what I'm very quite bullish about
are uses that produce immediate economic
value is you've got to go back to basics
not from what we see in science fiction
but where can people use this technology
and may can save lots of money most
quickly that's what will drive all
businesses so where will autonomous
things move first first in the high-end
industrial factories to the replacement
for inspection for high precision for
sensing the screw got put in correctly
for assembling things that humans
currently do for inspecting you know for
example take a look at this iPhone all
the when it comes when you get your
iPhone there are no blemishes but in the
manufacturing process there is a certain
percentage of items that got you know
scratched or hurt or or that it's all
currently largely visually inspected by
humans that can all be replaced you know
so that's that's going to be the first
fastest to happen but it's very
expensive so not every manufacturer can
do it immediately it will take time
so that area we're polish about
commercial robots maybe you know
security and things like that
home robots know maybe some you know
Amazon echo Amazon echo with the screen
our investments shall use that yeah
those kinds of things that are
nonhumanoid performing a function don't
require user education don't look like a
human no eyes no years no hands no feet
okay maybe and then but that these are
all small potatoes that really big one
that we all know about is autonomous
vehicles and autonomous vehicles will
completely turn around a lot of things
in this society and to give you an
example you know we are seeing three big
revolution happening at the same time
first one is the electrification of
vehicles second is the shared economy
uber DD and that the third is autonomous
driving adding value in faces so when
all these things happen three things
happen and it will be in the ten to
fifteen year time horizon the change to
this society is
dramatic it is not at all that you buy
your new Tesla there's a button when
you're tired you push it it is like
cruise control this is autonomous
control that's not the benefit of
autonomous vehicle autonomous vehicle
comes in when the entire traffic
ecosystem when the all the
transportation becomes human las' when
the driving becomes safer than people
there's no no pollution there's no
traffic jam your car comes to you just
in time when you need it the car knows
your schedule and the dhih dhih uber is
out there waiting for you the car is
built to your size so when you are
traveling on business alone it one
person is one seater will come the roads
will become you know multi lanes three
lanes will become six lanes so
congestion will be gone
they'll all be electrical and battery
power will get better even if battery
power doesn't get better it doesn't
matter because when the car is nearly
out of battery it will go find a place
to charge itself up right and the cars
will be dramatically safer because cars
will talk to each other right one car
will tell another I have a flat tire
stay away from me right and also
economics will be injected for a
professor Chen can you know say I'm late
to a meeting I'm gonna I why don't you
get me to work in five minutes and then
the car will tell all the cars around
the car professor change in a hurry I'll
give you I'll give you three cents for
getting out of my way
no ten cents then the cars will
negotiate right so all this IOT stuff
will really really take off in in in
this in the space and the safety rate
will go up dramatically a lot of people
debate the issues like the trolley
problem some of you may have heard of
that that is the moral issue of an
autonomous vehicle facing the choice of
killing you know two adults versus one
child which is worse a purely academic I
think we don't I mean yes people can
debate it but the important thing is
just to move on
get the product launched we are
responsible that the product launched
shouldn't be worse than humans in
Brittany beginning should be better than
humans but we're sure that once the
product is launched in five years it I
mean let's say the safety rates I think
in a hundred million miles is fatalities
like three four humans I don't think
it's responsible to launch the product
with the fatality rate higher than three
initially but I can guarantee you that
in five years three will go down to one
and then one will go down to zero point
three and human lives and safety will be
dramatically improved because AI learns
with data not only the saying I not get
drunk not get sleepy not get angry they
also learn and get better with time we
as dry human drivers our skills plateau
after maybe three years of experience AI
keeps getting better so so this will
dramatically change society and also
think about the economic benefits right
Uber's costs three-quarters of uber
costs are with the driver one-third with
the passenger so what so that's why Ober
is losing so much money and but imagine
when two-thirds cost has gone they will
go from wildly at a loss to wildly
profitable so imagine the incentive
that's pushing our bure a DD and a Tesla
forward and that will drive progress and
also imagine local governments that will
enable this to happen one one mistaken
belief is that the technology will get
gradually better that first this
computer human drives eighty percent
machine drives twenty percent then the
human number goes down the machine goes
up that's not going to happen
Google did an experiment of giving a
bunch of pretty good l-3 level cars to
employees and say take it home for a
spin but this is not autonomous keep
your hands on the steering wheel all the
time watch the road when it makes a
mistake override and then it keeps
cameras in the car and then when all the
Google employees return the car to
Google weeks later it looked at the
video and found that most Google
employees climbing in the backseat had a
drink you know read newspapers and made
out with their girlfriends so
so this is a simple lesson that we
learned that we as humans are not to be
trusted to be collaboratively driving
with the Machine either the human drives
or the machine drives there's a hard
line so today you know they can be
assistive assistive wake us up when we
fall asleep you know help us drive on
the highway only parking only when you
have a very clear line but you cannot
have collaborative driving it's just not
a realistic option so you have to go
directly to autonomous that is our
belief and our investment thesis is
based on that so how can we go
autonomous directly well there are lots
of ways you can do that if it's hard
with passengers then do it with trucks
it was hard in local roads do it on
highways and if it's hard on public
roads do it in parking lots and private
roads and tourist scenes and that those
are the ways in which cars will get some
practice without getting into legal
moral insurance issues and then get
practiced get data get better and
eventually hit the road so we're very
optimistic we also believe that
autonomous vehicles will form a huge
engine of growth that will make sense
ourselves cheaper more capable and those
will then be taken in to our eventual
home humanoid robots and the like
because you know robots just like cars
have to see your move and what you learn
on the road can be transferred back to
the robotic in area so probably the if
you think about the engine or the
platform that drove AI you know search
was a big one finance will be a big one
but autonomous vehicle will be a really
big one and it will come back to drive
robotics so that's our projection about
the future so this has huge implications
to the economy and maybe we can save
some of this for the discussions later
so I will just point out the questions
and that we can answer the ones you're
most interested in I'll bring a couple
of issues one is many people displaced
out of jobs what happened how do we how
do we help them find new jobs to what
human skills remain useful three how do
we change our education system so the
kids are not immediately displaced when
they're out of school and four how
how do we socially provide for the
people who are displaced and and how do
we prevent the rich getting richer poor
getting poorer problems in the society
so these are and then you know some
there are some hand-wavy answers you
know let's tax people let's tax the rich
more is that so easy to do which
government will do that first okay
universal basic income you know give
everybody 15 hundred US dollars per
month well that's three trillion dollars
for the US right and fifteen trillion
for China can we really afford it where
does the money come from and when you
give it money to the people well they
really automatically find what they want
and if they don't what the society do
and if the rich gets richer poorer gets
poorer and ninety percent of the people
are ultimately out of jobs how do we
prevent a socially a unstable situation
right why would people not go to the
streets and then what happens about
addiction right if people are out of
jobs yet they're provided for somehow
why will they not play games all day
right wrongs are Romeo you know and you
know and then VR you know they can live
in a parallel universe and and and let
and and have fun but but then but then
will human race perish as a result so I
think the only way human race will
perish is either through some human evil
using technology or through human
wide-scale giving up right we all get
addicted to games and then we stop to
evolve so these are the questions we'll
save for maybe later discussion in terms
of which jobs get replaced this is a map
that I wrote it's mostly based on the
Oxford study I think three to five years
repetitive work five to ten years
standard work ten to fifteen years some
tougher jobs not just blue collar not
just drivers repairman maintenance but
also radiologists I think radiologists
will be other jobs in in about ten to
fifteen years and that's a strong signal
to those of you who are thinking about
medical school and or with children I
was talking to the Harvard Dana Farber
had obtained a Farber and we well we
disagree on the how fast a I will take
over we absolutely agree that
if you're going enter a medical school
please consider doing research because
that's something that machine AI cannot
do you know machines will be able to
diagnose and and of all the diagnoses
reading x-rays and and the CT and MRI
will be relatively easy for computers
because imagine if the computer can
recognize from three million faces
better than humans why can it not
recognize cancer better than humans
right we humans through our revolution
we're trained to recognize faces that's
how we don't get lost from our parents
right and we lost that's an that skill
how can we win on recognizing cancer so
radiologists would be one of the
categories I think dermatologists would
be another very dangerous category
psychiatrists on the other hand will be
a booming business because many people
who are confused and and and lost by
this AI will be seeking psychiatric help
and AI will be no good at that so anyway
there will be job gains and job losses
and then what jobs are safe well
obviously if AI cannot cross domain if
you're cross domain you're safe yeah AI
cannot create AI just optimize it so if
you're a creator you're okay
what types of creation there can be
scientific creation engineering creation
artistic creation there can be
storytelling right PR marketing
novelists poets you're all safe but you
have to be really good because AI
starting to write poetry as you know so
if you're a you know sophomore level
poet then you know no you the machines
will beat you but if you're a you know
Robert Frost level poet then then you're
then you'll be safe okay and then some
jobs will change an interesting example
I give is the doctors right sounds like
I'm being quite negative on doctors who
do diagnosis but actually I'm not
because it will become a great model of
human-machine collaboration machines
will get better and better in diagnosis
initially the doctor will consult it
just in case the machines right later a
doctor will primarily rely on the
machine and occasionally override it and
eventually the doctor will just defer to
the Machine completely I don't know if
this is over a 10 20 30 or 40 years but
eventually that will happen but the
human role is very important because the
human and
engagement empathy listening to the
patient and giving the patient the
assurance I think is really really
important and just listening is
important because I mean times have you
been to a doctor when you start the
saying okay I got the following 10
symptoms by the time you're done with
the second one doctors off ok enough
this is your prescription take it this
is enough this happened to me once I got
shingles right I walked in and then the
doctor says ok shingles I said wait let
me tell you about my my headache
just I can tell from the way your you
know scars are forming I don't need to
talk to you anymore
but I didn't feel very good so the
doctor would just you know take another
10 minutes and listen to my symptoms I
would feel that that diagnosis is more
accurate even though it's the same right
and then when I feel better i cure more
I'm more likely to get cured
isn't that right because of you know
about placebo effect so you know the
doctors are just so scarce they're not
spending enough time listening to
patients
imagine if the doctor says well visit
you at home next week to make sure
you're single is better right that's
that's great
and also the doctor can package can can
be a great storyteller right so imagine
if I went to my you all know I had
cancer a couple years ago so imagine if
I went to an AI doctor says what color
you have for liquid you have follicular
lymphoma stage 4 and likelihood a 5-year
survival is 26% well I would be
devastated if they gave me right but my
you know imagine the doctors as well you
know you got some tough problem but you
know ky Fuli had the same problem and
five years later he's healthy again so
if you follow the same you know
chemotherapy and target therapy you have
a good shot too well now that now the
patient's recovery rate must be higher
because of placebo effect so that's how
a I and a s evolution will create many
more doctors than today maybe slightly
lower paid but larger in number able to
reach out to poorer provinces in China
able to reach out to Africa everyone who
wants to consult the doctor there can be
one sometimes is purely AI sometimes
it's AI with remote medicine and I think
humankind will be better for it and
employing
will not go down but go up as a result
and then in terms of education actually
the fundamental principles have not
changed this is how I raise my kids this
is how I believe education should be if
we believe the world will be end up with
two types of primary jobs with the AIS
success 10% or some some small number of
creative jobs larger number of socially
oriented jobs well what should we do or
we should provide an education where it
kids find an area in which they can be
creative go after their passion work
very hard and not their challenge not
just by their competitive humans but
also by AI
they have to work really hard at 10,000
hour rule applies and and then at the
same time you got to be ready in case um
you're in the 90 percent which is okay
too but then you have to have balanced
social communication skills empathy
talking to people caring for people and
and that's also how we will get a sense
of satisfaction right imagine the 10% of
people are generating lots of value for
society and making lots of money and
then the 90% the reality is the 90%
might have a net aggregate negative
contribution to the economics in the
world that's just the reality it's very
different from the rise of China right
China rose up in to some extent India
rose up because of the population
dividend there's a lot of people were
paid less
so we manufacture each one asked to the
come to the country's gross domestic
product but so so you could say the
country's value is the population size
times the value of each person not
roughly speaking but in the future we're
going to enter an age of 10% creative
people who have a huge multiplier and
90% of the people who have a much
smaller multiplier that's possibly a
negative multiplier so the question for
a country and education is how do we get
more than 10% and how do we get a 10% to
add the most value and second is how do
we make sure the 90 percent are able to
look forward to a life of self
actualization contributions to society
and I think the best way is
they can find some profession that
appeals to their heart they feel like
they'd help people and their love and
emotion and connection and empathy have
contributed to the society and makes
them feel good at night even though
economically there might not be the best
contributors to the economy so I think
that's an important aspect when we think
about the future of Education so to
conclude I think why started out in AI
in 30-some years ago I thought we're
going to figure out how humans think and
maybe connect computers to humans but I
realize now is what we've accomplished
is actually a bunch of narrow AI
algorithms that are optimizers for
singular domains so it's very limited
and not at all touching how we think
nevertheless those singular optimizers
can be applied to take over a lot of
what humans do and really make several
huge contributions to society one is it
might create so much economic value that
we eradicate poverty secondly it will
free us from the repetitive work that we
currently do and let machines take care
of that okay and lastly it might get us
to really think what why do we exist on
this earth I think it is to create and
to love and those are the two things for
the ten and a 90% so that really it's
not figuring how our brains work but how
our hearts work thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
