humans are rarely satisfied with what
they already have humans are always on
the lookout for something better
bigger tastier Yuval Harare is a
celebrated thing his book sapiens about
the history of our species was an
international sensation it was
translated into 30 languages including
English which allowed me to talk to him
here at ideas
now he's back with another big picture
book and in it he looks towards the
future of humanity
when humankind possesses enormous new
powers and when the threat of famine
plague is in War is finally lifted what
will we do with ourselves
what will the scientists investors
bankers and presidents do all day write
poetry if we're actually on the verge of
eliminating famine plagues and war as
you've all her re says we are then where
does that leave us
humanity's next targets are likely to be
immortality happiness and divinity
having reduced mortality from starvation
disease and violence we will now aim to
overcome old age and even death itself
and having raised humanity above the
beastly level of survival struggles we
will now aim to upgrade humans into gods
and turn Homo sapiens into homo Deus
homo Deus is the title of Yuval Harari
his latest book he joined me in our
Toronto studio to talk about the future
as he sees it a future where humans
become like gods let me tell you it was
a mind-bending experience evil famine
plague and war still very much with us
what gives you the idea that they're
going away what we still have definitely
famine plague and war around but far
less than in any previous time in
history today for the first time in
history more people die from
eating too much than from eating too
little more people die from old age than
infectious diseases and more people die
from killing themselves from suicide
than from war and crime and terrorism
put together and he look at famine
especially which was the biggest threat
to human life for thousands of years
today actually there is no longer any
natural famine in the world there is
only political famine if people still
starve to death in places like Syria or
North Korea or Somalia it's not because
of an objective lack of food it is
because some politician or government or
ideology wants them to starve to death
and I think that given the progress
we've accomplished so far it's not
certain but it's likely that in the 21st
century we'll be able to bring them
under our control okay well moving from
famine to plague we might not have the
Black Death anymore but we have AIDS we
have malaria there's cancer there's new
diseases I mean I didn't know bird flu
and and Zika I mean there's various
viruses that are new is disease
disappearing it seems like it's coming
this is changing I mean for most of
history the main threat was infectious
diseases and epidemics which killed up
to a third or half of all children
before they reached adulthood and which
every every few decades you had
something like the Black Death coming
and killing maybe a quarter or a third
of the entire population in the last few
decades the advances in medicine have
managed to bring down a mortality of
children for infectious diseases to the
lowest level ever and managed not to
completely stop all epidemics but to
avoid a repeat of the black death or of
their Spanish influenza for example when
you heard the Ebola epidemic in West
Africa initially experts feared that
this is the beginning of the new black
death
but within about three months they
managed to bring Ebola under control and
in the end a bola killed 10,000 people
which is a terrible thing but it's a
completely different story than the
Black Death which killed something like
40 or 50 million people okay no that's
feminine and plague war you come from
Israel how can you say that war is going
away yes I mean again you just look at
the statistics first of all for much of
history maybe about 10 percent of human
mortality was because of you and
violence today all over the world
globally it's about just one percent or
maybe a little more than one percent
especially if you look at places like
Canada statistically the chances of the
average Canadian being killed by let's
say al-qaeda or Isis is about a thousand
times less than the chances of dying
from eating too much at McDonald's
McDonald is a thousand times more
dangerous to the health of our audience
than the Islamic state but you don't you
don't hear it in the news because it
doesn't make news and even more
importantly previously in history we had
periods of peace but peace always was a
temporary situation the meaning of peace
was the temporary absence of war
everybody knew that let's say if in the
Middle Ages you had peace between the
king of England and the king of France
something might happen that within one
year they will go to war against one
another so peace was just the temporary
absence of war today in most of the
world peace has a completely new meaning
peace means the employees ability of war
it's simply unthinkable that Britain and
France will go to war
next year and this is true not only in
Western Europe this is true in most of
the world there are exceptions of course
like the Middle East but in most of the
world if you think for example about
South America you have to be really
crazy to think that next year there
might be a big war between Brazil and
Argentina there might be
little border incident but an
old-fashioned war with Brazilian armored
division's trying to conquer Buenos
Aires and Argentinian airplanes bombing
entire cities in Brazil this is
extremely unlikely to happen they just
don't think along these lines anymore
okay well then if you dismiss with
famine and with with plague and with war
what you've done is you've replaced him
with three other abstract nouns
immortality bliss and divinity that's a
pretty big order yes now why have you
chosen those three well this is my
educated guess of where Humanity is
headed what are the next big projects of
humankind and you already see it
happening in Silicon Valley maybe the
hottest word today is immortality
equality may be out but immortality is
very much in Google just established
two-three years ago a sub company called
calico whose stated aim is to overcome
death they say we've solved search so
now we'll try to solve death and they
are the only ones you have people like
Peter Thiel who are also saying
explicitly that what they want to do is
to overcome all the age and death and
similarly if you think about bliss and
even divinity when I say that humans
will try to upgrade themselves into gods
in the 21st century this is not meant as
a metaphor I mean it literally if you
think about the old gods of the
traditional mythologies like the Hebrew
God they have certain qualities not just
immortality but maybe above all the
ability to create life to design life in
the book of Genesis the first thing God
does is to create animals and plants and
humans according to his wishes now we
are in the process of acquiring these
divine abilities we want to learn how to
engineer and produce life and it's very
likely that in the 21st century the main
products of the economy will no longer
be textiles and vehicles and weapons
they will be bodies and brains and
lines and I'll say another thing that we
are actually trying to go beyond any of
the traditional gods because even if you
believe the creationists that say that
all life has been created by God then
the only thing God managed to create in
four billion years of life on earth is
organic beings all the beings that
existed on this planet for four billion
years whether amoebas or dinosaurs or
giraffes or Homo sapiens they were
organic creatures made of organic stuff
and now we are in the process of
creating the first into organic entities
of the four billion years of evolution
it's very likely that within the
lifetime of at least some of our
listeners we will manage to create the
first inorganic artificial intelligence
entities it sounds like you're not
saying that we're going to be like gods
we're gonna be super gods
we're gonna be gods to create gods
almost in a way yes I mean again if you
think about ancient mythology you read
the Bible the main thing that biblical
Judaism was concerned with is
agricultural output the main thing the
ancient Hebrews expected from their God
was to provide rain so you'll be able to
water your fields and to provide
fertility and to provide protection
against all kinds of locusts and
diseases and things like that and today
modern science is already doing much
better than the Hebrew God I mean with
all the insecticides and antibiotics and
and genetic crops and things like that
already today what the Hebrews expected
from their gods our scientists are doing
better if you think religious fanatics
with burning eyes and flowing beards are
ruthless just wait and see what elderly
retail moguls and aging Hollywood
starlets will do when they think the
elixir of life is within reach even when
science make significant progress in the
war against death the real battle will
shift from the laboratories to the
parliaments courthouses and streets
once the scientific efforts are crowned
with success they will trigger bitter
political conflicts all the wars and
conflicts of history might turn out to
be but at pl prelude for the real
struggle ahead of us
the struggle for eternal youth eternal
youth I want to focus on where you see
that actually happening I mean isn't it
already underway aren't people who go to
the spa and who buy creams aren't they
looking for eternally everybody all not
everybody but most people definitely in
in modern Western societies are obsessed
with with youth and with eternal youth I
mean until now people knew that there
was a limit to what you can do with
going to the gym and buying creams and
things like that but just from an
economic perspective think what an
immense market the market for eternal
youth is going to be most likely in the
21st century the biggest market of all
will be the market for eternal youth
with you personally want to be young
forever to live forever as a young
person that's a good question I mean a
lot of people when they talk about
immortality they have a distorted vision
of what it means that like you take a
pill and you live to be a million and
this is not what the people in Silicon
Valley are talking about like records
file or Peter Thiel but they have in
mind is something far more down-to-earth
that they will come to you and ask you
do you want to live another ten years in
good health the vast majority of people
will say yes I want another ten years in
good health and then when these ten
years are over they'll come again and
say okay do you want another ten years
into renewable country and this is what
we're talking about it's not a one time
pill that makes you live to be a million
nobody understands what what it means to
live to be a million nobody really wants
such a thing but to extend your life a
decade in another decade in another
decade in good health this is something
that I think almost everybody would like
to do everybody would like it but who
will be able to afford
I mean the way I know that Silicon
Valley works the prices go very high
will it be only for the the 1% who
couldn't actually pay hundreds of
thousands of dollars for a pill that
might give them ten more years of life
healthy life that's the big question
at present it seems likely that it will
not be available for everybody and that
biotechnology will for the first time in
history translate economic inequality
into biological inequality throughout
history
you always had inequality but it was
always social and economic and political
it wasn't biological there wasn't any
real difference in physical or mental
abilities between the king and the
peasant but in 50 years or a hundred
years it might be possible for the first
time to translate economic inequality
into biological inequality and humankind
will basically split into different
biological castes the rich will enjoy
physical and mental abilities which will
really be superior to the poor and once
such a gap opens it becomes almost
impossible to close it because the poor
will no longer be able to compete with
the rich this is a frightening brave new
world and you're talking about a
possible existence for most of humanity
that will be so far below that of the
upper echelons that they won't even
recognize all to them it should be
emphasized that this is not a prophecy
it's just a possibility I mean
everything that the book Howe Medeiros
describes there are not prophecies they
are just mapping different possibilities
and if you don't like some of the
possibilities you can still do something
about it I don't think that technology
is deterministic with the same
technology you can create completely
different social systems if you look
back then you see that with the
technology of the Industrial Revolution
trains and electricity and oil and radio
you could create a communist
dictatorship a fascist regime of a
liberal democracy the trains and the
radio did not really
tell you what to do with them so it's
the same with the technologies of the
21st century if we just leave it to
market forces then I'm afraid that yes
market forces will drive these
technologies in the direction of the
kind of brave new world with
biologically different costs but we
don't have to to allow market forces to
make the important decisions for us
there is still some political options to
take these developments in a different
direction yeah I think that's an
important thing in yeah you said it's
not necessarily a prediction of what
will happen it might actually be a call
to arms and I want to get to do talk
about that later first I want to push
you back on something I asked you
earlier okay I asked if you wanted to be
to live forever as a young person you
said it was an interesting question you
didn't answer the question do you want
well personally I definitely don't want
to die in the next 10 years and I
definitely don't want to age very much
if I can keep my physical and mental
faculties as they are then yes I'm a
good customer for these kinds of
developments I think it will be
dishonest to pretend to be anything else
I mean to get another 10 years of good
health yes sure many scholars try to
predict how the world will look in 2100
this is a waste of time any worthwhile
prediction must take into account the
ability to re-engineer human minds and
this is impossible
the many wise answers to the question
what would people with minds like ours
do with biotechnology all we can say is
that people similar to us are likely to
use biotechnology to re-engineer their
own minds and our present-day Minds
cannot grasp what might happen next
computers are very much at the center of
much of what you're talking about and
then some people have used the word
transhuman to describe where we're going
a point at which there's some sort of
convergence between computer
intelligence and human intelligence
I think Ray Kurzweil who you mentioned
uses the word synchronicity that the two
will become similar and in fact at some
point the Ameri TAS and I'm wondering
how far do you see is going down that
road I think that artificial
intelligence AI is now outperforming
humans in more and more tasks and
therefore may even push humans out of
job market and will create an immense
new class the useless class people who
can't do anything better than an AI
better than computers so they don't have
any jobs in any political power but
liquid looking even further to the
future I think the big danger is that
intelligence will simply decouple from
consciousness a lot of people confuse
intelligence with consciousness because
in humans and in all mammals
intelligence and consciousness go
together intelligence basically is the
ability to solve problems consciousness
is the ability to feel things to have
subjective experiences to feel pain or
joy or love or hate or anger or whatever
you know we think of one of those being
a sort of human territory and one of
them being a computer or machine
Territory what do you mean by decoupling
what an example of them separate but for
millions of years of evolution in
mammals and humans intelligence and
consciousness went together because the
way mammals solved problem is to a large
extent by relying on their feelings on
their sensations and on their emotions
and because they go together people
often have the idea that they must go
together and in
many science-fiction movies when
computers become super intelligent they
automatically also become conscious and
they start having emotions and desires
and all that now this is definitely not
what is happening now computers are not
becoming conscious they are becoming
highly intelligent over the last sixty
or seventy years there has been a
tremendous progress in computer
intelligence but exactly zero progress
in computer consciousness computers in
the 1940s had no consciousness no
feelings and computers today have no
consciousness and no feelings if we look
to the future
this trend may continue and we may see
the emergence of a super intelligence
which is completely devoid of
consciousness and this super
intelligence might make all the humans
powerless and redundant and may even
break out of planet Earth because
organic beings have been limited to this
planet for four billion years because
it's very difficult to sustain organic
life in outer space or other planets but
a non organic artificial intelligence
will find it much easier to survive
space travel and to colonize other
planets so what we may see is not just
on earth but in the entire galaxy the
spread of this in varying high
intelligence but devoid of consciousness
and this is a very scary scenario
imagine not just earth but the galaxy
full of intelligence and devoid of
consciousness devoid of feelings and
emotions so in in some real sense
natural selection which Darwin talked
about which we've always thought was the
way things we're gonna move along it's
gonna be replaced with market selection
human beings are gonna both be supplying
what they want to sell and buying it as
well yeah I mean the problem is that
from the viewpoint of the market
consciousness has no value at all but
intelligence is what the market really
values if you think about something like
a taxi driver so up till now all tuxedo
driver's head consciousness they had
feelings they had emotions
why not because we need emotions from
taxi drivers but simply because the only
thing intelligent enough to drive a taxi
was human being which came along in in
this package you also got consciousness
and emotions but within a very short
time most experts today estimated within
five or ten years a I will drive cars
better than any human being not only
more cheaply but far more safely today
every year about 1.3 million people die
each year from car accidents that's
twice the number of people who die from
war and crime and terrorism put together
and almost all these car accidents are
caused by human error and if you replace
humans with with algorithms with AI you
solve most of these errors and AI a
self-driving car will never drink
alcohol and drive it will never fall
asleep while while driving it will never
disobey traffic signals or a stop sign
so it's very likely that we will see
because what what we need is the
intelligence not the consciousness we
will see that human drivers are being
replaced by these computers by these AI
and the world will be a better place
even from an economic perspectives
definitely yes economic but again the
big question is do we want a situation
in which eventually everything is super
intelligent but without consciousness
without emotions without feelings and
this is I think a very deep
philosophical question and actually if
the speaking of philosophy a lot of
philosophical questions that for
thousands of years were just theoretical
riddles for philosophers to pass time
may become practical questions in
everyday life that engineers need to
think about again going back to these
driverless cars let's say that you have
a car that the car is driving any
about to collide to run over five people
and the only way to save these five
people is to swerve to the side fall off
a cliff and kill the driver what should
you do this is the kinds of questions
that philosophers have been arguing
about for thousands of years and it had
very little practical impact because no
matter what you said in theory that you
will do when you are actually in the
situation you did something different
but now when you have a driverless car
you need to program the algorithm to
drive the car with the answer to these
ethical questions if a driverless car
sees it it's about to run over five
pedestrians and it can swerve to the
side fall off a cliff and kill its owner
what should we do the engineers at
Google they need to program the code so
they need to answer this philosophical
question and the amazing thing is
whatever answer they give it will
actually be implemented now of course
because we live in a market economy
maybe they will say let's just leave it
to market forces to the customers will
produce two cars they Toyota all traced
and the Toyota AG waste the Toyota
authorized if you buy it when in this
situation it will kill you and save the
five people the Toyota AYGO East will
save you and kill the other five people
and customers will just decide which car
they want to buy and you know the
customer is always white
that's beautiful you're listening to
ideas on CBC Radio One Sirius XM and
cbc.ca / ideas we're talking with
acclaimed historian Yuval Harari about
his book homo Deus the title of course
translates as man God because that's
what he believes is happening to our
species
we're collectively in the process of
becoming like gods something our
ancestors can only imagine in myths and
legends
it's this kind of original intellectual
portraiture that is one you've all her
re a raft of international awards you
can see them on our website cbc.ca slash
ideas in a short video improvising on
terms and ideas we just kind of threw
Adam for fun here is now ruminating on a
crucial term he writes about in his book
modernity modernity is a deal all of us
sign up to this deal on the day we are
born and it regulates our lives until
the day we die very few of us can ever
assigned or transcend this deal it
shapes our food our jobs and our dreams
and it decides well we dwell whom we
love and how we pass away at first sight
modernity looks like an extremely
complicated deal it's like when you
download some software and are asked to
sign an accompanying contract which is
dozens of pages of legalese you take one
look at it immediately scroll down to
the last page tick I agree and forget
about it it in fact modernity is a
surprisingly simple deal the entire
contract can be summarized in a single
phrase humans agree to give up meaning
in exchange for power exchanging meaning
for power how does that in your mind
define the modern era that we live in
but in pre-modern times people believe
that they are part of some cosmic drama
some cosmic plane they have a part to
play they don't have much power I mean
they must do whatever God decides that
they will this is your part in creation
this is your part in the universe so you
can you don't have the power to change
your role but in exchange you got
meaning your life really meant something
you're playing maybe a small part but
you're still playing a part in this
cosmic drama and whatever I said
whatever I did it it meant something
from a cosmic perspective now in the
modern world we no longer believe in
this cosmic drama there is no drama
there is
no director there is no screenplay
nothing which means on the one hand that
everything we do has absolutely no
meaning if planet Earth explodes
tomorrow morning with all the people on
it the universe won't care on the other
hand because there is no great play no
drama so there is no limit on our power
the only limit on our power is our own
knowledge or ignorant if we have the
knowledge then we can completely change
our place in the universe the way we
behave everything it's up to us to give
meaning to the whole universe
and how will you do it by looking inside
yourself connecting to your true self
connecting to your feelings your
emotions your feelings will give meaning
not just to your own life but to the
entire universe this is the basic
message the basic dogma of humanism
which have dominated the world for the
last two or three centuries
the literal meaning of the word
individual is something that cannot be
divided that I am an individual implies
that my truth self is a holistic entity
rather than an assemblage of separate
parts however over the last few decades
the life sciences have reached the
conclusion that this liberal story is
pure mythology the single authentic self
is as real as the eternal Christian soul
Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny if you
look really deep within yourself the
seeming unity that we take for granted
dissolves into a cacophony of
conflicting voices none of which is my
true self humans aren't individuals they
are dividuals
most traditional societies and religions
indeed imagined that the way humans make
decisions is because they have some
spiritual essence called soul or spirit
or whatever and in the end in some kind
of magical way with freewill or whatever
this magical soul makes decisions now
over the last two centuries the life
sciences have been distancing themselves
more and more from this traditional
viewpoint and you can summarize I think
a hundred fifty years of biological
research since Charles Darwin in three
words organisms are algorithms the way
that all organisms whether it's tomatoes
or giraffes or Homo sapiens the way we
make decisions is not because of some
spiritual essence but in an algorithmic
way by biochemical reactions and
calculations in our own body I've never
heard evolution described as an
algorithm before would it make sense
yeah and I can give maybe a simple
example of how it works otherwise it
sounds very complicated let's say that
you're a baboon in the African savanna
and you see not far from you there is a
tree with bananas but also there is a
lion nearby and this is a typical
problem of survival that natural
selection puts before organisms in order
to survive you need to make the right
decision to go for the bananas or not
now this is basically a problem of
calculating probabilities what is the
probability that I will starve to death
if I don't eat the bananas versus the
probability that I will be eaten by the
lion if I try to get the bananas so to
survive and pass my genes on to the next
generation
I need to calculate the probabilities
correctly how does the baboon calculate
probabilities well first I need a lot of
data data about the bananas how far are
the bananas how many bananas are there
big or small ripe or green then any data
about the lion how far
the lion is a big or small is the
awakened or asleep and I need a lot of
information about myself how fast I can
run how hungry I am and things like that
now you need to take all of this data
into account and quickly calculate the
right probabilities how does the baboon
calculate the probabilities not with pen
and paper or a pocket calculator the
entire body and nervous system and brain
of the baboon is the calculator what we
call sensations and emotions out of the
way in which the baboon takes in all the
data makes the calculation and reaches a
conclusion the conclusion of the
calculation will not appear as a number
it will appear as what we call emotion
if the probability is positive you
should go for the bananas then this will
appear as the emotion of courage the
baboon will suddenly feel courageous and
all is easily puffed up and run to the
bananas and if the calculation is
negative then this will appear as the
emotion fear so what we call emotions
are not some spiritual phenomena that
comes from God or whatever it's
biochemical calculations and yet and I I
don't know what I'm reaching for here
but I'm reaching deep inside myself and
that's something people do I mean I you
look for the gut instinct you you you
try to find the honest physical almost
physiological response or not and I'm
still stuck in a world where I wanna
cling to that ik and claim there is a
self other than something that's just
calculating how fast this self can run
to get the banana well most people cling
to it but most biologists say no there
is no self humans and other animals are
just a collection of biochemical
processes that basically calculate
probabilities and for me what brought
this home what brought this revolution
home was a children's movie I saw this
year a very good one by Disney I think
inside out did you see it but you know
for decades
Disney has been selling kids all over
the world this
humanist fantasy that you are an
individual and the right way to make
decisions in life is getting touches
with yourself listen to yourself follow
your heart and everything will be okay
and this new film inside out it tells
about a girl called Riley which moves
from Minnesota to San Francisco and she
has a crisis and then it looks what's
happening inside her head and you find
out and this is what Disney is telling
the kids now this girl Riley is just a
robot inside her head you have all these
amazing biochemical mechanisms it shows
how dreams are being produced and how
emotions are competing with one another
and it's there is no self inside there
is no inner voice that Riley needs to
get in contact with there are just
biochemical mechanisms that produce all
the decisions that Riley makes and this
is Disney okay that's Disney let's make
it you Val is there a you and new Valley
when you wake up every morning in Israel
or women when you're in a world tour
like this you have certain assignments
I'm assuming you go to the bathroom and
you wash up and then if you're at home
you probably go and teach here you get
ready to go and do interviews with the
likes of me and you follow a daily
routine which is which is something that
is repeatable you repeat it and I
ultimately begin I would assume to treat
that as something like oh that's myself
that's what I do that's what I am what
happens is that people construct a story
about themselves and they become
extremely attached to this story they
identify with this story and it
basically controls their life now this
story it's in truth it's an illusion
it's a fantasy but it's still very very
powerful in the same way that entire
human societies are being controlled by
fictional stories about God and heaven
and the nation and all that so also each
individual is actually not an individual
it's a collection of internal entities
that are being controlled by this belief
in a single overarching story which is
in truth fictional now I I do my best to
really understand the reality about
myself so I spend two hours every day
meditating I meditate Vipassana
meditation two hours every day to really
understand go beyond this fictional
story and really look what what am i
what is the body what is the mind how
are they interacting and this is a very
important part of my life and one other
thing that I would like to do to comment
on this is that I'm not saying that what
I just said about there is no self
everything is but just biochemical
calculations this is not necessarily the
truth this is current scientific dogma
there is one thing that this theory so
far fails to explain and it is
consciousness the mind we don't have any
good theory that explains how the brain
produces the mind how come when billions
of neurons in the brain fire electrical
signals one to the other how does this
produce a subjective experience of love
or hate or pain or joy we have
absolutely no idea the scientists are
they have kind of a dogma that somehow
the neurons produce these experiences
and maybe we'll have the good
explanation in 20 years or 50 years but
at present we don't now it doesn't mean
that the old mythological stories of
religions like Christianity about the
soul that they are right because science
can't explain consciousness I don't
think we should go back we should go
forward which is say yes we don't
understand consciousness yet so we need
to keep on researching and to invest far
more time and energy and money in
investigating the mind and not just the
brain and the body
in the early 21st century the train of
progress is again pulling out of the
station and this will probably be the
last train ever to leave the station
called Homo sapiens those who miss this
train will never get a second chance in
order to get a seat on it you need to
understand 21st century technology and
in particular the powers of
biotechnology and computer algorithms
these powers are far more potent than
steam in the Telegraph and they will not
be used memory for the production of
food textiles vehicles and weapons the
main products of the 21st century will
be bodies brains and minds and the gap
between those who know how to engineer
bodies and brains and those who do not
will be far bigger than the gap between
Dickens's Britain and the mahadesh Sudan
indeed it will be bigger than the gap
between sapiens and Neanderthals in the
21st century those who ride the train of
progress will acquire divine abilities
of creation and destruction while those
left behind will face extinction
according to what you say in the book
we're all either going to become gods
like Shiva or yahwah or we're gonna die
will will disappear is it really that
start I think given the current pace of
technological development it's very
unlikely that human beings like you and
me will continue to exist in say 200
years we are one of the last generations
of Homo sapiens given the technological
powers that we will have either we'll
destroy ourselves or we'll upgrade
ourselves into something completely
different now science is coming and
saying we're not there yet but we are
getting closer death is no longer a kind
of metaphysical decree people have to
die because God said so no death is a
technical problem
and every technical problem at least in
principle has a technical solution so we
are now working on the technical
solution and it's the same with
upgrading humans people dreamt about it
for thousands of years all the ancient
mythologies are full of upgraded super
humans but we never had the technology
to actually do it so it was all just
imagination it was all just fantasies
now for the first time we're approaching
the point when technology gives us the
ability to realize our fantasies but up
till now it was mostly the power to
change reality outside to change the
world to change the geography the
economy is a social system but the world
inside inside our bodies inside our
brains this hardly changed at all we
still have the same bodies the same
brains that we had 20,000 years ago in
the next century or two we will direct
our gaze from outside inwards and we'll
start for the first time in history to
really change our bodies and our brains
and not just the economy or society I
was intrigued in the book you seem to
imply in fact suggests that that
fundamentalism religious fundamentalism
is on its way out that it's not
something that will last again it's like
war and plague and pestilence I look
around and I see a lot of people who
still believe in God and I don't see
that trend necessarily yes it's
basically like in the 19th century with
the Industrial Revolution most people
still believed in God not in the steam
engine but what changed the world was
the steam engine not God and it's
happening again now given the tremendous
changes were facing already today in the
world you see a lot of people trying to
cling to some eternal story like God or
like the nation but this is unlikely to
really stop the change in the world
oh to shape the 21st century because
these stories don't offer us answers to
the big problems of the 21st century
the big problems of the 21st century are
things like what to do when you can
start designing babies with
biotechnology what to do when artificial
intelligence is pushing humans out of
the job market and you have this massive
useless class what to do when humankind
is being split into different biological
castes now you don't find answers to any
of these questions in the Bible or in
the Quran because the people who wrote
these books back in ancient times did
not know anything about artificial
intelligence or about genetics so it's
obvious they don't have the answers
there if you you need answers you need
to create new ideologies new religions
and in the same way that in the 19th
century we saw the creation of new
ideologies like socialism and they
really changed the world so I think in
the 21st century will again see the rise
of new ideologies and religions coming
not from the Middle East but from places
like Silicon Valley and they will shape
our world much more than the fanatics of
the Islamic state can you be specific
about what these new religions you talk
about may look like or sound like or be
like yes the most important I think at
least at present is data ISM a religion
or ideology which worships data and not
God and not humans basically what data
is insist is that given enough biometric
data and given enough computing power an
external algorithm can understand me
better than I understand myself and once
we have that an algorithm Authority will
shift away from individual humans to
these algorithms so in the same way that
authority at first was with the gods
above the clouds and then in modern
times Authority shifted below the clouds
to human beings now authority will shift
again back to the clouds but to the
Google cloud to the Microsoft cloud this
is where authority in the 21st century
will
and all the important decisions will not
be made by the Pope or by God they will
not be made by democratic elections and
by individual consumers they will be
made by the algorithms in the cloud
technology man ISM agrees that homo
sapiens as we know it has run its
historical course and will no longer be
relevant in the future but concludes
that we should therefore use technology
in order to create ho models a much
superior human model our models will
retain some essential human features but
will also enjoy upgraded physical and
mental abilities that will enable it to
hold its own even against the most
sophisticated non conscious algorithms
since intelligence is decoupling from
consciousness and since non conscious
intelligence is developing at breakneck
speed humans must actively upgrade their
minds if they want to stay in the game
humanism thought that experiences occur
inside us and that we ought to find
within ourselves the meaning of all that
happens there by infusing the entire
universe with meaning data ist's believe
that experiences are valueless if they
are not sure and that we need not indeed
cannot find meaning within ourselves
when it only be called and connect our
experience to the great data flow and
the algorithms will discover its meaning
and tell us what to do algorithms
telling us what to do may sound like a
half-baked notion straight out of
second-rate science fiction but you Val
Herrera maintains that were already
getting closer to that reality you
actually give a musical example and
that's a computer program that was
created that actually created a piece of
music and it was given to people to
listen to and they listened to it they
thought it was real music created by a
human being what does that tell you
actually maybe you can just do an
exercise of just you know play the bow
and the Emmy music and
ask the the listeners what do you think
was composed by bus and which one was
composed by my computer we can do that
in fact we can we can find the examples
and weigh them this will be amazing
here's the background the musicologist
was David Koch who was at the University
of California he'd invented a computer
program called Emmy which could create
music then somebody challenged this
professor okay let's play the the piece
composed by your computer and let's play
real Bach and we'll see if people will
be able to tell the difference
so here we go can you tell the
difference between a computer-generated
piece of music and another one made by
the real flesh-and-blood Johann
Sebastian Bach here's one piece and now
here's the other
and the amazing thing is that most
listeners thought that the real Bach was
composed by a computer and that the
computer piece was composed by buff for
the record the real Bach piece is this
one
we have flooded with such examples like
just a few months ago there was this
famous match of Go Go is there like just
Chinese chess yes it's much more
complicated than chess in Finnish and
most experts before the match were
convinced that there is no way that the
computer can beat a human champion at go
and the artificial intelligence alphago
actually went on to defeat the human
champion Lisa doll fought one in a match
in Seoul but a really important thing is
that go experts then analyzed the way in
which alphago played and they were
amazed because nobody told alphago how
to play go they just told that the I
what are the basic rules what it what
are what it can do and cannot do and
then it just they just left it to
alphago it played around millions of
times against itself to train itself and
then it just went on to defeat the world
a human world champion it go it gets
worse or better depending on your
perspective you know how various
websites like Amazon recommend future
purchases for you based on the data the
site collects from your past purchases
that kind of predictive algorithm is
just in its infancy if you read a book
on Kindle so as you read the book the
book reads you Kindle knows which pages
you read fast which pages you read slow
and weary stop reading it gives you a
lot of insight about your reading habits
and what you like and dislike now
already today you can even upgrade
Kindle with face recognition programs so
it can basically monitor and analyze
your facial expression and know if
you're laughing if you're crying if
you're bored if you're angry in 5-10
years you can connect Kindle to
biometric sensors inside your body and
that constantly monitor your blood
pressure your sugar level your
testosterone level everything and then
Kindle will know what is the exact
emotional impact of every sentence you
read in the book now most of what you
read you forget very quickly after
finishing the book but Kindle which
means Amazon will never forget anything
it will basically know who you are and
how to press your emotional buttons I as
I've said repeatedly throughout the
conversation this is a brave new world
that I'm not sure I wanted to be part of
but it's it's interesting the way you've
described it like I want to close by by
posing another question that comes from
something you said earlier in the
conversation you you you said we could
have a choice between two kinds of cars
that would be self-driving cars so we
wouldn't be driving them ourselves
ultimately but we could choose to have
either a towed altruist or a Toyota
egoist yes which one would you Volvo
I don't like driving I really look
forward to the moment when I can just
give it to the algorithms to drive my
car other things I like to keep to
myself I think that the key is to really
get to know yourself better I mean if
you want to compete against the
algorithms the question is do you know
yourself better than the algorithms know
you and so you know the oldest advice in
the book nor yourself is now becoming
far more important than ever before
because if you don't know yourself well
then you're very easy prey to these
algorithms evolve thank you very much
thank you on ideas you've been listening
