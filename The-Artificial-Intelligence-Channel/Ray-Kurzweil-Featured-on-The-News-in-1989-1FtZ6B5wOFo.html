you suppose to down home ice cream
makers a jet-setting lingerie mogul and
a computer genius have in common not
much that's for sure but believe it or
not they do have some similarities there
are all New Englanders who've each had a
very unique invention idea the desire to
turn those ideas into reality and the
determination to make their venture
successful and make no mistake about it
they are successful and there's one more
common thread between them they're all
here tonight to share with you the tales
that took them to the top we've got ice
cream that packs the political punch
sexy underwear and robotic wizardry on
the bill so stay tuned I'd say is going
to be a pretty unusual hour
how far technology has come and yet we
seem to take for granted how much it has
altered our lives not too long ago it
might have seemed extravagant to own a
personal computer today many people
can't get by without one and who would
have thought that we'd see the day when
a computerized scanner adds up your
grocery bill and what about automatic
bank machines and computerized security
systems it all sounds like something out
of a sci-fi movie but they are indeed a
part of everyday life because a few
pioneers of science dared to experiment
with concepts that we only dreamed about
today the big challenge for computer
scientists is artificial intelligence
machines that can perform functions like
reading aloud from printed material
music machines that can recreate any
sounded hears machines that type while
you dictate it seems almost unthinkable
but our next success story is about a
man who has in fact invented machines
that think Ray Kurzweil was born in
Queens New York in 1948 his mother was
an artist his father a noted orchestra
conductor both highly intellectual so
perhaps it came as no surprise that at
the age of five ray knew for certain
that he would be a scientist a few years
later when most boys were discovering
girls and sports ray discovered an
infant technology the computer became
interested in computers really around 11
or 12 I built a computer my first
computer at that time and a little bit
later in high school I built a computer
that could analyze melodies and develop
what I called a pattern recognition
model of of why melodies and particular
composers sounded good or what
differentiated melodies from of a
particular composer from another
composer and it could then actually
compose melodies in the style of the
composer say Mozart Chopin that it had
analyzed it would sound like a
third-rate
student at monsoon later in his college
years at MIT he developed and sold a
program to a distinguished book
publisher for $100,000 computer science
was relatively new to MIT and when he
had taken the eight computer courses
that the school offered he changed his
major to literature he graduated with a
combined bachelor's degree in these two
areas and decided to direct his
attention to solving a specific
technological problem that had perturbed
him since high school my primary area of
interest within computers is a field
called pattern recognition which is
teaching computers how to recognize
patterns like printed letters or speech
if we look at a scene and see a cat on a
table we immediately can tell that
that's a cat that's pattern recognition
and that is actually the most difficult
aspect of human intelligence very early
on in in computer science we were able
to teach computers to play chess solve
mathematical theorems things which
adults find hard to do well yet today
it's still a challenge to teach a
computer how to tell the difference
between a cat and a dog which a small
child is able to do that's been my main
area of interest that about half of the
human brain at least is devoted to this
area of pattern recognition has become
an increasing area of interest within
computers because we realize that for
computers to do useful things they're
gonna be able to have to recognize
patterns the same way people do
character recognition the ability to
tell an a from a B regardless of what
type face is printed in has long been a
classical problem in in pattern
recognition and in 1974 I set up a
company personal computer products to
solve that problem and a ready for net
aid and solve it he did ray invented a
computer there first-of-its-kind that
has the ability to scan printed material
and read aloud using synthetic speech
for the first time ever blind people
could read without assistance
has worked for John Hancock company
since 1952 and received a personal
reader in his office in January of 1987
he recalls the day it arrived unpacked
it and got it going matter of fact I
came in the following day Saturday to
kind of work on it and began using it
immediately to read all kinds of
documents memos manuals books reports
tables you name it one example is this
security booklet employee security
program booklet we've had it for years I
always thought I really should sit down
and read this thing sometime or at least
the sections that pertained to me but
somehow you just never got time to do it
now I never got around to doing it so
one of the things I did quite early on
with the Kurzweil is in fact read that
book or the portions that I cared about
and I learned quite a bit and it was
just so nice to be able to do that sort
of thing I begun subscribing to certain
things that I did not subscribe to
before because I knew I'd never get
around to reading them and of course the
idea now that I'm fortunate enough also
to have one of these things at home
which I did because I liked it so much
in here actually taking books out of the
public library and reading them that
really is kind of an exciting thing for
those of us who haven't been able to do
that higher
adding table planting highly qualified
position there are two types of medical
evidence a signed statement can be
provided by a legally qualified
physician I'm sure look I can remember
one time my secretary started reading a
questionnaire that I was supposed to
complete it was sort of a medical type
thing for the clinic and we got into
some questions I have a secretary
reading to you and it would have been
nice to have the scanner another of rays
first customers with a voice reader was
none other than Stevie Wonder he was so
pleased with the product that he agreed
to appear in a television advertisement
ever wonder how Stevie Wonder reads his
mail with an amazing machine that can
read out loud it scans printed words and
turns them into spoken words here the
grade alone program begun by Xerox and
the American Foundation for the blind
will make them available to those who
must make their ears do it what their
eyes cannot this is Magic Ray and
Stevie's mutual interest in automation
evolved into a friendship it was during
one of their casual conversations that
Ray was presented with what could become
his next technological challenge I had
occasion to talk with him around 1982
about music technology and he was
lamenting the fact that there were two
different worlds of musical instruments
there were the acoustic world which are
instruments like piano and violin and
guitar which was still the sounds of
choice for musicians but it was very
hard to control those instruments in
fact you couldn't even play them unless
you've played a variety of instruments
you couldn't play them simultaneously
there was the electronic world where you
could play instruments simultaneously
you could modify the sounds you could
sequence them so that you could play a
whole Orchestra at once but the sounds
you had to work with were very thin
electrical sounding synthetic sounds and
he said wouldn't it be great if we could
apply these very powerful artistic
control methods that electronics
provides to the sounds of choice in the
acoustic world piano sounds violins and
so
and that really was the the challenge of
Creswell music systems in 1984 Kurzweil
music systems began shipping out the
Kurzweil 250 unique in that it could
realistically recreate the sounds of
hundreds of instruments from the human
voice to the elusive acoustic piano my
Bridget professor of music synthesis at
Berklee School of Music
there's no way in my lifetime that I'll
be able to learn how to play flute
clarinet trumpet trombone harp sing
violin cello drums timpani all of these
instruments yes one can play at them but
to have the dexterity on keyboard and
then to be able to make these sounds to
sit down at an instrument like that is
just it's just a joy it's it's a fun
experience a gratifying experience
experience I can listen to my own
compositions I don't have to try to put
together an ensemble to audition my own
compositions
all musicians judge instruments
electronic instruments and acoustic
instruments for that matter based
number-one on the sound because
synthesizers had been out for twenty
years everybody knew what a synthesizer
sounded like but for a keyboard player
to go up to a keyboard and play a violin
or harp sound or something some non
keyboard instrument and have it sound
pretty close to the original that was
that sort of the dream
the curves well 250 received a lot of
media attention
it's morning we could really use the
words amazing and awesome for a device
called the Kurzweil 250 and for the mind
of this man who is Ray Kurzweil who
invented this device the Kerswell 250
meets TV's needs it's really as soon as
we said we had this working model he
came over and wanted one right away and
he can hit the kisaburo one all of the
equipment that you see can be programmed
by anyone sighted or blind to play by
itself that is a technological wonder
rave latest invention solves get another
problem associated with pattern
recognition this time in the form of
speech speech patterns have always
puzzled computer scientists because the
patterns created by two people saying
the same word often differ significantly
if you look at two different people
saying the word baby
it looks dramatically differently and
again there must be some invariant
features that makes them the same word
and allows us to recognize it as the
same word that's the heart of the the
problem trying to find what those
invariant features are that's the same
between two different utterances of the
same word and we're devoted to what's
called large vocabulary speech
recognition which is recognizing speech
with a very large vocabulary of five or
ten thousand words large enough to
create written documents in a hospital
emergency room time is precious
in a matter of life and death
unfortunately it is the norm for the
doctor to spend almost as much time on
paperwork as he does on a patient raise
newest technology voice I am a voice
recognition system can cut form-filling
time virtually in half from Mercy
Hospital in Springfield Massachusetts
dr. John Holbrook this brings us this
overcomes the biggest hurdle that has
existed in the creation of a paperless
hospital which is the entering of very
complex data which is the data about the
patient encounter generated by the
practitioners by the doctors and the
nurses and the nurse practitioners that
data has never been able to be captured
before because people don't have the
time and the patience in a busy practice
of medicine to type that stuff into into
computers the ability to use voice to
enter that material into computers makes
it rapid and user-friendly so at the
human interface that the humans using
the computer the voice technology is
what really makes makes the capture of
the record possible after that
everything is easy testing 1 2 3 4 5 6 6
7 8
demographics one seven years white email
ankle sprain right twisting one hour
continue right limited range scratch
that full range based bandage signature
the ultimate goal is to convert the
emergency room to a paperless emergency
room we estimate that perhaps 25% of the
cost of delivering health care in the
hospital goes to just creating and
pushing around pieces of paper eight and
so we anticipate a huge monumental cost
saving if we can ever approach a
paperless emergency room it's difficult
for most of us to apply such terms as
common sense and intelligence to a
machine rakers well whoever knows the
future of computers and that future is
machines step think good thing because
today they are effectiveness about every
discipline it's hard to be involved in
any profession that isn't being
profoundly affected by computers in one
way another and with what's called the
knowledge principle which is the fact
that computers can't do much unless they
have knowledge about the world computer
science itself is expanding to develop
most other disciplines and for rakers
well whose interest range from art to
astronomy there's no place he'd rather
be than where he is right now
involved with the computers you're
invariably involved with something else
not speech recognition business we're
creating systems that create medical
reports so we've had to learn a lot
about medicine in the music company
we're learning a lot about music
education in the nature of music and
teaching music theory to our instruments
so that they in turn can teach music
theory to children so you really get
involved in a lot of things other than
computers by studying computers and so
it's a very good vantage point for to
have
a variety of interests in other fields
in early 1980 Xerox Corporation became
interested in Rey's work and later that
year they purchased his reading machine
Rey however remains chairman and chief
executive officer of what's called the
Kurzweil reading machine division of
Xerox Xerox is also a leading investor
in raised voice recognition company
Kurzweil applied intelligence these days
besides running his free businesses Rey
is also working on her first draft of a
new book not about high technology or
machines of the future as you might
think
but a diet book it seems he wanted to
lose some weight and being the
analytical sort he did some in-depth
research on the subject
he's also managed to drop around 40
pounds so I'd venture to say that he's
compiled some dieting information that
will be a great value to many people now
if we can just invent a machine that
blocks your path whenever you head for
the late-night snack we'll be right back
you
well you've just seen it our three very
different guests do indeed possess many
of the same ingredients for success
despite the odds against them they
pursued their dreams didn't let the fear
of failure get in their way and they
proved once again that the
entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well
in America thanks for joining me good
night
