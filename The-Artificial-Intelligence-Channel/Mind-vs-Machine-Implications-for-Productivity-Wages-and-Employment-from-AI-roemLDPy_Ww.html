David Merrill I'm the executive director
of the initiative on the digital economy
your co-host for day two of this fine
event before we get started I wanted to
go on the record as saying that I am a
die-hard Boston Red Sox fan however my
nephew Jay barrel ID needs a shout-out
he's an MIT alum he runs marketing
analytics for the Houston Astros and
while it may be correlation rather than
causality I think MIT can take credit
for the World Series victory last night
so we're gonna get this morning rolling
right away
and I'm very pleased to bring up Erik
Brynjolfsson for those of you who were
here yesterday he needs no introduction
but I'll give a brief one for those of
you who are due here today he's a
professor at the Sloan School he is
co-founder and director of the
initiative on the digital economy and
one of the leading thought leaders on
how technology is affecting our economy
so Erik get us rolling please thanks
David
so what an amazing day yesterday I I
think most of you are here and I just
found it wonderful to hear so many
brilliant people and one of the great
things about being here at MIT is all
the wonderful people who come here and
are willing to share their thoughts and
all the people who who work here some of
the best technologists some of the best
economists and social scientists and
we'll be hearing four more of them today
and there are a couple of themes that
came up yesterday over and over now I
want to touch on both of those
I could have broadly group them into
optimism and pessimism I mean there were
people who are very excited about all
the great things that are happening but
we also heard a number of people I see
mostly there that pointed out there's
some real concerns some pessimism about
robots eating the jobs and how what's
gonna happen to the people who are left
behind today I want to pick up on that a
little bit and particular I want to
focus on an aspect of it not the
employment part which we're going to
talk a little bit more about later but
let me talk right now about the
productivity part
and there again there's been some
optimism and pessimism and and I came
across this study this week that I was
very surprised just about the pessimism
and this is the number of people in each
country that think the world is getting
better and China as you can imagine from
hearing from Chi Fuli yesterday it's at
the top of the list and almost half the
people think the world is getting better
I was amazed to see the United States
all the way down there at six percent
six percent of the people in America
think the world is getting better that
by itself is a pretty pessimistic
statistic that so many people feel like
things aren't working for them and I was
another survey that a majority of
Americans think that this is the worst
time in human history in American
history so that's six percent I don't
know exactly how many that works out to
be but but I suspect if you if you took
out the people in this auditorium it
might be down to five percent or 4
percent because I think a big chunk of
them are here so that is is an
interesting stat and it there's some
evidence behind it when you look at
what's happening to economic growth in
productivity we had this golden era of
productivity growth between 1947 and 73
and and Bob Gordon and Joel and AD
aronia and I are going to talk about
that a little while and then starting in
1973 things didn't go so well there was
the oil shock and there was some other I
think kind of inexplicable slowdowns in
productivity macro economists have been
studying and debating this for for-4
year 50 years and I don't think they
fully understood what's behind it as you
go from business cycle to business cycle
and by the way these time periods aren't
picked arbitrarily they're picked from
the peak of one business cycle to the
peak of the next business cycle
to try to take out some of the the
cyclical effects in productivity we had
some gradual improvement and in fact the
late 1990s and the early 2000s things
were looking pretty good many people
including me pointed to the information
technology revolution things who are
improving quite a bit but then since
then the latest business cycle has once
again been kind of disappointing from
since 2007 and if you continue it out
you still continue to get pretty low
productivity growth and I think this is
the
basis either explicitly or implicitly
behind a lot of the the pessimism that
we aren't growing as fast as we are used
to and and although Paul Krugman once
said productivity isn't everything but
in the long run it's almost everything I
think that's one of the the main drivers
of raising living standards making the
pie bigger so we have more wealth to
share and more resources to devote
towards improving health care education
food and eliminating poverty and a lot
of other pressing needs that we have and
that has spilled over into this question
inspired again I think by Bob Gordon's
research from you hear from in a minute
about whether or not we're sort of
running out of inventions where all the
great inventions in the past and it's
not a coincidence that this guy is
sitting on a on a toilet because that
was certainly one of the great
inventions in human history most of us
wouldn't want to have to give that up
even if even if it meant that we had
more smartphones so there were some
amazing inventions in passing and and
there's a real ongoing debate which will
dive into about whether there are
equally important inventions in our
future but I don't want to just talk
about the pessimism because there's also
a lot of optimism and you heard that
yesterday I mentioned Chi Fuli and his
optimism and about what's happening in
China but an artificial angelic
intelligence generally Eric Schmidt was
very optimistic yesterday but there's a
whole litany of people that are most of
them very close to the technology that
are really impressed with what's
happening now and couldn't be more
optimistic and what's the basis of that
well part of it is that machine learning
has got a lot better I want to note that
we're gonna have some muffins at the
break and I just want you to be real
careful about which ones you reach for
there and humans you know are pretty
good at recognizing objects and
historically that's been one of the many
things that we could do that machines
couldn't do but that's changed over the
past 10 15 years or so machine vision
has improved
matically so this is scoring on a big
database called imagenet about fourteen
million images and if you look at those
images humans do pretty good they get
about 95% of them correct it's about a
five percent error rate it hasn't
improved much the yellow line is pretty
flat humans are about the same at
recognizing objects as they ever have
been
but machines have gotten much much
better in that acceleration there is due
to our friend Jana Kuhn who spoke
yesterday and other people like Jeff
Hinton who have helped develop these
neural nets and when the deep neural net
approach was applied to image
recognition there was a very noticeable
improvement in performance and so as you
can see now the blue lines a little
below the yellow line meaning that we've
crossed a really important threshold
where machines for certain applications
can recognize faces objects images
better than humans I mean I played
around with some of the image net there
are dozens of different species of dogs
and birds there I have to admit I don't
know how to recognize all those
different kinds of dogs and birds but
but the machine does it can do it so
that progress continues and it's not
just in vision we see similar things in
voice recognition dramatic improvement
almost a doubling in the accuracy and
you guys have your own sense you know
that if you if you talk to Siri or
Google home it's far from perfect but
we're kind of in this ten year period we
went from machines mostly not being able
to understand what humans say to being
you know kind of passively good here the
progress has been even faster this is
not over the past 10 or 15 years it's
over the past year that we've had this
kind of progress again mostly driven by
these machine learning systems and then
you can apply them to diagnosing cancer
and there was a paper recently published
in Nature by Sebastian Thrun and some of
his colleagues that compared machine
systems for recognizing cancer in
dermatology applications to a set of
human board-certified dermatologists and
the machines did just as well if not
better than the humans did at that
application I could go through lots of
others you've heard some of them so
to cause for some optimism and looking
forward I'd be even more optimistic
we've having a flood of research we've
had a 10x increase in the number of
people working on these kinds of
applications and have to think that some
of them are going to continue to make
the kind of breakthroughs like the ones
I just showed you a minute ago so what's
going on here how do we why we have this
this clash of pessimists and optimists
in a paper with Chad Severson and Daniel
Rock that we just came out this week we
described four possible explanations for
this maybe maybe the optimists are just
wrong that's one possibility it's
happened before people had great
expectations and things didn't pan out
another possibility is that we're miss
measuring things that these benefits
aren't being captured in our
productivity and GDP statistics and
there's good evidence that that has some
truth another one is that maybe their
benefits are all being captured by a
relatively small group of people the 1%
or the 1% of the 1% and that's why we're
not seeing the returns to most people
and the last one is the one I want to
emphasize which is that this
restructuring takes time the technology
is amazing but one of the reasons we had
this conference is to bring together
technologists and social scientists and
managers and history tells us that when
these great breakthroughs and Technology
happen
they don't instantly get translated into
economic benefit if you look back at
electricity or the steam engine or the
internal combustion engine they all took
decades to play out and so these
implementation and structuring ret lags
are quite real and that means that in my
view the AAI productivity paradox is not
really a contradiction on one hand the
optimists they'll be able I just
described they're looking at current
technology and you're saying this is
awesome we've got some wonderful things
in the pipeline the pessimists are
mostly looking at current GDP current
productivity statistics and maybe the
past 5 10 15 years and saying hey things
have not been that good recently but I
mean I said when I say it that way it's
clear they're talking about two
different things the past versus the
future secondly AI is what economists
call a general purpose technology and
this phrase was mentioned a little bit
yesterday
general-purpose technologies like
electricity have enormous payoffs
because they spawned complementary
innovations electricity not only is
wonderful in his own right but it led to
the invention of the electric light bulb
and electric motors and electric motors
give you the possibility to have
refrigeration and air conditioning and
now electric cars so there's a whole set
of follow-on inventions that can be made
once you have one of these
general-purpose technologies and most
economic historians would point to GP
T's as the main driver of productivity
growth and economic growth over time but
surprisingly GP T's even though they
have these great benefits in the long
run in the short run they could actually
lower productivity and lower benefits so
how does that happen well I'll talk
about that a little bit more in a minute
but I just want to say that the current
slowdown is not necessarily predictive
of the future we did a little study with
Daniel Rock and we looked at how any one
given year's productivity predicted the
next year's productivity or the next ten
years productivity and as you can see
from this scatterplot there was almost
no correlation between the two of them
so yes we've had some disappointing
productivity recently but I wouldn't
look at those statistics as a predictor
I would instead look at what the
underlying technology is doing so let me
just wrap up by saying that I think that
we need to use these technologies to
change the way we do our work we can't
rely on the technologies by themselves
to have the impact instead the challenge
now is to put those technologies to work
- for the managers the economists the
policymakers to take advantage of these
technologies so instead of taking 10 20
30 or 40 years for the benefits to play
out we can instead have them happen a
lot more rapidly and the inclusive
innovation challenge that we Eric
Schmidt mentioned yesterday is a good
example of that where we are recognizing
and rewarding the companies and
organizations that are taking amazing
technologies and deploying them if we
can speed up the process
taking a GPT and putting it to work
we're going to raise productivity and
living standards a lot faster than if we
just plow only on the technology side so
in summary this paradox between the
pessimist and the optimist is not really
a paradox I think it could be resolved
by understanding that AI is a GPT
artificial intelligence is a
general-purpose technology they are they
require some time-consuming effort to
restructure to reinvent our
organizations and really our whole
society if we do those things we can
realize the benefits but the benefits
won't be automatic and a big part of the
goal of this conference is to inspire
people to think about how to use these
technologies to make the world better
and not just assume that the
technologies will do that by themselves
so with that let me stop there and
introduce this first panel where we're
gonna dive into these issues a little
bit more and their own Acemoglu oh I
think is over here is is going to leave
that panel drone is one of the I think
you could say the leading economist
looking at the economics of technical
change and how it's affecting labor and
we're very lucky to have him here at MIT
and he's going to lead and moderate the
discussion and I'm going to turn it over
to Tyrone to introduce the rest of the
panel their own welcome thanks Eric
well I'll actually go here for one
second and then do the introductions
well welcome everybody it's a great
privilege for me to be here you've
already heard one full day of
interesting thoughts and a great opening
from Eric which sort of frames the
questions almost every technology asurs
in hopes and anxieties and almost every
new technology has important societal
implications but perhaps all of these
are doubly triply true for AI and
robotics because of the huge promise of
productivity and efficiency gains but
also unknown and potentially complex
implications for the labor market and
and I think there is growing debate on
these issues as you've also got from
Eric's introduction I think one sort of
drawback of the debate that you
sometimes encounter is that it's it's
it's centered on dichotomies in
particular two dichotomies one dichotomy
is that you know the productivity
implications of new technologies are
going to be so amazing that we're going
to be in a world that has no parallel in
history and then the other one is that
there's nothing under the Sun in terms
of productivity the other dichotomy is
that you know again there's nothing
under the Sun when it comes to the labor
market implications of new technologies
it's exactly the same thing as we've
experienced over the last 300 years
versus this is going to spell the end of
work for humans as they get taken over
by machines and as you might guess the
realities in the gray areas rather than
at the extremes of these dichotomies and
I can't think of a better panel to
discuss these issues than the one we
have here you've already met Eric who's
been a leading participant in these
debates and we have Bob Gordon from
Northwestern University whose work I'll
say a few more words when I introduce
him with the specific questions and also
Joel makeer also from Northwestern
University both Bob and Joelle have made
fundamental contributions to these to
these issues so I think you have a real
treat coming
so I think let me get this started by
giving it over to Eric and and the
specific issue I think that Eric is
going to talk about is is a continuation
of what he has already introduced it's
about the productivity implications in
particular as you've already seen and
Eric will talk about where are the
productivity gains thanks Tyrone so yeah
the rhone asked me to to continue on
this particularly that the session is
both about labor and productivity but
let me let me go a little bit further
and I'm intimidated here by having Bob
and roll on the stage because they have
been doing so much research in this so
part of my talk is going to be kind of a
pre rebuttal to what I think they're
going to say Bob and I bob is one of my
oldest dearest friends and we have been
having a roadshow where we go around and
talk about productivity and growth and
the effects of new technologies and
panels are always more fun when people
don't always agree and I think you'll
find that we have some different
perspectives on that so I'm going to
give you my perspective on then we'll
hear from Bob and from Joe and what will
we'll all dive in on that so let me
remind you about this disappointing
recent reality of what's happened with
productivity because I think that's one
of the real concerns that we have around
productivity is this this last number
here that's a little little slower than
what we'd like to see and there's a lot
of concern as to the way we're going to
be stuck there forever and one way to
look at it is from a historical
perspective and if you look at what
happened earlier with earlier GP teas
like electricity what you see is that
although Thomas Edison and Tesla and all
those guys made some amazing inventions
with electricity and they started
telling people hey you should use this
in your factories and elsewhere there
was this long period there from 1890 to
around 1920 or so where you didn't see
much productivity growth despite this I
think anyone would deny that electricity
is one of the most amazing technological
inventions that we've had and historians
like Paul David at Stanford and Oxford
went and looked at the factories and
tried to understand what was going on
and what they saw was that these
factories
they electrified they weren't really
fundamentally changing the way they
worked before electricity they had big
steam engines or sometimes water wheels
that power the equipment through pulleys
and crank shafts and that drove the
machinery and when they electrified they
went and took out the steam engine then
he went and got the biggest electric
motor they could find and put it right
where the steam engine used to be hooked
up the same pulleys and crank shafts and
got back in business now did that
fundamentally improve productivity not
really there wasn't much of a change and
even when they built entirely new
factories the architects would take the
blueprints make a big X through where
the steam engine used to be and right in
the margin put electric motor instead
they'd say okay my work is done and they
would build a new factory based on the
old designs again not a big improvement
in productivity
it took about 20 30 years until you
started seeing a new kind of Factory and
the new factories were based on a
different model where electricity was
used to power small electric motors that
were spread out distributed through the
factory not just one cooked by pulleys
and crank shafts and instead of having
them the machinery all clustered around
that central power source you were able
to have different machines laid out in
the sequence of production the order of
production and that assembly line
approach and having the flow of
materials go through the factory that
did lead to big improvements in
productivity in the factories that Paul
David looked at there was not just 10 or
20 percent improvements there was 100
percent
200 percent improvement in productivity
and that's what you start seeing here in
the 20s as part of that is this
productivity boom that we saw but then
eventually that sort of started petering
out too and you see it levels off again
there in the 1930s or so why do I show
you this because as Chad Severson has
documented and I just finished writing a
paper with him if you change the x at
the top there to the current era the red
line is what's happening during the IT
era and you see that it kind of eerily
matches up there there was a slowdown
then there's this improvement that I
described to you on the earlier slides
in the 1990s and 2000
and then again of a bit of a slowdown so
one of the things I wondered it was like
okay well what happened with with the
earlier era with a previous wave did it
keep petering out did that blue line
continue to be flat and low well as it
turned out it kind of popped up in fact
in the late 30s and 40s and then into
the 50s and 60s those were the best era
ever of productivity growth in the late
in the mid 30s people were talking about
secular stagnation the way they are now
they said well there are no more good
inventions that there's nothing good to
be invented and the very next couple of
decades were just enormous ly successful
now I'm not saying that that's a
guarantee that's going to happen again
but it does give you some pause that
even when you when you have a slowdown
it doesn't necessarily mean that that's
the end of productivity growth the big
issue as I mentioned earlier is that Co
invention is not easy that if you have
these technologies it takes time to
reinvent your business processes these
factories that evolved from the new
technology took a lot of business
process reorganization Mona talked about
this yesterday and it's not very sexy
but it's a lot of work and in other work
I did there's up to five to ten times
more dollars time and effort spent on
the co invention the business process
redesign as is spent on the underlying
technologies themselves when someone
installs a big ERP system or another big
technology system those of you who have
done it you know that it can cost
hundreds of millions of dollars a time
and effort to rethink your business
processes and the actual computers the
actual software is a fraction of that
cost so that's what we're going through
not just at the organizational level but
really at the industry and societal
level so the expected productivity
effects of IT you can think of as not
only having this core technology but
also a big investment in what I would
call organizational capital or
intangible assets and these intangible
assets are not measured in our
productivity statistics they're not even
measured as part of our capital stock
even though in a way they are capital
when you reengineer your business
processes you spend a lot of money
upfront in order to get a stream of
benefits over five or ten more years
that's like a capital asset but it's an
intangible capital asset and if we don't
measure it or if we miss measure it we
are not capturing a big part of the way
that the technology changes the economy
now you can do this more formally in
this issue at MIT I thought you should
see at least one equation here it's even
got a Greek letter so you can officially
officially check that off there but this
is the way that we would model what's
going on there the first set of terms
there is traditional solo growth
accounting model at Bob Solow here at
MIT got a Nobel Prize for war but there
are some additional terms that have to
do with what happens when you have an
intangible asset like the organizational
capital associated with AI that isn't
properly measured and if it's not
properly measured you're missing a big
component of economic growth and a big
part of what's driving it and rather
than go through the equation let me show
it to you graphically there's this
remarkable J curve that can happen where
even though this technology is helping
the economy the way you measure it and
what's really happening there is a
growth almost immediately in terms of
true output but if you're not counting
the contribution of the intangible
assets you initially have a downward
effect on measured productivity and the
intuition there is that a bunch of
people are working very hard to invest
in organizational change and that
organizational change is going to have
payoffs over time at least they believe
it's going to have payoffs but it
doesn't happen instantaneously and the
productivity statistics will show a
bunch of people working really hard
there's 80 billion dollars of investment
in rethinking self-driving cars for
instance there aren't a whole lot of
actual self-driving cars on the road so
it looks like more input no increase in
output it looks like lower productivity
when in fact that's an investment for
future productivity growth eventually
the statistics catch up when those
self-driving cars when that
reorganization creates real benefits you
see higher
activity growth but in the short-term
you can be fooled by investments that
don't have an immediate payoff the last
thing I want to say is that although I
focused on productivity here I also want
to stress we're going to talk about
labor that productivity is important but
unlike what Paul Krugman says I don't
think it's everything you can have
increase in output per hour without a
big increase in median family income and
so we need to work not only on proving
making the blue line grow faster but
also think about getting that red line
the income that goes to the average
person more widely shared with the rest
of us so let me leave it there and turn
it over to to Bob thank you
bob is gonna talk about both of those
lines Bob Gordon has been working on
macroeconomics employment and
productivity for several decades but
most recently he's written a masterpiece
on the history of American productivity
pointing out that essentially the
puzzles that Eric started with and and
and why the past had such amazing
productivity growth but the future might
be somewhat different but now today I
guess Bob's gonna talk about something a
little bit more optimistic about the
labor market I'm always optimistic about
the labor market we've had more than two
centuries of one technological change
after another and none of them have
created mass unemployment we understand
what happened in the Great Depression
that was a failure of monetary and
fiscal policy look what a decade of low
interest rates have brought us to we
have 4.2 percent unemployment we're well
on our way to unemployment below 4
percent perhaps exceeding the level that
was reached back in the 1960s we've
created 16 million new jobs since 2009
and in labor markets we have this
enormous churn we have 6.1 million job
openings in August we've got five point
two million people hired 5.4 million
people hired 5.2 million separations of
which 3.2 million are voluntary quits
so people jobs are
constantly being destroyed but jobs are
constantly being created and they're
being created in greater numbers than
they're being destroyed what we've got
now is actually a shortage of workers
not a shortage of jobs in all sorts of
parts of the economy so should we be
concerned about the quantity of jobs no
should we be concerned about the quality
of jobs yes and that's nothing new we've
been concerned about labor market
polarization thanks in part to the work
of Darren's colleague David autor for 15
years or so the hollowing out in the
middle the fact that the job growth has
been at the top and has been at the
bottom we've been talking about rising
inequality the failure of median income
to keep up with average income we've
been talking about that for the last 40
years and for more than 40 years we've
been talking this is a basic ingredient
in many macro textbooks the mismatch of
jobs and workers by skills and by
location and the low pay for unskilled
workers lower in the United States than
it is in many European countries and now
we've got a new concern that labor share
of national income has been declining so
all of these things are familiar having
nothing to do with artificial
intelligence but things that go back
much further what is surprising and I
was very surprised to find this out if
you take a given wage distribution
across occupations and apply it to 2006
employment and 2016 employment the
average quality of jobs measured by
their wages has actually increased
slightly it's not true that all we're
creating is lousy low-skilled jobs so
what's new about AI and robots the first
industrial robot was introduced by
General Motors in 1961 and they were
plentiful by 1995 and automobile
factories those of us that the NBER took
tours and saw robots welding together
auto bodies and they'd taken over the
paint shop by then mainly in
manufacturing there are a few robots in
Amazon warehouses but so far we've seen
very little
introduction of robots in education or
in healthcare except for laser guided
surgery
Amazon's warehouses suggest how robots
so far are limited they bring great
shelves to the human worker the human
worker actually still does the picking
of the item and the packing of the item
AI has been traced back to 1957 it's now
20 years since deep blue an IBM machine
beat Garry Kasparov in chess it's been
six years since IBM's Watson won at
jeopardy so AI has been around for quite
a while and what does AI involve besides
games well there are lots of things
every time you go to an airline or hotel
reservation system and make a booking
and it figures out to charge you a
different fear than some other customer
that's smart that's AI and it's taken
away most of the jobs of travel agents
voice recognition and language
translation have taken away some but not
all jobs of transcribers and translators
computer phone menus have taken away
increasingly number jobs of customer
service agents barcode scanning has not
eliminated jobs of cashiers and checkout
clerks computerized radiology scans have
not eliminated the job of radiologists
who still even though the computer
improves their diagnosis still have to
sign off on the diagnosis most spending
on AI is in marketing one firm trying to
take customers away from other firms by
analyzing lots of big data and that's a
zero-sum game I asked my colleague Phil
Kotler the guru of marketing the other
day has AI and marketing taken away jobs
and marketing and he says no it's
created more analyst jobs in marketing a
year or so ago McKinsey quarterly did a
survey of 350 business firms and asked
them if you look at big data and
advanced analytics how much of it has
changed your revenue or your costs and
three-quarters of them say
that it had cut costs or raised revenue
by less than 1% so that's where we are
with AI now I've got three graphs to
show you that suggests that we're not on
the verge of disappearing employment
here going back to 1970 is a graph with
the big thick line showing the advance
of ATM machines from 0 to 400,000 the
thinner line shows you what's happened
to the employment of bank tellers it's
gone from 200,000 to 400,000 bank
tellers were not eliminated by ATMs now
here's a more recent chart about the
retail sector going back to 2008 the
lower line is bricks and mortar
retailing you'd think that's been
decimated by e-commerce yes it was
decimated by the Great Recession but
it's come back and the total job loss
has only been 200,000 since 2008 while
400,000 jobs have been created in
e-commerce so on balance and retailing
were ahead were not behind in the last
chart I think it's the most interesting
this shows in the by the vertical lines
going back to 1970 shows when the first
spreadsheets were invented for the
personal computer visit kau Lotus 1-2-3
and then Microsoft's Excel and the line
that goes down shows you that about a
million jobs of bookkeepers and clerks
were eliminated by the invention of
spreadsheets but red sheets made
possible a whole new career called
financial analysts and the steeply
rising line shows you about a million
and a half new jobs were made possible
my moral of from this is that it's very
easy to predict jobs to be destroyed
eric is very happy to predict that in
the next 10 years or 15 years we're
going to eliminate all the jobs of long
distance truck drivers so that's easy to
predict it's much harder to predict the
new jobs that will be made possible by
new technologies like in this case the
financial analysts so in conclusion my
horizon only looks forward 20 years or
so I would not deign to predict what the
world is going to look like in 50 or 100
years a I will indeed displace some jobs
at
to labor market churn but many jobs are
being created and monetary and fiscal
policy have the ability to create as
many as we need for the labor force the
spreadsheet example is pervasive it's
easy to predict job destruction but much
more taxing to the imagination to
predict which jobs will be created and
finally AI is nothing new and it's
evolution over the past decade has been
accompanied particularly since 2010 by
the slowest consecutive seven years of
productivity growth in the history of
the United States thank you it's my
absolute delight to introduce Joelle
makeer I go a long time with Joelle I
knew him before even we met because I
was greatly influenced by his books on
the British industrial revolutions and
levers of riches and then since I'm
happy to say we've become good friends
and joel has continued to be very
productive and thinking about the
history of industrialization and
technology but more recently turning his
attention to the future of Technology
and the labor market and I guess joel is
much more optimistic about productivity
but probably agrees with Bob about the
labor market so it's like a real treat
to hear Bob and jolt agree Bob and I
basically disagree on many things but
you will actually see that we didn't
coordinate these talks also we have
office almost next to one another but
you'll see that we're going to say very
similar things so well I disagree with
Bob of course he says I think that
there's pace of technological change
will not only continue as it has in the
past hundred fifty years but it will
actually accelerate so I'm willing to
defend it to the death but not here in
my seven minutes question is what will
happen to work and is there a chance
that we will actually see technological
unemployment and it's a real possibility
that people will be reduced to these
board and vapid drones that people like
you Val Harare and others are describing
to us you know they're the classic
statement of this still I think Kurt
Vonnegut's a player piano which
since 6:00 tomorrow so as an economic
historian my knee-jerk reaction is God
we've seen this movie before you know in
the past this has happened many times
and seller workers resisted
technological change that is the best
known case of course using the Luddites
of nothingham
this is earlier than just revolution and
they're breaking these machines because
I think they're going to displace them
now this turned out to be wrong in the
sense that technological unemployment
basically didn't happen their sons and
daughters of the people who are
displaced by these machines he's wearing
framework knitters handloom Weaver's so
I found out of jobs that weren't really
imaginable in 1825 say they became
railroad engineers electricians you know
telegraph operators an honor an alarm or
they migrated to the United States so in
the United States two things went very
different here are you know the number
of people employed in agriculture see
the first left column you know in
beginning of the nation you know
three-quarters the labor force where
farmers and in two thousand you know
around two percent so clearly what
happened to all these people well you
know the US economy did not collapse in
the streets when filled with these
unemployed and unemployable X farmers
except perhaps sort of great depressions
Bob mentioned but that was a different
story and so far then historically there
is very little evidence of technological
unemployment despite the fact that
technological change has been very rapid
and reasons are very well understood
first it's the growth of services not so
much manufacturing secondly appearance
of new goods and services and third and
that's whether I want to dwell on a
little bit because it was the process
was relatively slow and I think it is
now accelerating so maybe just maybe
this time it's really different and many
people have expressed concern including
Eric of course here but many people some
of them economists but somewhat of
course from other fields so I'm gonna
make a few observations about that
the first is maybe I'll just go to the
second paragraph is that we should mean
we can make a distinction between what
we call process and product innovation
so process innovation pure process
innovation is basically making stuff
with
less labour and less capital and that's
sort of the classic total factor
productivity growth but product
elevation means the appearance of
entirely new products and services that
didn't exist before and very hard to
judge these within their labor saving or
capital saving but what it does is
creates new jobs that nobody imagined
before and say 1914 you know people are
worried about this but who would have
known that that grandchildren would have
jobs like cybersecurity specialist or
GPS programmers or veterinary
psychiatrist you know all these jobs
exist today and you know nobody in 1914
would have even imagined that they could
exist and so as Bob said new jobs will
be created but we don't actually know
what they are but you know we can make
some guesses one of them of course which
we can predict with certainty is that
the aging of the population will
continue and so geriatric services and
things related with with old people
would clearly require more work and I
think that's wrekonize Asian will be
particularly of course difficult to sort
of some attempt in that direction it's
also quite clear that fertility will
remain low and I actually make more jobs
because because people fewer children
there will invest more in their
education sort of the standard quality
quantity trade off and so the more a
better education you want for your
children the more labor intensive you
want it to be and I also think much like
Bob that it's unlikely that even so AI
is I think progressing that and
breathtaking great particularly the last
five years since the perfection of
machine learning and it's not clear that
intelligence is all that counts
increased creativity so I have these
three other eyes your intuition
instincts and imagination and we should
never underestimate what we call tacit
knowledge knowledge that we have that we
can't express in words and f we could
probably put it in an algorithm so Ken
machine learning learn to be intuitive
instinctive and imaginative and if not
the idea that labor and AI will be
complement rather than substitutes I
think becomes very convincing what we do
know is that of course it will not be
painless it's always painful because
people were made redundant in one
occupation cannot
easily to another sector and that's and
so there will be pain and was pain in
the past that it will be paid in the
present but let's just do a worst-case
analysis okay just say let me get bear
with me for a minute
suppose that in the long run the
doomsayers are right and that in the
long run
AI is so effective in other technologies
that the demand for labor and seem
simply a falls behind supply storage is
wrongly the supply of labor remains
higher than the demand for labor because
demand for labor declines due to
mechanization how much then will people
work and what I'd like to submit to you
is that the boundaries between work and
leisure for many in the last say
generation have become fuzzy here's a
factoid 25 percent of all Americans do
some volunteer work they work but
they're not paid that seems to be an
interesting observation and we this is
just supposed to be enjoying leisure but
they're actually working people but if
people don't work what will they do
and here's something to think about the
most remarkable progress in technology
in the last 50 years has been in leisure
okay
the the improvement in the options and
the quality of things that we can do at
our leisure time have increased
enormously there's even a recent paper
by Eric first and colleagues who point
out that the decline in in male labor
force participation is largely due to
these kids being hooked on video games
so there was day to choose leisure for
income largely because the technology of
enjoying leader has been come so it and
then wait until virtual reality becomes
widespread it's gonna get worse but even
before the 20th century I submit to you
a life of leisure doesn't seem to be
particularly bad I know of no cases in
which a British Lord demanded to take a
shovel and spend eight hours in the
field digging up potatoes Vassily Liang
Kiev the Nobel Prize winner wrote a
famous essay about this basically makes
the same point this is those who ask
what the average working
would do so much free time forget that
in Victorian England the upper classes
did not seem to have been demoralized by
the idleness blah blah blah blah blah
and the same of course was true for
leisure classes anywhere we look at
whether they were Chinese mandarins or
Roman generals and John Maynard Keynes
in his famous essay that I thought would
have already been cited but I've told it
not so he wrote this 1930s a called
economic possibilities for a
grandchildren and what he's saying is
basically what I'm saying which is it
may well be that unemployment could be
called by technology him and he was
living after an additional written in
1930 he says all this means that in the
long run
mankind is solving its economic problem
by building economic problem basically
me in the sweat of thy brow though shalt
eat bread and we're solving debt we were
able to eat without working very much
and then he says for the first time
since the creation men will be faced
this is obviously you know not
gender-neutral language writing in 1930
is real and permanent problem how can
you just freed them from pressing
economic care and ah no no no ok so what
we may well reach ladies and gentlemen
in the long run is then what we will
call work will be understood which both
from leisure like college professors
today only they will not get paid and in
the limit only those who will want to
work will do so now this may require a
radical new approach to economics and
specifically the distribution of income
because if people don't work they're
gonna haven't make a living somehow and
so the question and then I'm going to
finish with that if this technolog to
miss scenario you hold up will this new
world be utopian or dystopian and what
I've drawn allows you here because
technology is like a wind for like it's
like discovering a resource and so this
windfall can be treated in different
ways society can treat it like Norway in
Canada have and become a progressive
welfare state in which most people share
in the blessings or they become like
Russia or Nigeria where their revenues
are stashed away for the benefit of a
small kleptocratic oligarchy and that
becomes a question of political
institutions not of Technology thank you
well obviously as you might have
expected Joel Bob and Eric have given us
a lot of food for thought I want to just
say a few words before turning it to the
panels for them to have an opportunity
to respond to others comments and and
add some some thoughts and then we'll
open it up for discussion I think you
know one thing to sort of say perhaps to
put a little bit of this discussion into
perspective but emphasize a few other
things in the process is that the common
theme you are seeing emerge here is that
we have to think of technology as doing
many things and creating multiple types
of responses I think there is very
little disagreement between Eric Bob and
Joel that there will be technologies
that displace workers in the short-run
or from a subset of tasks in fact a lot
of the technological progress throughout
ages and certainly for robotics and AI
is of that form once you can perform
some tasks more cheaply using machines
if you're going to produce the same
amount of output you would need less
labor now that's where economics comes
in we don't produce the same amount of
labor we will do sorry we won't produce
the same amount of output we will do
many different things one of the things
we will do is we'll increase the amount
of output that we produce and that means
that there's gonna be a Productivity
effect we might want to start employing
workers that were displaced from
production into producing more of other
things and that's where the
complementarity is that Joel for example
internet and Bob was implicitly talking
about come in we're gonna create new
tasks new occupations new possibilities
but this also highlights that we have a
huge amount from to learn from history
as Joel sort of mentioned because the
same source of displacement followed by
expansion of
output creation of new tasks new
occupations new industries has been
going on throughout history but perhaps
if I may add one issue to this for the
panelists to think more and respond to
is that you know my reading is that
every historical episode is different
because the balance of the productivity
effect which leads to expansion is
different and the balance of new tasks
that are created in the process are
different and even though joel is
absolutely right and Bob is absolutely
right that we've done quite well at the
end of many of these episodes of arrival
and spread of new technologies there
were several decades sometimes even more
of hardship for labor certain specific
classes of laborers or perhaps of in all
laborers so I learned from Joel's book
when I was a graduate student about what
wages had what happened to wages during
the Industrial Revolution more recently
the economic historian Joel's good
friend and my good friend Bob Allen
called this angles posed because there's
about an 80 year period in which there
was no way to grow up whatsoever in
during the industrial revolution while a
bewildering array of new machines were
being invented and were coming online so
I think the episode of the Industrial
Revolution in terms of how long it took
for wages to increase versus say perhaps
electricity where it was faster is devil
is old and all in the details so that's
why I think we need to understand what
AI robotics are doing and what the
institutional structure and the
education system are setting the scene
in order to facilitate the
transformation of work so with this I'll
pass it to Eric whose work has
emphasized very different themes than
the perhaps the ones that Bob and Joel
have talked about so I think he has a
useful come back at this point well
first I want to say there's so much I
agree with from what bob control and
Jeron just said and I could reiterate
that but I think it'll be more
interesting for all of us if I focus on
the parts where we where we disagree and
I'm gonna pick up very much with my MIT
colleague here and maybe disagree with
my northwestern colleagues on a couple
of things
I mean first as
Roma's saying every time is different
and I could easily win when Joel and and
Bob point to this historical evidence
Ike I say well wait a minute you know
these new technologies are affecting a
whole set different set of tasks and we
can't assume that everything's going to
play out the same I talked yesterday
about polanyi's paradox and the
potential of these machines to solve
problems that we don't even know how to
describe ourselves but that would be too
easy so I'm not going to do that I'm not
going to say this time is different I'm
gonna take him on in their own terms
talk about history and first I want to
reiterate what what what with Durant
just said that yes Joel said that
eventually things worked out and
eventually there were jobs from but but
he did he didn't he was an honest
historian he used the word officially
because he knows that there was a long
period where a lot of people didn't do
so well that there was real suffering
you did you can read history or you
could read Charles Dickens to see some
of those conditions and I showed you a
chart more recently this is not just
ancient history
more recently median income has been
stagnating in the United States by every
every metric and it's not just economic
measures you can look at hope you'd
abuse or suicide levels what and case in
her economist husband Angus Deaton
described deaths from despair they have
just been soaring and our next panel
we're going to talk about some of the
struggles in Appalachia that are part
driven by changes in in the economy so
part of it is that just looking at
history it wasn't necessarily all all
roses along the way but the more
fundamental thing is a philosophical
mindset and I don't think the right
question is is this going to work out or
isn't it going to work out it's not
something we sit back and watch and see
what what the technology does to us the
technology is a tool and as I described
in in my talk you can deploy it in lots
of different ways and there's a lot of
work going back to the 1800s one of the
reasons that it did work out is United
States made massive investments in
primary education it led the world that
had the most educated workforce and that
led to not just higher growth but also
more equality we made a lot of conscious
decisions it wasn't the market that did
that that was decisions by us as a
society as policy makers and
again if we want these things to work
out and I'm optimistic that they can
work out we have to be at the driver's
wheel and think about how we're going to
drive those kinds of changes and not ask
is this going to work out but rather
what can we do to make sure it does work
out wonderful Eric thank you I'm gonna
pass it to Bob and Joel for a very brief
comment so that we can have a few
questions from the audience also I just
wanna respond to the historical points
that that Eric made which I don't
disagree with I do want to point out
that in fact in that sense it's
different now and the reason it's
different is because when the Nestle
revolution was taking place not only
that Britain didn't have a welfare state
they what little they had of it they
dismantled in 1834 when they abolished
the old below act we in the 20th century
when I say we are mainly industrialized
in a Western world we have something
called the welfare state the welfare
state it was designed to be a safety net
for people who that that that Eric is
describing now if we are going to go on
dismantling the welfare state just as we
need it most
okay then we will be in serious trouble
and there's some evidence that that is
in the United States what we're in the
process of doing there could be and just
about the stupidest thing we can do the
welfare state is needed and it is needed
precisely because it can soften the very
painful what economists call
transitional dynamics that Eric talked
about which nobody in his right mind
would deny but that's exactly why I gave
you the analogy and we can do this the
way Canada nor we're doing this or we
can do this the way you know other
countries are doing this and that will
make all the difference let me let me
come in on several of these points first
of all to pick up on Joel
we have deaths of despair we have all
sorts of disappointed people in the
United States but if you look at labor
market institutions in Germany Denmark
Sweden they do not have a like set of
despair mortalities improving instead of
getting worse and your so you have to
start asking what do they have in
Germany and Scandinavia that we don't a
whole set of institutions labor unions
government guaranteed medical care and a
lot of other
things on Eric I wish you would stop
telling us about productivity rising in
the 1920s and slowing down in the 1930s
as a macro economist I bristle at any
attempt to liken the Great Depression
with what happened after the 1990s when
you lay those two decades on top of each
other and on Joel about Keynes and the
future of leisure in 15 hour weeks we
know from Europe that modern societies
do not choose to take their leisure in
the form of shorter work weeks they
choose to take it at more weeks per year
in vacation and so if we're gonna go
anywhere in the United States it's to
copy our European brethren and having in
taking the whole month of August off we
have a few minutes for four questions if
nobody volunteers I certainly have my
own but yes thank you
I'm gonna rig it with the office of
digital learning here at MIT if this
were a joint session of Congress what
would be the specific recommendations
based on policies that you would need to
enact to ensure that that future that
you mentioned actually arrives so I
think it's a great question and and I
think we've all written about this and
talked about it and I refer you to to
some of our writings like the second
Machine Age we have three chapters
devoted to this but let me very briefly
touch on on three that highlight first
off most economists and I'm able here
made from David Otter later today would
put education at or near the top of the
list we are not in a world where
machines can do everything there's still
so many tasks as Joel and Bob and Durham
point out that only humans can do and
there is often a skill mismatch and we
can do a much better job of reinventing
education I think just plain investing
more in education to focus more on
creativity to focus on interpersonal
skills teamwork and there those are the
kinds of things that we're going to be
needing more of going forward so we can
say a lot more about reinventing
education but that's the first thing I
list the second thing is I would
actually do more to boost
entrepreneurship and business dynamism
we hear a lot about the amazing things
in Silicon Valley and elsewhere but the
data are surprisingly disappointing in
terms of
overall entrepreneurship in the country
as a whole in a capitalist system like
ours more or less we have a group of
people who are designed who are charged
with coming up with new products new
services new jobs
we call them entrepreneurs and too often
government is trying to protect the past
from the future sure we're trying to
preserve old jobs and old incumbents
rather than embracing new ones we could
do a lot more to that and last but not
least as as Joel was pointing out we
need to make sure we have a safety net a
tax and transfer system redistribution
system my own favorite is the Earned
Income Tax Credit which not only gives
people income support but also
encourages them to stay engaged in the
labour force because there's so much
work that needs to be done and I think
people get a sense of value from being
contributors to sighted society so those
three things education entrepreneurship
and and redistribution I think would
help go a long way I would add a force
that I made and that is a lot of the
high-tech sector I'm not telling
anything that you don't know in this
country depends on immigration and the
one thing that the government seems to
be turning away from is realizing that
this is how you build a place like
Silicon Valley you bring in the Israelis
you bring in the Indians you bring in
the Turks you bring in people from all
over the world they want to come here we
should accept them with open arms the
idea of starting to to restrain that
strikes me as totally cockamamie and I
would say this in a joint session of
Congress we have two more questions so
let me let me take the two questions at
once and then we have one minute for us
to to react to them please okay I have
quick questions okay it's great that the
panelists mentioned the productivity AI
employment but one thing I think you
didn't mention is the technology enabled
the product productivity and in fact
employment across the border okay so
what happened to the distribution of
productivity across the border is this
something to do with globalization what
do you think about that ok and then the
final question please yeah I wanted to
bring up a couple of historical factors
that I didn't hear about in the
presentations and I want to hear your
thoughts and the first is about the
growth of consumption over the course of
the 20th century which some people argue
is what kept employment high and of
course now there's an argument that we
can't keep going down this path we can't
keep consuming evermore to keep
employment full because we've reached
the ecological limits of that that's the
first one the second one is the
organized and often incredibly violent
and bloody fight for shorter working
hours that happens you know at the end
of the 19th century which again some
versions of labor history would argue is
how workers started getting an
increasing share of profits in an age of
rapid technological change obviously
we're not having an organized bloody
fight for shorter working hours
oh that's wonderful that's our two other
good points so I think in the remaining
minus 30 seconds for our panelists we
have globalization the future of
consumption and the conflict between
labor and capital
take it away I just wanted to first of
all second joles
policy recommendation of much more
high-skilled immigration Trump wants to
cut legal immigration from a million to
500,000 I think we should go in the
direction of Canada which brings in
three times as large a share of its
population as we do and another thing
preschool education for the poverty
population those young kids that have an
enormous vocabulary gap from middle
class kids need help to avoid this kind
of stagnation and lack of income
mobility in this country so those are a
couple of more policy suggestions for me
and let me just hit on both questions
very quickly on the globalization
absolutely this is going to hit many
other countries I think even harder than
what's hitting the United States Michael
Spence and Andrew McAfee and I have an
article where we talk about how some of
those jobs that are very routine that
are being done in other countries are
even more in the bullseye of some of
these new technologies on the on the the
second question I would say we need to
rethink our economic metrics our GDP
is a very it was a great invention in
the 1930s and maybe some people call one
of the great inventions of the 20th
century but we need to move beyond that
and think about things that aren't based
on more flat-screen TVs or more
traditional consumption there are other
ways that we can increase well-being and
including the environment including the
value of all the three things we do is
part of it it's a research project we're
also doing here at the MIT issue but if
we don't have the right metrics we're
not going to be pointed in the right
direction well thank you very much yes
one note on consumption and that is the
pessimistic views about what is
happening to median income real wages
and simha things are all suffer from the
same flaw and that is they're all real
meaning they are deflated by a price
index now suppose suppose that that
price index was constantly erroneous in
the sense that it's over measures
inflation simply because they're unable
to correct for a constant quality
improvement of goods that actually means
that much of what we were worried about
is median income is concerned maybe the
result in part of Mis measurement very
much I think we've got a lot of food for
thought and you know despite the fact
that you've heard very different
perspectives and if you have interacted
with it Joel
Bob and Eric as many times as I have you
know that there is a lot more thoughtful
background to some of these
disagreements but also it's remarkable
there is how much agreement on some of
the very important themes and the one
that I'll just leave you with is that
the way that I too often put it is that
there's a huge institutions technology
mismatch here we have tremendous changes
but it's not clear whether the
institutions especially in the United
States as we have in the education
sector in fiscal system in Social
Welfare are actually apt to enabling us
to make the best out of them thank you
