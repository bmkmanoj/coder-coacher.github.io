our program and to introduce Joseph's
own more formally in its 55th year of
publishing some of the world's most
prominent authors in fields ranging from
science and technology to art and
architecture and importantly for this
evening including fields like higher
education and linguistics the MIT press
is committed to nothing less than
reimagining what a University Press can
and should be this spirit is alive and
well in tonight's featured speaker
Joseph Aoun and his just published book
robot proof higher education in the age
of artificial intelligence in his book
Owen challenges traditional models of
the University and of literacy itself in
an age in which tasks based on rote
learning and memory are increasingly the
purview of machines his book makes us
rethink the purpose of higher education
in confronting the world's problems a
robot proof education trains creators
not laborers he writes now as someone
who reads a lot of books and lethal what
reads a lot of book proposals some of it
very dry academic stuff let me say that
I was impressed not only with the
content and accessibility of this book
but with many of its with its many
beautifully crafted sentences I
mentioned to a mutual friend Jay Kaiser
professor emeritus of linguistics at MIT
and editor of a well-known journal in
the field named linguistic inquiry that
I had the honour of introducing Joseph
tonight and Jay replied quote I could
never understand how he could bring
himself to choose the presidency of
Northeastern over being associate editor
of linguistic inquiry there's a
there is no accounting for taste he was
also my student perhaps that's where he
went wrong so for those of you who know
him that's quintessential J Joseph own
earned his PhD in linguistics at MIT in
1982 serving as Professor Noam Chomsky's
first teaching assistant during his
years here he is a native of Lebanon and
he studied in Beirut and Paris before
coming to MIT and after MIT he joined
the faculty of USC's College of Letters
Arts and Sciences where he was named the
inaugural holder of the Anna H Bing
Dean's chair Northeastern University
named on its seventh president in 2006
now in his 12th year in the role he has
distinguished himself as an expert on
global and experiential education
he's enhanced Northeastern's signature
co-op program with work opportunities
around the world and he shares many of
these successes of the successes of the
co-op program in the book to date
northeastern students have worked
studied and conducted research in 131
countries on all seven continents in
2011 even received the Robert a new
award from MIT which honors MIT
graduates for significant achievements
in humanities arts and social science
fields and announced just today Arun is
one of seven university presidents
honored by the Carnegie Corporation with
a leadership award of $500,000 to
advance his educational initiatives
which is quite remarkable and typical of
his commitment he pledged a matching
grant to take this award even further
after President Ione opens with his own
remarks on his book David Rotman will
take the helm and start a conversation
to steer us through some of the work's
key questions and then we hope members
of the audience will join in the
discussion as well David is editor of
MIT Technology Review a science and
business journalist he has written
extensively on chemistry biotechnology
material science AI and environmental
issues but first please join me in
welcoming president Joseph Aoun of
Northeastern University
thank you good evening it's good to be
back at my alma mater and to see some
friends and colleagues and some of my
teachers actually Sylvan is here and Amy
and I graduated from the Linguistics
program so her you know she is very
biased in her introduction don't believe
and if anything she said so you know I'm
going to tell you a little bit about the
book essentially something you all know
smart machines are getting smarter and
displacing us in at many lab on many
levels many jobs are becoming obsolete
as a matter of fact various studies have
shown indicated projected that over the
next 20 years close to 50 percent of the
jobs we know will disappear the
inequality we know today is going to
increase even further at the same time
when we look at the marketplace when we
look at society and we ask ourselves
what you know and we ask people CEOs
employers institutions what kind of
talent are you looking for they are
looking for the creative talent the
intrapreneurial talent the talent that
can work with people that can be
culturally agile that can be global that
can think in a systematic way and this
is something that is needed and this is
something that everybody wants to have
given the challenges of jobs being
redefined and what people and what
society is asking for higher education
must change in order to make people
robot proof so in my book what I am
presenting is a blueprint for how higher
education can change to make people
robot proof so I'm saying three things
one we need to rethink our curriculum
second we need to integrate experiential
learning as part of what we do and third
we need to move lifelong learning in
order for it to become part of our core
mission so let me start by the
curriculum I am calling for a curriculum
based on humanics
what is humanics humanics is the mastery
of three literacies the tech literacy
understanding machines understanding how
they work and understanding how to
interact with these machines
the second is data literacy namely the
understanding of the enormous amount of
information that machines are producing
and how we can navigate this information
make sense of it and be on top of it and
the third is what I call the human
literacy namely the focus on cultivating
what is unique to human beings that
machines will have difficulty duplicate
duplicating what are these attributes
creativity intrapreneurship system
systems thinking the ability to interact
with people to be in pathetic the
ability to be culturally agile the
ability to be global and the ability to
function in teams how do we achieve that
we don't teach creativity we don't teach
entrepreneurship we have to practice it
we have to live it and that's the second
component experiential education
experience of Education is essentially
the integration of the classroom
experience
with the world experience now I believe
that the most powerful form of
exponential education is based on the
work practice or long term internships
or coops as Amy said what are these are
long-term internships that allow the
learners to test what she has learned in
the classroom to refine it to understand
what she's good at to understand how to
work with other people to understand her
limitations and her potential and then
to be a leader to be a creator and then
to integrate the two together that's the
power of exponential education and I see
it happening on a daily basis the third
aspect is lifelong learning machines are
smart and also getting smarter more jobs
are going to disappear and also new jobs
are going to be created we are going to
be obsolete each one of us unless we
they educate ourselves unless really to
lifelong learning is a necessity
now lifelong learning in higher
education has always been viewed as a
second-class operation and salary to
what we do it has to move to the fore it
has to become part of our Commission
people need to educate themselves to
etool in order to remain robot proof but
it's not going to be easy to integrate
lifelong learning as part of our core
mission because it will lead us to
rethink how curricula who owns them I
with the sole owned owners of this
curricula are the learners the employers
Society have do they have a role to play
in shaping them it's going to lead us to
rethink the notion of delivery it's
going to also lead us to rethink how we
are going to bring the learners to us
they don't have the time they don't have
the ability we have to go to them the
university has to go to learners it's
going to lead us also to rethink our
notions of degrees credentialing
we need to meet these challenges society
is changing the world is changing higher
education needs to change and I believe
that higher education has the
responsibility and the opportunity to
make every learner go but proof that's
what my book is all about thank you
thank you my name is David rotten and
I'm the editor of technology review it's
great pleasure great honored to be able
to participate in this conversation with
you I have to say this book is terrific
thank you and if people haven't read it
they should and I think it does many
things well but what two of them is it
provides a historical context in a
current context of why AI and robots are
changing jobs and how technologies in
the past have changed jobs and how this
time it's different in many ways and
it's it's a very nicely I think
discussion of how what is happening but
and then secondly as we just heard it
not just offers a problem but it lets it
provides a really I think strong
argument for why education needs to help
people adapt to these changes so
terrific book thank you I'm gonna ask a
few questions and then really open it up
and hopefully have a discussion I want
to start by asking you when did you
start thinking about AI and robots and
their effect on work and how they may
why education might change and then
that's sort of a follow up as you began
writing the book as you wrote the book
how did your thinking change
you know you know that there is a
seminal work that has been done by two
faculty here at the Sloan School called
the second Machine Age and this work was
called into action because they raised
the implications of what AI is going to
do to society to work so that you know
if you want that's one of the first
books that I read obviously I've been
reading a lot of books on AI
trying to learn about it but that was
one of the turning points for me and you
know and then if you know in higher
education we don't like to think too
much about work we want we want to
educate our students but we don't care
whether there is any implication for
work or not and you know I belong to an
institution and now with Northeastern
where this has been a part of the core
mission of the institution is to think
about the work not of today only by the
work of the future so you know this led
me to start thinking about the
implications of the IIE evolution the
second Machine Age on work on society
and frankly on higher education what has
changed over a when I was writing a book
is the book is that the acceleration
happened namely people when people
started talking about the AI people
thought that this was remote this was
not going to happen and suddenly you
know we are seeing it around us
you don't jobs disappearing jobs being
redefined and at the same time you know
we are seeing also that some many
politicians are denying them you know we
have politicians here you know saying we
have this is not a problem that we
should be concerned with and you know so
therefore you know other people are
scared we need to regulate
we need to tax it we need to do XY and Z
so what has happened is that something
that started a you know being a kind of
almost academic discussion became
central to many discussions happening in
society and that's why I had to adapt
and you know and integrate elements that
I didn't think about before mm-hmm yes I
think both the pace of the the
development of the technology has
changed has been much faster than I
think many had anticipated and I think
it's become more evident that were
unprepared for these changes
policymakers in society as large
absolutely absolutely and if you I mean
I was mentioning to David that if you
look across different countries Europe
is much more sensitive to that and much
more worried about that and you know and
it's happening at the government level
whereas here the government is saying
look this is not an issue we need to be
concerned with
so it's interesting and there for
instance
England is now the UK is looking at
possibilities of asking each company to
put a fraction a small fraction of its
margin in order to the tool to focus on
educating and relocating the workers
their executives you know and their
future employees you touched on this a
bit but I was struck at one point in
your book you said there really you
called it one of the most powerful
skills that we have as people versus
machines or versus robots is creativity
and creativity is still that advantage
that a person has over and will always
maybe always have it was wondering if
maybe you could expand on it I think you
mean creativity in a very general sense
in a very broad sense and maybe expand
on why what gives people that advantage
over
machines over robots I mean in look in
here at MIT a you know the creativity is
everywhere but so in society let's go
beyond higher education you know an
entrepreneur is a creator in appearance
looking at the problem and looking at an
opportunity and seeing it in a different
way
similarly somebody who is launching
not-for-profit in you know either in
Roxbury or in Africa is a creator is a
creator and is shaping something new
people who are working in various
industries are we thinking this industry
so it's not only the you know the
research the fundamental research that
is by definition you know creativity
creative it's everything we do the way
we look at the world we look the way we
look at the problem the way we think an
issue is based on creativity and you
know this is something that has been the
purview of human beings or human species
and it's very difficult for I haven't
seen yet
a robot that is going to see the new the
next no opportunity the create you know
and you know Apple have a new theory
whatever it is so that's why I think you
know we have to focus on these aspects
that are specific to human beings and
recognize that as AI and robots there's
many things that will get more and more
powerful but I certainly believe that
you just outlined that the creativity is
something that will be elusive at least
for the foreseeable future for AI and
hopefully other aspects to the ability
to look you in the eye and understand
you know whether you're happy with what
I am saying or unhappy the ability to
read your body language the ability to
interact with you to empathize with you
in when you when you're happy or when
when
New York said the ability to work with
you and you know be led by you you know
that all these aspects are you know
fundamental to who we are as human
beings and it's this is something that
we need to continue to cultivate and
focus on one thing I wanted to ask you
touched about it a bit in the book is
that we hear a lot these days about
skill gaps skill gaps in terms of
there's not enough people to hire for
four jobs or and then I know as you
point out in the book I what many
economists do not believe it's true and
it's it's a complex issue but I wanted
to ask you your take on the skill gap
how we address it how we make sure
people are sort of prepared and how
companies perhaps work with universities
to make sure that we're training people
for the right skills the right jobs you
know for instance now if you survey what
what is needed in society now and
actually those surveys happen you know
the business education forum did that
the Chamber of Commerce did that Council
of competitiveness did that you see that
for instance they are saying that we
need cyber security and big data you
know this is not a surprise and that
there is an enormous demand for cyber
big data etc now you know clearly others
you can add you can add design thinking
you can add various other aspects but
you know you ask me how society and how
we can look into that there are two
types of learners that I am discussing
in my book those that I call short on
experience long on time and those are
the undergraduates that you teach and
the others the learners who are long on
experience
but short on time and those are Gus the
adults so you know there will be there
will be in the you know new demands
constantly for new jobs etc what has
happened for instance is that and that's
lifelong learning namely for the second
group longer an experience short on time
what has happened is that society has
answered by because in say in fact
higher education has not answered that
we haven't answered that by creating for
profits by creating boot camps but you
know in order to meet the needs the
number of boot camps that were started
that will teach you coding now they are
teaching you Big Data they are teaching
you cyber they're teaching you they are
doing it but we are seeing the
limitations of what they have done
because if you have a boot camp let's
say in coding the employers are saying
this will get you into the job but it
will not allow you to really think and
master and be a creator
it's rote learning so this is you know
in some ways companies have answered
that by saying you know we are going to
create our own universities that's
interesting and every time a company
starts its own University that's that
means what that means that we didn't
meet their needs
otherwise they are why should they start
their own University you know at MIT I
have MIT t-shirts and I have also
Northeastern t-shirts so when I I design
at Northeastern t-shirts
I don't manufacture them I go to
somebody who knows how to do it because
that's they called business so every
time in a company like IBM or GE start a
university that's a failure of the of
higher education so to answer your
question society has done that by
allowing the for-profits to
flourish Society has answered the need
by allowing oh you know they don't need
to be allowed to do it by you companies
doing lifelong learning now if we don't
do it and we do it based on precisely
getting people to be a robot proof
that's our failure and that's also our
opportunity right I want to begin taking
some questions from the audience I'm
sure there are many yes
is there a why don't you give is there a
microphone that will come around there
you go like many people in this room I
was taught by Paul Samuelson that a
central perhaps the central issue in
economics is scarcity
stays law says that everything that is
produced will be consumed and there is
no concept of excess productive
capability
I believe that AI and advances in
material science and biotechnology have
or will soon repeal these laws how do we
create an economic system that widely
distributes purchasing power so that
consumer choice determines what is
produced and yet we want to maintain
incentives for outstanding people to be
creative and work hard thank you this is
a great question and it's beyond me in
many ways because because it said you
are referring to the fact that if indeed
AI and robots are going to displace us
as people who have jobs you know who are
going to be the consumers who are going
to be the taxpayers and also there will
be great winners and many losers by very
bifurcated society so what is happening
is that there are discussions about
you know universal basic income you know
about that you are discussion saying no
we have to give incentives for people to
redefine themselves you know this is not
something that I discuss it's really
beyond my expertise what I am saying
that everybody will become obsolete
unless she or he we educate themselves
and Ritu's and higher education has to
step in and integrate lifelong learning
as part of its core mission and I might
just suggest I wouldn't even begin to
offer answer to your question but I
think it does point out that these are
major significant upheavals to the
economy to our society how we think
about our future how we think about the
role work in our economy so I'm not sure
anyone really has an answer but I think
it does point to that this is a big deal
going on absolutely
there you go northeastern is known for
its experiential education and
northeastern results made some big
strides with online education how do you
provide an experiential learning
experience and how do you manage that
when your students may not be anywhere
near the campus yeah I didn't ask him to
ask this question so thank you first of
all in everything we do we are
experiential whether we're doing
undergraduate education whether we're
doing all the certificates master's etc
and now we are moving in having all our
PhDs being experiential some of my
colleagues are here who are leading this
effort the one thing that we have done
is to go where the learner is a what
what does it mean for people who are
long on experience short on time namely
the adults we have launched a certain
number of campuses there in Silicon
Valley in Seattle in Charlotte in
Toronto and soon in Europe and Asia the
purpose precisely is to be where the
learner is and to provide experiential
education so for somebody who is long an
experience we take into account what she
knows what she does in the workplace I'm
talking about the professionals it's it
says it's not we go for groups of 20
it's really not the mass-market approach
or anything like that and then for those
who are trying to educate themselves and
move
two new fields everything we do from the
certificate to the degree has to be
experiential in and it has to be
integrated because the point is not to
have the experience and to have the
classroom experience the point is the
integration of the two as a learning
approach so which means that in fact the
University is becoming a multi
University you know can't Boston is only
one manifestation of Northeastern that's
what we have done so wherever whatever
we do wherever we do it we go to the
learner and we do it in an exponential
way let me go ahead but as you get ready
let me intervene there's a question that
that people have posted and it is as a
follow follows are you concerned that
even following your blueprint for higher
education there will be far fewer jobs
available than people who need
employment I think you know this is a
healthy concern there will be jobs that
will disappear there'd be new jobs that
will be created I cannot predict you
know whether the jobs that would be
created would be enough you know we need
to be ready to be you know to educate
and ourselves to be to look at these new
opportunities are they going to be
enough I don't know I don't know I hope
so but certainly I know one thing that
we if we ignore the fact that we need to
educate ourselves and be part of them we
are going to be losers right adversity
actually asked this some version of this
question to many people and the best
answer I get is really there is really
no way to know how the key part of this
equation is how many
jobs will be created with the new
technology and this is basically
unknowable and I think to your point
what we can do is prepare ourselves for
the type of work that's needed the types
of jobs and and and hope those jobs
flourish and multiply and also along the
same lines you know if we start thinking
about our learners as creators then
maybe opportunities that they can shape
themselves in very in different ways and
not only partake in you know a new
economy but create and shape this new
economy sir two questions briefly
American higher education I think
generally is viewed as leading the world
American pre-college education is middle
of the pack and maybe below middle of
the pack what has to happen in the
public school system and in private
secondary education to prepare people
for the world that they're about to
enter and secondly do you see any risk
over time of what I would call a 21st
century Luddite movement saying I don't
want to be operated on by a robot I
don't want my car to be driven by a
naughty non-human I have people saying
no no no stop the world I want to slow
down I like the things the way they are
and could that become significant over
time absolutely you are seeing do and to
answer the second question you are
seeing reaction to that you know the end
of reaction is for instance take even
uber well you know in Europe and in the
rest of the world there are very strong
movements to oppose and limit that you
know every time I'm not saying something
that it's going to surprise you or
profound every time there is a change
you have the early adopters you have
people who are not going to accept that
the Luddites and the large majority is
an a wait and see situation and usually
what happens is that the early adopters
become you know the models and they will
carry the rest of the day and
it may take time but ultimately you
cannot stop it so absolutely it's
happening as we speak
similarly the idea of you know taxing
robots you know is it can be viewed
along similar lines you know other other
protectionist measures that you know
about worldwide can be viewed along the
similar lines with respect to your first
question about the discrepancy that we
have in the United States between K
through 12 and higher education is a
fundamental question I think that in
some ways I'm going to say something
that may surprise you higher education
needs to start looking at it at itself
as providing education or education
educational frameworks from K 2 grade so
for instance we have launched at
Northeastern this year the workshop in
the summer where we invited 70 school
counselors advisers principals to come
from you know from the United States and
Canada to come and work with us on
getting trained and retrained in
experiential education so why because we
assume that our responsibility is also
with respect to the K through 12 and the
case you know I mentioned that higher
education needs to change you know and B
in order to allow learners to be a robot
proof it starts as an only child and
that's our responsibility also in higher
education because we are leading the
pack in terms of thinking about learning
and not only in terms of you know
science and engineering and humanities
etc you know who does learning us are
they benefiting from they're not really
I hold the mic I'm sorry therefore the
power hi
you mentioned the critical
characteristics that the students have
to have you know the Entrepreneurship
creativity you know ability to interact
with people at the same time and I
couldn't agree with you more about that
absolutely at the same time those tend
to be fairly soft skills and society
seems to be moving more towards you know
keyword and pattern recognition on
resumes and all that right so the
interesting question is number one how
do you assess both within the school and
then how do you propose to let's say a
society or the private sector to
evaluate and assess those skills because
that's getting harder and harder without
interviewing everybody in the world yeah
it's a great point because in in many
ways in whatever we do in higher
education we have focused on input
measures on it we know how to assess
input very well you know namely when you
look at the incoming students we know
who they are we know you know the the
grades they have what they have done it
cetera we don't assess the outcome we
don't know how to assess the outcome
well and you know and now you know that
that's that's something we need to work
on but going back to your point about
what you call the soft skills
I'm not asking the only the you know to
focus on what you call the soft skills
I'm asking the I'm calling for the
integration of the you know tech
literacy information literacy with the
human literacy you know in other words
every engineer has to understand the
implications to be very simplistic the
implication way of what she is doing
when they are working on building a new
city along the coastal lines the
environmental implications the human
implications etc that now the final
point that you raise how do we ask
that you know we are at Northeast and we
have created a platform an app that will
take each learner before they start at
Northeastern and then will remain with
him or her for the rest of her life if
you want call it coaching for life that
will allow them to assess their
objectives learning and otherwise and
how they are meeting their objectives
and how we are helping them meet their
objectives we launched it this fall with
1,000 students and next year is going to
be universal so we have to do it we have
to start in you know when we have the
perfect app and the perfect coaching app
in you know in the first year absolutely
not
we are learning and we are building it
as we're flying it
sorry so before I came to MIT I went to
a liberal arts school where it was sort
of drilled into us that the purpose of
higher education is not to train you for
a job but it is a place where you will
learn how to learn and given these
developments I feel that this approach
is being vindicated however over the
last 20 years I have also noticed that
the universities over around the world
have started reducing or even
eliminating their departments of
philosophy of history of literature are
they doing a disservice to their
students given what the future bares I
think let me tell you we each one of us
in higher education bears a
responsibility because we created a
false dichotomy between learning to live
and learning to earn a living let me
repeat that we have created the false
dichotomy between learning to live and
learning to earn a living and we got
away with that because we are an
affluent society nowadays this is being
questioned so what I'm asking for what
I'm calling for is not this dichotomies
to go beyond it and to integrate the
various literacies from the
technological to the human literacies
and that is what I'm calling for so the
second aspect of your point is that are
we doing ourselves a disservice to close
classics Department or not in my mind as
an educator the responsibility is doing
we are doing ourselves a disservice and
I agree with you but also when we start
focusing on we are not teaching
literature will teaching theory I'm not
teaching history I'm teaching my
theoretical approach to history that
becomes something that is about me not
about the learner so we moved away from
what the ideal that you are espousing
and that's why also you are seeing now
several liberal arts colleges waking up
and saying no we need to integrate an
experiential approach in what we are
doing we need to worry about the real
world so you see that the world is
changing we have to change and we have
an enormous opportunity and that's what
I'm describing in this book let's take
one more question and I have one
question that has been sent in carrion
is a you know somebody I know so I don't
yeah she's biased too so go ahead Karen
looking forward to reading the book you
haven't read it Karen oh my god so
primary and secondary education have
been widely criticized for training
teachers too much in how to teach higher
ed has been criticized for teaching
people content PhDs learn about research
and so forth and not how to teach is
northeastern hiring different kinds of
PhDs or training people how do you get
your professors to a spot where they
know how to teach experientially instead
of what they were trained to do or they
being trained differently yeah you know
we what we have done at Northeastern
Karen is to focus on learning sciences
and to create a center that is building
the learning Sciences but also in like
whatever we do this is not only a
theoretical send center but also a
translation on center
so with that every educator is educated
in experiential learning is held its
coached and becomes part of the echo
system along these lines absolutely I'll
invite you Karen to do that but
essentially you know as I mentioned the
first aspect of experiential education
is not to have two separate endeavors in
any I'm teaching my material in the
classroom and then they go and they have
a six-month co-op or internship or
whatever it's how you are going to
integrate that in and that's what we
focus on the the integration of the two
so we have our learning specialists
working with our faculty colleagues and
at the same time the faculty colleagues
become the ones who are leading it
through their practice through and
through their fine tuning of that and I
have to tell you the students the
learners play a big role because once
they go spend six months in Shanghai or
Nepal and they come back and you talk
about the you know the discuss what's
happening in terms of the climate let's
say in Shanghai they can question you as
faculty because they they got out of
their comfort zone they lived it they
worked in it they shaped it and they
come back they question use and they did
and then you they get you out of the
comfort zone so it it means that in this
approach the learner is really at the
center because the learner is leading
the whole process so we you know for me
you know when I came to to Northeastern
this was an uneasy situation because I
had to learn and my best teachers were
the students because they lived it so
but I saw that the transformation on
impact because they came back knowing
exactly what they don't
to do what they want to do and how they
want to do which is and they got me to
understand this so we have the you know
this ecosystem is going to be helping
you at multiple levels through the
students the centers the colleagues and
every faculty is doing that you know you
know goes through this emotion if you
want that is transformative for us as
faculty I like to sort of perhaps leave
on there's a question that was sent in
and the question is knowing MIT as you
do what is your specific advice for the
Institute via V the conclusions in your
book and how best to rally the Institute
resources in that direct I have to be
careful Raffaele is it got failed is a
friend so let me I can you mention
something and it's going to be semi
controversial not fully EDX is a
peripheral operation at many levels if
you believe that lifelong learning has
to become part of the core mission you
have to your opportunity is to see how
you can lead the world by integrating an
EDX in MIT EDX is not MIT and that's
opportunity lifelong learning
if you agree that lifelong learning has
to become core and has to be fundamental
to what you do then that's there is a
way of rethinking EDX and rethinking the
whole operation how I will let my
colleagues here do it
that's a tough question and I think a
good one to leave the audience with so
please join me in thanking President
Joseph Aoun there's a terrific thank you
thank you David thank you for all for
being here and also I wanted to thank to
the MIT press and for the MIT Alumni
Association for putting all this
together for arranging it making this
happen thank you thank you thank you
David
here's a look at some authors recently
featured on book TVs afterwards our
weekly author interview program
progressive Policy Institute senior
fellow David Osborne examined the
charter school movement and offered his
outlook for the future of public
education Harvard University professor
Danielle Allen discussed how mass
incarceration has impacted her family
and radio host mark levin warned against
federal government expansion in the
coming weeks on afterwards investigative
journalist art Levine will report on the
mental health industry former radio host
and MSNBC contributor Charles Sykes will
offer his thoughts on the conservative
movement in America
Craig Shirley will discuss the life and
political career of Newt Gingrich and
this weekend on afterwards New York
Times magazine contributor Susie Hanson
reflects on her travels abroad and
weighs in on America's global standing
there's definitely that question of are
we exceptional but there is also just
the very question of why had I never
thought that this was a form of
propaganda that you know why had I not
sought to question where was this
concept coming from and what what what
was the job that it was doing for for
individual Americans and I think that
you know one thing that I was realizing
that this took a long time to realize in
fact is that the very language that we
used when we talked about foreign
countries had been kind of determined
for us a very long time ago because we
we tended to look at franker especially
Muslim countries and especially
countries in the East as were they
catching up with us or were they behind
us and what that does is that that
prevents you from being able to see the
country on its own terms
afterwards airs on book TV every
Saturday at 10:00 p.m. and Sunday at
9:00 p.m. Eastern you can watch all
previous afterwards programs on our web
site book TV org
let me talk about the just some a couple
of examples
I mentioned bad materials and one of the
prime examples is cell lines that
scientists use very commonly in
laboratories these are cells that grow
in plastic dishes in there and grow
perpetually and the very first of those
was actually featured in the the story
of Henrietta Lacks which is a wonderful
book and now also a TV movie that's just
out and she was a woman who was
diagnosed with cervical cancer and at
Johns Hopkins in 1951 they isolated some
cervical cancer cells from her and
turned it into the world's first set of
immortal cells this is a tremendously
useful line of cells to be used in
biomedical research they're used still
today you're still in labs around the
world but this also turned out to be
sort of the kudzu of of cell lines if
you will because these cells grow
incredibly rapidly and if you make a
small error in your lab before you know
it these these they're called HeLa cells
before you know it they're viewed or
throughout all of your cells and they
just take over and so scientists who
think they're studying liver cancer for
example in a liver cell will ultimately
maybe we hope realize that are they're
actually studying these HeLa cells and
this has been a huge problem for decades
scientists recognized this back in the
early 70s that these cells were taking
over and there was a lot of concern
about it a lot of hand-wringing and
honestly not very much was done in
starting about 15 years ago there were
actually some pretty good tests that
that could rapidly identify whether
these cells were in fact HeLa cells or
the cell that a scientist thought they
were using but those tests did not
really take off they are not used as
widely as they need to be so so there's
this is just one example they're 450
other examples of cell lines that are
misidentified that are used all the time
in in biomedical research labs and
scientists have these tools to check
them out but they cost some money
they're cost some convenient or
inconvenience and so these things don't
end up getting used these tests do not
get a ending being used as much as they
ought to be so so that's one source of
problem is these bad cell lines
a second thing I mentioned is bad
methods that get picked up scientists
design sometimes they design experiments
that are that don't really have enough
power to tell them what's going on and
some of the classic examples involve
mouse studies of ALS Lou Gehrig's
disease these studies have have led to a
lot of drugs and all of them have been
failures in this search for some
treatment for ALS and one of the main
problems I mean some of them are that
scientists don't didn't think very
thoroughly about what they needed to do
how many mice they needed to use but
also it's true that these these
experiments are quite expensive and to
do an experiment right you might take
dozens of mice for your study group and
dozens more for your control group that
costs could easily cost over a hundred
thousand dollars and many academic
scientists don't have that kind of money
so I say well I'll do 10 mice and I'll
you know and I'll call my results of
pilot study but and and you know they're
constrained by research</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
