are what does it all mean was it all
about
but in the context of science I'm
interested in what the world is made of
how the universe began where it's going
and what can we do while we're around
here and in my case that means studying
quantum mechanics the theory of how
things behave at their most fundamental
level and now 25 years ago I started
working on the problem of quantum
computing which was how atoms and
molecules photons elementary particles
process information at that point there
were only half a dozen people in the
world looking at this problem and now
there are thousands there goes the
neighborhood
so the devoman of any field that expands
by so much so rapidly there are now all
kinds of branches on this tree and
there's still the branches of the kind
of the fundamental questions of how we
understand the world in terms of how it
processes information interestingly
right now there has been resurgence of
interest in ideas of applying quantum
mechanics to ideas and quantum
information to ideas of quantum gravity
and what the fundamental theory of the
universe actually is turns out that
quantum information has a lot to offer
to people who are looking at problems of
for instance what happens when you fall
into a black hole and by the way my
advice is don't do that if you can help
it so if you fall into a black hole does
any information about you ever escape
from the black hole or not and these are
questions that people like Stephen
Hawking have been working on for decades
and it turns out that quantum
information has a lot to give to answer
these questions then there are a lot of
practical questions about understanding
what's going on
in nature for instance it's become clear
over the last decade that in
photosynthesis where particle blight
comes into us from the Sun is absorbed
by chlorophyll molecule the energy
rattles around inside a leaf gets turned
into more leaves photosynthesis is
operating in a very quantum mechanical
fashion and actually just exactly the
same kinds of models that we use to look
at quantum computation allow us to
understand what's happening in
photosynthesis turns out that the
photosynthetic plants and bacteria and
algae are extremely sophisticated in the
way they use quantum mechanics they they
use quantum coherence and funky effects
like entanglement to get very very high
efficiencies of energy transport
basically my motto about this is okay if
a little quantum hanky-panky will allow
you to reproduce a little faster then by
god you're going to use quantum
hanky-panky and it turns out that that
plants and bacteria and algae have been
using quantum hanky-panky for a billion
years to make their lives better
um so indeed what's happening in quantum
information in quantum computing is it
it's become more and more clear that
quantum information is kind of a
universal language for how nature
behaves a few years ago there was a
centerfold in physics today the journal
for physicists for the American Physical
Society now it wasn't a very sexy
centerfold it was a centerfold that had
all the different parts of physics like
you know high-energy physics and
solid-state physics string theory
mecan't physics of solid mechanics no
nano physics and right in the middle
they put quantum information and the
reason was that this centerfold showed
which parts of physics were talking with
with which other parts of physics so who
in this field was talking with this
other field and they had to put quantum
information right in the middle because
everybody was talking with the people in
quantum information
so you know so physical chemistry which
is or physical chemists are the people
who study photosynthesis all of a sudden
all the physical chemists were talking
with people like me and we were doing
experiments on you know plants and
bacteria now we're actually doing
artificial experiments where we try to
make artificial in our case they are
systems women and and virus made systems
that mimic the high efficiency of energy
transport and photosynthesis and in fact
by using ideas from quantum information
we've constructed systems that do much
much better than even the most efficient
naturally occurring system so and at the
same time as there are all these
theoretical developments there have been
major advances in how you build devices
that process information and building
quantum computers so there's a company
d-wave that builds these special-purpose
quantum computers that are not
general-purpose quantum computers that
could you know break codes and strike
fear into the heart of the NSA assuming
of course the NSA has a heart and these
systems are up and running and people
are buying them and trying to figure out
if they can solve hard problems faster
than classical computers the jury is out
on this question we don't know if they
can or not at the same time people
building superconducting systems and
systems made of atoms or ions and
optical systems have gotten much better
at building quantum computers so we
expect in the next five to ten years to
have quantum computers which are large
enough to do things no classical
computer could ever do so this is
actually a very exciting time in quantum
computation for coming up with stuff to
do with quantum computers there's am an
old idea was originally due to richard
fineman that you could use quantum
computers to simulate other quantum
systems kind of a quantum analog
computer and then I wrote the first
algorithms 25-year chart 20 years ago
with the first algorithms for how you
could program the quantum computers we
have now to actually explore how other
quantum systems behave and in the next
few years we're going to have devices
will allow us you know to build quantum
mechanical simulations of say what
happens inside a black hole we can look
at what these models actually do but a
few years ago some friends of mine and I
used a small quantum computer to
simulate what happens in the process of
time-travel because the theory of time
travel is intrinsically quantum
mechanical and if you want to find out
what happens when you send a photon a
few billionths of a second backwards in
time and have it tried to kill its
former self well we have an experiment
the test to see what happens when when
you do that actually may say that in
this case it's lucky that there's no
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
photons because uh a lot of photons died
in that experiment but it turned out the
one photon that tried to kill itself in
the past always failed because our
quantum theory of time travel shows that
you can't go back and do something self
contradictory in the past like kill your
former self one of the most fun
applications of quantum computing right
now
mirrors what's happening classical
computing so amongst the biggest
advances in classical computing these
days are programs for machine learning
to take computers and have them process
humongous amounts of data and figure out
what the patterns are the NSA uses us to
spy on us Google uses it to spy on us
Amazon uses it to spy on us everybody
uses on to spy on us well in in machine
learning it's no secret we live in an
era of big data
human beings are generating Avogadro's
number is worth of bits every every day
or so and so and companies like Google
and Amazon and Microsoft are processing
this data to try to find out every
aspect of their life so they can Stella
stuff and computers are getting very
good at processing data and finding
patterns in it so now quantum mechanical
systems have this feature that they can
generate patterns
that's very hard for any classical
system to generate and it also turns out
that quantum computers can actually
detect patterns that it's very hard for
any classical computer to generate too
sorry it also turns out that quantum
computers can detect and identify
patterns that are very hard for a
classical computer to detect so for
example if you have a huge data set like
you know the tick by tick history of all
the stocks on the Dow Jones for the last
50 years it's a big data set and you
want to say well I'd like to process
this to find out via what a good
portfolio would be for me if I can
tolerate a certain amount of risk and I
want to have a certain amount of return
well then with a pretty small quantum
computer the kind that we're going to
have in the next 5 years or so you could
actually find the answer to that
question much more accurately than you
could do on a classical computer so um
quantum computers work by storing and
processing information at the most
microscopic level so for instance if you
have an electron you could call electron
spinning up like this zero all electrons
spinning like that one and you could
call electrons spinning like that zero
and one at the same time which is the
primary feature of quantum computation a
bit quantum bit or qubit can be 0 and 1
at the same time and this is where
quantum computers gain their power over
classical computers so for the last 20
years or more my colleagues and I have
been working to build quantum computers
using electrons using particles of light
so you know a photon with its electric
field wiggling like that is 0 photon
with this electric field like that
wiggling is wiggling like that as 1 for
top of this electric field we're doing
like that is 0 &amp;amp; 1 at the same time so
we've been building these quantum
computers in quantum communication
systems I've been working I myself AM a
theorist so the experimentalist don't
like me to use a screwdriver in their
lab because I tend to break things but
I've been working closely with
experimentalist for more than two
decades now to build these devices they
started off small with a couple of
quantum bits but it turns out that just
having a handful of quantum bits is
enough to do good
demos of the kinds of ideas of quantum
computation and other quantum computers
are getting a lot bigger so now we have
tens of bits to have 50 bits and then
we'll have 500 bits because now there's
a clear path to how you build a larger
scale quantum computer or classical
computers famously obey Moore's law is
not a law of nature it's just an
observation about technological progress
with the number of the size of the
components and the computer gets smaller
by a factor of two every couple of years
the number of components doubles now
quantum computers haven't been obeying a
Moore's law the reason is that actually
to build quantum bits and to put them
together as a difficult process you're
operating at the most microscopic scale
it's tough to do you have to control
things very very precisely and but there
actually is a kind of a parallel Moore's
law that goes along with the ordinary
Moore's law in fact it's responsible for
this which is that as time goes on we're
getting better and better and better at
controlling things at very microscopic
scales and the same ability to control
thing is allowing us to make more and
more powerful quantum computers now our
quantum computers are still piddling
compared with a classical computer I
mean I remember I had a classical
computer that had 16 K of memory and you
know and and then a few years later was
64 K of memory and you know now it's now
it's like andra gigabytes of memory or a
terabyte of memory but uh quantum
computers have showed the stage where we
just have a small number of bits 10 bits
that we can use soon 50 bits that we can
use 100 quantum bits that we can use
still even though this is piddling by a
comparison with a classical computer
because quantum computers for specific
problems are so much more powerful than
classical computers this means it over
the next five to ten years once we get
up to something like you know few
hundred quantum bits which is going to
happen soon then we'll be able to solve
problems you couldn't solve on a
classical computer so what problems are
we going to solve
so a quantum computer with them say 500
quantum bits the kind we're going to see
soon around the corner would not be able
to factor large numbers break codes and
strike fear in the heart 'less NSA but
it would however be able to do some of
these problems for instance like quantum
machine learning finding patterns and
large amounts of data
last weekend I organized a conference on
quantum machine learning at nips this
gigantic machine learning conference in
Montreal and we're expecting a few dozen
people to show up and they're you know
150 people they could you couldn't get
into the room because people an ordinary
machine learning classical machine
learning are always on the lookout for
new ways of doing things and they were
very surprised to find that kinds of
machine learning problems like for
instance looking at the topology of
something figuring of the number of
holes in a piece of data you know
topology studies whether things have
holes or gaps or wards or connected
components these are features of the
world that people who are analyzing data
would really like to find but the
classical algorithms have do this while
effective are only effective on on you
know very small numbers of holes for
example because they just can't process
that data by contrast with a small
quantum computer even one with a few
hundred quantum bits you'd be able to
find complicated patterns and
topological systems like holes and gaps
and voids that you could never actually
find classically so that's a we've
really progressed to a new stage I mean
the first 20 years of quantum computing
were very interesting ideas from theory
establishing connections with other
branches of physics coming up with
different algorithms that you would love
to perform if you only had a quantum
computer that was big enough to perform
them and now we're on the brink of
having quantum computers that are big
enough to actually perform these kinds
of analyses do simulations of other
quantum systems of no class
system could do fine patterns and data
that no classical system could find so I
think it's going to be very exciting
time for quantum computation coming up
so yeah so who has quantum computers
right now well everybody's got quantum
computers you know over at MIT there are
you know five or six laboratories with
quantum computers sitting in them and
people are trying to expand them make
them bigger there are hundreds of groups
around the world that are building
quantum computers yeah so so these
quantum computers in these laboratories
are pretty interesting I mean they look
different according to what you're using
so for instance a superconducting
quantum computer whose quantum bits are
super current going forever around this
circuit in a clockwise fashion well
that's a zero and super current going
around the loop forever in a
counterclockwise fashion that's a 1 and
super current going around the loop in
both directions at once which is kind of
hard to imagine but that's what happens
that's 0 &amp;amp; 1 at the same time so they're
the actual devices themselves in the
guts of the quantum computer is a chip
it's a chip that's etched using
relatively conventional technologies in
which you H these little superconducting
circuits then the chip itself then is
connected to wires that come in from the
outside world because it's
superconducting it's got to sit inside a
helium dilution refrigerator 15,000th of
a degree above absolute zero so you've
got this big thing that sits there
looking like a beer keg going clickety
click click click because it cools it
down and then you talk to it using an
ordinary computer so you let's type on
your keyboard it sends signals under the
chip chip processes those signals and
then it does its weird quantum
mechanical thing to get the answers up I
mean these things are pretty large right
now because actually really just because
of the dilution refrigerator which
contains it you wouldn't want to put it
on your lap because it would squish you
there sufficiently compact that you
could actually just you know have them
sitting in your office if you like
for example there is a special-purpose
kind of quantum computer a quantum
annealer that's made by d-wave this is
actually a commercial device bandim a
number of people have bought them
Lockheed Martin has bought a d-wave
computer Google and NASA have bought
them the Army is buying some of them and
they're buying them because they're very
interesting devices nobody understands
exactly what's going on inside them
they're doing things that are quite
mysterious in their own quantum
mechanical way because being mysterious
is quantum mechanical thing and people
are buying them to put them through
their paces to see if maybe you could
solve some hard problems on them that
you couldn't solve on a classical device
these devices this this d-wave device is
actually based on a on a couple of
papers that my graduate student bill
Kaminski and i wrote in 2002 and we said
hey you could like take a
superconducting chip you could make a
quantum annealer on it the special
purpose quantum computer and here's how
you do it and we then didn't patent it
because we were idiots
what could I say well we didn't patent
it because we actually knew from a
simple analysis of our theory that that
this device wouldn't operate in the way
that you wanted it to operate which is
staying in its lowest energy state
throughout the computation so like fools
we didn't patent it the wave went along
and built it they admit this freely why
shouldn't they there's no patent and on
then when they built it it was indeed
true that it didn't behave in the way
that you wanted it behaved staying in
the lowest energy state throughout the
computation got excited to higher energy
levels but it still stalls the hard
problems why is this nobody knows so
I've been working with the folks at D
wave to try to figure out why are they
successful when they shouldn't be and
ever since then I patent everything by
the way even if I know whether it's
going to work or not so another fun kind
of quantum computer our quantum
computers that rely on quantum optics on
light now for many years these devices
were massive because basically they
consisted of a bunch of lasers big
lasers sitting on an optical table
covered with a million mirrors carefully
aligned by graduate students to so that
all the beams of light were going in
just the right fashion and now there's
been a really amazing development in in
this particular field because based on
techniques from telecommunications
people now can put the whole thing on a
chip so you take an optical table the
size of a football field and you can pop
the entire thing miniaturize it and pop
the entire thing on a little chip this
big and then the chip is etched with the
lines of silicon and the photons go
zooming along these little lines bounce
into each other bounce all around
interact with each other and then come
out the other side
so these are great devices and very fun
to play with um one of the funky things
about these devices is it's become clear
over the last five or six years that
even in some throw in some sense these
devices should be very simple it's just
light moving through a chip you know
photons bouncing off mirrors and
interacting with each other that their
behavior can be very mysterious
if you send you know 20 photons into
these little ports going into the chip
and you ask well what's the probability
that they come out of these twenty other
ports coming out of the chip this turns
out to be extremely hard to calculate it
classically nobody knows how to do it
yet this chip can just do it
automatically it can generate patterns
who's who's these patterns nobody knows
how you could possibly generate them on
a classical computer if they have some
kind of weird quantum feature that we
can't generate just use even using the
world's largest classical supercomputers
one possibility for such devices for
learning for instances a common feature
of machine learning is a view of a
device that can generate certain set of
patterns then it can also recognize the
same set of patterns so right now we're
working on an experiment to try to see
if we can make this happen can we have
the patterns that are generated by one
of these chips and then train another
chip to recognize a set of patterns if
we can do that then we'll
trained a quantum device to recognize
patterns that couldn't possibly be
generated or recognized by a classical
computer yeah we don't know we don't
these patterns are so weird you know you
look at them and they're of course
because they can't be generated by any
kind of classical object they're like
nothing you've ever seen before by
definition in addition to having these
funky patterns that we have no idea what
they are what they would be like how you
generate them classically then quantum
computers could you know do ordinary
machine learning kinds of tasks like
just recognizing large-scale patterns
and data the kind of everyday thing that
we now use all the time things like
facial recognition voice recognition
character recognition finding hidden
patterns and data so trying to figure
out for instance a very important
question if you're investing in the
stock market is is there some hidden
dynamics that's driving all the stocks
together in some pattern if you knew
what that dynamics was then you could
make a lot of money and the quantum
computer could could find such patterns
much more efficiently than a classical
computer could so there plenty of kinds
of ordinary kinds of problems were a
quantum computer even a very small one
with a few hundred quantum bits could
actually do things that a classical
computer couldn't and then they're the
crazier things like these patterns you
know that are generated these by these
devices that are never generated
classically I don't know what these
patterns are good for in terms of
recognizing them but they are very
useful in terms of problems that involve
cryptographic applications for example
just encoding information in ways that
nobody can actually decode because if
you take your information you put it
into one of these patterns you know you
put it together with one of these
patterns that nobody didn't can decode
than by gum nobody can decrypt your
information yeah it's it's useful to
compare the current state of quantum
computation and what's been going on
with the last 20 years with what
happened with digital computers over
their first 20 years so the idea of
building a digital computer was proposed
in the mid 1930s by Claude Shannon
annexes part of his master's thesis at
Harvard was a very influential master's
thesis by Konrad Zuse in and in Germany
and the first devices started to be
built them effectively in fact during
the Second World War and by the mid
1950s then people had these gigantic
extremely expensive devices there were
very few of them they cost a lot to
build it was a huge effort for a very
small number of bits they break down all
the time so the idea of building a
quantum computer was something that I
proposed in 1993 and quite soon after
that people started building simple
quantum computers and it's been tough to
do just in the same way the first 20
years of building classical computers
was tough and now we're at the stage
where we have these quantum computers
that fill rooms and have you know lab
technicians and white posts tending to
them they're hard to operate they break
down and they still only have you know a
few tens of quantum bits
although of course we're making progress
um andum so so what's interesting about
this is you know there is with computers
there is this if you build it they will
come
so the I have many senior colleagues at
MIT who were participants in this early
days of computation people like you know
like Marvin Minsky Gallagher so and
these when they tell me about you know
the good old days first they're fond of
doing one thing that comes across was
the origins of computer science in the
1950s was tremendously exciting and
there was a huge change as soon as they
actually had a device that they could
run their algorithm so on even a device
that was you know a huge device
physically but incredibly weak and puny
by the compare
with today's standards so pretty much as
soon as people had developed the first
computers where they could actually run
programs on within a few years
these pioneer computer scientists wasn't
even called computer science at that
point they'd actually developed many of
the most powerful methods that we know
today things like Monte Carlo simplex
algorithm all these algorithms of people
are now used for everything it was a
tremendously exciting time and it was
exciting because all of a sudden these
really smart people who'd been kind of
working in the realm of theory had a toy
they could play with and very fast they
came up with a huge number of fun games
that they could play with this toy good
pretty expensive toy but there were a
lot of fun games they could play on that
the field of quantum computing is in
that stage right now we have these toys
these you know simple or complex not so
powerful quantum computers but we can
play games on that and we can try out
the things that people come up with and
we can see what happens and people are
coming up with very fun games as a
result the field of quantum computing is
tremendously exciting for someone like
me because it's full of young people
with fantastic ideas some of the most
brilliant young scientists I know in the
world have gravitated to this field
because it's fun you can play awesome
games the questions are big there you
can ask questions about you know the
nature of the universe you can ask
questions about you know can I recognize
a scroll 5 or 7 but then you can
actually work with people as you can say
hey I've got this idea can we try it out
and you know we walk down the hallway at
MIT and somebody says yes we can try
that out let's see what happens so the
field of quantum computing right now is
a tremendously enjoyable place to be
just from the point of view of
intellectual play and you know I've fir
meant for for me it's great because I
get to work with these people who are
hackable
smarter than I am and that is a lot of
fun to thinking about the future of
quantum computing you know I have no
idea if if we're going to have a quantum
computer in every smartphone we have
quantum apps for class it would allow us
to communicate securely and find funky
stuff using our quantum computers that's
a tall order I think it very likely that
we're going to have quantum micro
processors in our computers and smart
phones that are performing specific
tasks this is simply for the reason that
this is where the actual technology
inside our devices is heading anyway and
if there are advantages to be had from
quantum mechanics then we'll take
advantage of them just in the same way
that you know in photosynthesis the
stuff you know the energy is moving
around in the quantum mechanical kind of
way and if their advantages to be had
from some quantum hanky-panky then you
know quantum hanky-panky it is so of
course it does you want to always ask
for these technologies is it really
worth it right you know is the internet
worth it yeah probably it is on the
other hand there's a you know there's a
huge amount of stuff that's not worth it
on the Internet
is it a great thing to have a smart
phone sure on certain occasions it is a
lot of time it's just a distraction
however that prevents you from paying
attention to what's going on around you
makes you run into lampposts while
you're texting as a professor at MIT and
I'm a professor of mechanical
engineering quantum mechanical
engineering I'm exposed to novel
technologies all the time most of them
you know super cool technologies that
will never be turned into something that
people will be used but they're super
cool nonetheless and the strategy I've
learned with this is you know there's a
huge number of technologies out there
and you just don't have to adapt them
you have to or adopt them you don't have
to adopt these technologies you you can
you don't have to use it you can use the
ones that you like you cannot use the
ones that you don't like so for example
you know I actually I don't use Facebook
or Twitter or
or other social media because I feel
that you know there's there's there's
there's presence and then there's
absence and then there's cyber presence
and cyber presence is a heck of a lot
closer to absence that it is to actual
presence similarly when I look at you
know my parents and their friends they
have friends who are people whom they go
and visit they go stay overnight they
have dinner together they talk with them
and you know that's what a friend is and
maybe some of your friends on Facebook
are friends like this but probably not
most so I think you know most of the
things that make human life life rich
and rewarding are just about being human
and not about technologies no if we're
lucky we can find a technology that
helps us understand what's going on
better or useful for certain purposes
and that's great we should use those of
course a lot of these technologies get
used for you know for bad sloppy
annoying purposes as well in general I
would say that you know that the that if
we're lucky with the technology if you
like here are the good things here are
the bad things and the average is just a
little better than you know zero that's
good technology is not neutral I mean in
fact one of the primary uses of
technology just very naturally in the
way that the economy works is that
wealthy and powerful corporations use
technology to exploit ordinary people um
there's some I've experienced this a lot
of just into my own job you know when I
I started off as a scientist I you know
I I I would write by - most of my time
calculating by hand and you know writing
formulas on blackboards and what I
wanted to write a paper I would maybe
type it up or write it out by hand and I
I'd give it to someone who would type it
and then it would go to a journal and
there'd be a typesetter at the journal
the journal would type in a very skilled
job to typeset scientific equations the
jour the typesetter would sites up these
taught scientific equations and now what
happens is when I submit a paper to the
journal I have to typeset it myself I
mean this very nice program called tack
relay tech that allow
to to typeset scientific equations but
it takes a lot of work I'm spending a
lot more time right enough to write a
paper I spend a lot more time than I did
in the past and a bunch of other people
lost their jobs yeah well this is you
know this is and one of the very natural
things about technology is that that
this at the same time it takes make some
jobs more efficient and easier to do it
means that the people are actually doing
them end up having more work because you
know your employer is making you do more
stuff and then there a bunch of other
people out there who are out of a job so
it's not technology is not neutral and I
mean it can make things more efficient
but it doesn't necessarily make our
lives easier or better fact it often
makes a lot of us work a lot harder
which I object to well I just I I find
its easiest to tell people the truth
about what's going on and that's good
for them too there are a number of
fortune 500 companies that are investing
heavily in quantum computing iBM has
always been heavily invested in quantum
computing Microsoft Google now Intel is
investing and is making a very
significant investment in quantum
computing NEC in Japan as a big
investment in quantum computing so there
are quite a few companies that have
decided they want to invest in in this
field and know when they ask me ok you
know are we going to have a quantum
computer that we can build and sell to
people soon I say well maybe not though
actually were much closer now and in
fact I think it quite likely with these
new advances and the technology is
particularly of things like
superconducting quantum computing and
atom optical quantum computing that we
will have quantum computers that people
can build and they might be able to sell
but there's um I think a very good
reason for such a company a company like
Google or IBM or Microsoft or Intel to
invest in quantum computing and that is
this is a technology that has tremendous
promise even though at the moment it's
not something that you know is
incorporated in everyday smartphone and
the reason has to do with the nature of
computing in general and when people
first built these humongous computers
you know the size of a gymnasium and put
them in gymnasiums they really didn't
have the slightest clue about what
computers would be used for and um and
they were thinking I will do it you know
to analyze things like shell
trajectories you know some material
properties and things like this but one
thing that that we've all experienced
over the last few decades is that
computers can do things that you would
never thought they would been able to do
and moreover information processing
technologies have exploded in a way that
nobody would ever have expected so now
it really doesn't make sense to just
talk about computers because everything
is computing I mean your smartphone is a
tremendously powerful computer your car
engine contains you know 20 to 50 micro
processors that are computing way all
the time
and this is the secret for actually
getting much better fuel efficiency with
pollution controls etc it also turns out
to be the secret to cheating on
pollution controls so computation is
present and information processing is in
present in a huge number of devices and
you know it's this notion that that
almost anything you touch is capable of
processing information in a
sophisticated fashion this is now a
commonplace so so if you're a company
that deals with questions of information
processing then it's very important for
you to know what's going on so places
like for instance IBM's very long term
investment quantum computing they've
been strongly invested in quantum
computing from the beginning basically
for more than two decades that comes
because they had very good people who
were amongst the founders of the field
who were developing in Laughlin Darin
Charlie Bennett and it was clear that
that really amazing things would come
out of this so it's not like they're
investing you know a billion dollars in
quantum computing but they're investing
tens of millions of dollars a year I
don't know what their actual investment
and as a result they have some of the
best and brightest people who were in
the world who were working with them who
are coming up with the ideas who know
what's going on who are playing with
their own quantum computers at their
building the same is true of all these
other companies there are fantastic
places for young people to work again
there are some of the main places where
new ideas are being developed DARPA has
always had a close relationship with
with quantum information processing by
its very nature program managers at
DARPA are always wanting to you know hit
it out of the park and it's been clear
from the beginning the quantum computing
is a potentially technology where you
could hit it out of the park I was part
of the I was a co principal investigator
on the first the first quantum computing
grant from the government which came
from DARPA back in 1994 Jeff Kimball was
a leader of this group and you know
they've DARPA realized right away this
is something that they could look at and
in fact over the last 20 years there
have been a wide variety of programs of
DARPA
investigating different aspects of
quantum computation many of them very
successful I think a lot of the the
fundamental advances in quantum
computing have ended up being funded by
DARPA in one form or another it's not
always you know as usual with DARPA this
is I regard this is a good thing I'm not
sure if the head of DARPA regards is a
good thing
frequently what ends up being developed
by a particular program is not what they
set out to do in the beginning and it
but it turns out that there's some
spin-off that comes out of this program
that is tremendously powerful
for example DARPA was the first funding
agency to recognize that this role of
quantum mechanics and photosynthesis was
a very important thing and they created
the first program to fund looking at
funky effects like quantum coherence and
entanglement in photosynthesis and an
energy transport it was a very
successful program that had wonderful
results for men and you know right now
with the some of the spin-offs that came
off that I'm working on right now are
these man and woman and virus made
systems that are much more efficient in
their energy transport than anything
that's found in nature so yeah I mean
DARPA has a finger of his fingers and
many pies and it's got its fingers and
many quantum pies and it's been part of
developing many of the offender
fundamental ideas in quantum computing
and in fact when I are spun off of DARPA
I are Paul has also taken a major role
in investing in the forefront of quantum
information processing because it's
growing so rapidly because it has impact
on so many other fields there are now a
lot of subfields in quantum computation
and quantum information processing there
are the techie guys who are building
quantum computers and of these are some
really remarkable people out there in
superconducting quantum computers John
Martinez who has just been hired by
Google my colleague will Oliver at MIT
the group at Delft then there are people
who are looking at wild-eyed and crazy
ideas about what kinds of new quantum
algorithms you could come up with Scott
Aaronson my colleague at MIT the famous
blog poster on gentle optimized his he
is a he has a remarkable set of ideas
and he and his colleagues are mapping
out the set of questions that you might
be able to solve on quantum computers
and doing a wonderful job in doing in
one of the most successful and powerful
types of devices you can make for to
build a quantum computer on earth using
ion traps where you take a bunch of ions
atoms you strip electrons off you trap
them in a little trap zap them with
lasers my colleague Chris Monroe at
University of Maryland as a pioneer in
this field
reiner blot at the University of
Innsbruck has done amazing things on
this my colleague Ike Shuang at MIT -
has done have made lots of progress on
building these devices then I always my
favorite part about quantum information
is the kind of wild and crazy stuff
where we say hey let's understand how
the universe is made and how its put
together from thinking about it in terms
of a lot of information so thinking
about quantum gravity which something
nobody understands in terms of quantum
information is something I've been doing
now for fifteen or twenty years and now
there are quite a few people working on
this it's quite fun um John Prescott at
a senior people include John Prescott at
UH at Caltech and Alexey Kataya
for who's a MacArthur prize winner
they're both brilliant people making
great strides in this regard what as I
said one of the things that
characterizes the field of quantum
information is the is the tremendous
quality amongst the younger researchers
in the field
Patrick Hayden who's just been hired at
Stanford exactly to look at questions of
you know quantum mechanics in quantum
gravity on a Bryan Swingle who came up
with one of the main connections between
quantum gravity and quantum information
when he was a graduate student at MIT
almost lonesome let's face it the guy is
brilliant what can I say China is a bit
of a late comer to the quantum
information game though they have about
four years ago they established an
Institute for looking at quantum
computing at Ching Wong and this is an
excellent Institute and they they're
doing great things and there have always
been some wonderful individual
experimentalists in China doing quantum
information like pong for example
Singapore has an amazing program in
quantum information processing at the
National University of Singapore it's
one of the leaders in the field there
are many fantastic researchers in Japan
on quantum information my colleague yes
or no vote excuse me my colleague
yasunobu Nakamura and groups at Tokyo
Institute of Technology and he sees had
always
a great group there and there are many
great people there the largest group of
collection of people you know
concentration of people working on
quantum computation are actually in
Canada at the Institute for quantum
computing in Waterloo where Mike
Lazaridis the founder of black brewery
has donated hundreds of millions of
dollars to as seed funds to create a
remarkable group of researchers of
headed by Ramon Laflamme and this is in
some sense the you know this is the the
biggest concentration in the world these
days you know there many fantastic
quantum groups in Europe the University
of Vienna has amazing people on tons
Islanders haven't been there for a long
time for the fall term they're the
Oxford and Cambridge have great programs
with blood-covered all at Oxford which
for josa
Cambridge oh and of course David Deutsch
at Oxford is you know founder of the
field though it's difficult to see him
because he only goes out at night yeah
yeah I I've had many conversations with
David Deutsch over the years one of the
most fun conversations was when I was
running a session at a conference at MIT
and David was appearing by a video lake
and I was in this gigantic auditorium
with a 40-foot tall screen in front of
me and I was seated in the front row of
the auditorium and David's 40 foot Paul
head was talking to me from the screen
there was nobody else in the room and we
were just talking about physics it was
like talking with The Wizard of Oz David
is a brilliant person and a deep thinker
I don't really need to say but it but it
is true you know he he was the first
person to realize that that quantum
computers could do something really
fundamental that possible computers
couldn't and it's interesting he
realized they're simply in the mid-1980s
and it took him a long time actually to
come up with an example of something
where a quantum computer could do better
um he had this intuition
he came up with the kind of formal
notion of quant computer but for about
more than five years or so he couldn't
come up with a night something work do
better and then when he finally came up
with something he showed well here's
something where a a classical computer
takes two or three steps on average to
do this problem and a quantum computer
can do it in one so even that wasn't you
know it was in advance but it wasn't you
know a problem that anybody would like
to solve but he was so fixed on the idea
of coming up with the idea and figuring
out what you could do that in the end he
kind of by sheer force of intellect and
willpower brought the community around
to realize this was an important thing
and then so other people started working
on this and coming up with ideas that
could be more useful
the quantum Fourier transform defines
periods and functions and then Peter
shor uses to come up with his famous
algorithm for factoring numbers and
breaking comets and then it was off to
the races now during the last two
decades since in the kind of you know
the Renaissance of want of computing
since Shor's algorithm in 1994 you know
it's gone from a half-dozen people in
the field to thousands of people in the
field working on a vast variety of
things during this entire time
david has you know stuck by his own
lights and he's continued to work on
what he regards as the most important
things for the last 10 years he's been
working on what he calls a quantum
constructor theory where so far as I can
tell and I can't say that I understand
it very well he's trying to derive the
varied nature of reality from ideas
based on quantum computing
I bet wish him good luck in doing so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
