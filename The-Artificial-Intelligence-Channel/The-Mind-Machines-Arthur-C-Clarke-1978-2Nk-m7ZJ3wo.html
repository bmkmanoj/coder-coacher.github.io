a sense creating our own successors we
have seen the first crude beginnings of
artificial intelligence it doesn't
really exist yet any level because our
most complex computers are still morons
high speed morons were still morons
nevertheless some of them are capable of
learning and we will one day be able to
design systems that can go on improving
themself themselves so that at that
stage we have the possibility of
machines which can outpace their
creators and therefore become more
intelligent than us artificial
intelligence a machine beyond the mind
of man it's science fiction but is it
also expected
chess for centuries a test of the human
intellect but these men are merely
observers in August 1977 16 computer
programs competed against each other in
the second world computer Chess
Championship is install check their air
vents we pull the jack the best programs
here can defeat 95% of all serious human
players the crowd tonight is absolutely
phenomenal I've never seen a crowd like
this before at the computer chess
tournament and they're certainly about
twice as many people here as there we go
to watch the US Open Championship or the
United States close championship even
when Fischer was playing I think that
probably most of you are having a good
laugh tonight we are here out of
curiosity but in a few years time you'll
be here because these programs are
playing better than the market and
grandmasters and US Championships the
favorite Northwestern University's chess
four-point-six is playing a program from
Bell Labs now we have known director
King ruck 7 linked by telephone to a
computer in Minneapolis just four point
six quickly examines a vast number of
possible Monday 8:00 until the style of
play is distinctly not you
as we have a move rook the rook 3 rather
than the judgment intuition and insight
characteristic of human champions speed
is the secret of success late in one we
have a move seem to work one
thank the bishop seven made and
therefore one pick without killing me
will computers ever think like people it
is a question that goes beyond chips a
central fact about computers is that
computers are prodigious calculators
they can solve huge systems of
differential equations and Ferg very
large matrices and other such
mathematical things in my view there's
an enormous difference between judgment
and calculation it is it is that gap the
difference between judgment and
calculations that that computers can't
can't cost from the beginning of time to
have always been people telling you that
this or that boundary line is a sacred
one and can never be crossed that it
would be never never be possible for
example to for scientist to simulate or
synthesize the basis of life not very
long ago the first complete gene was
synthesized in the laboratory
it's the vitalist attitude of
uncrossable frontiers is behind the
question of whether there are human
mental abilities which could never be
simulated I personally see no more
reason now to be discouraged by this
vaguely expressed feeling than
scientists have been in the past it is a
computer scientist kill Weizenbaum who
was now the most outspoken critic of
artificial intelligence his own program
called doctor gave rise to his first
dumps
the program parodies a psychiatric
interview the patient here Weizenbaum
typed in a complaint and the program in
the role of psychiatrist responds the
program became a plaything at MIT people
told it the most intimate personal
details as if they believed the program
could understand but in fact the program
doesn't understand anything I would deny
that that there's any important sense
non-negligible sense in which the
program understands it certainly creates
the illusion of understanding there's no
question about that but it but but we
have to understand that that illusion is
an attribution that the person
conversing with the program contributes
to the conversation it's not it's not a
function of the program itself the
program simply detects key phrases and
makes routine transformations such as
turning the word I into you when it
doesn't recognize anything it responds
automatically please go on
Weizenbaum was shocked when people began
to confide in the program acting as if
it really were a psychiatrist but it was
when colleagues began to suggest that
programs like doctor could be used as
substitutes for human psychiatrists and
treating real patients that
disillusioned set in there can be no
question that the response the responses
that I noticed with respect to the
doctor program particularly the idea
that this could be the dawn of automatic
psychiatry that machines could perform
psychiatry at all and so on that these
awoken me questions that apply it more
generally to how the physical
intelligence then merely do these kinds
of conversational programs is the
computer just a calculator or is it
capable of judgment is it only a number
cruncher or can it match the human mind
like us the computer has a memory where
its knowledge is stored its tiny
circuits hold billions of pieces of
information the circuits understand only
one thing the presence or absence of
electrical signals that means all
information must be put in on-off turns
so the memory or knowledge base is like
a maze of lights come on come on like
the dots and dashes of Morse code the
arrangement of the lights can represent
numbers letters even words this
particular knowledge base contains
information about television programs it
shows for example that Sesame Street is
an educational series for children like
an index it defines relationships among
the separate pieces of information it is
by means of a computer program that the
knowledge can be used
written is a series of simple steps the
program can retrieve facts and answer
questions about the information in the
knowledgebase it does this by issuing
instructions to the part of the computer
that performs calculations to the
circuits which move pieces of
information around and compare them
these are simple basic operations and
the program combines them in the most
effective way as an example we ask it if
there are any science documentaries and
television the question is translated
into the machines on/off code then
matched against the knowledge base step
by step the program directs the search
for an answer
step 1 it scans the category list it
locates documentary which reveals more
than one documentary program as a
possible solution step 2
it looks for science and the match is
made Nova is the only program with
arrows linking it to both documentary
and science step 3
it writes the answer even with a
knowledge base a million times larger in
reality this process would have taken a
fraction of a second it is undeniably
mechanical but proponents of artificial
intelligence argue that the fundamental
processes of human brain cells are just
as mechanical as with a computer it is
their combination the program that
counts
in matters of memory and calculation
machines easily outpaced the mind but
that's only a small part of human
intelligence the results of the first
few experiments in artificial
intelligence surprised everyone because
it turned out that relatively small
programs were able to do things that
everybody had thought would require a
lot more intelligence for example some
of the early programs would be able to
play a fairly good game of chess or to
solve pretty hard problems in college
calculus well everybody knows that those
things require very advanced
intelligence but it was much harder to
get the program's to answer simple
questions in ordinary language the kinds
of things that any child can do to solve
simple everyday common-sense problems we
take common sense for granted but there
is knowledge and understanding behind
even the simplest activity
artificial intelligence is based on the
faith that there are rules underlying
every aspect of human life rules which
can be uncovered turned into programs
and given to machines
but do such rules really exist that's
the interesting question why don't we
just tell the computer everything that
there is to say about our everyday form
of life it's because our everyday form
of life it's so pervasive and so much
something that we embody not something
that we know that there wouldn't be any
way of telling it's not a bunch of facts
any more than somebody who knows how to
swim
knows the rules for swimming we don't
know the rules for being a human being
or the rules for how to move and stand
up
we just embody those rules it's it Yates
said something very relevant to this he
said that we can embody the truth but we
cannot know it we have to know it to be
able to tell a computer what it was to
be a human being were the only
difference between us and those critics
is that they think it's impossible and
you can't understand it and we think
that you possibly can what makes up
common sense intelligence one important
aspect is certainly language Stanford
University's Terry Winograd wrote a
program to converse in everyday English
this is a program that I wrote in order
to experiment with language
understanding by computer but I wanted
is a world which the computer could talk
about so that while it was understanding
sentences it would actually be doing
something with what was being said you
can see there's a set of objects and
simple toy blocks and pyramids and a box
and a kind of a hand that can move them
around let me give it a simple command I
can type pick up a big red block and the
sentence appears you can see and it
analyzes what it is that I'm asking and
then plans a sequence of commands to
carry it out the program has no
intrinsic knowledge about the blocks
world so Terry Winograd has filled its
knowledge base with facts about the
objects that contains their properties
and their relationships to each other
it's by correctly carrying out his
commands that the program proves it
understands English but even in this
limited world the process of
understanding a command is no simple
matter when I type a command like this
it has to go through several different
phases of analysis first it needs to
look up the words in a dictionary it has
and figure out the structure of the
sentence the kinds of things you in
grammar school the subject the verb the
object then need to analyze the meaning
of that end in this context which
involves converting from the specific
words to a set of concepts that it has
about the blocks world what the objects
are what you can do with them what the
colors are and so on so that it can then
use that to construct a program for
tearing out the action and finally there
has to be a kind of a reasoning system
which reasons about the actions in order
to know what has to be done to actually
carry them out in that first one for
example it couldn't just go pick up the
big red block it needs to clear it off
first and there's a whole set of
programs which deal with what you need
to do in order to manipulate objects in
this kind of a simple world
in addition to knowing the rules of the
blocks world the program has to master
the rules of language which are not
always so clear cut the program really
didn't focus on moving these blocks
it's basically concerned with the ways
in which people use language to
communicate so if for example I type a
command like grass without pyramid
even though that makes sense in terms of
the basic ideas of the what's in the
blocks world in this context it doesn't
because there's three different pyramids
there on the screen and I wouldn't use a
phrase like about pyramid unless I had a
particular one in mind so the computer
answers I don't understand which pyramid
you mean since it has no way in this
context of knowing which of those three
I intended I can give it a much more
complicated command like find the block
which is caller than the one you are
holding and put it into the box in this
case it needs to do a whole set of
things one of which is figure out what
is meant by words like one and hit we
use those in normal everyday language in
a way which has to be interpreted by
looking at the context in which they
appears in this case it types back out
by it I assume you mean a block which is
taller than the one I am holding which
is only one of several possible things I
could have meant and needed to use a set
of rules of thumb about how people use
words like that in order to decide in
this case which one I intended as
skillful as it is in handling the
imprecision and ambiguity of English if
you talk to Terry Winograd program about
anything but blocks it would be
incapable of responding so language
cannot be understood in a vacuum like us
a computer must know what it's talking
about by trying to program a computer to
use language we're forced into looking
in a very clear way at what it is that
people do when they use language in the
same way we're forced to make very
explicit things which seem so natural
that people who don't look at language
in this way don't even think they need
explaining and one of the things that
we've learned from writing programs like
this is the complexity of the way people
understand language the kinds of
connections there are between using your
knowledge about what's being talked
about and your knowledge of language the
fact that you can't study language in a
kind of stepper
isolated way in which you look at
grammar and dictionary meanings and
content but that really needs to be
integrated into a much more coherent
kind of theory if language and knowledge
of the world cannot be separated how do
children acquire language one theory is
that even before they learn to talk
children accumulate a detailed knowledge
of routine experiences called a script
later they drawn these scripts as a
basis for language and conversation
observing the children that Yale
University is Roger shank who contends
that computers can learn to communicate
in much the same way he writes computer
programs that can understand stories
like this one it's simple even for a
child but surprisingly difficult for a
computer
well the main problem is that our
computers don't have knowledge they can
do certain operations but they don't
know things and if you want to tell a
story to somebody and talk about
something to somebody if they don't have
the same knowledge that you have they
can't understand what you're talking
about essentially it's like an expert
talking to somebody very naive it
wouldn't be able to negate very much so
what we have in this computer program is
the problem of giving it knowledge so if
we want to tell its stories what goes on
a restaurant well it better know about
restaurants and what they're for and
what goes on and them so it can sort of
fill in the blanks of what I didn't say
if people had to say every single piece
of information that ever happened that
little three line story about
restaurants would take hundreds and
hundreds of lines because there are
assumptions that we share because as
humans having been in restaurants know
that what goes on in them shrank
believes that the programmer can
compensate for the computer's lack of
experience by spelling out exactly what
goes on in a given situation
in other words by providing the computer
with a script in this case for a
restaurant a script is in fact knowledge
about the world it is an attempt to
codify the kind of knowledge that humans
have about situations in a precise form
such that we can give it to a machine
you can't just say restaurants and tell
it about restaurants in some very vague
fashion we have to give it a
explicit list essentially if this
happens in restaurant and then this and
then this in a bit so for example what
we have here at the restaurant script
and it has at the beginning some
preconditions which says the person who
eating has to have some money and has to
be hungry in order for me to go into it
and then he enters and it has an
entering scene answering scene says he
goes to the restaurant and just the
restaurant he looks around
he's even go to a table goes to the
table and he sits down this is followed
by a scene where the waiter gives him a
menu and the customer reads the menu and
enables ordering and where the customer
tells the waiter what he want this
enables the cook to prepare the meal and
eventually the waiter will give the meal
to the person who's ordered it well you
will then eat it
he will then get a check and go give him
some money to the management to leave
the restaurant the program analyzes the
restaurant story and fits it into the
script the stars show that the first
sentence John went to a restaurant has
been matched the program then works on
the second sentence of the story he
ordered lobster until it too is matched
but it's the final sentence that holds
the key to this simple story
well offenses he paid the check and left
by that I mean he'll say ok he paid the
check and he left and that's the end of
my restaurant script so everything in
the middle must have happened and so we
go goes back and traces between ordered
where we're at the last place we saw the
stars particularly told about and the
new park which is the paying money to
the management and the leaving so the
stars are now and it says oh well what
must have happened is the cook must have
prepared this Lobster and he must have
given it to the waiter and the waiter
must have given it to the person and the
person must have decided to eat it and
then the person must have eaten it and
so our program essentially is capable of
making all those inferences and in this
case have made all those inferences
because it understood the important
facts that surrounded the main event but
in the story the main event was never
really stated the program was told only
the john ordered lobster but what did he
eat
shank asked the program and the program
says obstacle no we didn't say that
actually the story never specifically
said anything about eating at all but
the program has no trouble with it any
more than a person
because it had in fact understand so I
think we have to be clear about the fact
that language understanding involves
very very much more than the mere
comprehension of a string of words
silences for example are very very
important if people are understanding
what is meant by emotional kinds of
statements or pauses or metaphors or or
whatever these AI critics think is is so
difficult I like to understand how they
explain that people can understand them
people have some method of doing it even
the most ordinary linguistic intercourse
among people involves shared experiences
and the fundamental difficulty with
computer understanding of language is
that there are human experiences
uniquely human experiences which the
computer by its by the its very nature
in virtue of its structure in virtue of
the difference between its structure the
biological structure and needs and so on
of human beings can simply not share
communication that involves sharing well
but shared experience that you could
make the same argue that computer
couldn't understand anything about a
restaurant that has never been in a
restaurant I think that whatever the
shared experience is you have some some
rule for accessing at you if you have a
rules as well I remember feeling that
when I was in love then I felt this way
well I can write that and then I did
this I can write that same rule into a
computer program whenever you see
something about love you can assume that
the person talking might feel this way
and might do this it's just a question
of understanding what people think they
know and think they are understanding in
a situation
forward forward if a shank believes
man and machine will have something to
talk about how will they actually
converse Michael Condon is paralyzed

back
Hauk in 1986 this vehicle is to make its
way through the barren landscape of mars
as the representative of earthbound
explorers the rover embodies another
aspect of common sense intelligence the
coordination of mobility and vision it
has a laser rangefinder and two
television cameras they detect a rock
shown in pink and its shadow in red the
rover has been told to cross the room
its computer plots a path to get there
which avoids the obstacles observed by
NASA scientist Bob Cunningham the rover
moves
on Mars it will cover 20 miles a day to
collect samples of rock and soil
here two will pick up a sample from this
group of five rocks the visual
information is conveyed through the
television cameras to the computer a
slightly different view in each eye the
rock in the center is the target the
computer works out its rough size shape
and distance then the arm goes into
motion with the computer guiding its
every step keeping track of where all of
the seven joints are in relation to each
other and the goal
at the end of the hand are tiny sensors
that control the final approach when the
position must be computed exactly
the hand picks up the rock but not just
to store it away
people on earth will want to know what
the Rovers discovered so it will show
off its samples
but during its mission the rover will be
in contact with earth less than an hour
a day scientists now cannot prepare it
for every contingency so they hope to
endow it with what is probably the most
crucial aspect of common-sense
intelligence the ability to learn
learning about simple shapes was the
problem given to a computer program
written at MIT by Patrick Winston I was
trying to understand if it's possible
for computer to learn on meaningful way
and by that I don't mean a kind of rote
learning which I just tell a computer in
a very straightforward way the facts
that it needs to know rather I will have
the computer to be more involved in the
learning process I wanted to do some
analysis make some descriptions to
perhaps compare descriptions and use
those comparisons to develop a kind of
model of what it is that it's supposed
to learn Winston wanted the program to
learn to recognize an arch he began by
getting it a model the program itself
labels and counts the pipes the diagram
on the right shows the important
features it spells those out in detail
and stores them in its knowledge base
the program was told only that this
drawing is an arch it had to figure out
for itself the distinguishing features
in this example the program sees
something different the two supports are
touching but it hasn't been told if it's
an arch so it asks Winston types back
that the drawing is not an arch from the
response the program can draw an
important conclusion that the supports
of an arch must not touch this new
information is added to its
knowledgebase from examples like this
the program accumulates facts about
arches it acquires knowledge but will it
be able to apply it now that I've given
the computer some examples I want to see
if it's really learned anything from
them I'm going to give it a little test
tightly and picture here which looks
like an arch except of the object on top
is a wedge now then if a brick the
program analyzes the drawing to see if
it fulfills the minimum requirements for
an arch without violating any of the
conditions this time Winston asked the
question the program checks through its
knowledge base before reaching a
conclusion
what will happen when this ability to
learn goes beyond archers when computers
can learn not just by example but from
experience as well if when computers
have an ability to learn in very
powerful ways it might start a sort of
chain reaction of intelligence that is
the smart computer might be able to
learn to make a self smarter and that in
fact would lead to a kind of
intelligence that's very difficult for
us about how would such an intelligence
compare with our own at the Stanford
artificial intelligence laboratory
professor John McCarthy I think it's
possible to have artificial intelligence
at human level or beyond but it's very
difficult to say how long it will take
because I believe that some major
discoveries are necessary to achieve
that level one way of putting it is to
say that it takes 1.7 Einsteins and 0.3
of a Manhattan Project and it's
important to have the Einstein be first
and the Manhattan Project second I would
say that on the basis of present
knowledge such claims are simply and
utterly ridiculous
there's simply no basis for making them
it's not only on the basis of present
knowledge but certainly also on the
basis of present achievement
the quest to build intelligent machines
began long before the computer age
traditionally they have been cast in the
image of humanity the green lady was
built by a nineteenth-century craftsman
to entertain the Royal Courts of Europe
her complicated and graceful moves are
rigidly controlled by a hidden mechanism
early computerized robots were equally
inflexible alpha newts sole function is
to seek light
a sensor conveys information to a small
computer which controls the robots
direction his successor beta Newton has
an on-board computer which directs it
through a programmed sequence of actions
without vision it can't distinguish the
letters let alone spell its name a human
being has carefully prearranged the
blocks
what primitive robots have in common is
that they can do only a single kind of
task but the essence of common-sense
intelligence is generality built ten
years ago at the Stanford Research
Institute shakey represents a more
sophisticated class of robot dismantled
now the versatile shakey could
understand English commands and devised
a way to carry them out even in an
unfamiliar environment
here he uses his power of vision to find
and retrieve a particular box
is shaky the forerunner of a truly
general machine intelligence or are the
problems insurmountable most people have
been skeptical about all the
developments in science and technology
that have occurred I mean look at the
history of spaceflight I can remember
when I was a boy and trust B M interest
in the space travel back in the 1930s of
this regard is the most ridiculous thing
you could possibly talk about
and before that across the idea of
heavier-than-air flight was ridiculed so
we've seen right down the ages this kind
of skepticism in this case to the
concept of the intelligent computer
there's also an element of fear involved
because this challenges and threatens us
tightens our supremacy in the one area
which we consider ourselves superior to
all the other inhabitants of this planet
so people are not only skeptical of
computers that are fearful of them and
perhaps even if they think it may happen
because they're fearful laio would try
to pretend to themselves as it won't
happen a kind of whistling in the
graveyard 1926
a German film metropolis the idea the
smart machine is designed to frighten a
mad scientist schemes to replace human
workers
it is from fantasy like this that our
image of the intelligent machine has
come and Hollywood has maintained this
Frankenstein motif in an endless series
of horror movies starring robots and
malevolent computers
what will intelligent machines of the
future be like what function will they
serve it is a question to ask the
creator of hell
arthur c clarke intelligent computers
could take almost any conceivable form
and i'm sure they will according to the
duties they had to perform the
Kabbalists idea in the general public is
certainly clanking humanoid robot like
the one in star wars are the ones
immortalized by my friend dr. Isaac
Asimov which looked like human beings in
fact some time might even be
indistinguishable from human beings but
I think that although that type may
arise most them all tend to be just gray
metal boxes sitting around and thinking
and communicating instructions to all
sorts of specialized tools and devices
and machines which are their servants
which do the jobs they're designed to
perform for example at the Stanford
Research Institute artificial
intelligence is being applied to
industrial problems mounted on this arm
is a camera which sees an object on the
conveyor belt
by analyzing the image the computer
enables the arm to pick it up
as in a real industrial situation
objects go down this conveyor belt at
unpredictable angles a worker picking
them up would automatically adapt
himself the robot arm must do the same
thing the arm returns to get the next
object another electrical socket cover
but the hole means it's defective
it's picked up anyway and the computer
directs it to be placed in a different
bin
the potential advantage of computerized
automation lies in its flexibility the
arm is now assembling a water pump by
changing the program the same hardware
can do many different jobs here they
contend that this could mean an end to
the standardized products always
associated with automation in charge of
robotics Charles Rosen for the first
time it begins to be possible to
customize goods that is to produce goods
that suit the individual to
individualize what is produced for
everybody
now I don't pretend that it means that
everybody will have an absolutely
individual styled car but it is possible
to have a much larger number of things
to choose from ones that you would
prefer from simple to complex and from
gaudy to non gaudy and so forth in the
field of clothes for instance it looks
possible to customize every suit of
clothes and every dress using other
forms of this kind of automation you
would need computer aided design and
computer aided manufacturing and finally
this programmable automation to
accomplish this and it might mean that
people would go around in their own
designed clothes with some help from the
computer at a price that can be similar
to the mass-produced prices that we now
have even after the bugs are ironed out
intelligent computers will join the
workforce gradually because of the great
expense involved they will be applied
first to dangerous and monotonous jobs
unpopular with human workers but it's
inconceivable that the trend will stop
there today around 30 to 40 percent of
the workforce is engaged in
manufacturing goods by the year 2000 I
would think that about five to ten
percent all the present working force
would be needed to manufacture the same
amount of work England
and like it or not this could mark the
beginning of the much-heralded age of
leisure and in its attempt to make the
impossible possible Kawasaki Heavy
Industries has been struggling for the
development of an unmanned assembly
system this has resulted in the
acquisition of a definite outlook for
the development of desired robots and
software to create a robot operated
assembly line this is no more than the
final goal toward which every effort in
labor saving technology is being
directed your new mate kawasaki units
will find broader application and
manufacturing operation in the near
future as we vigorously approach the
final goal of an unmanned Factory the
forerunner of technology which will
bring more happiness to everyone
it's perfectly obvious that the
development of such computers would
restructure society completely they
would clearly remove much of the
mechanical use that term the routine
work which of course has taken so much
of society style time of the human race
and they're already doing this in many
ways because our society now would
collapse instantly if the computers that
run it we're taking away and these are
very simple low-grade computers and this
of course raises tremendous social and
philosophical problems not just the
question of displaced people what will
they do what will the people who are
only capable of low-grade computer type
work what will they do in the future the
much profound question of what is the
purpose of life what we want to live for
and that is a question which the
intelligent computer will force us to
pay attention to it is a question that
will confront people from all walks of
life the decision-making capability of
intelligent computers makes them as
appropriate to the professions as to the
workplace medical diagnosis is a test
case now this a discomfort that you have
is it the kind of discomfort that would
grab and then let go and then it's more
of a steady discomfort except it's
influenced by meal at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical School dr. Jack Myers
is one of the country's leading
diagnosticians by asking questions and
making observations he begins to assess
what's wrong with his patient why don't
you show us next where you feel this
discomfort diagnosis is often regarded
as something of an art at the very least
a skill requiring the human touch fairly
good size but does it AB Dolman pain
Perry umbilical Myers conveys the
information he has just gathered to a
computer programmed by heart official
intelligence expert Harry Popol abdomen
pain exacerbation with meals these few
observations allow the program to begin
reducing the range
possibilities the system Harry's now
come back with the first stage of its
analysis it's of interest that the first
two items being considered are wholly
dhokala diocese which is the gallstone
in the common bile duct and carcinoma or
cancer of the head of the pancreas but
there are also several other
possibilities the program will seek
evidence to support or refute them in
like a physician it will do so by asking
questions it's asking now for findings
concerning the abdominal thing let's see
what details it wants to know is it a
colicky thing no it's not a calling you
thing some of the questions are
identical to those dr. Meyers asked his
patient really no it's not coincidental
for the past seven years they've been
tailoring the program to duplicate his
methods is there severe back pain no we
have back another analysis and the
system is in a narrow mode which means
it has two leading contenders for the
diagnosis from many possibilities it has
narrowed the field to two the system
will now try to distinguish between
these two and almost certainly will go
to more complicated studies than we've
been using up to this point have you
findings of upper GI barium meal x-ray
stand that has not been done yet the
program calls for the least expensive
and least painful tests first it will
draw tentative conclusions on limited
information and what about the clan
geography that has not been done as yet
but probably not a final decision with
all of these emissions in the important
findings it's pretty unlikely that the
program will be able to come to any kind
of a conclusion I would guess that we'll
see it
yeah the Turing is in fact the judgment
of the program at this point the program
recognizes 600 diseases and 2,500
symptoms with trillions of combinations
possible isolating the significant
factors that will lead to a diagnosis
would seem to require something tuition
perhaps but years of thinking about what
he does has convinced Jack Myers
otherwise my observations that what is
called art and intuition and diagnosis
is generally based on knowledge and
experience sometimes these things are
hard to analyze and understand but I
think this is predominantly the
application of information the
organization of information and that
coming to a logical conclusion
so diagnosis can be expressed in rules
and Harry Popol had to learn what they
are Harry here's a case I got out of the
files it's a very good one for analysis
this is a an elderly he would sit with
Jack Myers for hours trying to unravel
the diagnostic process develop cirrhosis
of the liver and then there many
complications of this in describing the
components of the liver problem you've
skipped over some other items that are
underlined how is it that you know not
to worry about those items when when
when working on the liver problem well
that's a matter of medical knowledge and
judgment and out of our beginning Myers
found it difficult to explain liver the
problem is if we're going to get a
program to do this I have to understand
what that professional judgment is that
you're talking about and I need to know
just just exactly what it is that that
enables you to do what you do and call
professional judgment well I can explain
to you each of these items and as to
what the item means result of several
years of work was a system that dr.
Myers believes reproduces his own
decision-making process item and then I
think you'll see how they do form a
pattern or a cluster alright let's let's
do that first the generally known
symptoms of a particular disease are
compiled by medical students then the
judgments have to be assigned now that
we've agreed upon the data for diabetes
insipidus let's put the profile into the
machine
Chuck are you ready sure age 16 to 25 Oh
- they are expressed in numbers which
tell the likelihood of a disease if a
symptom is present and the likelihood of
a symptom if the disease is 5:03 this is
intuition turned into numbers judgments
converted to calculation diabetes
insipidus family history this program is
intended to help physicians not to
replace them but won't we eventually
have more faith in the computers
decisions than in our own I suppose it's
possible in the future that these
systems will be considered infallible
but I I certainly hope not
there is a tendency for man to believe
machines more than other people but I
don't really believe this is appropriate
and I hope this won't happen even worse
will we abdicate responsibility for our
decisions this question becomes
increasingly important as
decision-making programs are implemented
in medicine and other professions as
well in a world of growing complexity
governments will use computer programs
to set public policy our cities are
already cognitive cities with many of
their functions computerized artificial
intelligence will further this trend by
giving computers the ability to program
themselves and maybe to explain to us
what they're doing perhaps we will run
things better in partnership of smart
machines perhaps will no longer run
things at all we're already seeing
individual functions of a city's life
the medical function the educational the
central administration the garbage
collection and so forth increasingly
computerized in due course these
computer networks will begin to exchange
with each other and we will have
centralized machine regulation of cities
at a level of complexity which none of
the inhabitants can anymore explain
follow correct or control and there is a
risk of our species ultimately becoming
parasites living in the intensities of
intelligence it is of the future which
may be governing themselves according to
certain criteria of efficiency which may
not always take into account in a
sensitive way what we regard as vital
human values in this experiment a
computer is reading a woman's brainwaves
the aim is for the computer to discern
in what direction she is looking not by
watching her eyes but by deciphering the
electrical patterns of her brain
as the subject looks in each of four
different directions up down left and
right a flashing checkerboard stimulates
for corresponding brainwave patterns
which are recorded by the
electroencephalograph the differences
among the patterns are so slight that no
person could tell them apart but the
computer can and it stores the results
in memory you can relax no we have out
anything and for the next one you're
going to see the maze in your field
vision remember you have to take that
little mouse out of the maze step by
step by fixating on the red dot that
stands in the direction where you want
the mouse to move are you ready this is
the test the subject moves arise in the
direction she wants an electronic mouse
to move in a maze the computer picks up
the corresponding brainwave and moves
the mouse accordingly it seldom makes a
mistake in effect the computer is
reading this woman's mind experiments
like this might be the first steps
toward a merger of mind and machine a
marriage of artificial and natural
intelligence
but in such a relationship who would be
in control who would be the dominant
partner it is possible that we may
become pets of the computers leaving
pampered existences like that bombs but
I hope we will always retain the
abilities to pull the plug if we feel
like it and if we don't actually do hand
over everything to the computers that
will just prove the thesis divide
sometimes suggesting that the computers
are designed to be our successors and
that perhaps when they come along as our
function becomes obsolete as our
predecessors have become obsolete and
being replaced by us and I feel that
that happens it will serve us right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
