and very thankful to MIT for holding
this workshop on artificial intelligence
in the future of work and very grateful
to Erik Brynjolfsson and the MIT
initiative on the digital economy for
enabling me to participate virtually
even though I'm in Asia today otherwise
I certainly would be with you in
Cambridge I believe that this question
of AI and work is really of profound
significance because they think the
transformations ahead will be enormous
and I want to explain why and what I
believe are some of the key policy
issues from my point of view the digital
revolution is as great a technological
advance as the great advances since the
beginning of the Industrial Age the
advent of the steam engine the advent of
the internal combustion engine the
advent of electrification I think the
digital revolution which has been
underway roughly from the 1930s onward
is having already deep and pervasive
effects on all aspects of the economy as
well as all aspects of social life and
politics and with artificial
intelligence and especially the machine
learning algorithms that have proven
their remarkable worth in recent years
we will experience a dramatic
acceleration of those changes they can
be positive to be sure but they also can
be adverse unless we handle them
properly so in a very brief synopsis of
my views I'd like to make the following
points first all great general-purpose
technologies whether it's steam
electrification or the digital
revolution
have pervasive effects on not only the
labor market and on income distribution
but on led to mass automation of work
especially in the goods producing
sectors of the economy
up till now that means in agriculture in
manufacturing and mining and in
construction in those sectors we've
already seen an enormous displacement of
basic relatively low skilled labour say
labour with education up to the high
school degree or even some college I
with huge shifts in labor demand against
such low skilled labor and in favour of
smart machines and high skilled labor
especially professionals with advanced
degrees that are complementary to these
systems of automation in general we talk
about capital's skill complementarity or
technology skill complementarity in
practice I think what that really means
is that skilled professionals especially
engineers are redesigning systems of
work that save on relatively lower
skilled labor and that are intensive
especially in smart machines and the
result of that is falling wages and
declining employment for lower skilled
workers and a significant boost of
earnings and employment for workers of
the high skills that are either the
inventors and designers of these new
technologies or are calm
Elementary with these smart systems I
believe that these basic shifts are the
main explanation for the declining share
of Labor income in national income a
process of decline that has clearly
accelerated in the last 15 to 20 years
and that is clearly a worldwide
phenomenon where lower skilled workers
are not finding employment or only
finding employment at following real
wages and in which more and more of
national income is earned by
professionals or by physical capital the
robots that are gaining their share of
production processes or of intellectual
property the patents and other IP that
are reaping a growing returns artificial
intelligence especially the new deep
learning of machines with the deep
neural nets for example is already
accelerating this process but I think
that it's going to have a further
pervasive effects on the job market
probably that are more complex and
disruptive than the changes of the past
part of the change will be an
acceleration of existing trends that
standardized work I certainly clerical
work will continue to be replaced by
smart machines work based on pattern
recognition whether it's surveillance of
protective security systems or whether
it's very sophisticated a reading of
diagnostic and medical images will
increasingly be replaced by
smart machines and of course one of the
things that we see is machines get
better is that work gets reorganized and
that clearly is underway in the shift
from brick-and-mortar commerce in retail
trade to e-commerce we're likely to see
a dramatic shift away from employment in
retail trade one of the major sectors of
the economy with a huge economization of
labor by shifting to e based trade and
this I think will be an acceleration of
trends against workers with high school
or less than bachelor's degrees because
right now retail trade is perhaps the
major being of labor that is providing
decent work for workers with that level
of educational attainment so what has
happened in the goods producing sectors
is now likely to dramatically accelerate
in certain parts of the service economy
what could be quite different from
patterns of the past though is that many
very high-skilled jobs are also likely
to be implicated I've already mentioned
the radiologists who will be replaced by
smart machines but it's very likely that
in our profession of Education machines
will replace a lot of what we do I
certainly the MOOCs are already doing
that but I think the range of
educational services that can be
provided at high quality very low cost
through online connected classrooms
distance learning new learning
algorithms will definitely scale
tremendously in the coming years
and I suspect in other areas of Medicine
for example with Watson type smart
diagnostician machines with the remote
sensing of patients and so forth we can
economize tremendously on skilled
personnel in the health sector and with
machines that teach themselves through
reinforcement learning as we've seen
with the alphago 0b coming in 72 hours
the world's greatest ever go player
we're likely to see even significant
parts of engineering essentially being
substituted by ever smarter machines all
of this will have pervasive effects on
the labour market and on the
distribution of income of course we're
seeing other phenomena as well that are
equally dramatic one is the remarkable
concentration of wealth that's taking
place because of big data the Big Five
Information Technology aggregators Apple
and Amazon and alphabet Microsoft and
Facebook have surged in cumulative value
to more than three point two trillion
dollars now I an astounding
concentration of wealth with very few
employees the indeed at stake because of
the vast returns to big data this is
already having profound social
ramifications and political
ramifications that I think we're only
starting to see obviously we're also
experiencing tectonic shifts in politics
as well the 2016 elections may prove to
have been a watershed where smart
algorithms deeply disrupted our politics
my
targeting of political messages perhaps
involving Russia I obviously played a
significant role if Cambridge analytical
is to be believed it's big data bases
and sophisticated targeting of what they
claim to be more than 230 million
Americans is a profound and actually
very upsetting a new aspect of our
politics we're only beginning to come to
grips with that from a policy point of
view I think we as economists and this
community broadly face one overwhelming
question and that is how can we ensure
that a technology that is so powerful
and so productive and with so much
promise of further gains of productivity
in the future should have outcomes that
are inclusive in their benefits that are
Pareto improving
across the society at any given time and
across generations those of us who are
watching the unfolding of this
technology have the right to be alarmed
we're seeing concentrations of wealth
widening income inequalities a loss of
empowerment of young owners of labor
relative to older owners of capital so
we're seeing huge effects on income
distribution wealth distribution
generational impacts that really have
the possibility of M is rising large
parts of the population even as these
technologies raise overall output we've
seen it before indeed I would say it's
part parcel of general-purpose
technologies that significant parts of
the popular
can actually be of misery's but we also
have tools to prevent that kind of
miseries ation and we as policy analysts
ought to be thinking hard about how to
ensure inclusive benefits let me mention
very quickly in closing a few ways one
is through expanded enhanced revamped
skill training obviously keeping ahead
of the machines or better said keeping
complimentary to ever smarter machines
is key we don't know quite what that
means I we tend to think it means more
STEM education but it may mean more
education in the human skills that are
complementary to the Machine
capabilities but what it surely means is
making absolutely certain that all parts
of society can have access to the skill
and education that they need in the
future not just the rich kids and this
means wider access to higher education
better financing terms pathways to free
higher education lower cost of higher
education in part through online
educational curricula and other methods
so that's number one is is the human
capital side second is sharing in the
increased leisure and basic job benefits
that will be enabled by these
technologies America is an odd place
we're the only country that does not
guarantee paid vacation for example and
our work hours are much longer than in
Europe some Puritans among us the view
Europe shorter work hours is a bad thing
I view Europe's long vacation times
guaranteed for all workers to be a part
of the decency and high quality of life
of those societies and we should be
sharing the benefits of even reduced war
could more leisure time much more widely
among the population a third dimension
certainly is the redistribution of
income it doesn't have to be universal
basic income doesn't have to be
untethered to work but it should mean
decent wages for all who are at work in
expanded Earned Income Tax Credit
reverse Social Security where every
newborn gets a capital grant in effect
enabling them to own a piece of the new
robotics and smart machine world to be
equity owners in this equity based
capital based economy our parts of the
new free distributive forces ahead and I
think a fourth area comes in politics
what are we going to do with these big
data aggregators they're super powerful
they're very intrusive they've
accumulated incredible amounts of wealth
and power they were part of the
manipulation of our political process
recently I think there's going to be a
very very serious look about how to
restrain the power that comes from a few
big data aggregators who have access to
almost everything we do in our lives now
because it's all online and our
commercializing our private lives in
ways that many of us don't condone or
believe is safe for society so all of
this is to say let's not underestimate
the massive changes ahead as economists
we are right to believe that
technological improvements are
potentially Pareto improving within a
generation and over time but it will
require lots of policy innovation and
lots of boldness and vision to ensure
that the actual benefits of these new
wondrous
and rapidly advancing technologies in
fact are broadly enjoyed and I think
that's a major challenge and opportunity
for us to help it sure thank you for
letting me share these brief remarks
with you best wishes on the conference
and I will look forward to carrying to
catching up with Eric and others of you
very soon and all success on the
conference thanks very much Jeff's
