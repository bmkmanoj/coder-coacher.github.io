you
I'm afraid I'm afraid
AT&amp;amp;T videophone mr. Clark good morning
or good afternoon as the case may be
morning or afternoon for you it's
evening for us how are you I am fine
looking forward to talking to you well
you know every parent is proud on the
birthday of a child and you must be very
proud now that Hal's birthday is finally
coming up so many years after 2001 was
released well it was a problem here
because he has two birthdays one in the
book and one in the movie and I'm never
quite sure which is which or why we
changed I wanted to ask you about that
because in the book he was born in 1997
and in the movie he was born in 1992 and
a Kubrick of course was a very insistent
on that that he wasn't going to be
fooled for a second that the birthday
was in 1997 how did that happen I have
no idea could have been a fluffly actor
I just had any ideas whatsoever and but
obviously we've missed 92 so let's make
the most of 97 absolutely in 97 is of
course what you wrote in the book and
you also mention it in the notes at the
end of three thousand and one the final
Odyssey which is coming out this early
next year I believe a vein Fabio maje is
very March I got the typescript of it in
the mail today Oh excellent I am very
happy about it I really think it's the
best of the the best of the trilogy I
don't think any trilogy should have more
than four volumes so there won't be
another one I thought you were a little
better at math in that let me ask you
how you originally created how we know
of course the famous story of how
Kubrick approached you and you
remember this short story that you had
written called The Sentinel but there
were many many steps between that first
meeting and the screenplay and novel of
2001 and at what point did the idea of
how begin to emerge whether you're
trying or hospita dredge up memories
that are overlaid by many other
structures of books and movies and
things but it all began in in 864 I
can't really believe the day when I was
actually moonlighting at Time Life and
then said it by not coincidence the
issue of time just arrived today I've
got a letter in about 2001 how did it
have it anticipated the future and Sandi
contacted me it had he contacted me
before I went to New York to work on the
time-life man and space project and we
sort of brainstorm together for quite a
few days and what I did I went through
my stories I'd written and I made a list
of about six and said do you hear some
basic ideas and a solemn old Stanley all
six and the only element he used really
was from the Sentinel a short story
about the discovery of an artifact on
the moon and then I bought back the ones
he didn't use from Stanley and hope one
day I will resell them to somebody else
now who invented what after all it's
like that I have no idea we were sort of
bouncing ideas back and forth and like a
table tennis match certainly at that
time you were much more optimistic about
the possibilities of artificial
intelligence than people are today oh I
don't think so artificial intelligence
is roaring along and in fact I've just
got a fax from Jet Propulsion Laboratory
and this is rather in order to tell you
what they're up to and I'm just reading
through the letter from dr. Richard
Doyle who is ahead of the autonomy
technology program at listen to this we
are holding in January 1997 symposium on
the topic of intelligent autonomous
systems or space intelligent autonomous
systems without
exactly what Howell was but it hasn't
really developed artificial intelligence
on the timetable it was suggested by
2001 we seem to be about as far away
today don't you think from how as we
were then or not yes and artificial
intelligence is always even about twenty
years in the future when I saw you in
1958 you were speaking at the University
of Illinois in Urbana did that visit
have anything to do with friends you had
there and did it lead to how being born
in Urbana oh very much so because my
maths professor at King's College London
was George McVitie who later went to
University of Illinois and my placing
house birthday there was a raelia
tribute to George and who is in dead now
for many years he was a leading
cosmologists incident he's one of them
mathematician and by the odd coincidence
the supercomputer center now is it
Urbana
now whether that's a coincidence it in
your opinion on do you believe that the
problems that Hal experiences at the end
of the movie are a programming error or
is he jealous of the fact that humans
want to usurp his role in the mission
other says he had a human emotion or as
he had a programming mistake I think
I'll pass on that one
but remember there the four books are
not exactly sequels are in parallel
universes now they may have changed
quite a few ideas some are forgotten
some are not relevant anymore in some in
fact clashed with later developments
obviously the timescale is gone
completely wrong a 2001 kingdom the
storyline can't happen before at the
earliest maybe 2030 and you know because
the whole space program is sort of on
hold now it is hard to remember that
when we
worked on 2001 in from 1964 to 1968
roughly NASA was seriously planning to
put men on Mars in the 1980s well now we
haven't put men back on the moon yet one
of the things that intrigues me in 3001
your new book is your idea of the sort
of space elevator a permanently orbiting
ring above the earth connected to earth
by a fabric made out of
buckminsterfullerene x' which would
allow a person to be lifted from the
surface of the earth up to this space
station at a cost of only about $100
worth of electricity that's true and in
fact $10 for the round-trip would you
get most the energy back you return the
nearest revenue - no this is an idea I
developed much further in another novel
called The Fountains of paradise I
described the building of the space
elevator intently from a mountain in Sri
Lanka now that book was recently carried
up in the space shuttle by the crew of
Atlantis when they did the tether
experiment and I have a wonderful
photograph of Jeff Hoffman holding the
fans of paradise floating in because in
space and beside him with the earth and
the background though that is a story
I'd love to see film one day another
interesting fact
and buckminsterfullerene the material
that will make this possible
was named after Bucky fuller who I last
saw in this very room and a couple of
weeks ago the chemist who when the co
discovers of this material got the Nobel
Prize so all these things are you know
pointing in the direction one day we may
be able to make the space elevator and
then the universe will open up another
idea that you've come up with recently
that I found fascinating is the soul
catcher the idea that a apparently a
computer or computer like device could
have enough complexity in memory that it
could store and recreate a person
physically emotional
and spiritually and you say in the notes
at the end of 3001 that the memory that
it would take to do this is less than
you originally thought well it's about
10 to the 15th or so but it is a thought
that one day we may be stored in
something about this size not only our
bodies but our minds our emotions
everything is a pretty scary idea but I
have developed it in the in 3001 is not
really original I mean the idea of
storing personalities goes back to
science fiction and a number of people
you know in the business now are taking
me seriously and working on the idea
today we live in a time when the cyber
culture has changed our lives so
dramatically could you have foreseen
that at the time that you were writing
about how 9000 did you think that
computers of the power for example of
the one on my desktop or on your desktop
would be in the hands of private
citizens by 1996-97
no I did the chip revolution is the most
remarkable in human history I mean no
one could ever have dreamed that
something of the size of a you know how
it's like the first computers using tens
of kilowatts of energy it would be
compressed into a thing you're about the
size of your thumbnail that is totally
unexpected and that's changed Society
you know a will change society you know
beyond recognition and I'm rather
worried about someone developments that
may happen recently I had an essay in
Asia week magazine and I've invented a
new word the coming Seibert ISM or the
subtitle this the coming cyber tourism
or who will change the lightbulbs when
they're all plugged into entertainment
you know who's gonna run the world let
me ask you something that is an obvious
question I think for any science fiction
writer including the greatest of them
all what were your thoughts when you
read about that rudimentary evidence
that they
might have been able to prove that there
have been life on Mars well of course I
was very interested
I think it's been rather overblown
because we're it's not proof it's I'd
say 80% or so evidence but it does mean
we should fold this up and for a similar
evidence perhaps from Europa in fact a
Freeman Dyson wrote to me the other day
and said that we should look for
meteorites that have been splashed off
Europa because the oceans of Europa as I
said in in three thousand and one or
three thousand and two thousand and you
know maybe the other place where there's
a lot of life in this solar system and
what about these cities that you've
found on Ganymede well the well I
described in Ganymede if you look at the
images from the Galileo spacecraft
there's some extraordinary formations
there and the one I mentioned
specifically it does look like a city
doesn't require much imagination through
see that these are city streets the fact
that there are five kilometers are so
wide is a minor detail do you think that
there is any scientific invention or
discovery that the man or woman who came
up with it would be so alarmed by that
they would feel it was necessary to
suppress it or would all knowledge be
useful and worth communicating in one
way or another there is one invention
which I have discussed I think many
years ago you possibly profiles in the
future and that is a time probe if we
could ever invent something it would
reveal the past so you see anything it
never happened when you think of the
implication of that they're pretty
appalling and would human civilization
survive such a thing I just don't know I
don't think it's possible but I can't
rule it out and if a time probe was
could be created then all the mysteries
all the secrets that ever happens will
all be revealed total transparency and I
think that's the most terrifying
invention I can think of
so if you were to invent the time probe
you might want to seal up your notes or
even burn them hey one of the problems
of course would be that if you did have
a time probe there would be so much time
to probe that you would never live long
enough to do it you'd be a bit like the
web you've written a lot of great
science fiction stories and novels do
you think that there is one you've
written it would make a great movie and
you haven't been able to convince a
producer or director of that what would
be your favorite unfilmed project to
film oh that's an easy one to answer
that's I think my best novel is the
songs of distant earth and insanity Mike
Oldfield is just done a beautiful suite
based on it and he's already sold over a
hundred thousand copies well the songs
of distant earth was in fact I think yes
Michael Phillips option at one time but
the option is laughs lapsed
meanwhile I've got several my stories on
option my meteor impact story the hammer
of God Steven Spielberg has just renewed
the option on that so I hope that we'll
go ahead
there's work on fallen moondust
childhoods end has been sitting at
Universal for about 40 years and I'm a
bit upset because the opening of
Independence Day which I've not yet seen
is it identical with that of childhoods
end and you sent me an email saying that
oddly enough the ending of Independence
Day was an example of anticipatory
plagiarism in which they stole the
ending from your forthcoming novel
before it was published before it even
got Randall thinking it it's really
synchronicity I suppose yes it's a fact
that could come to think of it he was to
beat us both you know it was a virus
that killed the invading Martians well
you know 2001 is certainly the best
science fiction movie ever made and as
you probably know it was voted one of
the
latest ten films of all time in that
poll that's taken every ten years of the
world's film critics directors producers
archivists and so forth by sight and
sound magazine in London it's considered
one of the top 10 films of all time but
so many other science fiction films have
not followed that lead there has not
been a film since 2001 with the same
kind of vision or ambition in the
science-fiction genre no perhaps not
of course 2001 kids on stage in films
for about a decade until the technology
caught up with it and then we had in no
Star Wars and and so forth which are you
know guess space westerns great fun I
enjoy them but you know perhaps right in
saying that no one has ever attempted to
follow the leads created by 2001 the
whole third Act of 2001 is such a
visionary leap into the unknown the the
feeling that that the astronaut has
arrived at a place totally beyond
imagining and although his physical
environment seems to be a room the room
has apparently been created by some
other race for its own purposes that's a
the kind of ending that today a studio
wouldn't allow the studio's today would
say the audience will be confused they
won't understand it it doesn't have a
satisfactory we have a resolution it
will be frustrating how did you get away
with that you and Kubrick in in in
making a a film with an ending that is
so poetic and and provocative and
unconventional well again you must
credit entirely as Stanley deserves all
the credit for that I just gave some
ideas and inputs and the critic of
society and is it amazing special
effects team led by Douglas Trumbull and
wahla V vers and they deserve the credit
but then the notion of putting him in
the in the bedroom that must have you
must have contributed to that
again I can't remember jack details you
see there was feedback in both
directions I would write something good
to stand me and he say that splendid Bob
Bob can and I drove I can rewrite it and
that something had the extraordinary ins
of rewriting a piece after I'd seen the
Stanley's version of it on the you know
in the rushes and so it was it was
feedback in both directions the
Starchild the last shot in the film as
the star child or at least 2001 fans now
call it the star child I I don't know
that was really what you called it but
the star child turns and looks at the
audience as if to put the ball back in
our court to ask us what we think our
destiny is and what do you think that
question was and what do you think the
answer is what is the star child asking
is and what can we how can we respond
well I would say that the implication is
that the future is wide open it's up to
us what we do about it are do destiny is
at least to some extent under our own
control but of course at the time a lot
of people didn't get it and one of the
remarks I remember hearing after the
premiere was from a senior MGM executive
saying despairingly well that's the end
of Stanley Kubrick in your original
short story The Sentinel you you talk
very dramatically of the impact on the
minds and on the very identities of the
people who see an artifact that is
obviously the creation of a race other
than the human race why is it do you
think that we still haven't gotten any
definite proof of intelligence form
anywhere else wouldn't you think or hope
that there might be some way that
another race could make itself known or
is the universe simply too large and is
there too much time involved well of
course this is a subject which is being
debated endlessly and we don't know the
answers there's so many possibilities
some scientists are coming around to the
viewpoint that we're maybe unique or
that intelligence is very very rare
although perhaps life of some kind maybe
if had it common that we have the other
dichotomy that I think about 50% of the
population in the United States believe
that aliens are already here and they
made contact with us there's an
extraordinary situation I think it's
part of the madness which occurs at the
end of all millennia you are not one of
the people who believes in the UFOs are
among us theory I've seen too many UFOs
to take them seriously I've seen about
six including the best of all with
Stanley Kubrick and it's all on record
and they all they all turned out to have
very simple and often absurdly simple
explanations the one that you saw the
Kubrick how did you explain it okay well
we're this is really incredible you
think you might think I'm making this up
but the very night we agreed to make
2001 we went on the roof of Sandy's
penthouse and coming up from the West
was a brilliant star rose you know we're
gonna right up the sky and apparently
stopped overhead well our first reaction
was of course it was an artificial
satellite but out of your satellites
comped it's not motionless and then it
continued on down down to the east
well we actually got checked with the
New York Times to see if there was a
satellite then and we got on to the
Pentagon and the explanation was absurd
really absurdly simple it was a
satellite it was the echo satellite but
there was a full moon at the time and
it's very hard to judge the movement of
something of vertically overhead if it's
station you may think is moving it was
moving you may think it's stationary it
was the anchor satellite but by some
extraordinary coincidence the New York
Times which gave satellite crossings
didn't give that particular one that
particular night now you can impend all
kinds of conspiracy theories out of this
one but we did see the echo satellite we
couldn't identify it we eventually did
the other five or six that you saw that
any of them look any more puzzling than
that one not really the most striking
one I guess there's a lot of brilliant
sources flicking
back and forth over the over the sunset
and again the explanation turned out to
be ridiculous if they were seagulls you
wouldn't believe this but birds at some
angles reflects almost specularly like
mirrors and you can't tell what they are
if you're a long way away the
information at the end of 3001 includes
your speculations about the possibility
of instant universal acceleration which
would allow someone to move very quickly
to another place without having to worry
about the g-forces and you seem to feel
that that might be theoretically
possible well we know it is probably a
gravity field just just this if you were
falling in the gravity field of a black
dwarf or a neutron star you could be
accelerating at a million G and you
wouldn't feel anything until you got so
close to the tidal forces tore to pieces
so you know Nature has provided a space
Drive in a way if we can ever control
gravity and there's some hints that this
might be possible then we would have a
space drive when you started as a
science fiction writer the genre was not
very respectable there were some good
magazines John Campbell of course that
astounding was trying to do some very
high-level stuff but many of the
magazines were pulps on the level of
thrilling wonder stories and amazing
stories today science fiction is a genre
with bestsellers with professors with
PhD research projects with books of
criticism conferences symposiums what
are your thoughts about the development
of this genre which you are certainly
one of the small handful of of
grandmasters and and founding fathers of
well science fiction was respectable
before it got a label I mean the wels is
scientific romances or whatever you like
to call them you know we're quite highly
regarded and most mainstream writers
seem to have written some sensation
quite some surprising names I mean
Rudyard Kipling for example who's
making a rotten bit of a comeback
nowadays you wrote stories about the
future of aviation and Melville or the
robot story is not very well known but
Bruce Franklin put together collection
of such stories and so science fiction
until Hugo Gernsback came along and lost
the pulp magazines was Federer
spectacles so we don't know whether the
bless or curse hugo for making it may be
a popular but less respectable and i
remind of a remark made by one of my
friends in the fields that science
fiction should go back to the gutter
where it belongs it was fun when we were
in the gutter that was getting to
respectable
you
you
I'm afraid I'm afraid
AT&amp;amp;T videophone mr. Clark good morning
or good afternoon as the case may be
morning or afternoon for you it's
evening for us how are you I am fine
looking forward to talking to you well
you know every parent is proud on the
birthday of a child and you must be very
proud now that house birthday is finally
coming up so many years after 2001 was
released well it causes a problem here
because he has two birthdays one in the
book and one in the movie and I'm never
quite sure which is which or why we
changed I wanted to ask you about that
because in the book he was born in 1997
and in the movie he was born in 1992 and
a cube reek of course was a very
insistent on that that he wasn't going
to be fooled for a second that the
birthday was in 1997 how did that happen
I have no idea it could have been a
fluff the actor I just had any ideas
whatsoever and but obviously we've
missed 92 so let's make the most of 97
absolutely in 90</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
