on the program it's great to be with you
on um where are you actually now I'm
actually in Los Angeles although usually
I'm in the Boston area uh-huh
well welcome to the West you got here
hopefully after the deluge of rain just
flew in actually you missed it that good
um all right well you know just before
just before the program got started I
had about two seconds to talk to you and
I say does he I Robot because obviously
we're gonna be talking about artificial
intelligence robots and all that sort of
thing and uh then you said and you said
yes
with an interesting movie but it
suffered from the same thing that a lot
of futurist movies do which is it took
one change in this case human level
cyborgs and put it on today's world is
if nothing else is going to change I
mean the reality is that there's going
to be lots of changes well they have
cool cars well thank the cars were just
like today's they I mean ahead slightly
cool designs but basically was today's
designs today's cars today's coffee
makers lots of things are going to
change within a karateka life extension
we're going to have full-immersion
virtual reality we're not just going to
have one change put on today's world I
mean that's a mistake that a lot of
people make when they consider changes
you know we were just talking about on
our book about radical life extension
Fantastic Voyage look long enough to
live forever and a lot of people ask
well if people live a long time are we
going to have overpopulation uh-huh but
other changes for example nanotechnology
will enable us to have very dramatic
economic growth I will be able to make
virtually any physical product using
food from a very inexpensive materials
and just information if it pans out now
the only reason I say that is because
again returning to robots ray when I was
a child on 59 years old now the promise
was
oh boy we'd have the kind of robots we
saw on iRobot that would do all the
nasty chores for us and all the rest of
it that was a promise and almost an
absolute promise from science yeah not a
promise from me actually well I mean
there are a lot of bad predictions about
the future and you can you can find
embarrassing predictions that go back
many decades and even centuries but it's
important to have a sound methodology
for anticipating the the technological
trends I mean in your book the
quickening issue which came about
nineteen ninety-seven you talked about
how technology was accelerating yes and
the impact of technology such as
economic change is also accelerating yes
but what I've done is actually create
mathematical models of that acceleration
and it's really stemmed from my interest
in being an inventor I realized that my
inventions have to make sense when I
finished the project and sonoda most
inventions fail actually because the
timing is wrong so I became an ardent
student of technology trends and have
developed mathematical models of how
technology evolved this is actually
taken out a life of its own I have a
group of 10 people now that gathers data
about technology in many different areas
and develop mathematical models and but
actually doing this for 25 years
book I wrote in the 1980s had hundreds
of predictions about the 1990s and the
early 2000 years which have tracked very
accurately so you did wrong right but
it's based because it's based on a sound
methodology I mean some things are
actually hard to predict and if you ask
me will Google stock be higher or lower
in three years no that's very hard to
predict but if you ask me how much will
it cost to sequence a base pair of DNA
or how what will the spatial resolution
of brain-scanning be in 2010 those
things turn out to be very predictable
why well I have a whole theory about
that
call the law of accelerating returns
which technology evolves in an
exponential fashion because we're always
using the latest generation of tools to
create the next and for that reason the
power the tools and the effect the
technology has on the world accelerates
and it's intact grows exponentially and
you can take for example the price
performance of computing and put it on a
logarithmic graph and it forms a very
smooth progression for the last hundred
years the same thing is true of
telecommunications were in our book
Fantastic Voyage we talked about this
whole biotechnology revolution we were
now understanding our biology in terms
of information and that is growing
exponentially the amount of genetic data
that were sequencing is actually
doubling every year the cost of
sequencing a base pair of DNA comes down
by half every year so two thirds through
the genome project we had actually only
collected 2% of the genome and the
skeptics were saying well there's no way
you're going to finish the project on
time and they finished ahead of time
they finished ahead because it's the
last few doublings that go from just a
few percent to 100 percent that's a sort
of explosive power of exponential growth
it took us 15 years to sequence HIV the
sequence stars with a pretty comparable
project in 31 days and few years from
now we'll be able to sequence a new
virus in one day and a few hours so
these technologies are really exploding
exponentially in speed the price
performance the capacity the bandwidth
the amount of data anything that has
anything to do with information almost
no matter how you look at it is growing
exponentially so though in those areas
you feel as though you can make
predictions that are going to be pretty
definitely right on right I mean I have
we have these curves these graphs of
many different measures of information
and lately I've been focusing on biology
and how it affects our health and
longevity I see that in your book it
says live long enough to live forever
live long enough to live forever right
this is a book that I co-opted with dr.
Terry Grossman who also loves rats right
now I met him about five years ago he
actually was my dog
I had a very thorough evaluation at his
longevity clinic which was a great
experience and we developed I was not
the usual patient we had lots of e-mails
back and forth and dozens of emails
became hundreds became thousands we
actually estimated recently 10,000
emails between us
Wow we're really collaborating very
intensely on what we call these three
bridges to radical life extension in
bridge one which is about two thirds of
the book it's what you can do today to
stay healthy and you can really slow
down the aging and disease process a lot
more than people realize and I mean dr.
Grossman when I self do that ourselves
I had a it's a biological aging test at
his clinic which showed that I'm about
forty even though I'm I'll be 57 in a
few weeks and I'm really not I would say
have an age very much in the last 15
years you anyways healthier than I was
20 years ago you want to live forever
well I don't want to die and I don't
think I will get to the point where I
want to die but I would say that if
everything stayed the same and if our
experience and stayed the same that we
didn't we're not able to expand our
minds and our experiences all of us
including myself would ultimately get
sort of profoundly aboard we'd develop a
profound on we profoundly bored I wonder
how long but that's not going to be the
case I mean in addition to radical life
extension technologies such as nano
robots in the brain which will interact
intimately with our biological neurons
will enable us to greatly expand our
experiences and our mental functions
we'll be able to have full immersion
virtual reality from within the nervous
system these are some of the things we
talked about in the third bridge of our
book it's this first bridge of staying
healthy and doing things today with
efficient and supplements and exercise
to slow down the aging process will keep
even baby boomers like like you and I
and dr. Grossman not only alive but in
good shape
until the full blossoming of this
biotechnology revolution that will give
us more time to the third bridge which
is the nanotechnology revolution we can
really go beyond the limitations of
biology
now many people look backwards and
you'll hear my statistics if you stop
smoking you'll add a few years to life
if you exercise you'll add some time
that's looking backwards it's very
important to look forward because
because of the exponential nature of
these technologies in a fairly short
amount of time we're going to have
dramatically more powerful tools to
enhance our health well we are
unraveling the 10 or 12 different causes
of aging aging is not one thing there's
a dozen different processes so what are
you doing
to extend your life now to get to the
magic point where other things begin to
happen well in this book Fantastic
Voyage like the rest when I described a
practical program nutrition and we can I
can describe some of the details of that
aggressive supplementation
finding out what your specific issues
are so we give you the guidance to
really develop a customized program and
find out what your issues are is your
homocysteine high if it is and take
folic acid and B vitamins and TMG and
some other things and get it into a
healthy range it's your cholesterol high
hmm just in the papers last week there
was a lot of discussion of c-reactive
protein that that's as important risk
factor as cholesterol because it's a
measure of inflammation that we're
learning that inflammation underlies
many of these very important disease
processes like heart disease and
diabetes oh my I want to ask a question
at this point there's a couple of them
well is it by ox and then it's it's
still on the market cousin that are
anti-inflammatory so there have been a
little trouble lately for them with more
advanced estimated way I just wanted to
ask if anti-inflammatories would be part
of a regimen well we do recommend things
like EPA DHA omega-3 fats
laboratory or curcumin reserve which is
anti-inflammatory and these don't have
the downsides of these drugs when I
would draw a distinction between old
drugs which were discovered and new
drugs which are being designed drug
development used to be called drug
discovery and it literally was a matter
of finding some substance it seemed to
have some positive effect they would
find something that lowered blood
pressure and we didn't really understand
how it works it seemed to work that it
would have a lot of side effects kind of
similar to when primitive and a woman
thousands of years ago would find a tool
like a here's a stone this would make a
good hammer we couldn't really shape
tools to do a job now we're actually
learning the precise biochemical steps
underlying these disease processes and
we were described in the book you know
the each key staff there's seven or
eight different key steps in the
progression of atherosclerosis which
causes heart disease a new drug
development we're actually able to
create very precise chemical weapons
that will go and interfere with a very
specific step and stop these disease
processes without side effects are much
fewer side effects so these old drugs
like by ops they do have certain
benefits anti-inflammatory but they have
side effects because they were not
designed to do a very specific job in a
precise way it celebrex for example or
is still in the market now there are
properties are all old drugs well I take
celebrates and so I'm asking for a
personal reason I mean um the little
risk but I have a very bad back so
bright so hopes my back now is that you
say there are some positive aspects to
the anti-inflammatory is that matters oh
well yes I mean it's good to slow down
these inflammatory processes because
inflammation over activation of the
immune system underlies fundamentally at
this grossest each step in the
progression towards a heart attack is
fueled by this inflammation process this
particular class of drugs though you
know have side effects which in many
cases may do more harm
good there are new drugs being developed
that will much more precisely undercut
these processes without the surrounded
side effect and that's the whole that's
that's our second bridge that we talked
about in Fantastic Voyage it is really
being able to understand the information
processes underlying biology and
developing key tools that can then
change those processes for example where
we have tools now that can actually
change the expression of your genes
something called RNA interference which
we talked about in the book could
actually turn a gene off like we send in
this little RNA fragments that latch
onto the messenger RNA for a gene which
destroys it and actually prevents a gene
from being expressed what would be a
practical application of that well let
me give you a very exciting one we have
all these genes inside it's one gene
these teams actually little software
programs and one of them's called the
fat insulin receptor gene says hold on
to every calorie because the next
hunting season may not work out so well
and these genes evolved tens of
thousands of years ago right so what
would happen if you turn that particular
gene off well we truck there was tried
at the Johnson Diabetes Center Oh on
rats we turned off the fat insulin
receptor gene in the in the fat cells
and and these mice ate ravenously and
remained slim and got the health
benefits of insulin they didn't get
diabetes they didn't get heart disease
they actually lived 20% longer oh my god
they got the health benefits of caloric
restriction which is something we know
extends life and adds and provides good
health while doing the opposite of
caloric restriction so that'd be a
pretty cool drug if we people could eat
as much as they want and remain slam and
actually get the health benefits of
being slim anybody tried on a human yet
well there are our promise of companies
rushing to bring you know something that
would inhibit oppression of this gene oh
the human market so that's you know have
to go through developing and testing but
I would say in five to eight years we
will see that but then it exists now in
the lab will they use the particular
to knock out this particular gene in
mice and of course it's easy to
experimental mice and mice developed
very quickly so determining for example
a 20% extension of their life sure
doesn't take that long and they can look
at future generations quite quickly
comparatively so there are many genes
that play a role in disease there are
genes that play a role in aging and we
have a tool now actually just emerged in
the last couple of years our name to
parents which allows us to turn genes
off gene therapy which allows it to
actually insert new genes is also making
progress or exciting new ways of being
able to place genes at the right place
on a chromosome which has been one of
the problems with with gene therapy we
also have the means of inhibiting
enzymes for example one drug which we
talked about in Fantastic Voyage called
horse atrophy which is actually now in
Phase three trials it turns off a very
specific enzyme that destroys the good
HDL the good cholesterol call HDL and
the blood by simply inhibiting that
enzyme people's HDL levels the good
cholesterol soars and that has a
beneficial effect on slowing down or
stopping others grossest which is
because of heart attacks so I mean
without hanging our hats on any one
specific drug because we you know we
need to let these trials continue there
are hundreds of these developments in
process because we now have the tools to
turn off an enzyme or add an enzyme turn
off a gene so for now you pursue it all
if I wonder if we've got a break here
with bottom there I wonder if there is
though the possibility in the near
future of that magic bullet that that
one moment when a genetic scientist
actually men manages to turn off the
aging process literally just turn off
the aging process and that's a fate you
don't
get any older
all right ray I understand that your
book reasonably illustrates to a person
how to get to the point where is
something some big breakthrough may
occur how to live long enough to get to
that point but right I mean that's a
title I think is instructive live long
enough to live forever you know they
live long enough is our bridge 1 and we
do describe in a lot of details how you
can do that I mean you can really slow
down aging disease processes much more
than people realize and we provide a
practical program for doing that it's
not a single silver bullet or one-trick
pony I mean we have a number of ideas
here about nutrition and supplements and
exercise but it's quite a doable program
right what would happen if this magic
bullet dip here I mean maybe it could
appear too soon at the rate technology
is moving I'm curious what you think
would happen if they suddenly found
something to turn on or off genetically
that would stop aging could that magic
bullet come too soon for the world I
mean these are our second and third
Bridges I mean I we feel that
biotechnology which will give us very
powerful new tools to really master
biology will be here in 10 to 15 years I
mean many of these things already in the
testing pipeline that's pretty soon and
then that'll be raised to the 3rd bridge
of the nanotechnology revolution and
that really will enable us to rebuild
our bodies and brains it's a molecular
level and you know then there's really
no limit to what we could live right but
what could have come too soon and I'm by
that I mean is society the world ready
for that kind of incredible leap of
technology it's kind of comforting I
think it's gonna come you know in a
couple of decades and that's why are
important particularly people our age
and their 40s 50s 60s 70s to really be
aggressive and taking good care of our
health so there will be in good shape
when these things happen we'll have
other developments
that will enable us to provide for a
month for a larger population
nanotechnology artificial intelligence
these developments will provide for very
substantial economic growth right to get
to the point where somebody who just
barely makes it let's say and they're 90
years old and along comes a magic bullet
would they then probably be frozen at 90
or would would regression be possible
it depends on when we're talking about I
think within about 20 years we'll be
able to essentially arrest the aging
process which is not one thing there's a
dozen different processes where we're
learning them we don't understand them
fully today but in 20 years we'll not
only understand it but it will have the
tools to stop them
you could go out further to go out say
30 years or more then we actually will
be able to reverse these process easily
and get younger okay so the answer is
even if you just barely made it you
would at that point arrest your aging
process and you would make it to the
next level breakfast that's that's
correct but you know it's good not to
cause you know excessive damage to our
biological bodies because some things
are hard to reverse and what a lot of
these disease processes you know they're
silent like athis grosses people don't
notice it the very first indication that
they have a problem might be a heart
attack in a sort of first heart attacks
are fatal another third cause permanent
damage to the heart muscle that's true
that eventually with cell therapies like
stem cell therapies or cell regeneration
we can undo that damage mm-hmm but it's
a lot better a lot easier and a lot more
a lot less painful to avoid that damage
in the first place hmm how damaging are
our policies prohibiting some lines of
stem-cell research well you know I'm
very opposed to the prohibitions and
restrictions and I think stem cell
research is very important ultimately
the holy grail of self therapies is
something called transdifferentiation
other than taking stem cells which has
somebody else's DNA you know what would
really be beneficial is to take my own
skin cells and turn them into other
types of cells mine selves and create a
Galit cells that have my DNA and in the
process actually pick ones that don't
have any DNA errors so there'll be DNA
corrected extend what are called the
telomeres which are mutations of how old
those cells are yes and create basically
youthful regenerated DNA corrected cells
with my own DNA now that's actually been
done in a petri dish scientists just the
past couple of years have actually taken
humans in cells and turned them into
immune system cells and they're just
themselves because I you know what is
the difference between different types
of cells they all have the same DNA
different genes are expressed and we're
actually learning how to control that
gene expression process so these are
some of the technologies that are in
development now that we're learning to
master in this second bridge of
biotechnology which is in the early
stages but it's going to progress a lot
more quickly than people realize as we
talked about earlier the power of these
technologies are doubling every year so
10 years from now will be quite
phenomenal and is there any Moore's law
involved ahead for this technology you
know with computer technology without
Moore's Law notes as eventually we're
going to hit a brick wall and Moore's
law is really just one example of what I
call the law of accelerating returns
which is that all information
technologies grow exponentially
basically doubling their power every
year and Moore's law with regard to
computers means the shrinking of
transistors on integrated circuit that
will hit a wall but then we'll go to
another paradigm which is
three-dimensional molecular computing
which will continue that progression and
Moore's law was not the first but
actually the first paradigm to bring
exponential growth of computing but we
also see it in any other area not just
computing I mean for example in
biological technology that's what I'm
asking about whether there are
equivalent okay 15 years to sequence HIV
we sequence ours on 31 days that's
because we have
Moore's law for biology the amount of
genetic data they were collecting and
understanding the price performance of
genetic sequencing is doubling every
year we can now I mean we're not that
far from being able to do a whole human
genome for thousand dollars that'll be
feasible in a number of years so we're
really gaining power over our genes
we've in some simpler animals we've
identified some aging genes and
particular worm we manipulated these
aging genes and they lived five times
longer equivalent of a 500 year lifespan
right human right now that's a simpler
animal than humans actually it's the
number of genes it has is not that much
lower than humans are to the join
forelli modest factor now obviously
these things will take some time to
translate into human therapies and
humans have aging processes that these
ones don't have but we're learning to
reverse-engineer them advance to them
okay well you're you're a big optimist
then about this technology there's no
question about it
but there are it seems to me with every
giant gain the world has made
technologically there's been the good
and the bad there's been the upside to
it like nuclear power and then the
downside to it like nuclear power gone
wrong and so forth with a really
articulated the downside as well
probably familiar would build Joy's
arguments about the downsides of some of
these technologies but he actually got
those ideas for my book the age of
spiritual machines and having considered
it what do you really consider to be the
things to watch out for well let me take
take this hold biotechnology revolution
we've talked about some of the great
benefits of understanding disease and
aging processes overcoming heart disease
and family standing age of the downside
is it also provides a set of tools that
a bioterrorist could use to create a new
virus that was spread easily was deadly
and stealthy
that's the downside and the knowledge to
do that and the tools to do that are
actually more widespread than the tools
to create an atopic uknown atom bomb oh
okay well then go out of it there is a
way of you can actually go after an
individual like the white race or the
black race or the Mexicans it could
target that way to couldn't yeah I mean
these are all feasible scenarios if you
have a pathological individual and we
and we know though that there are no
shortage and ideologies out there who
are bent on destruction so that's a
grave concern in a venir answer to that
though it's not to relinquish these
technologies but but to actually
accelerate the defensive side of the
equation that's a but but that's very
why I asked you about about well let me
ask you about for example the Chinese
we've got this prohibition right now on
stem cell research I ask you how
damaging it really potentially is have
you looked at the particular lines that
are banned how much are we losing by
these laws against this research well
first of all in my view these kinds of
prohibitions end up being like stones in
a in a stream that the flow of progress
just goes around them stem-cell research
itself has continued despite actually a
ban on stem cells it's a ban on
government funding it's continued in
this country and certainly overseas and
then stems embryonic stem cell research
is not the only type of cell therapy and
cell therapies itself is only one type
of biotechnology and in our book
Fantastic Voyage we talked about a dozen
different very exciting ideas about
biotechnology stem cells is one part of
one of those ideas and someone else
continued so it's not I mean I think I'm
certainly opposed to the prohibitions
and the restrictions and I think it's
important research and we're learning
about gene expression through stem cell
research and I think you will see some
changes and like there's some very
creative ideas that actually creates
themselves without
you know the involvement of embryos
which will get around the ethical issues
oh I think I will see these this type of
research continue I'm sure we will but
but specifically with the lines that are
banned how much are we missing out on
how much of a jump mic the Chinese for
example beginning on the United States
by having no such prohibitions
I think it's a legitimate issue I mean
there are overseas the research is
continuing at a faster pace the United
States and exactly you know I think it's
something we should we should change and
I'm not saying we shouldn't trust the
Chinese Rea but with some of the
cautions that you just talked about
I am the Chinese working like crazy on
this the average person would say to
themselves maybe the Chinese aren't our
best friends at some point and like you
know key issues are what I got back to I
referred to before that we're actually
pretty close to developing drugs that
could combat viruses in general and
broad spectrum antiviral medications we
need to we need to really accelerate
that work I testified before Congress
recently suggesting that we spend tens
of billions of dollars to finish that
job quickly so that we have those tools
before we need them we don't want to
what kind of attitude did you get back
mommy was interested but no doesn't seem
to be the political motivation to do it
I mean we want to have those solutions
in hand before some bioterrorist yeah
our challenges yes yes and so the
feeling you got from those you testified
before was that they weren't all that
fired up about it huh that's scary well
they were interested but it takes more
than one testimony to to change things
but you know these technologies are
accelerating and I think my own view
though is that the benefits beneficial
the benefits of these technologies do
ultimately outweigh
the perils but you know if you look back
at the history of technology we've come
a long way human lifespan was 37 in 1800
the human life was extremely hard
disease was rampant we didn't have
antibiotics we didn't have sanitation I
mean only 200 years ago on the other
hand technology facilitated a delicious
destruction in the 20th century so you
don't have to look further than the
recent past to see the promise and peril
of these technologies other hand when
when the lifespan was what do you say 37
years in 1837 in 1700 it was 55 okay
well so when when lifespan was 37 years
I bet there wasn't here the amount of
Alzheimer's we have now that's right I
mean we most people died of infectious
disease and accidents accidents now
people are mostly surviving those for
the most part so now we're confronting
degenerative diseases hmm I think like
heart disease cancer diabetes stroke and
these are things that you don't catch
just walking down the street one day
they're right there actually even in
somebody 20 or 30 these processes have
started and they're they're picking up
speed and what we talked about in
Fantastic Voyage is to really see where
are you in the progression of these
processes how advanced is your office
kosis do you have early precursors of
cancer just early insulin resistance
that could lead to diabetes we provide
information on a test that you can
easily do by yourself or with your
physician to really find out where you
are so that you can do something about
it before you take that last step off
the cliff that is what you did there you
went through that exact process right
right I mean 20 years ago I was
diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but I did
the conventional treatment made things
worse I came up with a program that
overcame my diabetes about five years
ago I met dr. Grossman and actually went
through a very extensive here's a
two-day executive evaluation that is
frontier medical clinic frontier Medical
Institute in Denver and really was able
to refine that program and then working
together with him you know we've refined
ideas and put it in this book Fantastic
Voyage so I mean I would recommend
people you know follow our program we
provide a very easy to understand
program to find out your own issues and
develop a personalized program if
somebody wants a really intensive
understanding of their own health and
how to optimize that I would suggest
they do what I did and actually go out
to the frontier Medical which is FN my
clinic comm and have this 2-day
executive evaluation and get a
personalized program that you can then
follow at home and you know it's a very
important thing to do all right
now you talked a lot about technology
and I want to talk about artificial
intelligence a little bit when do you
think we might see machines that achieve
the level of intelligence equal to two
people right now we're in the era of
what I called narrow AI we have hundreds
of systems that are as good as people
poor narrow tasks like detecting
credit-card fraud or diagnosing an
electrocardiogram or blood cell with
images or flying an airplane landing an
airplane making financial investment
decisions or I could list a hundred
things which people used to do and which
computers now routinely do actually a
better equal or better performance to
humans mmm my days for when computers
will have the full range of human
intelligence in which you could
interview like you're interviewing me
and really be convinced that you're
dealing with a human-like intelligence
mm-hmm
which is the Turing test that's 2029 by
that time we'll have computers that
equal or exceed the basic computational
capacity of the human brain we will have
completed the reverse engineering of the
brain there's one thing we'll have
nanobots metal robots you can go inside
the capillary
Brandon scan the brain from inside will
actually understand the principles of
operation of how the brain works you're
telling me it will apply that to Detroit
a powerful computer that there could be
something that I could be interviewing
just where I'm interviewing you right
now getting the kinds of responses or
even better than then you're giving me
right now from a machine and I wouldn't
know the difference the voice would be
right I mean that that is sexy classical
pet or how to determine human level
intelligence or machine that that's what
Alan Turing came up and with the 19th
and then I'm sorry what year would that
be my again 2029 2029 alright hold tight
we're at the top now by 2029
do you know during the break I was
thinking of interviewing machine bad
enough right but maybe by 2029 you'll be
listening to your new host the talk
master 2500 the the talk show host it
really is a machine not human being at
all and I hadn't considered that now I
think I'm not as happy anyway actually
the what's really going to happen is
we're going to merge with our machines I
mean internet Accords we talked about
the third bridge which is nanotechnology
in the killer wrappers nanobots and
nanorobots
will be able to send millions of them
into the capillaries of your brain
they'll keep you healthy from inside
your body by killing pathogens and so of
course but they'll also communicate with
your biological neurons and actually
extend our intelligence so that even
biological humans like you and I will be
enhancing our technology through this
very intimate integration with our
technology it's a nature of
non-biological intelligence that it
basically doubles in power over a year
where our biological intelligence is
fixed so ultimately get to the 2030s can
be the non-biological portion of our
intelligence that predominates the
non-biological portion in other words by
then we're more that's another way of
saying we're more machine than man right
but it's most important to understand
that pretty nature of machine is going
to be different right now when you say
machine you think of something it's much
less sophisticated less complicated
let's settle as supple and say human
being the nature of a machine is going
to change machines will actually be as
subtle and as intelligent and as complex
and deep and funny as human because what
we and funny
did you see yes I mean that's part of
human intelligence that's something that
human beings do where every sense of
humor we have emotions in fact it's our
emotional intelligence and things like
getting the joke or having spiritual
experiences or relationships you have a
fun the cutting edge of human
intelligence
it certainly is funny is
out there I mean you would have been
always that is that is the ultimate in
human intelligence well it requires all
of our mental faculties to be upfront
and let's say we achieve that and I
understand the implications of what
you're saying go back to iRobot and look
at the premise presented you know the
Three Laws of Robotics by the way do you
think those three laws are reasonable is
it is it reasonable that if you had
something of that intelligence that much
intelligence that you would lay down
those three laws as you know the basic
premise operating system well they're
reasonable laws except that they
overlook into which are biological and
non-biological intelligence is going to
emerge it's not going to be clear-cut
you say okay robots in the right size
room you and beings on the left they're
gonna be all mixed up boy it's not going
to be a clear distinction in fact you
know biological people like you and I
are going to be come in large measure
non-biological also so not going to be
humans against machines it's going to be
the humans are the machines and we're
already enhancing our experiences for
our machines I went talk to to a degree
one woman who said you know her computer
might as well be in his brain because he
walks around with it all the time really
an extension of his communication with
the world I mean I feel that way I mean
the Internet is an extension of our
nervous system and ultimately we'll
really integrate with our nervous system
so it's we're already expanding human
intelligence as a species with you know
our civilization does intellectual feats
that we certainly could not do without
our technology already today I've
actually interviewed scientists on this
show Ray who connected themselves to
computers they did it through it nervous
system in the arm and it's pretty
strange freaky stuff but they were going
to actually allow communication directly
to their brain through through cruising
nerves I mean that was the idea now what
we actually have practical applications
of
I mean there's an fda-approved implant
that we talked about in Fantastic Voyage
and this exists today there replaces the
neurons that are destroyed by a
Parkinson's disease and the latest
version of this neural implant actually
allows you to upgrade the software for
your neural implant from outside the
patient oh brother
and the biological neurons you know near
this computer that are placed in
people's brains receive signals from the
computer yes and are just as they used
to get signals from the biological
neurons it used to be there before they
were destroyed their Parkinson's they're
perfectly happy to get signals from an
electronic device which enables them to
integrate so we already have examples of
people walking around who have computers
in their brains and their intelligence
is now a function of both biological and
non-biological intelligence uh you know
special today is that we're overcoming
certain diseases but ultimately we'll
actually go beyond our you know
biological capabilities through this
intimate merger with our technology um
it's hard to even imagine I mean at that
time when we actually are at that point
what is our society going to be like
it's going to be very different than now
is it not still be fundamentally a human
society and even the non-biological
portion in my view is going to be you
and because it's going to be based on
the reverse engineering of human brains
can be patterned on bite on human
intelligence it's going to be an
extension of our human civilization and
expansion of it and we've already
expanded argument civilization through
our technology well you're almost
calling it a natural or evolution you're
almost calling this evolution aren't you
you're saying it will be human it will
be part of it it is interesting we
actually we talked about this in
Fantastic Voyage how our technology
actually is a continuation of the of the
evolutionary process that led to the
technology creating species in the first
place well that's almost like a religion
then or it could be an N by the way
it's an observation about evolution
evolution accelerates the first step
that the evolution of DNA took billions
of years and it's a nature of evolution
that works through indirection it
creates something and then it uses that
something to create the next stage
uh-huh
so then it used DNA the Cambrian
explosion you know what a hundred times
faster and biological evolution kept
speeding up than our species Homo
sapiens evolved in only a few hundred
thousand years then the next step which
was the first steps of technology went a
little bit faster took only tens of
thousands of years for fire the wheel
stone tools then we always use the
latest generation of technology to
create the next stage of technology
today we use the most advanced computers
to design new ones the next generation
of computers and only things you know a
few months to do that major paradigm
shifts like the World Wide Web
we should really transform things only
took a few years to come into being
oh I you know I I don't know how I feel
about what you're describing is possible
future where man will take as an
evolutionary step a sort of a mating
with machines and and it will seem
natural but I can tell you right now
right for example you're being heard you
know throughout the entire nation but
just fine right on through the Bible
Belt right and there's a whole bunch of
people there that would have a lot to
say about some of the things you've
talked about for example chips implanted
chips that sort of thing they have
incredible I can tell you right now you
give out your email address if you have
the cojones to do that and and you'll
get some email and you'll see what I
mean I'm not up there with people from
many different kinds of backgrounds and
there actually is not religious
opposition or or opposition from
conservative religious folks for example
to this FDA implant for for people with
Parkinson's disease and there is there
isn't really opposition to providing
using
his lands for people who are weapon
through stroke are paralyzed and can't
control their environment so you're
saying once they have some disabling
disease like this everything else gets
wiped away and they jump for it well I
think we do have a consensus in our
society to alleviate human suffering
overcome disease we have been expressing
back our longevity in Fantastic Voyage
we talk about how longevity has been
progressing you know through
technological innovation and we now have
this technological innovation going on
through biotechnology where we're
mastering the information processes
underlying biology there are people who
would say that the whole thing is not
natural right now and you must talk to
people like that that you know we're not
we're not human beings are not just
fruit hanging from the tree vine to fall
on the ground I mean if we are the
species that seeks to solve problems it
seeks to go beyond our limitations we
didn't stay on the ground we didn't stay
on the planet
we have not stayed with the limitations
or biology we've been pushing human life
expectancy and that's really why we sort
of expressed in Fantastic Voyage this
urgency to use today's knowledge to stay
in good shape because you don't want to
be the last person on the line in the
you know to the theater to not fit in
young the theater of Health which you
know biotechnology and nanotechnology go
to break drink so you think the
opposition to this whole idea and I'm
talking about life extension the
possibility of living forever toying
with genetics I mean there are a bunch
of people out there array that think
it's all unnatural and wrong we've been
toying with genetics for breeding it's
hard for 200 years and in much more of a
natural manner zone well you know we use
all kinds of genes that are not natural
I mean drugs surgery are not natural we
have more common tations and
replacements for many other different
parts of our body I mean we're not just
living a natural life like plants and
animals and
we are the species that has created
technology to you know better our lot in
life and if you compare life today to
even a few hundred years ago it's
tremendous difference people live lives
of tremendous poverty hard work disease
and misfortune right I'm just saying
there there are a group of people but
don't agree with you you you realize it
right or do you think it's all important
understand that you know if I described
the world in 2020 or 2030 it's not as if
we're going to wake up one day and take
this huge leap to that world we're going
to get there day at a time and there are
new developments and they may seem
controversial at first I mean consider
new reproductive technologies like
test-tube babies that was very
controversial for six months but then
people got used to it and now it's just
part of the landscape I mean these new
ideas point these new ideas occur you
get used to them some ideas we decide
are not a good idea they don't succeed
in the marketplace or then they don't
make sense and they don't they don't
stay with us so it through our own
experience with it the marketplace
testing with the FDA so on certain
things will work and some won't we'll
sort out what really enhances human life
there's a big guy you mentioned the FDA
there's a big controversy now about
whether the FDA is in fact testing
stringently enough for what is your view
well my view is that the FDA really
slows down how these innovations and
what we're not giving enough weight is
what is the cost of delaying life-saving
treatments if you have a drug that could
really reduce heart attacks and the FDA
because it's getting all this pressure
to be careful delays it in extra year
two years three years how many people
are going to die as a result of that but
that seems to get no political pressure
because people have been dying from
these diseases you know for a long time
nobody blames the FDA for dying from a
disease whereas you know a few people
die of a drug that's approved and you
know then there's congressional hearings
and
political fallout so they're in
tremendous pressure not to approve
things
mm-hm and if they don't approve
something nobody nobody gives them a
hard time for failing to approve
something is you know god forbid they
approve something and then some people
die you know if you people die in gene
therapy trials and their congressional
hearings and all the research who stops
for six months I mean how many you could
make it strong cases hundreds of
thousands of people ultimately will die
as a result of that delay but you can't
name them is it's a very diffuse so now
so in my view we need to balance the
cost of delay and nothing is risk-free
and God knows these diseases like heart
disease and cancer which we're gaining
the tools to make progress again are not
free of risk I mean you know millions of
people die each year across the world
and from these diseases um turn on my
interest that the you know this pressure
for the FDA to slow things down I mean
they're going to react like a
bureaucracy and just slow everything
down and that's going to ultimately
expand human suffering mm-hmm if if all
if all limitations were removed on stem
cell research of all the different lines
including other ones that are now
forbidden and all other if the FDA just
virtually wasn't there and people could
turn out things and just put them
directly into human consumption would
with that speed all this up tremendously
I think I think we need to reconsider
how we balance risk I'm not saying we
shouldn't do testing and although we
should not have regulation I think that
the emphasis should be on safety I think
we can let the marketplace and sort out
efficacy
I think the imposition should be on
safety and I think we need to balance
the risks of delay and realize that
there are risks in interventions but
it's not as if doing nothing is
risk-free if you if you heard and you
followed all of this
obviously been through the regimen and
so forth if you heard ray that the
Chinese had developed something
incredible I'll just use the Chinese as
an example it could be the French or
anybody else I know the French um and
and and they had a radical life
extension uh would you be so motivated
as to and get so excited as to go to
China and get this treatment if it was
available and to hell with the FDA and
whatever all else well I mean they have
to evaluate each situation I mean
general these technologies and companies
whether they're Chinese French or
American companies are worldwide
companies and serve the worldwide market
and certainly China their whole business
model is to export you know their
technology and keep it around the world
so generally you don't have to go to
another country you know unless
something is banned here which that was
a regulatory problem that's not because
it was invented but what I'm saying is
if there was some magic bullet that the
FDA had improved therefore it wasn't
available in America and you could
travel to get it you you seem to be
pursuing very hard life extension I
would assume you would get on a plane
yeah I do and go I mean in the
hypothetical situation that I had some
fatal disease and the only treatment was
available somewhere else and that's
actually convinced that was a good thing
yes well sure I would consider that
mm-hmm but I think a really important
thing and what we talked about in
Fantastic Voyage is to avoid getting
into those quandary right these things
heart disease cancer they don't strike
you out of the blue and you can actually
find out where you are we talked about
how you can test yourself to see where
you want a progression of these diseases
and stop those processes right before
they get to a critical point it's the
medical profession the trillion dollars
we spent or more on medical care is
really the after clinical expression of
these diseases and that's what the
medical profession is trained to do and
very often that's too late it's like
waiting until you fall off the cliff
it's a lot easier to deal with these
things early on early obvious where
they've really manifested themselves
alright ray read about the hour hold on
ray kurzweil was my guest we're gonna
open the lines let you ask questions
here shortly
any
well when you talk about artificial
intelligence again because I just saw it
and because I was so impressed by the I
don't know the incredible animations and
I I Robot nevertheless there I am with
iRobot again as we talk about this and
of course ultimately and this is a good
question for rain ultimately the robots
decided that all the three laws
considered the Three Laws of Robotics
that would be the perfect circle of
protection for human beings their robots
decided on within the context of those
laws that human beings were doing things
that were basically so harmful and so
detrimental to continued human existence
that for our own benefit and our own
that well safety that everything would
have to change that the way we do busier
on earth you know the polluting the wars
that we have all those things that might
put a big old dent in life extension no
matter what you do that these things
were so dangerous that they would have
to take over and make it right ray why
is there reason to believe that wouldn't
happen well I don't think it's gonna be
two different civilizations we are
extending our intelligence already with
our machines and the machines we're
creating are really an extension of our
own intelligence they'll be based on
your intelligence I'm going to created
by human beings so you don't even see
we're gonna merge with their technology
aren't the biggest impact is we're going
to extend our biological intelligence so
that intimate merger with non-violence
right so you don't even see the kind of
robots that they portrayed there at all
you you see more of a meshing of the
human and the machine well I think we
will see both I mean there will be
systems machines that are just
non-biological that also are as
intelligent as humans but I think the
most important phenomena is that it's
not going to be a clear distinction and
it's going to be one civilization I
think we're already a you know
a human technology civilization we do
things that routinely we couldn't do
without our technology but Ray if we can
create machines you said as intelligent
as people by 2029 then one would imagine
by 2050 nine will be well into the area
of much more intelligent than people and
there there are some considerations
there are they're not much sooner than
that I mean but only 30 years I think
the non-biological portion of our
intelligence as a species will will
predominate but it will get in my view
that's still human and I think the
problem stem some misconception about
the the idea of a machine we have an
idea that a machine is something much
less valuable than a human being much
less subtle much less intelligence and
you think as valuable as intellectually
and in every other way we can measure
including emotionally yes I mean that
these are we should really come up with
a new word because these are not much
any kind of machine that we've ever met
but that's really the the key message we
talk about that some extended Fantastic
Voyage in the third bridge this was
really trying to get you to this era of
nanotechnology and artificial
intelligence we will have these very
powerful technologies I mean enabling us
to radically extend our longevity it's
just one implication we're also going to
greatly expand our experiences for
example to a full immersion virtual
reality and it also expands our
intelligence well again right how would
we protect against a greater
intelligence than ourselves deciding
that we're indulging self-destructive
behavior and then changing that well as
I say no I mean right now our computer
technology is not a world apart it's
very integrated into our civilization we
have conflicts within our civilization
but it's on a conflict between humans
and machines we probably will have
conflicts between different factions
within our civilization as we do them I
don't think that our conflict is going
to go away necessarily
but it's not going to be conflict
between humans and machines because
humans and machines are actually getting
closer and closer like you know when I
was a kid machines were behind glass
walls and very remote and then we had
the personal computing revolution and
then we had local computers under our
arms and then now we have computers in
our pockets and a few years to be woven
and our clothing and it's gonna make its
way into our bodies and brains
that's the third bridge we talked about
in Fantastic Voyage we'll have computers
little robots in our bloodstream and
there will go inside our bloodstream and
actually keep us healthy they'll sell my
pathogens reverse Southers grossest kill
cancer cells so I say what about our
body we're part human we're part machine
you would say no we're just in a evolved
human that's right I think I think it's
the nature of our species our specie
seeks to improve ourselves improve our
world
I mean idea that natural is good I mean
the tsunami was natural you know we try
to improve human existence and human
experience and it avoids some of the
harshness of of nature I mean nature was
very harsh people lived in caves
thousands of years ago even 200 years
ago life was extremely hard I mean you
know read Dickens as what life was like
sure a few hundred years ago is just you
know for 99% of human population was
extremely harsh so we've liberated
ourselves you know to some extent from
that harshness we've extended human
longevity from 37 to now almost 80 in
200 years and I think we're going to see
you in longevity you know take a huge
very rapid rise what as we master the
processes underlying biology and then
we're developing the tools to actually
change those processes to overcome
disease and the processes underlying
aging all right all right I'd like
through the lines we have a lot of
people who want to ask something or
contribute something first time caller
line you're on the air with Ray Kurzweil
hello I art hi it's Andy Cohen where are
you Andy I'm in Ontario Canada okay
that's why I don't like the base of the
Bruce
insula that separates Lake Huron from
Georgian Bay yes okay and I have a
chance here maybe to ask you guys a
question that I've never had the answer
to but it ties into what you guys are
talking about tonight okay now I'm gonna
maybe just tight a couple of things
together here I've noticed in my
experience in life and other people's
comments that you know as you get older
time seems to come at you faster right
and and here's a comparison here as you
turn your conventional radio dial up
from a lower frequency as you turn it as
at the same rate the frequency comes at
you faster mm-hmm now in the movie 2001
a Space Odyssey the Apes were using the
tool the bone to attack the other eight
right and they tossed the bone up and
that bone became the rib of that
orbiting space station okay you have
enough to rush to it here okay
yeah now what I'm getting at here is you
know as time goes on a technology
exponentiate that seems to be you know
that's a given
now now in the movie 2001 where they're
they sped up in the craft and and
they're going Lightspeed and the guy
winds up in the room with his
grandfather or that grandfatherly of
being of himself himself and that child
offspring the three of them were in the
room in that room together as if time
had sped up like everything I understand
in the cosmos is circular and how you're
relating all of that all of this and and
and and how and as time speeds up like
that it's 4:30 in the morning here and I
was on my way to bed and and anyway how
you realize that to this well I could
give it a shot all right go ahead right
you're giving different examples of of
Exponential's and
exponential growth is seductive it seems
like things are moving very slowly and
suddenly they explode and you alluded to
the fact that technology does add music
and he said there was obvious I agree
with you but not everybody understands
that I mean one of the main themes that
we are particulate in in this book that
dr. Grossman and I wrote Fantastic
Voyage is that these technologies grow
exponentially and a lot of stuff even
sophisticated scientist even Nobel Prize
winners don't get that I've had
arguments about because they feel
they've solved one percent of a problem
over the last year and it'll take 100
years to solve the problem our
understanding of biology is growing
exponentially we're doubling our
knowledge of biology doubling the amount
of genetic data we're sequencing
doubling our knowledge of the brain
every year so you know ten years from
now would be a very different world
we'll have very powerful tools because
of this exponential growth and that's
really should provide the motivation to
stay healthy today so they were in good
shape when we have those more powerful
technologies but it does it again does
it shock you to know that not everybody
agrees with you not everybody thinks
that what you envision coming or even
being inevitable is a good thing they
think it's not a good thing and that
it's not natural and what do you say to
those people well you know people look
back idyllically it's a wonderful
natural life we had 200 years ago
unencumbered by technology but if you do
any reading about what life was really
like 200 years ago you realized that you
know a single misfortune could would put
a family into desperation there were no
social safety nets misfortune was all
around you because nymphal infection was
yes would be a disaster since we had no
antibiotics there's no sanitation there
was take six hours to cook the evening
meal life was extremely hard and brutal
got all that and it's better now um I
agree with you but there are still
people who say this is not natural
frankly let's just cut right to it that
you live your natural life right and
then you die and then you
progress you go to heaven your soul
moves out of its physical body and
something very natural occurs they have
great faith in that and and so when I'm
saying these folks we've had no
alternative but to try to describe how
death is really a good thing but I think
everyone would agree that if we have the
means to stay healthy and alive that
that's what we should do I mean none of
the major religions say that we should
fail in helping people who are taken
it's not a question that people just
suddenly die I mean there's a tremendous
amount of suffering involved for these
diseases cancer heart disease and these
are very difficult conditions and you
know we will have we never knowledge
right now which we talk about in the
book to really prevent these diseases is
medication I appreciate that
but I I mean there are people who say
that nevertheless these diseases and the
suffering is part of life that they
accept or even look forward to in stage
as much as middle stage and beginning
stage I mean do you think that if there
really was an alternative those views
would change very quickly and those
people that believe that and there are a
lot of them ray would just suddenly say
ah please that's not anymore keep me a
lot baby well you know I mean how many
people really are willing to relinquish
all of you know medical science and
technology altogether I mean in general
if somebody has a disease most people
there are faiths or or not will seek you
know the most sophisticated treatment
that they have access to to alleviate
suffering you know and I think there's a
general consensus I in the idea of
progress of overcoming what afflicts us
and that is and that has support and
well of course it has support and it has
my support I'm just saying there are
those of different belief systems
wild card liner on the air with Ray
Kurzweil's hi good evening earth hi
where are you sir I'm calling from Hilo
Hawaii Hawaii all right welcome to the
program thank you my name is Paul ray I
have a question regarding the stem cell
issue are you familiar with whether or
not it's they're working on being able
to for instance create joints human
joints either using a template and using
stem cells that direction hand or or
directly injecting stem cells to improve
joins I I have a severe degenerative
joints and I sure would like to be able
to stick around but sticking around is
kind of things lost at this point and I
was kind of hoping that there is a
option out there using the stem cell
research to you know do we replace
cartilage and stuff like that Ian do you
know I bet that's a yes
let's find out right well I mean there
is experimentation with using using stem
cells to regrow all kinds of tissues
even give a nervous system tissue and
there there are successful experiments
in animals I think we're quite a ways
from practical therapies in human beings
I think we're going to circumvent the
whole embryonic issue there's some very
interesting proposals for being able to
actually create stem cells without
embryos or at least without destroying
embryos the most interesting thing is
actually be able to harness your own
cells either use adults themselves your
own bodies that have your DNA or even
you know turn your skin cells into other
types of cells like cartilage or
whatever cells you need anything into
anything virtually right and we've
actually done some preliminary
experiments we I mean the medical
scientific community in a in a petri
dish of taking skin cells and turning
them into several other types of cells
by controlling the gene expression so
these are the kinds of things I will
they will come to pass I believe in the
next
10 to 15 years and some of the early
fruits of this are actually already in
the testing I was learning the means of
actually directly controlling the
information processes of blocking a key
enzyme or blocking a gene and we talked
about you know probably 50 different
projects like that in fantastic ways
well and when you get to this Fantastic
Voyage point haven't you put evolution
in your own hands I think it's not
question that human technology has you
know trumped evolution I mean we are
making already making dramatic changes
in the nature of human life and
biological evolution works in such a
slow scale that I'm you know we will be
vastly changing the nature of human life
long before the extremely slow pace of
biological evolution could possibly
affect human beings I mean the cutting
edge of the evolutionary process is not
biological evolution now its
technological isms could they put
something together
that ultimately would grow a new human
appendage for example appendage yes a
new appendage you know like a wheel an
arm now right a left and right arm
suppose we had an arm in the middle of
our back I you know I don't know it
doesn't matter I'm asking if they might
get to the technological stage where
such thing would be possible well you
know when we fully reverse-engineer
urology which I believe we will do over
the next couple of decades we will have
the means of modifying biology and
changing it anyway we want I mean
handing another advantage is probably
not something that we'd want to do but
what we will want to do is overcome
disease into ten or twelve processes
underlying aging and stop them and
reverse them enhance our mental
functioning our emotional capabilities
you know this is what's coming and
that's why in Fantastic Voyage we spend
two-thirds of the book on how to take
care of yourself now sending our IQ
through the roof
well sure we'll be able to expand human
intelligence I mean right now we do all
our thinking on interneuronal
connections that process that elect
electrochemical speeds chemical
switching speeds of a few hundred feet
per second it's a million times slower
than electronic speed all right da-rae
hold it right there we're at the top of
the hour
I was once heard when you could turn
brown eyes blues and you'd be able to
cure AIDS
and I guess it will all be just as
natural as ma and apple pie as it
happens as easily as we have adapted to
computers and now the internet we will
simply continue to adapt until man meets
machine and I guess falls in love I have
several questions for you Ray one is
with respect to the regimen in Fantastic
Voyage if one were to follow that all
the way through how much money would
somebody spend it's a legit question I
mean - you know well actually it's not
very expensive no we do provide
comprehensive program I refers to start
with our book Fantastic Voyage live long
enough to live forever which is very
expensive and really provides a
comprehensive guide nutrition I mean the
mainstay of the nutritional program is
vegetables and small amount of fruits
and so on and that's never expense oh no
no all right there's a medical side to
this right have a meeting you know walk
there rather than take a taxi that lucky
save you money
uh-huh we do have a website fantastic -
voyage net that actually has a whole
summary of the recommendations on there
and then we have a side ray and Terry
comm where we actually provide the basic
supplements actually quotes well under a
thousand dollars a year for the whole ok
supplement program now that's for a
basic program one of the key messages in
the book that we describe in detail is
to find out what your issues are to
develop a personalized program so for
example you have let's say a high C
reactive protein that was in the news
last week you'd want to get that down
and take more omega-3 fats and we have a
supplement to that Ray what about the
Wilder stuff and by that I mean I've had
doctors on the show who are saying that
injections of hormone growth and things
at that level also now our part
legitimate part of this and they get a
little pricey well we don't support
human growth Hall actually has shown not
to be consistent with life extension may
actually do the opposite you know in the
absence of you know clear medical
certain medical diseases in general
human a horrible human growth hormone is
not something that dr. Grossman our I
recommend okay that's insulting you know
very interesting in general it's not
that expensive but you know if you have
a serious problem will tell you
cholesterol is very high then you would
want to take action and right there are
supplements like they we described on
Ray and Terry calm that can lower your
cholesterol again these are not that
expensive and the importance of not
doing these things yes all right can
they can these supplements do as much as
going to a physician and getting another
a certain number of drugs that are
fda-approved now right ray that
cholesterol certainly recommend that you
work with your doctor will give you
guidance actually to find a doctor who
for example is nutritionally aware so
this is not in lieu of this is a long
with yeah and in fact statin drugs are
beneficial they not only lower
cholesterol but they actually appear to
lower inflammation which is also an
independent cause of heart disease and
other diseases very but if you take
statin drugs it's important to
supplement with coenzyme q-10 because
statin drugs deplete the body of
coenzyme q-10 and that's something we
talked about in Fantastic Voyage that
it's generally not well known a lot of
doctors don't tell their patients to do
that and it's a great and that a lot of
the side effect that you get from statin
drugs are because of this depletion and
it's easily rectified by supplementing
the concept I'm so this is the kind of
thing we talk about all right all right
here we go used to the Rockies you're on
the air with Ray Kurzweil or hi I first
while I should say sorry about that
vehicle people
have you read the book warp speed A+ no
book discusses I did a separation of the
soft and regenerative biochemistry from
hard chemistry and that the name of the
book again please what speed A+ works
speed a + and also discusses how
socialized automation shall fund
socialized biochemistry and is
automation ISM Chalfont biochemistry ISM
right that making sense to you
I'm not familiar with the book let's
hear what the question is not naughty
have you read the book no the answer is
no oh it's a good read ok all right take
care
sorry with the book I guess you can't
tell us and so we can't comment let's do
the Rockies you're on the air with rate
for as well running in my time um anyway
no I had a I don't see why people would
have a problem with with religion as far
as religion and and automating the brain
and all this kind of stuff you don't
think so huh III don't think I mean
isn't isn't it I look at I read the
Bible a long time ago thought it was had
a fascination with it and as soon as I
had kids I noticed it looked more like
the parental magazine to me I mean it
told me a lot about you know you don't
put your hand in the cookie jar the kid
puts his hand in the cookie jar got to
smack don't do it again ok I won't know
what I'm sorry I'm sorry yes it does it
again and again and again and there's
stories over and over again about that
happening and like I said soon as I had
kids I see that same thing you know
don't run in the halls run down the
stairs they keep doing it you're telling
no they do it again and it won't be the
point being that what do you want from
your kids you want your kids to better
themselves you want them to be better
than you are and I mean not to say we
should go out and become gods
but people have a problem saying that
that's what you're doing you're playing
God you're trying to create life you're
trying to no and isn't that what I want
my kids to be better than I am so
to college I didn't go to you know get a
free figure job whatever it is get a
bigger house better family then I did
and I don't know he how that would be a
problem
I mean the but the Protestant ethic is
support city of work creative work
bettering the world the Puritans and the
shakers were actually very inventive
people and created you know inventions
that bettered society I think you know a
lot of the thinking that emerges from
religious thought is supportive of the
idea of progress and bettering the world
that we live in not just being subject
to bettering by nature without you know
seeking to improve or overcome human
suffering well I guess what some would
say ray is that we are in the sense that
we understood a god about to become gods
that is create torus and that's it's an
interesting argument I mean the the
technological advances that you're
describing do lead to the point where
many would say we would be able to do
god-like things right well you know we
are our technology and our reach as
humans through our technology is
expanding exponentially as may seem from
today's perspective or what will be
feasible many decades from now may seem
from today's perspective to be infinite
but actually you know when we get there
it won't be infinite it'll just be you
know a lot more capable than today well
create our conception of God these you
know God is described as being infinite
in knowledge and creativity intelligence
so I would say that evolution you know
particularly technological evolution
today moves in what you could call a
spiritual direction because it moves
towards greater intelligence and greater
creativity greater beauty
and that's a that's a positive direction
to move in and you're a positive guy ray
but there's a race on on the one side
there is the Ray Kurzweil and dr.
Grossman's
who are trying to do good things for a
long life and make the world a better
place for all of us and on the other
side this is the race part we have
people who wish us dead they don't want
to make deals with us right they've
given up on that part they just want to
blow us up or extinguish us or whatever
either the world is a really dangerous
place ray and so there's a race on and I
and I suppose you're optimistic about
who's gonna win well I mean like
actually in Fantastic Voyage we talk
about promise for apparel and I've
talked about that inter my other
writings and Technology does empower our
destructive side I mean even 9/11 was
the misapplication of technologies yes
and buildings of London right and some
of these new technologies biotechnology
which can cure cancer ultimately will
also could deer you know empower a
bioterrorist to cause cancer right now
you know a good example actually of this
promise versus perils look at the
Internet we get wonderful things from
the internet but we also have software
viruses yes however I think your degree
that you know the benefit outweighs the
danger you know very few people if any
are calling let's are saying let's do
away with the internet because you know
and that's why I have higher because in
front end is that we we do keep we do
have a technological immune system that
has emerged that well it doesn't save us
from all of the destruction of software
viruses does protect us from a lot of it
and I think we'll see the same thing in
these other technologies we need to
accelerate the development of for
example broad antiviral technology so
that we can protect ourselves from a
malevolent use of this technology
uh-huh that's why I'm so darn worried
about the ban on certain cell lines
because believe it or not we do have
enemies
in this world and some of them are
working in areas that we were not
working in well it's a good argument for
continuing stem-cell research because
these technologies will enable us to
protect ourselves and it is a race you
know it is feasible you know to create a
bio engineered virus and I don't think
we'll see that very soon but ultimately
we probably will encounter that and we'd
better have the defense's ready when
that happens Sirena the kind of world
that you say we're on the edge of is the
kind of world that dr. michio kaku
describes as a stage one for example
where zero type zero now and we would be
type 1 we'd make that that leap recently
he's up the odds and he's a little more
optimistic but for years he told me the
chance of our getting you know he looks
at all the stars and all the planets
that we can see in those we can't even
see and imagines one of the reasons we
might not have had contact yet from
anywhere else is because a lot of
civilizations have come to the point
where we are now or near that point and
instead of making the leap to type one
the optimistic scenario the more likely
scenario is that they kill themselves
yeah I don't agree with that I think
it's possible that a civilization might
destroy itself when it gets to a
particularly powerful stage but it's
hard to you know the assumption
underlying the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence is that
there must be since there are trillions
of planets out there there must be
millions of civilizations
yeah well many of them would be ahead of
us yes and if they're ahead of us are
going to be had a you know since
technology moves so quickly when it gets
to our stage many of them would be
vastly more powerful than us it's not
credible to believe that every single
one of them you know blew themselves up
there is a there is some risk but I mean
let me go back to this Internet example
meant you know when sort of viruses
first emerged there were predictions
that ultimately software viruses would
be so destructive it would destroy the
Internet but I mean that hasn't happened
they're still around there there
nuisance sometimes they're more than a
nuisance yes but they're not they
haven't destroyed the internet not yet
and they haven't destroyed the
effectiveness of it and we live with
both the promise in the peril and I say
you look at the Internet the promise of
ways the peril and it hasn't destroyed
itself so I think it's actually unlikely
it's possible you know some of these
technologies could conceivably destroy
us I mean we have that already with
Renault okay let's write nuclear weapons
that's definitely a category but um that
aside for a moment you referred to the
fact that I I've written a book or two
or four actually and one of them I'm
very concerned about Rea and that is if
you look at the environmental state of
the world I'm actually far more
concerned about that than you know an
irrational act of destruction but you
can't you can't move that out I'm
concerned about I don't know the melting
of the North Pole and the changes that
are going on right now on our on our
globe I'm very concerned about that
that's part of the brace you know all of
that is industrial error pollution the
third stage that we talked about in
Fantastic Voyage nanotechnology will
actually enable us to reverse a lot of
that for example we'll be able to create
solar panels I can actually create all
of the energy we need if we converted
0.07% of the sunlight that falls in the
earth we could meet all of our energy
needs we can't do that today the solar
panels are heavy expensive and
inefficient nanotechnology will enable
us to create very inexpensive very
efficient solar panel or panels we will
store the energy and nano-engineered
fuel cells and actually meet our energy
needs in a renewable way without
pollution there are ways so we can use
that of technology to reverse the
pollution that dust realization is
created and Rhea do you think this will
occur nanotechnology can reverse the
pollution inside our bodies quickly
enough oh we have many people saying we
are now at peak oil that may or may not
be but there is going to come a time
when we're not
going to be able to get as much oil or
the price of it is going to be
prohibitive that's where we're headed
and so do you see nanotechnology
arriving in time to prevent an otherwise
catastrophic strike on the economy and
more well we may be past Peak Oil in
terms of very inexpensive access to oil
I mean we didn't have actually a lot of
fossil fuels
oh yes and there's many different types
in it's a long discussion but there are
types that are you know a hundred times
greater than the oil we've been using
but there are more expensive to get I'd
like share and so on so energy may pop
up energy from fossil fuels will get
more expensive gradually possibly over
the next decade or so but that's a
gimmick is this actually going to create
more pressure to accelerate these new
technologies that are renewable well
that's what I'm asking do you see them
coming along in time I think so I mean
we may have some short-term economic
pressures because I really see the
golden era of nanotechnology based
energy also nanotechnology in the body
that we talked about in Fantastic Voyage
nanotechnology for manufacturing is
probably the piece of 2020s so we do
have to you know use some other
technologies like fossil fuels in this
in the meantime there are some new
technologies there as well there will
enable us to access some of these more
plentiful technologies for example coal
can be converted into energy without
pollution and this in demonstration
plans to do exactly that you know we
need to invest more in these new
technologies which I think will you know
how for a substantial pay off but it's
such a race right I mean the Chinese now
and the rest of the world rightfully
want the kind of comforts and
technological level that we have here in
the US and they're quickly moving in
that direction other the problem is of
course that with that there you know
thing into all of the things that we
have like emissions from vehicles and
all the rest of it so it's it is indeed
a race and it's going to be interesting
to see how that race turns out anyway
hold tight ray we're at the bottom the
outer rate for a while is my guess and
we're talking about where technology is
taking us and it's really an interesting
place according to Ray depending on how
you feel about it it's not a world where
robots run everything into everything
for us like many of us imagined not that
world but a world instead where the
machines and mankind in a very natural
kind of way merged and that is our
evolution evolution is in our hands
think about that we will be our own gods
not sure what an optimal design would be
but probably not one that includes heart
attacks cancer and all the other things
that kill ascend or make us sick you
would say I suppose that nature's design
is not optimal if it includes all of
those things ray do you agree with that
that it's not optimal that nature is not
dying I mean nature is remarkable but
it's not optimum and this is an issue
that actually dr. Grossman and I discuss
a great length hi ma'am in our book
Fantastic Voyage lived long enough to
live forever on the key issues is that
you know when our genes evolved tens of
thousands of years ago a lot of things
were different there was not any
interest of the species for you and I to
live much past childbearing age because
we didn't really contribute anything we
just used up the precious resources
there was no selection for long
longevity useless eaters within the
interest of the species for our bodies
to hold on to every calorie we talked
about this before we'd like to actually
you know change that permanent we've
been our identified that it's one gene
the fat insulin receptor gene that
controls that if we could block that in
the fat cells we could eat as much as we
want to remain slim and that's been
demonstrated in mice we talked about
that experiment in Fantastic Voyage
there's a lot of things we'd like to
change in our genes and we're actually
getting the tools now to change our
genes so that's the biotechnology
revolution which is in its early stages
already reach its full fruition or ten
to fifteen years from now we'll have the
means of actually changing these ancient
genetic programs to be optimal so that
we don't have heart attacks you don't
have cancer duck diabetes is actually a
lot more we can do already right now
with today's knowledge this is what we
call bridge one in Fantastic Voyage to
really dramatically slow down these
disease and aging processes very few
people really need to get a heart attack
you can we can avoid the vast majority
of these degenerative diseases through
nutrition through
sensible supplement program exercise and
so on and we describe that in a lot of
detail in the book all right a lot of
people want to speak so used to the
Rockies you're on the air with the rake
repairs well hi oh yes floor hi
turn your radio off please yes I did sir
this is Keith and Hamilton Ontario far
away Keith okay it's always good to talk
to things really guests I don't know
whether I'd like to live forever but I'd
like to live to a ripe old age of 200
hours of the aging first I was wondering
how you feel about courage ethics huh oh
that good question
um well you know the argument cryogenics
is it's a good insurance policy is it
and that the alternative is the have no
hope if you die you know I'm I find it
hard enough to advance my interests when
I'm you know alive and kicking and I
know telling daunting to consider
advancing my interest you know what if
I'm frozen so I think that's a personal
decision I wouldn't try to influence
people's decisions really what dr.
Grossman and I advocate is that you do
everything possible to achieve radical
life extension you know not by being
frozen or by being healthy today so that
you can so that we can be healthy 10-15
years ago you have these very powerful
new yes but but assuming the worst
perhaps it sounds as though you might
make the decision not to do that
personally well I really would leave it
to people don't understand right not
it's not the attractive way to go okay
healthy is really effective Grady there
all right and the second thing Homer
okay I just thought it was critically
panned and I don't think many of the
audience liked it but I was wondering
what he thought of are still Berg's
movie a I okay thank you well I mean I
had some positive elements and two
elements of it
the problem I had with the movie and I
have this with most features movies is
it took one change in that case
human-level cyborgs and put it on
today's world if nothing else is gonna
change there was no virtual reality the
cars were the same
there was no merging of human and
machine humans were just like they were
today
there's no advances and so your answer
then to the boredom that would otherwise
ensue is that all areas will advance and
you'll have virtual entertainment by the
time you've meshed with the machine
somewhere down the line and you can live
vicariously anything you want I mean a
third bridge in Fantastic Voyage is this
nanotechnology AI revolution and we're
going to be able to for example have
full-immersion virtual reality from
within the nervous system so you want to
go into virtual reality the nanobots
shut down the signals coming from your
real senses replaced them with the
signals that you would be receiving in
the virtual environment and it feels
just like during that environment you
can choose from thousands of different
environments to be with you can be in
you can go there with other people you
and I right now are in auditory virtual
reality but we'll be able to add all of
the other senses and have experiences
with people in these virtual
environments so that's one way which we
will expand our experiences yes and is
there not a danger that that it would be
so virtually excused upon irresistable
then it would be like today's drugs and
virtual reality is still reality and
you're having real experiences well with
real people in virtual environments I
mean considered the telephone
you don't say that well I had a
telephone conversation but there wasn't
a real conversation there was those
weren't real agreements even though
telephone is a virtual reality
environment for the auditory sense so
it's it's really a communication medium
you can think of it as a telephone where
we add all of the human senses so that
we can be together even if we're not
physically prompted yes but doesn't that
lead away from the physical and like in
the song 20 in the year 2525 eventually
we're just vegetative intellectual
entities
that are now part of machines and we're
operating fabulously but not in any way
physically particularly we've evolved
into a complete mental being with our
machines will also be physical and will
be enhancing ourselves physically as
well in fact all three bridges that we
talked about in Fantastic Voyage
enhanced ourselves physically we can
certainly do that with our health
immediately with the bridge one and then
with biotechnology we can protect our
biology and keep our physical bodies
going so they don't had as tropically
collapse from heart attacks and cancer
and so on and then with nanotechnology
we can actually extend ourselves
physically and make ourselves stronger
more capable more resilient and you
think that we would choose that I mean
what if there was a bridge for where
everything did become intellectual where
the physical virtually no longer
mattered isn't that a one possible
future scenario as everything virtual
becomes the new reality well you know a
lot of people look at these future
scenarios and think we're losing
something I really see them as super
sense of what we have today uh-huh
we're going to keep our physical reality
but we're going to be able to do a lot
more with it okay on here we go
short on time west of the Rockies on the
air with a break for as well hello all
right yeah my name is Joel San Diego I
just want to start off saying that I
love the show I get to listen as much as
I like to but uh the problem I become I
could see with all of this
nanotechnology and such would be that
the ones individual control of our lives
is given up to you know pretty much the
Internet what degree of free will do we
have anymore
a reasonable question ray well I don't
think we we considered the Internet
today it's actually a very democratizing
force like I wrote in the 1980s that the
centralized communication is coming
would probably destroy the Soviet Union
and we did see that we saw a great move
towards democracy through the 1990s and
even at other levels I mean for example
we talked about in fantastic ways
how patients go into the doctor's office
armed with knowledge from the internet
that not just dependent on their doctors
for all wisdom and knowledge somebody
has a chronic disease they join
discussion groups of people around the
world and really learn a great deal
about that so the Internet is very
democratizing it's liberating it can
really enhance our freedom and our
individual power and because it's
decentralized actually see it as
something that supports your individual
initiative ok our international line
you're on the air with Ray Kurzweil
hello oh whoops I didn't push button
international line sorry you're on the
air now hello there international line
speak hello nothing are there okay I
recently read an article about how aid
there could be a cure for AIDS on the
horizon within the next couple of years
and my grandfather wrote a story a
couple years back novel about how AIDS
there was a group within the Catholic
Church that were conspiring to eliminate
AIDS researching doctors to hold back
the vaccine because it was God's Way of
eliminating the gays what types of
groups do you think are there liked it's
note they're you know okay without
commenting on that specific allegation
Ray surely he's right about one thing
there will be radical groups as these
new technologies unfold that will be
truly radically opposed to their
implementation and so how do you comment
on that I how do you feel like that we
have a long history of medical progress
and we have a and controversy attended
our lives tremendously and we've
overcome any diseases and and we know
the second bridge
providing Fantastic Voyage is really
understanding very precisely each step
in diseases like AIDS or heart disease
and so on and being able to attack them
with very precise smart weapons that are
not indiscriminate is I mean these old
drugs that were finding now that happens
problems would not design that way there
are really very blunt instruments that
may have some benefits but as we're
finding out how many side effects these
new drugs done to rational drug design
where we can attack ones precise enzyme
or one antigen on the cell on the cell
of a camp on the surface of a cancer
cell and so on are much more precise and
doesn't mean that every one of these
will work these are very powerful tools
that will enable us to make very
substantial progress I mean there there
are my nights and reactionary
fundamentalist reactions to progress in
general I mean we see that in the world
today you know the biggest danger is
fundamentalism in general trying to
oppose progress and use technology
against us using sort of asymmetric
warfare yes it is again so that and I
think you know the way to combat that
I'm from posturing our there were
Craddock values in general is to really
hasten the development of the defensive
technologies right now that would mean
trying to develop you know antiviral
technologies medications that can combat
viral diseases if that's the biggest
danger you know over the next decade are
we devoting sufficient resources right
now to that effort in your opinion well
we should be devoting more you know I've
given testimony to Congress on that
uh-huh
we're actually fairly close to
developing some very powerful tools
against viral diseases a side effect of
that a side benefit of doing this would
be making tremendous progress in general
against Arnall diseases so I think we
should accelerate that because it is a
race as you put it out okay first time
color line you're on the air with
first of all hello yes how you doing I'm
doing fine sir where are you I'm in la
vida Colorado okay far away yes my
question for the caller is is that I
understand where you're going with all
of this you know these technologies to
help us but you know it seems like that
all of these technologies are really
just kind of treating the symptoms and
not the cause so what my question is to
you is you know with us constantly given
our power away technology don't you
think we need to kind of go back to
looking at why these things are
happening these illnesses in our life
that they're asking us to look deeper in
our lives and let's go oh what kind of
problems we're having in our own lives
well I think if you you know read are
both Fantastic Voyage
just fine we actually describe
fundamentally how these diseases come
about and we even talk about things like
balance and life and stress management
and we talk about nutrition and exercise
and so on and really trying to address
the fundamental causes of heart disease
and cancer and so on which are actually
nutritional diseases and caused by
decades of the wrong diet so we do talk
about that and as we actually understand
an increasingly reverse engineer the
processes underlying these diseases as
well as aging ultimately will have from
biotechnology much more powerful tools
to actually stop and reverse these
diseases and conditions and aging kind
of curiosity right these these dietary
changes that you talked about and the
the nutritional supplements that you
talked about are they eligible or is the
kind of life that you've got to lead
near nearly a cloistered life I mean are
you selling eating it's a very moderate
program with
is not radically low-carbon that
