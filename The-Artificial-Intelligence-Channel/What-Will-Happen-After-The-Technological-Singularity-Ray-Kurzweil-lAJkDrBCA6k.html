only about a dozen computers in all of
New York City now we all carry multiple
computers in our pockets and our belts
the computation is a lot more pervasive
than these gadgets we carry around take
this rock for example it doesn't look
like it's doing very much but it has
trillions of trillions of atoms and
molecules in here they're all moving
around bouncing against each other at
incredibly high speeds
that's computation that's not very
useful today it's organized kind of
randomly we can't communicate with it
very well but we're gonna change that
we're gonna reorganize the vast amount
of computation in this rock to make it
useful and it won't just be raw
computation will infuse it with
exquisitely intelligent software vastly
greater than our intelligence today and
with all the knowledge of the human
machine civilization this rock is going
to be a trillion trillion times more
powerful than all biological human
brains today this is going to be quite a
valuable Rock we call matter and energy
reorganized in this way
copy TRO neom we're gonna reach these
limits late in this century and at that
time we're gonna turn many of the rocks
and other stuff suitable for computation
into computronium and so to keep the
expansion of our intelligence going we
will then need to spread out to the rest
of the universe
turning some portion of it into
computronium how fast can we do this
that depends on whether or not we can
transcend or otherwise get around the
speed of light as a limit there are
suggestions that they may be subtle ways
of doing this one possibility
is to send intelligent nanobots through
wormholes which are basically shortcuts
- apparently far away places through
other spatial dimensions beyond the
three were familiar with wormholes
through space appear to be consistent
with our understanding of physics if it
is indeed feasible to either find or
build such wormholes our intelligence
will be so great they will be capable of
engineering these shortcuts to reach
other parts of the universe in brief
periods of time in that case we could
infuse the universe with our
intelligence rather quickly
it would require only another century
that is by the end of the 22nd century
to saturate the universe with carpet
ronia on the other hand if we can't get
around the speed of light it will take a
lot longer but in either case expanding
our intelligence throughout the universe
is our ultimate destiny cosmologists
today argue about whether the universe
will die in fire or ice fire means a big
Hut crunch basically the opposite of the
big bang ice means stars flying apart
eventually dying out both of these views
of cosmology assume that intelligence
has nothing to do with it that
intelligence is just a bit of
entertaining froth that dances in and
out of the dumb celestial forces that
rule the universe
but this perspective ignores the law of
accelerating returns as a result of the
exponential expansion of our knowledge
and skill the universe will ultimately
be infused with computron ium and with
the vast intelligence of our human
machine civilization
so the universe will wake up and we will
intelligently decide to debate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
