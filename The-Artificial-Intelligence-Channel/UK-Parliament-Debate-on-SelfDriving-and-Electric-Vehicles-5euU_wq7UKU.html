we start
before we begin observation and we
should turn off their mobile phone
devices the selection list for today is
available in the room and on the bill
website this shows how the selected
amendments have been grouped together
for debate amendments grouped together
generally on the same or similar to a
members put their name for leading a
member the group is called first other
members are then free to catch my eye to
speak on all any of the amendments
within that group a member may speak
more than once in a single debate at the
end of the debate on a group of
remembers I should call the member to
move the leading amendment again before
they sit down they will need indicated
their wish to withdraw the amendment or
seek a division if any member wishes to
press any other amendment or new Clause
in a group to a vote they need to let me
know I shall work on this sums of the
Minister wishes the committee to reach a
decision on all government members if
any our table please note that decisions
on amendments do not take place in the
order they are debated but in the order
they appear on the amendment paper in
other words debate occurs accorded the
selection group English decisions are
taken when we come to the clause which
the amendment affects I shall use my
discretion to decide whether to allow a
separatist and Park debate on individual
causes and schedules fall under debates
on the relevant amendments I hope this
explanation is helpful so we start now
with amendment 1 to Clause 1 with which
it will be convenient to consider
amendment 8 and new Clause 11 and I call
well thank you very much indeed sir
Edwards it's always an absolute pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship I'm
grateful for the opportunity to speak in
the bill generally and to the opponent
standing in my name which I'll come to
surely this gives the committee and
exciting opportunity to speak about the
potential to liberate many people who
are currently excluded from access to
rural transport the bill also provides
the opportunity to improve personal
transport arrangements quality which is
crucially important given the dire state
of the Empire
and the impact it's having on health I
want to begin the Sir Edward by thanking
the minister personally and from the
outset for his collegiate approach to
the bill I also thanked him for his
approach and his cooperation and
assistance in preparing for this session
and indeed for even allowing access to
his officials between my staff and
themselves it is genuinely appreciated
I beg to move amendment warning Clause 1
page 1 running at 10:00 at the end
insert subsection 1 a the secure
secretary of state must consult on and
publish the criteria they will use to
determine whether in their opinion a
motor vehicle is designed or adapted to
be careful in at least some
circumstances or situations of safely
driving themselves without having to be
monitored by an individual and in
Subsection 1b the secretary of state may
not change the criteria until further
consultation esteemed ways with vehicle
manufacturers insurers and other such
persons as the secretary of state
considers appropriate sir Edwin this
amendment improves the bill and I know
that the minister is intent on improving
the bill it improves the bill because it
requires the government to consult on
and publish criteria for the deaf ear
the definition of automated vehicles
that will be used barring the Secretary
of State Sarah wood as the committee can
see the current drafting of Clause one
puts the onus on the Secretary of State
in his or ere opinion to define what
constitutes an automated vehicle without
having to console the sector the will
that the bill in my view will be vastly
improved if there is a requirement to
consult and pub
the criteria by which they are defining
an automated vehicle secondly it
prevents the secretary of state changing
the criteria without consulting the
vehicle manufacturers insurers and other
such persons as the secretary state
considers to be a portal we're asking
for that consultation and publication of
the criteria because it's crucial for
manufacturers vehicle owners and insures
to know whether they are making buying
warning or insuring on an automated
vehicle and whether the scope of the
legislation applies to the vehicle with
previously in evidence heard from the
insurance industry that the welcome the
government taking on the responsibility
to say what is an automated vehicle
however we're still concerned that the
bill is currently drafted leaves the
Secretary of State with total discretion
on what is actually an automated vehicle
with therefore table the amendment to
provide greater clarity and to help the
government by ensuring that the relevant
persons and organizations will be
sufficiently involved allowing that to
inform the secretary states list of
automated vehicles the opposition
believe that the additional clarity
provided by the amendment would help to
create a more reassuring environment
they encouraged the development of
uptick of automated vehicles as I've
said already the amendment would also
prevent the Secretary of State from
changing the criteria without further
consultation it guaranteed that the
criteria used will remain up today and
as practical as possible in a very
fast-moving sector
we've we asked these matters previously
surrender so I'm not wanting to keep the
committee to work long on at this point
the previous bill committee for Vita the
Minister I think give assurances and
I've had the opportunity of looking at
hansard on at this point and he promised
to go away think about it
amend the bill appropriately to tighten
the definition but it doesn't seem that
that's happened and without it I don't
mean to criticize the Minister
personally I think six months for the
government to think about this the only
change that I can say it is in clause 1b
but it's just semantics oh so we do
intend to move this clause to evolve
thank you
amendment one to cause once on the
amendment paper the questions that the
amendment we made mr. Lee and it's a
pleasure to see you there in the chair
and the committee under your
chairmanship once again and cannot start
they all say I've had a number of
conversations with the minister informal
chats as we've bumped into one another
wandering around the house and I really
do appreciate the approach that he's
taken towards this bill because my
amendments are genuinely to try and
probe this area which I find fascinating
about this interaction between
artificial intelligence and and human
beings and human behavior and and I
think nowhere more than in our transport
systems is this going to become more and
more prevalent over the coming years
so my amendments that I've put down this
morning are really to prove the areas
where I think that this is this comes
really into sharp focus and when we boil
it down what we are legislating for here
and we heard this in the evidence is
that we're legislating for vehicles
where they are
driven by computer software the we heard
from the witnesses on Tuesday that we
are legislating mainly for the tr4
and exclusively for Tier four and Co
five of the five tiers which start with
driver assisted systems like a braking
systems steer incisions parking systems
etc going through five tiers right the
way through to automated vehicles that
can switch between being driven by human
and and being driven by software at Tier
three which overlaps into tier four and
in tier five which is purely automated
vehicles now I think that this
legislation really does challenge us as
legislators so because I think what we
are being asked to do through this
through simplifying the insurance system
is to enable our roads to become
laboratories to really sharpen up this
this technology and I think we heard
that quite clearly in the evidence
because there were different attitudes
to what's taking place when when asked
about tier five technology mr. Wong from
the Society of motor manufacturers and
traders said that that sort of software
probably wouldn't be around until the
2030s in fact he said is as to when
those level five vehicles without
steering wheels are capable of
performing enter and journeys from my
house in the village to my office in the
city that is anybody's guess that will
probably be sometime in the 2030s it's
quite complex but then we heard from
mister boland of 5ai who tells us that
these vehicles are going to be on our
roads in 2019 in an experimental fashion
nonetheless
but all the same he expects that
automated vehicles built will be capable
of being on our roads in an experimental
manner quite soon so I think that's a
big challenge for us I think we need to
be looking at this software and a great
deal of detail and I think it needs to
be a criteria that the Secretary of
State has the power to oversee and set
certain standards certainly in the mr.
one referred to the Ethics Commission
automated and connected driving which
was the report written for the Federal
Ministry of Transport and digital
infrastructure in Germany which I've a
bit of an anorak but I've started to
read it I've read some of it and it is
fascinating reading but the difference
here is that they come from the approach
that this sort of technology is there to
improve safety and we seem to be coming
to it from the front from there soon
this is a technological advance that
could help industry and that could but
as a by-product improve safety and and
social inclusion is something some
aspects albeit that those those those
will be a long way down the line so I
think there are some ethical issues that
are being thrown up here and in terms of
how the software will operate this is
why I really think that this is an
important point I asked the the
witnesses about the issue of when an
accident is imminent and how the
software will perform and how it will
will take decisions and I gave the
scenario to say a four year old toddler
walking out in front of a vehicle and
the vehicle cannot stop to prevent it
collision with the child so the left is
oncoming traffic and the risk of a
head-on collision to the right is
perfectly innocent bystanders on the
pavement may be sent a bus stop and
those are the options that are before
the vehicle now this is this is known as
the as the trolley classic trolley
problem as Mr Wong described it and it
is referred to
this document from the German transport
department and and the situation there
is that the
the conclusion of the this Ethics
Commission is that it's quite simple to
make a decision where the choice is
between damaging property and human
injury but where that then becomes a
question of different types of injury so
to two different Road users and possibly
perfectly innocent pedestrians who are
not part of the scenario then this this
moves into a completely new area of of
morals and ethics and we have to be
prepared for this because these
situations are going to come to life on
our streets and we are legislating
further to for this to be to take place
so we really should give ourselves the
opportunity to oversee this software
before it is allowed to to go onto the
streets so so so amendment 8 and is
about giving me that is an attempt to
give the Secretary of State that power
over the software and a new Clause 11
sets out the criteria by which that
would be achieved I'm grateful to him
for giving way and I'm listening to his
arguments but if he looks again at the
bill as originally drafted doesn't
Clause 1 subsection 1 already cover what
he's trying to do in amendment 8 in that
the Secretary of State in paragraph B
has to be satisfied that the vehicle is
designed or adapted of safely driving
itself and in making that decision
surely the Secretary of State would take
into account the nature of the software
we would hope so and and yes in the
general terms in which the bill is
written that's that's quite possible but
I'm I mean this is very much a probing
amendment I won't push it to the vote
but I do think this is an area that we
as legislators need legislators need to
scrutinize because this the software
it's absolutely key this is what's going
to be making the decisions and this is
what is going to be driving the vehicle
and we seem to have started this
discussion in terms of if this is a
mechanical problem about how you develop
a piece of technology that can read all
different scenarios on our roads and
reacts accordingly but when you look at
the research that's been done at
different speeds of vehicles the
transition between a driver and an
automated vehicle and the delay and the
time that that will take there's an
awful lot that's in that issue around
the software that's not referred to in
this bill but what I'm doing and what
I'm attempting to do is draw attention
to that and put it on the face of the
bill that this is the crucial area of
the technology that we really should be
paying attention to and in particular
new Clause 11 refers to the issue about
the moral argument and and again it goes
back to this point about the choice
between property and an injury is an
easy moral argument to to answer but
when that comes to making a choice
between two scenarios on the road and
mr. worm mr. Wong what to do refer to is
a minimum read minimal risk maneuver
well that sounds fine when you're
answering in a committee but a minimal
risk maneuver which is a choice between
injuring this party or another party in
a in a risk situation on the road is a
serious moral dilemma and how we how we
decide and what type of software what
choices what algorithms whatever we want
to call them whatever these calculations
are they are going to have to be made in
these
vehicles that's undeniable and it's not
possible in all scenarios as was
described to us for the vehicle to just
come to a safe stop there are going to
be situations where it's unavoidable
point out that and the that the the
experiment that the minister visited
down in Greenwich where they're testing
automated vehicles there was an incident
where somebody pushed a plastic chair up
in front of the vehicle and the vehicle
didn't stop and it hit the chair now
it's not a scientific test but what it
did demonstrate is that there are
circumstances where things are going to
happen and these these these vehicles
are going to have to make choices in
these circumstances and we should be
legislating for it we should at least be
giving ourselves the power to be able to
react and respond to it in the future as
this technology develops I'm not arguing
against this technology I think it's
something that has arrived it's time is
here as I was discussing with the
minister the other day this capacity
exists in air transport we could fly
passenger planes they could take off
perfectly safely and land perfectly
safely without a pilot on board in an
emergency situation they could be flown
remotely by someone from an air traffic
control but if you tested that in the
market all the evidence suggests that
people wouldn't buy a ticket in spite of
the fact almost the entire flight today
of any flight that anyone will undertake
is done by a machine by technology and
some of that technology even shuts the
pilot out because it is not safe to have
the pilot interfere with the technology
but because of public opinion we don't
have that in our air industry would save
the air industry 31 billion pounds I'm
told by the House of Commons library and
so there's a big incentive for the air
industry to do this but it's not done it
yet we are motivating to do it on our
roads and we are not legislating to to
really control the key bit of the
technology which is the software which
is why I
pose these amendments today which
relates to these amendments but more
precisely to the schools do you want me
to raise them in a stem plant debate or
now if he speaks as the minister knows
there are two specific issues in the
bill that concern me and led me to seek
to be part of this committee and one of
them relates to this question of the
strict liability of insurers when the
vehicle is operating automatically which
of course relates to the software and
its safety which is the subject of the
amendments that are being considered
I've suggested in this to two possible
approaches to resolving a problem which
I think was exposed in the witness
sessions that we had and one of those
would relate to clause 1 1 and would I
think require probably actually a
somewhat different amendment from the
ones that have been put forward but it's
the same broad kind let me first explain
the problem and then try to suggest to
the minister the solution in questioning
the various witnesses we established I
think very clearly from the insurance
industry representatives that the strict
liability which here attaches in the
bill as currently drafted to the car
which is an entirely new phenomenon in
insurance law rather than to an
individual
and supposing that there is not a
fundamental legal problem with strict
liability attaching to the insurer of a
car and I'm making that assumption then
though I don't necessarily think it's a
safe polymer that maybe it's poured more
in the other place by lawyers who are
much much deeper acquaintance with
insurance to all the like completely but
supposing that that is a feasible range
me um we then face the question at what
point should that strict liability clock
in and that wouldn't be a material
question if the machine was of a kind
which was never driven by a human being
but only by the machine itself rather as
the as the on remember just spoken
pointed out during the evidence session
was raised by the rather enterprising
group that's going to be creating
service operations on Lisle streets in
London out of what are in effect level 5
vehicles we're ahead of the schedule
which some other witness is suggestive
of the play um in such a case they
clearly are never going to have a human
being driving them the human being is
going to get into them they they are
automated object this bill as currently
drafted were therefore create a strict
liability for the insurers on the happy
assumption that that will work legally
insurers will insure those vehicles and
they'll discover whether it's a very
expensive proposition or not and that
will get built into the service price
and I'm not worried about it from a
legal point of view but I think the
minister would agree with me and I think
all our witnesses seem to be agreeing
but in parallel with that rather rapid
rollout of these highly automated level
5 items it's extremely likely that mmm
it on for many many many motorists maybe
many millions of motorists there will be
a gradual progression not necessarily
strictly demarcated there's level 3 and
level 4 and so on from a vehicle which
is largely driven by a driver but
somewhat assisted by the machine
through vehicles which are more and more
often driven by the machine under more
and more circumstances but which
sometimes are driven by the driver and I
think it's wholly likely or I mean I
certainly don't think we should
legislate on the assumption that we know
what the future's going to look it's
it's highly like it's very possible that
there will be a stage at which there
will be vehicles which for example are
well designed to operate on those ways
on an automated basis and where the
nation can benefit hugely from having
them operate that way because it's both
safer and allows much shorter distances
between vehicles therefore allows much
more intensive use of motorways
therefore diminishes capital investment
of the motorway system improves safety
records and prevents the environmental
damage which building more motorways
with occasion so might will in fact
become compulsory at some point but
those very same vehicles might be quite
ill designed to deal with country roads
or city roads or some other kind of read
and so they may will have a function
which enables them to be switched back
and forth between automated driving and
driver driving now we heard rather
different things from different
witnesses about this question of the
switchover and I think the reason we
heard different things is that to tell
the truth nobody really knows how this
is going to operate and the history of
technology is littered with prophecies
from experts about how technologies in
the future will operate which have
proved to be false so I think the
committee would be wise to assume that
we don't know and we won't know when
we're legislating how exactly the
switchover between driver and automated
vehicle will occur it may be that as mr.
Wong suggested in one of the evidence
sessions the vehicle itself offers up to
the driver the opportunity to switch
over to automation under circumstances
where the vehicle is sufficiently
intelligent to know that it's safer to
drive take over the driving and that it
will never otherwise offer up and in
under such circumstances it's perfectly
sensible when the vehicle offers itself
to the driver to take over operation and
if the driver allows it to take over
operation then the vehicle becomes the
driver and the strict liability of the
insurer attaches to the vehicle and not
any longer to the person that would be
fine if however and some of the other
witnesses seem to think this was the
case it's the driver that is going at
least under some circumstances to make
the decision of whether to switch over
to automated use then it becomes a
highly material question has the driver
made that decision in a reasonable
sensible fashion because if the driver
hasn't made that decision in a sensible
and reasonable fashion and if the
insurer is nevertheless bound ensure of
the vehicles never that's bound to have
strict liability for the vehicle taking
over the action insurers could be faced
with enormous bills under circumstances
were what they were actually doing was
facing a bad decision by a person whom
they had never insured they'd insure the
vehicle and local person and that's the
problem I think we need to address which
brings me to the question of one one but
of course I'll sit down I'm delighted
and I'm also like to stoven your
champion I briefly say that as I've
isn't the first time your friendship
from the generosity of your of your of
your home which you offered me just this
week with a deposit
anyway so I I like dancing the head of
pins but we must careful to avoid it in
this committee because time did not
permit it and and there was a slight
entities
case my make this argument in as
critical as I can the key issue about
the event that took place while the
Bitcoin is an autonomous mode is not the
point that it went into autonomous mode
but the events the point where the
incident occurred now if we can be very
clear the vehicle was being driven
autonomously at the time of an incident
or accident that then becomes the
sapient rather than what might have
happened five minutes or half an hour
before when the driver switched it to
autonomous mode because of course the
circumstances it be mocked on us
will then become absolutely clear and at
that point the liability is not in
question now I take the point that
whether it should have been all times
mode may be immaterial all that more
than one I sponsor the debates report
but I just think it is about what
happens at point of the accident that is
what the greatest concern I just put
that on to my right hand no I I have
considered that and I think that is the
assumption I think that the I arrive on
friends well expose the logic that
underlies the current drafting and it's
an error in my view because while of
course the material moment is the moment
of the hypothetical accident the cause
of the accident is the material question
from the point of view of the operation
of our insurance system and if the cause
of the accident was actually a bad
decision by the person there is an
illogic which will eventually undo all
the good we're trying to do if
nevertheless the insurer has strict
liability ensure the Bureau has strict
liability so the fact that it might have
been five or twenty or fifty five
minutes before the accident that the
person handed over controls that that
vehicle is irrelevant if the basis on
which the person handed over control was
wrong and the person made the wrong
decision
I will but man just just make one
further point so it seems to me that the
issue we need to address is easy it's
possible that the person should have
made such a wrong decision or have we
eliminated that possibility that's what
I want to get onto because that's where
one one be but isn't it highly likely
that this sophisticated vehicle will
prevent the driver seeking to put the
vehicle in automated mode if it is
unsafe to do so it will reject the
request my right horn phone for asking
that question because it leaves me
exactly at the point I want to raise in
relation to one one a B and as I think
it may need to be C it is indeed
possible that the proposition that my
right honourable friend just put which
is exactly the proposition that mr. Wang
put in the evidence session will be the
case and that vehicles which are capable
of genuine automated driving will have
sufficient intelligence built into them
so that they will only ever accept or
offer to take over if it is totally safe
now if that's the proposition on which
the minister wishes to base the
legislation bearing in mind that we
don't actually know whether at the
moment the technology would go in that
direction then it seems to me what what
is needed is an amendment or a new sub
falls one one seat or there abouts which
makes it clear and this relates to the
opposition amendment makes it clear that
the Minister will only insectary snake
will only have the power to approve an
automated system a fully automated
system if the Minister has verified that
that system will always safely determine
its own capability to take over the car
and I will of course and that's fine
that would solve the problem that I've
advanced because the minister would have
or some expert on his behalf would all
sector state or some expert on his or
her behalf would
verified in advance that the machine was
capable of taking over and would only
ever take over under safe circumstances
but just before I get way to administer
I want to point out that is using the
law to limit the technology and the
history of that approach in our
legislation in our country has been very
bad I won't go into all the history but
I'm very happy to write the minister a
memorandum Murphy wants I once wrote an
article about this there is a very long
history of Parliament trying to prejudge
the technology legislating on the
assumption that it will only be that
technology mandating therefore only that
technology and discovering there isn't
any of it and that people elsewhere are
manufacturing things which we don't get
because they don't fit our legal system
so it's not the route I actually
recommend and I'll come back to that
when we get to Clause 2 but it is a
possible route and one that the Minister
should at least consider it relates
closely to the the bill is an attempt to
thread a quantity tonight between
creating sufficient certainty to
establish a framework to allow further
development from the other hand exactly
what my right all the thread said in
trying to predict a future that may not
come to pass and he's right - is that
greater detail on the specific point
about liability
I just draw his attention to three - we
will be debating three to throw but he
won't let me debates it now for that
reason the three to does out he
specifically talked about the subject he
described a because it draws attention
to the to the possibility of an accident
caused wholly Jews personal negligence
in allowing the vehicle to begin driving
itself when it was not appropriate to do
so
now that's very much
about Miss wife assassins they'll be
making a separate plane and the good
ones in today about technology that
kicks in of its own accord because the
technology the software determines that
it's better at that point by simply to
put in at least age 2 3 2 I recognize
sir but that I'm treading on your
indulgence but as the ministry has
raised 3 - let me just briefly will know
that discusses later but let me briefly
point out why don't think that solves
the problem it it's possible that it's
acceptable of redrafting so that
acquittal but it's ill drafted if the
intention is to solve the problem I've
been raising because in the first place
it says totally was holy jutsu the
person think urgent that is an almost
impossible thing ever to establish so I
think as currently drafted it does
almost no heavy lifting at all one I
know I think why parliamentary draftsman
is nevertheless inserted the word Hurley
because as the Minister has I've had
quite a long experience of dealing with
parliamentary draftsman on a number of
bills and I know that they think through
very carefully the question of what
happens if you don't put in a word like
Hurley under these circumstances the
remember is gradually wandering off the
road the strict record which relates
this amendment if he he can always come
back on false vampire I've allowed him a
lot of indulgence so far but
you'll get back to the amendments now so
I will leave it at that on so far as
Clause 3 2 is concerned will no doubt
come back to it may I just say finally
in relation to 1 1 rather than 3 2 that
if it were the intention of the minister
to solve the problem by adding to 1 1
rather than by doing something to Clause
2 or 2 Clause 3 which we'll come to
later then I think it would be very
important to establish whether the view
taken by mr. warm that these machines
will always be designed in such a way
that they do decide on a safe basis
whether to take over he is actually a
very very consensual view right across
the industry in every country or whether
it's happenstance view of some
particular technologists yes okay
because again he's touching on this is
that this area of ethics which is
covered again in this document the
excellent document was written by the
german transport department and this is
the the issue about freedom of choice
should the individual who's driving a
car succumb to a superior knowledge of
the software that's been put in the
vehicle and have control of the vehicle
taken away from them in certain
circumstances and that so that's an
issue that we've not discussed but it
could come about as a consequence of
this legislation again is why I'm
suggesting we should be looking very
carefully at the software but there is a
major question about the freedom of
choice of an individual when driving
their car if we allow this technology to
take those sorts of decisions away from
the driver yes
actually I agree with the Honorable
gentleman like that and actually sharing
his anorak tendencies I too have been
interested in the German case and in
fact have spent some while talking to
the German officials and motor
manufacturers about this and actually I
think there is a serious problem as the
final one I want to raise relating to
one 1b which relates specifically to the
questions of ethics that the Honorable
member has raised and I want here just
to draw the minister's attention to the
word in 1 1 be safely undoubtedly server
duties number 10 calling the minister to
fire and yet they may not be such great
significance to our future as this very
building in 1 1 B as currently drafted
the sexual state is asked to apply on
whether the vehicle that is being
approved and put on the list is capable
of safely driving an awful lot will hang
in what will probably be a very rich
jurisprudence over many decades on this
word safely and I think what the
Honorable members rightly drawing our
attention to is that safely in this
context could mean something technical
is the machine technically sophisticated
enough to deal with circumstances or it
could mean something much deeper which
is is the ethics and applied
intelligence built into the machine such
as to produce views or choices which
accord with the social preferences of
Parliament about who's to be sacrificed
on the circumstances where there are two
different groups of persons to be
sacrificed in trying to minimize the
effect of an accident or any other set
of very complicated ethical choices now
I bow of course to the developments
legal advisors and parliamentary counsel
in any external Council but my own hunch
is that there isn't actually enough of a
jurisprudence currently available to
guide us on whether the word safely will
really bear that amount of weight and I
therefore wonder whether the Minister
should consider at least giving the
secretary state the duty
in duty in due course to consider not
just whether the machinery is capable of
driving safely but whether it's capable
of driving and I don't know quite what
words parliamentary counsel want to
choose but ethically or properly or in a
socially desirable where's that there
which is an odd kind of question to ask
about a machine I grant but then these
are very old machines that we're
considering here and I think the
Honorable member was some to a good
thing with his amendment date even if he
doesn't press the actual amendment
because he is raising an issue which we
will have to address and what we all
don't want to get to I think we're
across the committee United in this is a
sort of red flag situation where
machines have been authorized because
they're technically highly Wizardry so
they have a large amount of technical
wizardry in them that makes them highly
sophisticated but actually they're
making choices that any sane Parliament
or government would envy public would
regard as wholly morally objectionable
or socially undesirable or both and and
I really think we need to think very
hard about making sure that this
legislation at least lets our successors
whoever secretary state at the time
consider that range of issues when
approving something because otherwise
the Sectary state is going to say oh
well this is technically ok but I don't
like the look of what it's going to do
by way of the kinds of decisions it's
going to make and some adviser is going
to come until that sector States sorry
sectors take it's ultra virus for you to
refuse this vehicle on the list just
because it's going to mow down young
people in preference to old people or
something because it only allows you to
determine safety and not ethics so I
think it's really quite important that
we get that precise wording right thank
you I've grateful to you for your
tolerance the points made by the
Honorable gentleman the I was trying to
think of parallels really and in trying
to understand this or trying to imagine
what this might be like in 5-10 years
now and I guess I was like to the
instruction introductions that say
cruise control and so on and how and how
that works with the insurance industry
and if a driver was instigating the
cruise control in an urban area and
setting it in a particular speed and
that speed was in excess say of the
limit in that particular roadway where
the responsibility where the liability
falls and and I think you the industry
and the technologies are improving at a
pace and I think that it is very
difficult to imagine where we'll be as
has been said in the chamber but I do
imagine that the liability essentially
is down to his should be with the driver
in that if the driver has introduced the
cruise control or has introduced the
automated driving system that may take
that that is their choice in a way that
it is their choice to maneuver from one
lane to another today which might
ultimately result in an accident so I
would have I would have assumed perhaps
I'm not appreciating defined numerals of
this debate in quite the same level that
the ultimately the the liability has to
be with the driver and that the
telematics will prove otherwise were
there to be in the event of an accident
that would be there will be that data
being able to be provided to the
insurance industry to prove so Edward I
rise simply to ask for a point of
clarification from the minister and he
responds to this debate I anticipate the
answer to my question will be yes but
I'd like to have it on the record and
that is the the list of vehicles that
the Secretary of State will compile and
update will include as well as motor
cars lorries buses emergency services
vehicles and other vehicles that the
driver would require an H GB license or
a BSD license I I anticipate that is
what is meant
but I say would like the clarification
because I can anticipate the technology
for example with HGVs that they drive
normally for a large part of a journey
but then form some part of some road
train on a motorway with other similarly
equipped vehicles and as they just like
to have that clarification that this
list will include these vehicles as well
as private motor cars thank you thank
you would I um I didn't paraphrase
furniture I didn't know whether I was
born too early or too late but I do know
that I was born to dead dreams of a
future inspire and be shaped by the past
but but not constrained by it a future
where we can achieve wonder and part of
that journey will be assisted by
technology technological change the
technological change we're considering
now as the principal party the honorable
gentleman said could liberate a number
of people who haven't had easy access to
private transport for a variety of
reasons to do so
and that has extraordinary and wonderful
prospects associated with it so as we
look at this bill we should as the kind
of minister did discuss it in that
context however the bill presents
challenges and they are highlighted by
tools one and by the amendments before
us and indeed by the contributions we
had from both sides of this committee in
essence the challenge as I briefly
explained when I intervened on my right
honourable friend is to provide
electricity framework sufficient to give
he's the degree of certainty to an
industry which is engaged in research
and development and further investments
but on the other hand being so specific
in an area which is so highly dynamic as
to try to do what he guarded anticipate
just to try to predict that logical
trade in the way that he described
governments have done in the past with
unfortunate consequences so that is now
mission and I am determined I'm very
grateful to the survivors I'm determined
to do so in his convivial as per as we
can you Frank
whoever was in government they'd be
facing these challenges and would be
bringing a bit of this kind to the house
and so it's perfectly appropriate that
we should discuss it in a way which is
as consensual is it can be the job of
the Opposition is to scrutinize these
things and indeed the job of my
honourable ranking or colleagues is to
do so to those who have served on few
standing committees had little
experience of legislation and there are
some because there are newer members of
the house won't counter the ministers
are quite like me before I am one of
those rare creatures it is very happy to
listen to debate to hear suggestions
take you guided by them and concede
where we've got it wrong and all the
more so in an area like this because we
are charting the difficult course I've
described now when we debated this bill
last time this is directly relevant
amendments around four just in case you
were thinking it might not be when we
debated these masses previously in the
bill which we could not proceed with
because the inconvenience of general
reduction
slaughters doing so we looked at the
issues which we are beginning to bake
now and those issues are about the
creation of a mr.
automated vehicles which provides just
the kind of clarity to the public and
the industry that I have described and
the relationship between those vehicles
and new insurance provisions essentially
and as much as this bill deals it does
so to create the secure insurance market
which will allow the further
developments the bill suggests the
sector estate will create this list
great clarity about insurance by
applying the definition of subsection 1
a and B applause well we staple
automated vehicles of those which are
designed or adapted ly capable or in at
least some circumstances or situations
of safely driving themselves and the
answer I think to my to my honorable
friend is that so friend- easy well know
that some of the ARA deeds being done is
on those and it may be that given what
we already know about the work that's
being done in this area that it's not
private cars that are the first to
become automated I mean I'm not making a
prediction but it could be vehicles the
of the kind that he describes I mean the
the I say the best example I could think
of the shuttles when users are airports
who know those to get to terminals which
we don't think of really as vehicles in
the same way that we do as a car that we
might drive from our home the others
their cousin they are traveling on a
preordained route as it were rather like
the vehicle I saw when I went to
Greenwich I mentioned it
in a little direction which is a fully
autonomous circle driving on a single
row from two set points that might be
the kind of first steps that are taken
as this now but I do emphasize the
technology is in its early stages it's
not quite an experience it's more in
turn infancy and the standards by which
these vehicles would approve the safe
sale and use are still being discussed
in America and so the other challenge
for government is to make sure that we
as a nation of poverty as a parliament a
don't jump ahead of those international
standards this is another ball that
we're juggling with if I can put it in
those terms record the international
standards to developing was the
aggressor to developers with the claim
about describe is happening across the
world many countries are engaged in it
and indeed many of the businesses are
national of course they're working a
number of different countries this will
be discussed and is being planned by the
United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe where the UK plays illegal wrong
these standards are still being
developed and will form the basis of the
type approval process which is well
established for the motor industry he
talked already quite a teeny about type
of prison with a long-standing parcel of
of how the industry works the critical
thing here is there were vehicle to meet
that type approval process rather like a
normal domestic vehicle now he sold for
safe use on road you might meet those
the core requirement of safety is
implicit in the development of those
standards which will as I said be
international the Bessey's just
mentioned the core requirement of safety
what does he understand safety to meet
in this context what does he in this
context understand safety or safely to
me and what advices he received but
whether it can bear the burden of
distinguishing between it ethically safe
or ethically proper set of choices by
artificial intelligence and their
ethically improper choices well that's
the that's a very very big question in
dealings the one that in a sense was
first raised by the route them in the
witness sessions when he raised and in
the second reading of this bill actually
when he raised the so now he painted a
picture of a scenario where a human
being I think the example of paraphrase
the safest repartee was where you were
faced with writing along the trail
travel swirling and possible by swirling
accident now that's a momentary judgment
that any driver makes he news I in the
end an ethical judgment it's a practical
animal judgment isn't it and we could
have a very long debates and my friend
of my right may be Michael Moore PPS but
he won't be entirely indulgent of me we
are gonna extend it
yeah well let me invite me minister on
that path a little bit because the the
the the right honourable member for West
Dorset Braves there I think an important
question which may as succinctly as he
did but but he's got more experience of
drafting legislation than I have so it's
a small there's no surprise that he
probably did point it out that is that
if the issue of morals or ethics aren't
referred to specifically in the
legislation then a sharp witted lawyer
sometime down the road could argue that
the issue is safety and not ethics or
morals and therefore it's ultra virus to
use this legislation to to rate try to
regulate on that specific area of of the
technology so I would suggest to the
Minister I urge you to go away and look
at that issue again and consider
amendments to the bill that would take
to take that into consideration and I
hope he would he would consider that
further well then try and deal with the
argument on the record II to waiver by
firstly drawing attention to the
evidence from mr. wall he heard on
Tuesday and just convenience the
committee mr. Wong said and may I point
out something I mentioned with Thomas
emergency braking it's been demonstrated
that the technology is improvable of
time previously autonomous emergency
braking worked perfectly at 30 miles an
hour came increasingly sophisticated a B
can work well even at 50 miles an hour
it was surprised me if tell us she
didn't improve more basic law in the
future so so in truth the character of
this technologies is improving so
rapidly and so dramatically that the the
scenario that painted by the Honorable
gentleman
we're we're a an alternative vehicle
changes lanes brakes in this case of mr.
Wong's example is he's likely to be part
of that change and of course the the
reason the vicar would do that will be
to ensure safety
the reason the insurance industry
believed that there will be fewer
accidents as they describe to us in the
evidence they gave if they think the
autonomous vehicle would outpace a human
being would prompt the human being in
terms of the judgment if you like and I
use the word judgment the judgment of
the automated bit software that wrote
the machine would be more acute and
would be in the end safer so the human
beings are more prone to route up than
these machines will be likely to be
therefore they'll be less accidents
therefore they will be safer
therefore the BA easier to insure and
cheaper to do so we heard that
repeatedly during the evidence session
so I I think we can be confident that is
the direction of travel sorry to use
that rather hackneyed way of making my
point given the subject we'll discuss it
but I don't think we can be sure about
how quickly we'll get there or exactly
what it will look like I think I'd be a
very bold man if I made those kind of
predictions I also listened to mr. Wong
and indeed reread that part of his
evidence that the Minister has quoted
it's wholly irrelevant to the point
we're making here and I thought was
extremely instructive that Mr Wong is
clearly a very great technical expert
completely failed to understand the
issue which the Germans have begun to
understand and which the bill genuine in
seriously is not currently addressed the
bill is drafted as if artificial
intelligence we're the same kind of
thing as say speed control
isn't this is a very important error
that underlies the drafting as it's
currently conceived that speed control
is a technical matter you could go much
further with technical development and
still be in the technical arena where
safety is the only question because the
ethical judgments are made exclusively
by the human run with artificial
intelligence we are moving into a
terrain where as the unremember opposite
rightly says the machine is going to be
making decisions that are the kinds of
decisions which parliaments make and
human beings make and they aren't
questions of safety
they're questions of judgment about the
right outcome under difficult
circumstances and I really do us that
minister to go back and talk to the
lawyers in his department about whether
jurisprudence will deliver him that the
ability or his success is the ability to
refuse approval to a piece of artificial
intelligence which either directly or
through its learning processes either
will or could have the effect of
producing totally dysfunctional utility
ante utilitarian results by making
judgments which are technically
perfectly safe but just happen to take
the view for example that wipe me out a
group of three year old school children
is a better thing than wiping out in
ninety eight year old acrossing the red
now that's a very difficult judgment for
a human being to make but it's the kind
of judgment that Parliament's have to
make and I think at the moment it's very
clear on the face of this bill that it
would not permit a sector of States to
prevent Type Approval to a machine which
was designed in such a way that it could
have those very bizarre and undesirable
results and I'd sure that's not what the
department or the Minister wanting peace
but maybe think about that forever is
let's not overestimate how hard this
bill at this bit I'm very particular on
my words there it intends to get this
bill is about ensuring that victims
of collisions cools by autonomous
vehicles get quick easy access to
insurance compensation in line with
conventional practices and what we heard
in evidence and what we debated when we
debated this earlier incarnation was
that it was important for the insurance
industry and therefore for the further
development of Technology and we were
clear about that but there will be no
difference who like from the perspective
of the person who owned the vehicle in
how they went about making a claim there
is a much bigger base which will clearly
have to be dealt with in legislation in
regulations in type approval and a whole
range of other things around some of the
other matters about the odometer Elson
and my Ratan camp West Dorset have made
and if they are both right that we are
going to get to a point where the
Machine exercises and ethical and I
usually try to use worked very carefully
here because it is very hard to see the
machine making ethical judgments and I
do appreciate the strangeness of the
machine makes what is in effect an
ethical judgment think of clearly that
will have to be taken into account acts
at a future point in the legislative
process now I don't think this bill is
the place to do it
I just don't think he can do it because
I don't think we get know enough and and
we're back to my first point record
about the line were trying to tread
between doing what we can do now with
certainty and what we might do in the
future in a a world in which we can yet
only imagine what might occur so very
good environment from will permit me
perhaps the two gabion synthesis that we
might meet with what appears to be my
pieces into that synthesis is that this
bill is a starting point a first step
along as I said a long read I entirely
accept that this bill is just the
starting point but I think he's missing
the point that I'm trying to make about
what starting with this language with
just the word safely here and no
reference to wider considerations will
do to his successes there's no point in
having the secretary state empowered to
make a list and their sectors of state
are actually going to make lists there's
no point in empowering to make lists of
automated vehicles unless those lists
event relate to automated vehicles those
automated vehicles will have artificial
intelligence built into them they can't
be automated otherwise therefore the
Secretary of State who is making this
list in the first place which this bill
provides will not some on the bill but
this bill is going to be constrained by
the terms that the bill sets for what
basis he can use to make lists that's
why the Shadow Minister has raised
questions about the criteria and why
we're having this debate with respect
surely therefore we need to empower and
not suggest to me in any way
obliged but empower later sections of
state to consider inter alia whether the
things on the list the machines of the
he or she is putting on the list are
actually murderously safe or good and
safe machines at a moment he can only or
she can only decide whether it's a safe
machine if it happens to be safe in the
sense in which Stalin could safely
eliminate large sections of his
population the poor old Secretary of
State would as I construe it and the
Minister hasn't given us any indication
he's across the country people
differently cat away by there I think
or more away from the leaves quite
narrow definable so I know the minister
will get back on track well I I'm guided
by us ever having already cycled your
sagacity I could hardly be anything
other I think where we might end up
delightful nice to get styling a table
it's the same Easter Egg won't go bad in
many committees I think where we might
end up here is I am prepared I think it
is important safety which in the end is
a baseline but there is a point about a
hips of course and the advice I receive
on that is that no vehicle that aren't
considered safe and ethical will be
allowed on the market and therefore not
consideration on the list but faith an
effort but I'd received that back and I
do like they're taking advice and and
not taking it
it's red wood as a minister and I before
I make that my definitive position that
I want to reflect a bit because if we
were to say no device say phonetic who I
not be actually clear what ethical means
we know what safe means that we can draw
on existing practice in respect of
type-approval
we know what safe measures of safety are
about but when we get to measure red
face bring them together a little
challenging area that's why I'm going to
reflect a bit on the character this
incredibly interesting by the way I'm
very useful debate I give away brief
piece each other
I know the program well it's a real
trouble I'm very obliged to the minister
we concede the right honourable
gentleman he's absolutely my honourable
friend the might well be in fact there
is huge potential for legal argument
about what is actually safely driving
you know there is gonna be a debate
around those
and in litigation potentially yes yes I
agree and I think I think precisely
right and I think that's what thus that
that's the significance as I said
earlier moment ago at the debate I think
I think we're now at one though there
needs to be a list I think we're a one
with at least needs to be qualified I
think we've made some changes those in a
second since we first debated these
matters
the Honorable gentleman in his first
contribution to the opposite direction
we've now some quite a long time ago
actually spoke of consultation I think
it I don't want to constrain the
identification process and I don't want
to be too precise about the criteria the
very reason discussing but I do think
it's right the consultation is an
implicit part of the continuing
consideration of this and I'm very happy
to say that that has to be it because of
course as the technology develops given
what I've said about dynamism it would
have to be ongoing communication about
the changing character that that meant
the safe functioning criteria more
straightforward because this is about
American software and of machine the
Machine certainly needs to be safe and
machines now and we're driving in terms
of us regions which are fundamentally
that different from their early so we
know that the Machine needs to be say
but the the existing provisions in the
bill are clear that this can only
comprise at present
of vehicles that can be legally used on
the roads it is absolutely right that
maybe this is the having reflected
Brickley and marvel at all but I'm
already affected Motel maybe it's about
what you do regulations therefore as
that moves on there may be a an
opportunity to qualify or clarify
through regulation how that list about
sand will go where the just one second
but I proceed you write on whoever made
the point that if we're if we're too
narrow and put in this legislation even
though it's a first step on the road it
may make the second or third or forces
that more difficult that's the essence
which he came to the end I think it was
either that he focused his arguments
more precisely at the end or I was not
bright enough to grasp it seem to me to
be the essence what did you say
and I'll that's the bit that I won't
think more about because we can't I
think we're all happy that this is the
end of its process but we must make the
beginning of the process before purpose
that's effectively now and let me try
and get through some more of my
pre-prepared debts
rather than temporizing as is necessary
when you're having proper dialogue now
this is the most in danger of going
round in circles
I will come to a brief conclusion if I
might
I'm not through your prayers I hate to
be too precise about the criteria at
tenth parent self the only snips
interesting we have is a list of Italy
whether it meets the definition the city
of you or not if it doesn't we clean
this it doesn't not be cleared on this
there's no discretion ministers you have
some parameters
Herod merely administrative is not
discretionary letter to power this is so
we can be very clear about the reasons
vehicles need to go on the list because
these types of vehicles defined will not
be covered
currently Shores framework and that will
need new specifically the types me
Sherrill product and that's the point I
was making about what the limits what
we're trying to do now and the essence
wedding that's what it is about allowing
the further development of appropriate
raw products that are not out there now
and if they're not out there in the
future would inevitably limit how far we
go with the firm the develop of the
vehicles I promise to waste a little
gentleman I haven't done so very
discusses of me when I do so now waiting
and listening notes just to pick up
really about the about the the framework
of regulation really and where this
takes us from here and because the
interpretation of safety is is is all
about the criteria and what is set by
say the transport Road Road Transport
laboratory and if you look at say
braking systems what is a standard was
an acceptable braking and what we deem
or what the the secretary of state
ultimately through the transport
department determined to be the measures
there is the criteria to say
responsiveness and what is acceptable
say for responsiveness whether it be a
swerving action by a vehicle or a
braking system and it's that and how
that thing gets measured and therefore
whether a vehicle is acceptable to be on
the list and so this is obviously the
first stage but it's the next stage and
what those criteria may be set to which
are deemed to be acceptable for UK roads
so I I hope that is helpful in that I
would have I would have imagined that
that is a very technical set of
regulatory framework that would be
needed to be determined yes I think
that's precisely why we do have been
down the line and in the regulatory way
there on the grounds one suggested and
it's why you need to do so mindful in
the international standards I described
and the ongoing debate that's taking
place internationally through well
recognized bodies to do that so I agree
and dramatic by myself so series of
trainers and the final point I can make
really is this that the the character of
the amendments and the character of the
debate that we have really is about is
about the interpretive powers at such a
stage we've gotta be careful here about
extending the interpretive scope of this
part of the Secretary of State's
responsibilities and this is yet another
line to walk and not to cross the
criteria for inclusion on that is need
to be sufficiently clear as not to allow
any doubt in the insurance market about
precisely what kind of vehicle might be
on the list and therefore what kind of
vehicle might or might not be insured so
I am doubtful about extending the
interpretive scope we need to be very
clear of which vehicles including
software can be safely operated and want
to make it grow
therefore essentially we'll be able to
transpose these approve the vehicles
into the list we call that domestic
insurance framework is based upon and
clear about which vehicles need which
insurance products it would not
therefore be appropriate the legislators
early stages suggested by mandate and
new course 11 said an approval procedure
or safety criteria until we know what
those international standards are I
think the honor event will work Levinson
is right we'll probably need to do that
further down the line as those
international standards become clearer
we're certainly set and and whether that
were in other legislation or more likely
I think in regulation is how I would
like to go it's something no doubt would
be directly over the course of the
coming days in essence I returned to my
core argument this is a starting point
to create a greater clarity it's not by
any means the end of what is I
gave to be to return to my very early
words a wonderful story can tell I'm
very much in danger it's irregular
except that this is the bill is the
mechanism for getting the ball rolling
as he won but the more I've listened to
the debate I'm more persuaded that
actually we do need something on the
face of the bill to ensure that this
consultation at the criteria and for
that reason with your leave I was trying
to avoid continually that's a well known
fact about my stuff I just do so have
said I'll reflect on what the I have
said indeed that I think consultation is
a duplicity part so I just in for the on
Frenchman so boy consume the way to
withdraw a moment sorry human I'll not
be withdrawing the amendment but pushing
it with your leave - hey one to close
one as on the amendment if the question
is that the amendment be made as many as
are that appears they are I the contrary
no I think the noes have it say well
then you challenge I write division
right thank you
got all your people Alan brown yeah
Rosie duck feels like effort Vicky
Foxcroft mr. John Hayes no didn't care
no it's a great night it's all of a let
win Scott man
Andrew Stevenson no Ian Stewart Craig
Tracy
so the eyes were six and that nose were
mine so the noes have it the noes have
it found what we now count the question
that Klaus wants that part of the bill
and I ruled that because of the very
wide-ranging nature of discussion that
we had on the earlier members that we
will move immediately to that decision
being taken so they it's formally on it
the question is a closed one stand half
the bill as many as are that opinion say
aye
the contrary no I think the eyes have it
the eyes we now come to a member 9 2
Clause 2 with which a we convened to
consider a member 10 I called my Thank
You mr. Lee and hopefully they won't
take as long on these two amendments as
we did on the previous ones but it was a
fascinating discussion but no listen
this follows all because this this is an
issue about the the transition this it
really does relate to Tier three of of
the the five tiers from as a driver
assisted right through to full all
information and this is where they the
vehicle track goes through a
transmission from fully automated to
being driven by the driver and vice
versa
and there's been there aren't there has
been various bits of research into this
that have come to different conclusions
so when we heard him in the evidence
that there was out he had carried out
some some research at different speeds
and they come to a conclusion at a
minimum of ten seconds in in that
transition period others of in the
adventurer research have come to
slightly different conclusions but all
of them points are the facts that this
is a problematic area of this this area
of Technology of automated vehicles in
that there can be a period where it
takes a deal of time for the driver to
become alert
mr. Wang described to us various forms
of alarms that would tell the driver
that they should be aware that the
vehicle was requesting that the driver
takes back control of the car and that
if that if those various alarms don't
alert the driver that the driver vehicle
will then slowly come to a halt if
that's happening on a motorway and we
can all imagine the sort of disruption
that that could that could cause even
described you know preparing for the
accident because the seat belt of the
driver would tighten up just before the
vehicle came to a halt because the via
the driver mayor passed out or maybe so
fast asleep woken the driver up either
way there are various scenarios here in
this transition that do cause some alarm
and mr. Gooding
at the AI he he said that he felt that
tier 3 we shouldn't we shouldn't even
entertain tier 3 that it's it's it's not
it doesn't make any sense
and we should with what this legislation
is about is is actually moving straight
to tier 4 and tier 5 and we shouldn't
even entertain tier 3 because it's
unsafe and doesn't make any sense now
clearly if that's being said by it by
people giving us evidence then I would
say to the minister this is this is
cause the government some alarm and that
perhaps we should be legislating to say
that this is perhaps something we don't
want to allow to happen on our roads
because there are issues that are being
raised around this transition at tier 3
that are fairly dangerous and we were
adding a new certainly helped give away
and I'm to notice what was said about
tier three but but I hope he's not under
playing his own point what he's
referring to in about the transitioning
phase also applies in level four it's
only at level five that it disappears my
understanding of of of level four and it
was said to us in the evidence of mr.
Wong that they in at level it's only at
tier four that they that the human the
person is removed from the equation I
think those exact exact exact words and
I'm asked that I must admit I will feel
just suppose this point I will give way
to I must admit there does seem to be
some sort of contradiction there because
with tier five as I understand it's
fully automated vehicle no steering
wheel and totally under the control of
technology tier four then you wonder
what tier four is if tier 3 is the the
transition between the human and the
vehicle then bodies and tier five is a
fully automated vehicle no steering
wheel whatsoever
what is tier four then it's sort of a
lesser of tier 5 or a greater of tier 3
give way to the Minister is going to
enlightens well I'm going to suggest
rapid that I drop a note to the
committee setting out which keep each
tier means that's because the otherwise
we're gonna have this debate time and
done again that way I can anticipate
members across the committee wearing it
so why don't I drop a note I've asked my
officials already by the way to set out
description of what each kid looked at
it but it just has been demonstrated in
the air exchanges that the difference
between to.5 and tier 4 is it's not all
together entirely clear when it's
described by people who go who gave
evidence to us that in tier 4 the human
is entirely removed from the equation
and so this I mean that's so I think
this is an area that we do need to look
at because in the adventurer experiment
that on the and the evidence that I read
there this is the the the Bristol
testing centre what was that what was
discovered is that the the drivers when
they first took over tended to be over
cautious and drive at a slower rate so
there were issues of increased
congestion potentially but certainly of
vehicles suddenly slowing down and and
that there was a point there where there
was that where danger could be could be
caused then and mr. Gooding in his
answer to questions about this actually
said it was that issue that he felt was
more important than the issue of
congestion so I think there are some
important considerations that are raised
around this issue of transition and
particularly around this this area in
tier 3 because if we are if we if we
consider the Artemis's that we had about
when will the vehicle decide though it's
safe for the vehicle to drive or that
the vehicle should be handed back to the
driver to the human being what was
suggested it was the road condition so
what this would suggest is that it's
going to happen in the same location in
around our roads so for instance when
we're as vehicles come off of motorways
for instance and they start to enter
into more built-up areas where the
hazards around and the potential dangers
for a vehicle are greater and then it's
likely that the vehicles will be
transitioning back to being driven by
the driver so if this is going to happen
regularly in the same location we could
be creating accident black spots and so
this is a quite considerable a new
element of our new hazard that we are
creating on arrows give way to the
origin
honorable gentlemen um and obviously we
eagerly await the ministers name but due
to the wonders of modern technology
actually one can look it up on the web
and level four is very clearly described
as a fully autonomous and designed to
perform all safety critical driving
functions for an entire trip however
it's important to note that this is
limited to the operational design domain
of the vehicle meaning it does not cover
every driving snow so I hope that the
Honorable gentlemen agree with me that
actually the transitioning question
arises in relation to level four when
vehicle moving from one kind of driving
scenario to another I accept that
entirely and I agree with the right
honorable gentleman and of course it
comes back to my point that this is
likely to happen in similar locations on
a regular basis and that though we will
have a pattern of behavior that will
occur in particular spots where
transition occurs because the technology
requires it and I think we need to be
aware of this these are that the the
testing that these burly's taking place
is telling us that this is happening and
we're not and we're not taking this into
consideration in this legislation I
think we should so I would suggest to
the minister that again this is
something that we need to take away and
have a look at because one of the
aspects that with there's got to be most
prevalent in our minds is is that of of
safety there is also this issue and it
goes back to this sort of moral issue
again or ethical issue around driver
autonomy whether the driver is in charge
of the vehicle well the technology is
going to be in charge of the driver
because the minister in the previous
debate around the previous amendments
and said that you know the technology is
superior he didn't use that word but
that's the way he described it that a
suit that because it's safer than than
the human and that in the scenario of an
accident that
even better to suggest it even that the
vehicle would make better choices or
quicker choices that then that then the
human being well this point so you know
down a road if I'm the pump but of where
well why don't we have roads operated
like we control our railway or around
the ground service why don't we have
fully automated vehicles where drivers
don't have control at all what I said
was that that I drew that from the
evidence we received when the insurance
industry and other of the witnesses say
they think that the vehicle would be
safer and therefore insurance premium
over time come down they're doing so
because they believe the autonomy will
make them safer so it is implicit that
they that they gain the autonomous mode
they my answer to that to the minister
would be that my experience has been
that many people come and give evidence
to to us as MPs assuring us that this
technical logical advance is going to
deliver x y&amp;amp;z that it's going to take us
this far forwards and it's going to lead
us to a promised land where things are
safer and much more improved and then
what we find is the the you know the law
of hidden consequences and we find that
there are a whole different set of
scenarios that we are where we are
facing and then while I'm pointing to
here is that this transition issue
between the driver and the and the
technology is star already throwing up
the potential hazards on our roads even
before we've let the vehicles out there
we know that this this exists because it
has shown up in the testing and
therefore we should be which we we
should be legislating for it so I've
asked the minister to take onboard those
arguments so I could see the whip is
eating to get on to
I'm gonna like not like the hassle made
ahead than the paper the question is
event in a political situation ability
now
