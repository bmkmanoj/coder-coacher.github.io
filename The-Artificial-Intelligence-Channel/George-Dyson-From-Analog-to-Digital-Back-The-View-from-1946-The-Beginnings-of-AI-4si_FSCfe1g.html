trying to do the math I think it's 38
years ago and he's one of the oldest
friends here and he was friends with my
partner and yeah I'm gonna tell you
about sorry about analog and digital but
at that time I had just come down from
living in a tree so and you'll think
nothing nothing's more analog to the
tree or living in a tree but so I lived
up there and down there are the cedar
boards that I was splitting up to finish
building that house but if you take that
cedar apart so I split that wood even
this tree that this analog is actually
doing a digital computation that's what
trees are nature's way of digitizing
time so if you count the Rings precisely
you see that that's actually there's 544
rings so things could be digital they
could be analog in a technical sense
analog computing deals with continuous
functions and digital computing deals
with discrete functions and anything I
would say about this would be absolutely
in the shadow of our great Marvin Minsky
who knew this subject more deeply than
almost anyone else alive until last year
here he's at the Naval so don't trust
your spell checker postgraduates for it
and Google so Marvin was there from the
beginning of what I like to call the new
testament of computing with all the
greats is Johnny von Neumann Ross ashbey
John McCarthy Claude Shannon and what
Stan ulam said 32 years ago is
absolutely true today all you need to
only change one word where he said tax
payers now you can change that to
shareholders and Stan's I'm going to
give you the family history of computing
Stan and France woz we're friends of my
mom and dad just goes way back so early
first story we have is the 13th century
Roger Bacon tries to build an AI so he
does everything to make this head
exactly like a human head and get it to
speak and waits three weeks and nothing
happens until he finally decides to
raise a spirit just go to the devil and
I could deal with a devil get this thing
to work and I'm not gonna tell you the
whole story you can look it up but it
ends badly and this is a common theme so
and Thomas Hobbes took those ideas it
made that much more rigorous explained
in a very strict sense that all logic
can be done with arithmetic and that you
could have sort of what we now would
call social networks that that delegate
political power and why may we not say
that all automata have an artificial
life and leiden it's made that even more
into a complete system of binary
computation that could be implemented by
a machine without wheels and this was an
insult to his competitor Pascal who had
a machine that worked with wheels and
and lightness was saying how you can do
this with shift registers with no wheels
at all then we get in the 19th century
Charles Babbage or desta ADA who brought
us really what we now call it would call
software and Andre marina pair who
coined the word cybernetics and sciency
cybernetics Alfred Smith its first
person to bring in electricity try and
explain how the mind works no ethical
way you have images that are reality
images that are thoughts the power to
distinguish between the thought reality
is conscious so he hasn't explained
consciousness but at least he's defined
it and he works very hard to not only
define it but explain it developing what
we would now call neural networks models
of how you do deep visual processing
through classifier very very much ahead
of his time and then even this is a
paper where he explains how you could
build a search engine that would do what
Google does find things among vast
bodies of facts but the problems would
have to be the size of London
it would probably break so what we
needed was electronics and it was John
or Ambrose Fleming who brought and
coined the word electronics by looking
at problems in the physics of an
electric plant it's always a problem
that leads to something new so when you
look at an Edison lamp the light is
going in all directions but there were
some odd particles that were going in
one direction what was going on those we
learned we soon learned where electrons
and Edison oddly ignored that he
discovered it but ignored it but the
problem with being famous is that even
if you ignore something it's been
successful we will get named after so it
became known as the Edison effect and
lead the forest we actually have a star
in Hollywood for his work on film
soundtracks he developed that into the
modern vacuum tube with a control grid
so suddenly we had machines that could
operate at the speed of light rather
than at the speed of sound Lewis fry
Richardson gave us everything you need
to know about AI is in this one slide a
mind having a will but capable of only
two ideas so all the principles that
we're still trying to work out are there
in 1930
now Richardson was a very strict Quaker
a pacifist so he realized that that AI
would would be used by the military so
he went into weather prediction and
pioneered that doing digital models of
weather he chuckled if you had 64,000
mathematicians in this great theater
they could calculate the weather as fast
as the weather itself and that's what
what Danny Hillis one of Marvins
students actually did then the military
became in weather prediction came to him
so he stopped all work on weather
prediction and worked on the
distribution of wars in time so now
we've reached the end of the old
testament of computing we're getting to
the new testament the person who brought
us into the new testament was Alan
Turing if you were here at eg two years
ago I got to interview on stage
Alvy Ray Smith about Alan Turing so the
the founding text was in the Proceedings
as an echo society on computable numbers
where he proposes computing machines in
a very abstract mathematical way from
that copy so destroyed was Von Neumanns
genes personal copies you see how well
the engineers studied that document so
in the New Testament there are four
great prophets there's Alan Turing who
wondered whether machines could think
was Johnny von Neumann we wondered
whether machines could reproduce Claude
Shannon who wondered how machines would
communicate with each other and Norbert
Wiener always getting in trouble who
wondered how machines would take control
and let me put that all together he
didn't build the computer that all our
computers were modelled on but he built
that he assembled the team of people who
built it it's all started at Los Alamos
with a machine called Nene AK built for
the army by Eckert and Mauchly and what
Kahneman realized was we needed software
and clari his wife did all the early
programming in either the guinea pigs
she became one of the first coders a new
occupation which is quite widespread
today did the first Monte Carlos imitate
simulations then he needed someone to
build the machine he went to Normandy
nor said who could do this there's only
one guy Julian Bigelow he came down to
person his old austin and they got a lot
of miracles working who led the RCA
research labs where RCA was trying to
build a digital vacuum tube 4,000 bits
like a USB stick done in in vacuum tube
technology and maisy think they made a
proposal this was a posle for a network
of 100 computers around the world that
would predict and control the weather
and but the Select run didn't get built
in time so instead Bigelow built this
high-speed drive with bicycle wheels
that could read 90,000 bits per second
that's a 40-bit word everything so what
I'm the whole point is talking you can
build digital computers using analog
parts and you can build analog computers
using digital parts
is what we're doing now so this you're
putting all these analog it's a hardware
together and making the modern digital
computer that's the first shift registry
what lie bits and vision now done with
vacuum tubes they used the 6j six the
most common cheapest tube you could get
at the time everybody made them they
were reliable there's a twin try out so
it scores one bit they wanted 40000 bits
of memory so they would need 40,000 to
very difficult so instead they used a
clever hack has been developed in
britain of storing bits on the face of a
cathode Richard exactly the same way
your touchscreen works on your iPhone
using standard war-surplus off-the-shelf
5-minutes oscilloscopes tubes they could
store a matrix of 32 by 32 a thousand
bits put these in the machine whose a
giant v40 engine and 20 cylinders on
each side so that's five kilobytes but
all this was driven by work on nuclear
bombs particularly the hydrogen bomb so
the people we remember so well but
Neyman richard fineman standing lamp
they all got run into this project the
deal was if they designed the weapons
from the government they could play with
the computers it was the first person in
that photograph which was Nick
metropolis who took the picture
he was the Hurley of the time and so
this was basically a deal with the devil
back to the 13th century so this is a
letter from Hanoi Minh to Edward Teller
who was pushing harder than anyone else
to build the hydrogen bomb the factory
floor is a gift of God or of the other
party they knew they were doing the work
of the devil but it was worth it so the
result was a weapon that was 1,000 times
more powerful than Hiroshima but in
exchange they could do all these great
things were the computers that we still
do today so even like looking at what we
would now call artificial life could you
evolve living systems within these this
five kilobyte memory very interesting
question Norman some of his greatest
contributions were actually as a
biologist and then of course looking at
the
but what we learned that was 1953 we
discovered the structure of DNA we
learned that life is digital but all
these guys knew very clearly the brain
was not at all digital the brain was not
a doozy computer they were completely
different than if you had to understand
the brain it did not operate on
mathematical logic Rox Ashby looked at
this very his law is that any effective
control system must be as complex as a
system it controls on diamonds law a
complex system constitutes its own
simplest behavioral description that's
why it's impossible to describe things
in a formal way the software and what's
called the third lock if they have a
native after anybody yet any system
complicated enough to behave
intelligently will be too complicated to
understand that that would seem to make
eight real a eye impossible if there's a
big loophole which is the loophole that
we are diving full-speed through today
it's entirely possible to build systems
without understanding there's no law
against that that's what we're doing
we're building things we don't
understand this was all done very early
everyone telling you they've got some
new thing in AI I can show you how it
was done in the 1950s this is work done
by Oliver Selfridge one of Minsky's
colleagues pandemonium which we would
now call deep learning when you develop
a certain universe of demons and let
them compete against each other and
software let the good demons propagate
and create more machines this all become
it has to be done probabilistically Alan
Turing was not allowed to talk about
what he did in the war so he he
laundered his ideas actually had at
least half Bereans ideas we would now
call it Bayesian networks in fact saying
I asked worrying whether we started to
think conscious every asked what did
Troy said yeah he'd say so if he would
otherwise be punished a very good answer
so good wrote the first take her on
ultra intelligence use machines that are
so intelligent that we cannot understand
them and how you build these things it's
best
start with a random Network because it
will contain every network you might
ever need so these pioneers had all the
clear ideas that many people have today
if standing lab what makes you so sure
mathematical logic corresponds to the
way we think it doesn't we don't think
our brains do not work in a mathematical
logical way so the importance of what's
happening today we think it's still the
digital revolution but we actually are
living in an analog revolution if you
look at what's interesting stuff that's
going on or on the Internet is
computation that is treating streams of
bits exactly the way vacuum tubes treat
streams and electrons so it's computing
with continuous functions with pulse
frequency with topology with what
connects where blue button links to what
we're back to analog computing the moral
this where I'm going to get moralistic
now is be careful of where this power
leaves so the first high speed all
optical digital communication network in
the United States was built in the 1880s
in the southwest it covered a hundred
thousand square miles and it was built
to drive out the Apaches who were driven
into Mexico
that's Tirana MO whose nephew they did
was not captured so later and when he
was captured he had 200 still 200 arrows
and he was fighting the US army with
bows and arrows and less than 60 years
later we gone to the age of nuclear
weapons that's how quickly things are
changing back to that deal with the
devil what why did these people do this
on island it's clear he made the deal
because he wanted the computers
Oppenheimer I think it's clear he made
this deal because he wanted the power it
gave him as a as a public figure and
Teller
I think teller was actually not such a
bad guy he did this because he really
didn't trust Stalin and olam why didn't
he want to show the world he was smarter
than Teller and he so he actually solved
the problem that teller and not solved I
was drawn into this by my mother in here
in Athens exactly where you saw the
pictures in Mario's program my mother
was a group theorist
and she told me I have vivid memories as
a child of us driving in her
your dodge convertible up Mount Diablo
with Edward Teller I can remember that
clear as day she was a group theorist
who came to Princeton to well could
curdle didn't work with anybody but she
could work around him and girl by the
way would have nothing to do with a
computer guru was the pioneer of logic
he wouldn't go near that could because
he knew it was being used for designing
bombs that's my mother's outline of her
monograph on noodles theorems so this is
my mother also saved a whole bunch of
negative Susan tiger so this is here
right around the corner keV I went down
there this morning but but I've already
turned in my slides before and after
picture so that's caramel 1956 and when
I was invited here so I'm gonna go look
up in her Diaries and find out when that
trip with teller really was and I found
it in the diary this is what historians
do we try and reconcile what people
remember happened with what really
happened whose actually was July 1953 so
I was four months old I can't possibly
really remember that drive up Mount
Diablo I was told about and that's where
why we need to experience and go back
and find out the real facts I'm gonna
give you two lessons from the whole
thing the first is the technical one
that we've always believed in this
argument that well we're safe from
computers because we need programmers to
program them and as long as the humans
are doing the programming why do we have
to worry well that is no longer true
when you analog nature the analog is
infinitely better for control systems
and there is no programmer so don't take
any comfort in the fact that you think
the programmers are are still in control
they're not and the deal with the devil
everyone talks about the physicists but
what about the devil and why you know
the thermo we never had a sooner clear
war so did we win and we got all the
computers nothing bad happened but
remember I think there's a possibility
it actually was the other way
and that the devil could have said well
I'll take the computers and it's just
waiting and so you know we trust them
completely so that's our job is to make
sure that that doesn't happen to make
sure because the computer is actually a
much more powerful tool of dictatorship
or totalitarianism than any weapon
that's ever been invented and our job is
to keep it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
