you know none of it's down to me it's
all down to four computers anyway we
know alphago is going on in career right
now but I understand that Microsoft has
had a kind of AI hit on its hand in in
China can you tell us a bit about that
project and what you're doing with it
now sure first of all on alphago it's
just incredibly exciting and inspiring
to see these kinds of inflection points
in the field and so so we're just
watching with a lot of a lot of interest
so what you're referring to is is kind
of a strange thing so I want you to bear
with me a little bit in case it sounds a
little bit odd there's a 17 year old
girl in China her name is Xiao Weis or
you know little ice or ice junior and
she's very popular in social media has
about 40 million followers interestingly
she's so compelling about 15 million of
those followers are interacting with
shall Weis about an average of 23 times
a day which is really incredible and of
course how ice is able to do that
because she's virtual she's an AI chat
bot and this started off as a science
experiment in Microsoft Research we've
of course been working with our product
team partners on Cortana for quite a
while and Cortana is an AI that really
tries to understand the semantics and
intent of what people want in need but
there's another way to try to approach
AI which is just through sheer Big Data
and and so we launched that experiment
in China and she's really been the viral
hit so when do we you know when do we
get a kind of chat bot on steroids in
Cortana you know when's that arriving
here well so you know I've always
wondered a how specific to China this is
by the way you know Xiao Weis is now
doing the nightly weather report
national dragon TV in China which is
just incredible
and so she engages in chitchat with the
news anchorman which is
is really crazy we did just launched a
Japanese market version of chalets
called Rinna and she's already attracted
about one and a half percent of the
Japanese population as followers so we
are actively working on and exploring
other markets and so I guess the best I
can say is stay tuned okay and and I
guess this is part of a bigger
transformation for Microsoft where
you're you're famous to be the company
that is good at inventing stuff and then
you have this tendency that sometimes it
it kind of stumbles on the way to
products or you have trouble getting it
out to the real world now to consumers
there's been a bigger story at Microsoft
of the change to Microsoft next where
you're changing how you do research how
does showers and other projects fit into
that and yeah so first of all that
question is incredibly annoying to me i
but it is true that you know I know it
is actually this crazy thing where
virtually every product that Microsoft
has has the imprint of Microsoft
Research technologies in it but you're
right we've always been kind of behind
the scenes and for the most part
traditionally we never went directly to
consumers directly to two people we
always went through Bing or Xbox or you
know Microsoft Word or whatever and so I
think the biggest change now is with
such an adela he is he's really kind of
pushed us and given us permission to to
take things all the way go end to end
and I think that first hit me in the
first few months when such it was the
CEO he was going to he took over I think
in February and in May he was going to
give his first sort of public appearance
as the Microsoft CEO in the Silicon
Valley at the recode conference I think
you said you were there mm-hmm and he he
took a demo he took one of our Microsoft
Research demos which was this
speech-to-speech simultaneous translator
that we were putting into Skype and we
were of course very proud and nervous
and excited that he was demoing this the
demo worked perfectly which was a bit
lucky because the technology was pretty
nascent at the time and then on stage he
said and we will deliver the public beta
by the end of the calendar year and that
was news to you its first time I heard
it and and so it was this sort of
realization we were very excited in the
first 30 seconds and then really
terrified
after that and so that kind of I liken
that to the first time you ride a roller
coaster you really want to ride it and
then when you're going up that first
hill you realize you really don't want
to ride it and then why the time you
finish that first ride you you want to
ride it over and over again and that's
sort of what such an adult is put us
into but isn't it a good thing
especially for AI products if they're
used widely by people they get smarter
that's the best way to make them work
better rather than just wanting to keep
it behind the scenes until it's perfect
yeah I think with the Skype translator
effort you know we have the reach to you
know 350 million daily active users and
so so even just a tiny fraction of those
people using the speech speech
translation service has given us amazing
ability in an unsupervised fashion to
improve the speech recognition and the
translation products in that that's been
really transformational and it's taught
us lessons too because we were always
approaching speech in translation using
training sets from speeches and lectures
maybe optimizing them for for kind of
short business transactions between
strangers like talking to a hotel clerk
or a taxi driver in Skype no one talks
like that you know you have two
co-workers talking to each other or
grandmother talking to a grandchild all
of the speech and language models we
found
are much more intimate and we've had to
redo them from scratch and that just has
just pushed us to a point where we think
now we're on the verge of being able to
do all sorts of let's say Enterprise
scenarios with our language processing
and things like shell Weiss that are
just are able to interact and speak and
converse in very socially relevant ways
has just improved by leaps and bounds
but does it you know does it still go
wrong from time to time and if it does
does it break in a more surprising or
less predictable way than traditional
technologies yeah so we've had a lot of
embarrassing moments the maybe the one
that hit me was I was giving a keynote
speech actually here in San Francisco
about a year ago and I used part of it
to give a demo so as I spoke in English
what was coming over the PA system was
Mandarin and you know I was trying to
pull at people's heartstrings so I
talked about growing up in a small and
snowy town in Upper Michigan and then I
noticed a couple of Chinese speakers
apparently Chinese speakers in the
audience chuckling everyone else was
sort of captivated afterwards when we
were looking at the translation snowy
town in Upper Michigan was translated to
snow white town upper Michigan and I
later learned that snow white town is
slang in China for a prostitute's town
oh dear wasn't caught in our profanity
filters and so there is sort of a steady
stream of these sorts of unpredictable
things one challenge that we've had to
face in the Skype translator is prosody
that's the rhythm and tone of language
so in Spanish if you say something like
a jack you have a daughter now she must
be very beautiful the direct translation
in most of the translators online
including some of our competitors will
translate that in in a very bad way and
and so getting the how bad I mean would
I walk off the stage
you know if I heard it or yeah we might
not we might not talk about yeah they're
pretty bad and and so so we've had to be
able to develop new technology to
capture prosody
there are disfluencies all the ohms and
ahhs and and the resets that people do
in conversational speech and that's led
to more philosophical questions because
if you're trying to get a date in
Shanghai maybe those ohms and odds are
actually part of your charm and so it's
really and when they're all kind of
cleaned out of your speech through the
Skype translator system it's really
raised a lot of questions about you know
what it is that we're communicating and
so does this mean you know Skype
translator is one example cher Weiss is
another / other Microsoft initiatives
where you're going to be more aggressive
in enrolling them out to people so you
can learn from vermin and what might
those be
yeah so you know we've really also been
very deeply I think you'll hear this
over and over again I'm sure you did
yesterday and and you all today about
just the amazing advances in machine
learning in particular in this sort of
ever-widening set of ideas emanating
from the concept of deep neural nets and
deep learning and that's been absolutely
true for us you know in the computer
vision area at the imagenet competition
then in December you know we even
surprised ourselves by learning for the
first time just how much learning
Headroom there is you know we've gone
now in our vision that works into
hundreds of layers using a concept
called deep residual networks and it's
shocking to us that these systems still
get better you know how can it matter if
you have you know 185 layers versus 187
but it does matter
there are meaningful measurable
improvements
and similarly then the ability to really
exploit more and more data is is just
remarkable and there seems to be no end
in sight and so as we develop those
things and deploy them internally of
course there are lots of applications to
make you know make our Salesforce
smarter to improve Bing to you know when
you're if using Windows 10 right now
with the surface book and you know you
wake up your machine it recognizes your
face very accurately now all of these
things are just coming out silly things
like the how old are you robot or the
assets that I was fifty so it didn't go
down well with me yeah we're getting
better don't test it on your spouse
without testing privately and so
photographs ahead of time
the these things are are just reaching
more and more people and so one thing
that we've been very committed to in MSR
through a beta project called Project
Oxford is to take all these things that
sort of get caught off eyed into golden
nuggets and putting them on our cloud
for kind of at this moment for free
access to developers and and all of
these silly apps that we've made which
have sort of been really viral the
source code is open for those things to
give developers an idea of how you can
build very intelligent applications
using these sorts of things that's great
well we're going to be doing some
questions so if you if you have
questions maybe assemble it over the
microphones and I'll wrap them through a
couple more here and be interim one is
you know you talked about doing neural
networks which are hundreds of layers
deep for people who aren't very sad
nerds who spend their time looking at
this stuff that means that it's
computationally phenomenally expensive
you know and if you the more layers you
add on the more your computational
resources needed to compute withing
scales so I are you just giving
certainly Nadella a really big
electricity bill every month like how do
you deal with that side of it and how do
you
more efficient well luckily you know in
Microsoft and I think this is probably
true it the other cloud companies the
internally we get free access to our own
cloud which is I don't know what we'd do
otherwise but it's true so when you use
deep learning to create the machine
learning model the models themselves are
can be very compact and efficient so so
that's not the problem
but the training itself I guess deep
learners if you want to have to
prioritize it people learners are slow
learners so you need a lot of compute
generally and a lot of data and so for
us this is a big deal even with the
global computational resources of the
Microsoft cloud it it can be challenging
and on top of that the growth of
customer workloads on our cloud is
doubling every year
in fact it went up by more than a
percent in the last year a lot of that
doubling is being covered up by Moore's
Law so right now it sounds remarkable
but every month we're adding more
compute more processors to our cloud
every month then we had in the entire
Microsoft cloud just three years ago
which sounds like a lot but if we
actually hit the 7 nanometer wall in
2018 or 2019 and we stopped getting a
mirthless killing effect then these
numbers really become unsustainable and
so we have actually an MSR have been
very active in developing technologies
that both in the near term that we can
deploy as well as in the medium and long
term to try to maintain a Moore's law
like scaling in our cloud
so what spurred near-term stuff I mean
mostly people are just instead of
writing a really big check to Intel
they're writing a big check to Intel and
a slightly smaller but still significant
time some money - and video for GPUs you
know are you doing that or are you doing
other things as well so we're doing
those things but we're also trying to do
some more creative things
in the very near term one thing you can
try to do is to eliminate the
interpretive overhead of an instruction
set architecture and you're gonna need
to go slightly high heaven okay well you
know when you have a CPU like an x86 or
an ARM processor it actually executes a
language that's called the ISA or
instruction set architecture so you can
think of a processor as a piece of
hardware that interprets that language
interpreting a language has overheads so
one thing you can try to do is to get
rid of that interpretive overhead and so
we've been working on using something
called FPGAs field programmable gate
arrays doing some custom design with
partners at Altera to see if we can have
AI workloads compiled directly into
highly optimized Hardware circuits and
the first large-scale experiment was to
implement the Bing ranking web ranking
engine in that way and we reported about
a year ago the first results of that
experiment and they were spectacularly
good and so that has created a lot of
interesting excitement in the here and
now to sort of create much more
capability in terms of lots of different
workloads and our cloud using FPGAs and
also it helped Altera in its getting
acquired by Intel
so you're still writing into a really
big check Intel's please Intel is a
great partner and I guess final question
what about what about quantum computers
like and like how far away away from
that stuff being applies to anything
that we we'd see so quantum computing is
stupendously exciting right now at least
in my part of MSR it's the the largest
area of investment and and we've
we just have the sense that we're on the
verge of major scientific achievements
and those scientific achievements then
you know there's just hope and optimism
that those scientific achievements will
lead to practical outcomes it's hard to
know when and where the way I've tried
to explain it to such an Adela is our
work in speech processing we worked so
hard for over a decade with no
discernible practical improvement and
it's suddenly passed a tipping point and
and the whole deep learning revolution
sort of took off I think a lot of
scientific research has this flavor
where you are kind of heads down for a
long time it's a long game and that's
only person typing point with quantum
you know we've made just gigantic
advances in creating superconductor
semiconductor interfaces that allow
semiconducting materials to operate as
though they are superconducting and what
that means just boil it down is the
possibility of semiconductors that can
operate it as extremely high clock rates
and with very very little or no heat
dissipation and so it's just really
spectacular
fantastic well pizza leaf thank you very
much for spending time with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
