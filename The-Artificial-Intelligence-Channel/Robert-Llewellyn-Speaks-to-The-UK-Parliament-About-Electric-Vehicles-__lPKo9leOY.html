Robert Llewellyn we have until 11:25
a.m. for this session could the witness
please introduce themselves for the
record hello yes my name is Robert
Llewellyn I am a writer TV presenter and
electric vehicle driver thank you can I
call the first question right Stephen
Kerr the bill addresses fundamental
issues which you know in terms of
electric vehicles automated vehicles are
really revolutionising the way that
drivers seat driving that we as a
society see driver do you think the bill
as it stands will address the issue of
public confidence in new technologies I
think it starts to go towards that I
mean it's certainly the key area that
I've been working in doing many public
appearances discussing the impacts of
electric vehicles the fact that it
effectively is a disruptive technology
in the same way as cell phones the
internet you know there has elements of
those disruptive aspects to it which are
never always positive there are some
positives but there's definitely some
negatives and I think one of the things
that it highlights is the ownership
model and it's certainly something that
motor manufacturers are very focused on
is the way we use cars at the moment
it's the 1990 dilemma and I've never
heard anyone dispute that so for 90% of
the time the cars we own at the moment
are idle 90 percent of the girls are
idle 90 percent of the time which is a
when you look at it from that point of
view any other business or industry that
gets 90 percent of its assets idle for
90 % would not be in business and it's a
really difficult challenge and I have I
don't have an answer certainly one of
the answers that has you just been
hearing this that emerging is autonomous
vehicles there's so many complexities as
you've listed very wonderfully in in the
build so far you know when I started to
read it I did get a bit of a fuzzy brain
but that's you know the actor side of me
not
the enormous intellect but I think that
the the challenges it right the raises
are fascinating the fact that I fuel my
own cars with my own fuel that I make in
my house now that's never been possible
before I mean it's conceivable if I
lived in the right part I thought I
could have drilled down extracted oil
built a small refinery find it filled my
car but that's pushing it a bit and the
fact that this technology allows you to
do that not all year round not 100% of
the time but the fact that I can do it
how do how do you legislate that - how
do you tax that fuel how do you you know
all those things are thrown up in the
air and it's very it feels a bit Wild
West ish at the moment so that's
certainly one aspect of it the other
aspect is the charging infrastructure
which anyone who's got an electric car
will talk to you about for a year
because it's such an emerging area when
I first started driving electric cars in
2010 there was one rapid charger in the
country and that belong to Mitsubishi in
Cirencester and he had to arrange to go
and visit it so it was like a day out go
down to Cirencester and use a rapid
charger 90% of the time it didn't work
all the instructions are in Japanese no
one understood Japanese at Mitsubishi so
it wasn't very reliable but now as I've
done you can drive from if you're stupid
enough in the winter you can drive from
London to Edinburgh in and this that
leaf takes a long time it's a miserable
trip it's quicker on the train but it
can be done you know and you can I've
driven all over the country in various
electric cars right now relatively
easily so there has been a dramatic
change in there in the infrastructure of
button there are very few electric cars
on the road if you even double the
numbers overnight there would be issues
with that there's I think 40 percent of
people in the clock of this country
don't have somewhere off the street to
park their car so where do they charge
them you know
so they're us yeah I could I won't go on
too long so there anything that's not in
the bill I think I mean the one waste
the one crucial technology yes that was
your question yeah the one crucial thing
that I think really could be addressed
and has been addressed in other
countries Island California between
places I anova where there is one system
for paying for electricity so everyone's
happy to pay for the electricity that
uses an electric car but it's so complex
I mean I could get the collection of
cards out of my wallet that I need to be
able to use all the charges and very
often I don't have the specific one for
that card and in Ireland there is a one
system and an app that you have and you
can use any charge it's operated by many
different companies and they all get
paid for it but you just have one thing
and that combination of either that or
touch to pay which you can do you can
buy a bag of crisps with touch the baby
you can't buy electricity from a charges
and there are you know no there are
complexities and legal difficulties and
expense in doing that but that would
really make a huge difference it's the
most common complaint I hear is I you
know I haven't got a wallet big enough
to hold all the cards that and you need
a membership and you need subscriptions
you need all that needs to go so that
you literally go up to a charger you pay
for the electricity you're using and you
move on and you don't have any we don't
have join a club to use a shell petrol
pump you just pay for it so that is a
really essential thing Carl toner very
well
the problems we have declare an interest
as a as an owner of an electric vehicle
as well finding somewhere to charges
often extremely difficult one of the
other problems of course is all charging
and the requirement of off street
parking but I noticed very recently the
run cost of parking as sorry charging in
a fleet Council and I wonder what you
think about that and whether local
authorities need to do more to support
councils to provide these charging
points I mean I think it's it's a very
good system that's what their company is
called electricity German but it's a
very good system
my primary into time about it do you
think it's incredibly easy to use you
drive up to it you plug your wire in the
wire has a box that communicates that
tells the company how much electricity
use if like the other end to your car it
starts charging you do nothing and that
is what we need it's that frictionless
ability to do that and there are I can't
remember the figures but there are many
hundreds of thousands of suitable
lampposts and one of the aspects of the
technological change we're seeing is
when a lamppost is converted to LED
lights it has extra access a extra lots
of work capability no juice electricity
that you can take off it without blowing
anything up so it doesn't need any other
infrastructure changes so it's a very
simple system it requires lap posts that
are on the curbside of a pavement yeah
which not all lampposts are but there's
certainly hundreds of thousands of legs
put they fitted a great deal of them and
they've been very popular support my
point is mr. chairman is
the cost to install this will be a
suspect reduced from a live charge I
think it's probably going to be a lot
less cost it's in the hundred other than
fact it is but we have a situation where
local authorities are cash-strapped yeah
you know not every local authority has
an awful lot of electric vehicles I
think this very two charging points in
all City Council I think they're hoping
to get to the dizzying heights of
seventy at some point before 2020 in the
doing the best but I mean you know
shouldn't we be encouraging local
authorities with incentives and I mean
crudely that's really sensors to ensure
that this equipment is available for
everybody it would be ideal I mean I
think one of the other problems we have
is that the technology is changing so
fast so I've just recently driven over a
strip of Road in just outside Paris
which has an induction charging strip
it's set in the road well I don't think
that's going to happen because then
you're talking you know to put that in
the m1 I can't imagine the cost that it
would be in the billions but the idea of
induction plates for static charging so
when you're parked the car starts
charging they're quite common now that
technology is getting cheaper and it's a
really different one to I feel nervous
suggesting anyone invest in enormous
amount in that there have been failures
in public invested charging points
they're in the wrong place they break
down they're not maintained they're not
run by the company that set them up you
know there's been plenty of examples of
that and so it's that it's a it's an
Arab idli emerging technology with that
keeps changing so even the actual wire
you use finally it finally it's a bit
like phones there is now a sort of
standardized type to connector that goes
in every socket goes in every car but
even that was a mystery a while ago so
there is a certain I have a certain
reluctance in going yes make all
capsules
thousands of charges because they might
be the wrong ones in the wrong place and
it's a there's a sort of organic
development that is happening in private
companies starting to put them in car
parks supermarkets put in their car
parts shell for courts now is putting
the racket charges in in there for court
so there is a you know it is happening
but it's happening quite slowly and I
think it's probably it's chicken and
egging like that so there's more cars
than there's more charge more cosmic
judgment you know and it's a really I
wouldn't know how to suggest where to
put them and and finally the bill
requires it makes it mandatory for fuel
stations to provide shouting yes is that
necessary one I actually think it's a
really good idea if there's one group of
fuel supplies that could probably afford
that without too much stress it is the
garage change them and they say and they
seem to be quite keen to do it I think
they can sense a change in public
attitudes I think that's why she'll have
gone ahead and done what they're doing I
know BP you're doing the same don't know
about any other companies but it makes
sense all I would beg them to do is put
in nice chairs and Wi-Fi and reasonable
coffee because you tend to be in the
garage a bit longer before I call the
minister can I just and clarify I've got
the minister Graham Jones Ian Stewart
Matt Western Scott man and Matt broader
to indicated they wish to ask questions
is there any more no that six well you
can do the maths as well as I can if
members could be as brief as possible
with the question and Robert we really
enjoy your eloquence and insight but if
you could be as pithy is possible and
responding
Minister Naoto b-52 okay so broadly for
utopia I said well you welcome your
drones Lenin Barone will be helped by
the fact that the bill suggests that
retailers security elwood have child
pointers access all the way but you're
also saying that we need to do more in
terms of the spread yes I think so
yes just one other point and it's a
chestnut I mean no apology for resting
it one more time in terms of the look
and feel of child points I'm very keen
that they should have some familiarity
you better see a child know what it was
is that what I did yeah very much so
when I mean that's certainly something
that's been discussed a lot I mean if
nothing else like a garage forecourt if
there if there was a child a row of
charge points say it in motor services
or Auto garages only it's under a canopy
that would be nice and that has a
specific kind of coloring that attracts
you to that you know that would be a I
don't know if you can legislate for that
but it would be a great benefit so that
you're not standing in the rain when you
plug your car and you hope that the
coffee but a bit of coffee or tea mint
herbal tea
yes I thought you had better when you
get onto the coffee I have grown jealous
Thank You chair Robert you're a great
enthusiast for automating the electric
vehicles on this bill must please you
know end just a broad question and a
particular question the broad bomb beam
what do you think's missing from the
bill we heard from unites about
integrated transports you know rather
than just the relationship between the
driver and the vehicle by the insurance
company as well some other small matters
so the bigger issue why do you think's
missing what would you like to see if
you were the minister or in charge and
then it's one ask a particular question
at the end about vehicle variations
receive does the bill accommodate what
we will see in the future or what I
believe we'll see in the future it's
different types of vehicle variations
because they're electric vehicles
instead of just before seats a saloon
car yes okay so I would think that the
three things that would be wonderful I'm
definitely not an expert but when I've
seen it you can see how popular its
community electric car sharing /
ownership / use that those when those
little systems organized by local
communities appear they are very popular
with the local community and I'm told
I've seen this in fact kind of small
towns rather than big cities the the
other one is got its backs for villages
yeah almost yes yes yes and then because
also they would then have a dedicated
place where you park and charge them to
you you remove that problem and then you
know there's a lot of there's a lot of
benefits to that I think the thing that
I haven't seen in the bill which i think
is a vitally important part of it is
vehicle-to-grid
technology which is appearing very
rapidly which has a you know an enormous
impact potentially on are not on
vehicles but on the grid on the fact
that say there were three million
electric cars
plugged in overnight
is a staggering amount of electricity
that is a very large power stations
worth of stored energy you only need to
take a small amount from each vehicle so
that technology is is you know it's
available now not in this country very
much but certainly being used I've been
to a I'm trying to keep its pithy an
office in Tokyo that is run by a hundred
miss and leaves that are plugged in
outside they don't use electricity from
anywhere else and those cars of
discharging and charging all day with a
guaranteed amount for the owner to get
home at night so you know that
technology already exists communities
say ah yes
fast charging I think from experience
and this is from experience of driving
many hundreds of thousand miles electric
cars slow charging is really good
destination charging is really good when
you go to a car park and you're there
for two hours topping up it's not not
rapid charging not gotta fill it in ten
seconds that's the kind of in a way of
petrol or diesel mentality I'm driving a
really long way I need to fill it really
fast you do do that but way less than
you you might expect way less 15 20
times a year I use a rapid charger but
if I can go to a car park where I'm just
like a caramel I'm in a meeting go on to
the movies go on to the restaurant and I
add 20 30 40 miles that is an enormous
benefit and if you can do that the more
places you can do that the more car
parks that have chargers fitted you know
that you pay for that you you know ping
your card on and you pay for the
electricity that would be a fantastic
change and those are emerging and every
time I can use one it's an enormous
benefit two or three hours gives you 20
or 30 miles well you think that's not
very much well it's 2015 I figure we've
got let's see can I bring any insurance
a supplementary in your earlier points
about Ireland and California having a
harmonized payment mechanism do you know
did that come about just from the the
industry creating it or was there
government regulation their decision
actually translation yes so there was a
chaotic system in California I'm more
familiar with I don't quite have what
happened in Lima but it was catastrophic
it was a simple bit of government
legislation from there Californian state
registers here that just insisted that
there was one system that you could use
all public charges and I believe it's a
dongle rather than an app that may have
changed I haven't been there for a while
but it certainly was so that's something
you would like this bill or or another
piece of legislation acing thing that
would be an amazing change and I think
it would ease a lot of people who
haven't adopted electric class to go
well how do I charge it when you just
walk on vinegar good and then charge my
question thank you it's great to be in
the company of someone so evangelical
without what do you think you probably
see that in terms of the ambition for
the inner structure of electric vehicles
more tolerant electricals and
replacement petrol diesel by 2040 and do
you think we're being ambitious enough
and compared to other nations and which
of other nations are doing that perhaps
we've
and then I was very pleased when I heard
that announcement I think it's might a
technology might overtake it there's a
possibility there's a strong argument
for that in amongst the sort of
evangelical wolf if that the electric
rope uses whoo I try to stand one step
back from and be a little bit more
objective but it's such a hard thing to
do the number of graphs I've seen to
describe the uptake of new technologies
and how this is going to be what will
happen to the lecture because the
s-curve of adoption I think it's a
really I think our emotional
relationship with cars is really
complicated it's deeper than our
emotional relationship was with landline
telephones or television you know how
television is viewed all those things so
I think it is more complex than that I
don't think it's quite as simple but I
think you could be more ambitious I
think you didn't go to 2030 you know the
technology is advancing so much the
simple fact that the car that I have
longest and this ant leaf has a 24
kilowatt hour battery there is now the
newness only the battery pack is exactly
the same size and it's a 40 kilowatt how
much now that doubled more than doubles
the range of my very battered dirty old
Nissan Leaf I drove to the train station
in today sorry no no people Scott man
just briefly about your experience in
driving in very rural areas you know we
have a lot of energy generation around
the country that happening
history solar and wind and I just wanted
to know whether there are enough
charging points in rural areas and
whether we could do something to
decouple maybe the National Grid in some
of those areas so that some of those
farmers that produce an energy could
effectively provide George I mean that's
it's a whole other area of you know
fascinating stuff going on with micro
grids and local community owned
generation and something I'm involved
with in my village I think it's actually
in many ways easier to have an electric
vehicle in the rural area because you've
generally got some even if it's a muddy
drive or field entrance you can park the
car off the off the road so most people
have that far more people in the rural
area have that ability and also you've
got you generally have a bit more space
to install things or wind turbines or so
so there are they're setting a lot of
that activity happening on a community
level of people generating their own
power they own the assets that do that
and they also install electric car
charges as a local farmer to me who's
putting 20 kilowatts of solar on this
barn roof wants to make half a car
charges
you'd have to drive miles to go get had
under why anyone would he's got some
nice cows
Matt Radha thank you in some ways a
similar question but from an urban
perspective and what would you see is
the most effective way to encourage
urban residents particularly with people
who don't have off street parking to
convert to electric vehicles and then
also my other question would be about
how to incentivize landowners who have
car parks so large employers railway
stations supermarkets to have charges I
mean the the the second part of your
question I feel more confident answering
is that when people do install
destination charges is the common term
for it they all notice an increase in
time spent of individual customers
because they're there
a repeat visitors
I mean it's convincing supermarkets that
if you put charges in your car park
you'll get more customers is is the
argument I was trying news set the
hotels and restaurants have noticed a
marked increase of specific specific
type of customer particularly if it's a
high-end electric vehicle and they put
those charges in there they appear on
the map on the sat-nav and they get
their business like that so that is an
argument rather than that I don't know
whether you could legislate that but
that certainly I can have in favor of
doing it and I think as more electric
cookers appear that will make even more
I feel that would kind of roll itself
out in a way am i able to ask the
supplementary sorry do you feel there's
a need to look at the by the planning
system could incentivize that to get
bird marquee started I would hope that
they would be would be wonderful if
there were encouragement sand and
nudging pressure to say when you build
this new supermarket with the new car
part can you put in 40 car charges not
two not four down the far end but just
one whole side of it is for electric
vehicle charging would be over and it's
not that expensive to do low-cost top-up
charges it's not a big expense a common
policy word then please not take off
diesel vehicles which I know are huge
costly problem stems air pollution so
therefore to achieve future deadlines
with the make sense
you kick on touch the direct incentivize
the purchase of EVs or lorrison vehicles
scrappage schemes etc I mean yes it I'm
just very uncomfortable in pressuring
people you know
in that sense to kind of you know
encourage them yes but to pressure the
Mort it because of the the result of the
you know the misinformation that we all
suffered from a higher the feasel you
know people did and I think that's a
really difficult area I don't I feel
very unfair to a that other you know I I
work on encouragement and enthusiasm I
wouldn't know how to instigate
legislation that would insist on people
buying electric cars I think though beer
incentivizes incentivize yes incentivize
certainly if there are no further
questions from members can I thank the
witness for is evidence given our next
panel of witnesses are not due to give
evidence until 2:00 p.m. I invite the
government with to propose the
adjournment
the question is committee do now adjourn
as many as are of that opinion say aye
aye to the contrary no I think the eyes
have it the eyes have a order order the
proceeding has ended
the proceeding has ended
the proceed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
