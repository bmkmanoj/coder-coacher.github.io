impact of technology on philosophy and
how technology can illuminate or
sometimes even transform philosophical
questions and these are really exciting
times right now in technology with
massive advances just the last few years
in frigid artificial intelligence and
virtual reality that's got them in
youths on a wider scale than ever then
both of these technologies phrase very
deep philosophical questions and what's
artificial intelligence that's an
artificial mind
what's virtual reality that's an
artificial world this is great for a
philosopher because for us because I see
is all about thinking about the nature
of the mind the nature of the world and
the connection between them how can a
mind know about the world for example in
the past I've thought a lot about the
mind and in consciousness and when you
doing that it becomes very natural to
think about artificial intelligence you
know could a computer have a mind
could it be conscious what kind of mind
but it have and about technology like
smartphones as extensions of the mind
but lately I've actually been getting
especially interested in questions about
the world and about artificial worlds
now virtual reality is basically a
technology for creating artificial
worlds virtual reality as I understand
it it's a world it's an environment
which is generated by computer which you
look at today a somewhat like a headset
an oculus rift or an HTC vive or one of
the Google cardboard devices that gives
you an immersive interaction with a
computer-generated artificial world the
expression virtual reality with made
widespread by Jaron Lanier and others
back in the 1980s as this technology
started to be developed there was
actually the term virtual reality was
first put forward in the 1930s by the
French theater scholar Antoine - who
about the theater as a kind of virtual
reality reality which well with
apologies for my my French accent he saw
the theater as a way of generating an
alternative kind of reality here with
human actors on a stage that would give
an immersive experience for those people
watching it these days we use the term
virtual reality more specifically for
something which is an environment which
is generated by a computer in fact if
you want to define a virtual reality one
way to do it is a virtual reality
environment is an environment which is
computer generated which is immersive
it's it's as if we're in the middle of a
whole three-dimensional world which were
fully immersed in and it's interactive
we can interact with that environment it
makes a difference to us we make a
difference to it so I take full-scale
virtual reality it's an immersive
interactive computer-generated
environment called ordinary physical
reality meets two of those three
conditions its immersive feels like I'm
in the middle of it and it's interactive
I'm interacting with it but it's
presumably not computer-generated so it
only meets two out of three
virtual reality is takes the immersive
this into interactiveness and brings in
the role of the computer in generating
this reality artificially so think of it
if you like as an artificial world this
raises any number of questions so time a
moment is a virtual reality that you're
interacting with is that a genuine
reality or is it some kind of illusion
some kind of fiction there's a long
history of people saying virtual reality
is a kind of second-class reality I
think it was within Gibson and
Neuromancer who said cyberspace meaning
virtual reality is a consensual
hallucination
so hallucinate of reality something that
doesn't even exist you watch a movie
like The Matrix
and it's portrayed as if it's all an
illusion it's not real at all I'm kind
of thing this is actually the wrong way
to think about virtual reality that a
virtual world is just as real as a
physical world when one inhabits a
virtual reality we might puts on an
oculus rift or even perhaps when one's
playing a non immersive video game like
a world of warcraft one is interacting
with a genuine digital reality one's
when one sees one's avatar and virtual
reality that's a real body it's just a
digital body when one's in one's
environment by this interacting with
other people when one say in a
environment like Second Life you and the
other people in the water inhabiting a
genuine digital world and there's
nothing fictional about it it's a
digital reality to be sure it's a
different kind of reality from the
physical reality that were used to but
but it's perfectly real for all that for
all that I mean this is really
interesting for a philosopher because it
was back to a thought experiment put
forward by Rene Descartes back in the
17th century in his meditations on First
Philosophy and this is the thought
experiment of the evil demon how do you
know that an evil demon isn't fooling
you into thinking that there's a world
out there of objects and things and
trees and people when none of it exists
and we're supposed to think that
everything we're seeing could be an
illusion well of course the modern
version of that is basically how do you
know you're not in a simulation right
now how do you know you're not in a
simulated reality when none of this
really exists because that's basically
the question how do you know you're not
in a virtual reality maybe I've been
living in a virtual reality my whole
life in which case we're supposed to
conclude - all this is illusory none of
it really exists
at all I'm inclined to think this is
again the wrong way to think about
virtual reality or simulations simulated
worlds are perfectly real worlds they're
just digital worlds will it's
fundamentally grounded in information if
it turns out for example we're living in
a digital virtual reality we shouldn't
say that none of the stuff around us
really exists we should say that we're
living in a world where everything is
grounded in information it's a little
bit like how wheelers famous it's from
bit hypothesis all of reality is
grounded in information we looked at
that forward as AI pollicis about
physics physics might be grounded in the
interplay of information but this is
meant to be a hypothesis about reality
it wasn't one that made reality some
kind of illusion physics is still real
it's grounded in information what I view
that's the right way to think about
virtual reality if we are in a virtual
reality we're living on it from vid
universe where all this is grounded in
information now some people have caused
have speculated that we ourselves may be
living in a virtual reality that our own
environment may actually be virtual and
this is the hypothesis that we ourselves
are living in a computer simulation have
been since the beginning that's the
hypothesis
made famous by movies like like The
Matrix
more recently the philosopher Nick
Bostrom has given some reason that maybe
we ought to actually take this
hypothesis seriously probabilistically
there are gonna be many simulation
technology is getting better and better
we're going to view ibly generate more
and more complex simulated worlds as an
op technology goes on and you might well
expect that any intelligent civilization
will end up producing multiple simulated
universes and that then raises the
question there's probably many more
simulated universes and unsiyyah lated
universes many more simulated being
then I'm simulated beings in which case
boström asked him what are the what are
the odds that we are one of the lucky
ones the few unsubmitted beings at level
0 much more likely that we're at one of
the simulated beings way down they're
much more likely that we're in a
simulation and there's various ways like
them that can go wrong but I think at
the very least it gives us some reason
to take seriously the hypothesis that
you know we could be inhabiting a
virtual reality and to think about what
follows you think of the simulation
hypothesis the hypothesis that we're in
a simulation as a version of the
multiverse idea that there are multiple
universes coexisting because yet our
universe will be a local universe which
is a simulation presumably whoever
created this simulation created other
simulations maybe they created a million
simulations overnight slightly different
parameters to watch them run and see
what happens so there's a multiverse a
million simulated universes right
they're all contained within another
universe at the next level up and who's
to say of course that universe is not
simulated - so this gives you a kind of
branching multiverse structure of
universes within universes within
universes maybe there's a top-level
universe which is not simulated but at
every level beneath this there'll be
simulations within simulations within
simulations I mean some people have
speculated maybe there's a theology here
whoever created our universe the
simulator well that's in a way that's
our God what's our Creator this being
might be all-powerful able to control
our universe all knowing knowing what's
what everything that's going on in our
universe some people have even proposed
that we should be yeah yeah maybe
forming religions around around the idea
that our simulator is our God now I'm
gonna religious person myself and I
think this would be a there's something
in this idea I mean this being really
would be would count as a creator it
would be all-powerful it would be
all-knowing at the same time this put
all I think the natural
explicable in terms of say the laws of
physics just the laws of physics of the
next universe huh
there'd be nothing Supernatural about it
more importantly I think is that to be a
religion I mean it's good to be
something like worship or some very deep
spirituality involved I don't see any
reason why being simply in virtue of
creating our universe by simulation in
virtue of knowing everything and being
all-powerful that that might give us
respect for this being maybe even a kind
of or I'm not gonna worship that being
you know who knows maybe such a teenage
hacker in the next universe up that's
created this universe for fun well great
and I'm glad that I exist so thank you
but you know I refuse to worship you and
if you ask me that is actually I'm an
atheist for a for a number of reasons
but the most fundamental reason I have
to being an atheist is I cannot imagine
a being that would be worthy of worship
that would deserve worship it just seems
an inappropriate attitude to me to have
towards any beings even if there is an
all-powerful locally all-powerful
creator
well well wonderful but I'm not going to
erect religion around you so I've been
cloudy at best these beings our
simulators might be gods with a
lowercase G not gods with a capital G of
course the question just arises at the
next universe up at the next level who
created them did someone create the
whole system of universes and I see no
particular reason to think so maybe if
you wanted a genuine traditional God
you'd need a God of the entire
multiverse someone who created the whole
multiverse rather than just a local god
who created this local universe and as
far as I can tell there's no particular
reason to think there has to be some God
responsible for creating the whole
multiverse so no the chances are the god
you're gonna get from this kind of
simulation theology is extremely
watered-down God that would probably
seem somewhat blasphemous from the
tradition from the perspective of
traditional religion well people will
make religions out of anything you know
so there is a strong religious impaired
if you find in many people which I don't
share myself so I mean it may well be
that some people are going to want to
make religion out of the idea of us of a
simulation and within decades we're
gonna have simulation theology and
simulation religion all around us with
people tape praying to their great God
the simulator the Creator I think that
would be a terrible mistake I don't
think anyone ought to be making a
religion out there something anyone up
to be forming their moral code based on
the idea we're in a we're in simulation
at the same time the simulation idea is
extremely interesting because of the
possibility of giving even a
watered-down version of the traditional
theistic hypothesis of God in a
framework that seems compatible with
science I don't want to say this is a
scientific idea in the sense that it's
one that science has demonstrated or
even might demonstrate I think it could
well be that we were in a simulation
maybe we'll never get get proof of this
or if we're not maybe we also can't get
proof so I don't want to say we're
exactly in those in the territory of a
scientific hypothesis it's more perhaps
than the philosophical hypothesis but
interestingly it is a version of God
which is consistent with science in a
way that you may have thought many other
versions of science somehow require
positing something it goes beyond our
general scientific picture of the world
spirits or forces or all goodness and
love well no the simulation hypothesis
just doesn't do that all we need is
physics in the next universe huh all we
need is technology that we already
understand I'm the technology of
creating artificial worlds they're
probably going to be at official worlds
that we just changed perspective and say
maybe we're there and this could be our
situation we are created in a completely
scientifically explicable way so again
don't make religion of that but still
you get some components of the
traditional religious view of creation
power and knowledge perhaps of the of
the of the creator when some people
might speculate on the possibilities of
an afterlife if we're able for example -
if we are ultimately code and that code
could be uploaded into a different
environment maybe the environment of the
next universe up so think of it as a
science compatible version of ordinary
religious some people do Siva do see
virtual reality as a as a way of living
forever or at least in a virtual
valuable this wonderful TV show black
Meera had an episode recently is it
Illustrated now the main characters get
to upload themselves into a virtual
reality environment and live forever as
a kind of heaven that it was all very
idyllic you live on a beach as gauzy
gauzy music and drive around in their
sports car you know I've got a feeling
that heaven is gonna actually get kind
of boring after it ends after a year or
two and they're gonna wish for a
somewhat more substantial reality to
live in but I think you know it may well
be that in the future we develop virtual
realities for us to ask to hang out him
there as substantive and as interesting
as genuine reality and many people may
choose to spend their lives in happening
those virtual realities what is missing
if anything in a simulated world you
could recreate all the causal structure
of a world in a simulated world and
connect it up to a conscious human being
who interacts with it
is there something fundamental that's
missing here some people think live
feelin that kind of virtual simulated
reality would be meaning would be
meaningless so it would be valueless in
fact the philosopher Robert Nozick had
an experiment he liked it the thought
experiment you'd like to tell the case
of the experience machine just say you
had the option of entering into a
machine for the rest of your life that
would simulate your world would produce
all kinds of wonderful experiences where
you were successful and had wonderful
friends and became the world champion of
whatever
that was all pre-programmed and it was
all simulated and Nozick said you would
not choose to enter that world I would
not choose to enter that world many
people have taken that to be a reason to
think that virtual reality is somehow
second-class at least in the sense of
being valueless meaningless not a way in
which you could live a fulfilling life I
think that music again was action those
other Nozik was wrong about that or at
least his his reasoning does not support
this conclusion about virtual reality
being big meaningless I think one thing
you do get out of Nozick's thought
experiment is that living in a
pre-programmed reality which everything
that happens to you is for ordained by
certain creators is basically it's not
meaningless relax
much of what we find meaningful in our
lives which is the challenge of living
our own lives creating our lives
overcoming obstacles and creating our
own destiny a pre-programmed environment
will give us that but it's only a
virtual reality there's no reason why a
virtual reality has to be pre-programmed
in fact probably the very definition of
virtual reality that I gave before is
its interactive you the person at the
center are inhabiting a virtual reality
you get control you still get to think
you get to control your body you get to
interact with others you have as much
free will I think in a virtual reality
in principle at least as you do in a non
virtual reality so as far as I can tell
pre programming is not a it is not a
count against virtual reality and I
myself don't see why you shouldn't be
able to live a life in a virtual
environment which is as meaningful as
fulfilling at least in principle as life
and a non virtual environment but for
now the virtual environments are very
stripped down and sparse and the
entities interactions within them are
never ripped as in ordinary physical
reality but give it a few years you know
within a decade or two I'm sure we're
gonna have virtual reality but begins to
be
visually in order terally at least
indistinguishable from worlds like ours
I mean something's gonna be harder the
role of the body hunger thirst sex
earth-death okay so something is gonna
take a while to build in to virtual
reality might suspect within a century
or two there will be matrix-style
virtual reality which is more or less
indistinguishable from our kind of
reality and then the question arises
would that matrix tile virtual reality
indistinguishable from our reality
perhaps better in some ways that may
contain features that we can't even
imagine now would there be something
fundamentally deficient about that
reality such as if you chose to spend
your life in it you'd be somehow missing
something vital that gives life
meaningful its life meaning and some
people take that attitude to virtual
reality but I'm inclined to think no
there's nothing that would be missing in
principle one's life there could be
could be just as meaningful and may well
turn out that if we treat a little badly
then living in a living in a virtual
environment is going to be an attractive
option for for some people the world may
be much may be much more inhabitable and
I'm sure we're gonna face a debate maybe
even a political debate about the
division between the virtual and a
non-virtual and it's probably a lot to
be seven either side I don't see any
fundamental philosophical obstacle I've
always been fascinated by technology in
fact uh back when I was 12 the first
micro computers came out and I remember
going to the store and playing with a
trs-80 before long when I was 14 I got
my first Apple 2 computer my parents
gave it to me for present for a
Christmas present I'd loved playing with
uh with these computers I'd actually the
very first virtual reality i inhabited
was not a immersive virtual reality I
played an old text adventure game
original adventure which took place in
colossal
cave and you interacted with dwarves and
treasures and you threw axes at them all
through a text interface but nonetheless
you
the sense of a virtual world where this
system of caves which seemed very real
to me and it was implemented on a
computer now later on of course virtual
reality but much much better erika image
technology eventually turned 3d but some
of the basic ideas were present back
then what is the nature of this reality
I was interacting with in colossal cave
later on I went on to I studied math I
went on to do my PhD in an AI lab in
doubt Hofstadter's artificial
intelligence lab in Indiana where
surrounded by people working on
basically on artificial minds or at
least on artificial cognition think
about how you can get the processes of
the mind running on computers so I did
my own PhD in philosophy but I did and I
concentrated on consciousness but at the
same time I was doing a lot with
computers from the start so I've
basically always been computer junky and
it seems to me that computers are
especially interesting to a philosopher
or anyone else because they give ways of
artificially recreating almost anything
you like they would create you know the
underlying structure of anything your
life can be at least simulated partially
recreated on a computer I thought for a
long time about that in the case of the
brain now what happens for example if we
create the structure of the brain on a
computer mice interacting silicon chips
where you had interacting neurons would
it be missing anything that's missing in
the mind I'd like to think that actually
a computer could be I could be conscious
that's a long tradition of thinking
about technology in philosophy and
especially about information technology
ever since the computer age got going in
the in the middle of the 20th century I
mean Turing Alan Turing himself
published his original article and the
Turing test in mind or the philosophy
journal around 1950 and rapidly
afterwards philosophers began paying
attention hilary putnam the great
philosopher in the 1960s started
publishing articles on minds
machines the computer model of the mine
that led to what they called
functionalism which is basically a
computer inspired philosophical theory
of the mind and really it never looked
back at least for some decades damn
denna did all kinds of extremely
important work that brought him
computational thinking just to keep out
the mind and to keep out AI in
particular Jerry Fodor who's another
philosopher of mine was not quite so
keen on AI but nonetheless was giving a
computationally grounded theory of mind
from the side so these ideas have always
been very important in philosophy when I
was a graduate student in the late 80s
and early 90s everyone in the philosophy
of mind was thinking very hard about
artificial intelligence then the big
thing was neural networks neural network
theories of the mind and where these
were going interestingly all sort of the
bottom dropped out for a while in the
mid 90s when such a neural network
movement hit a brick wall and people
started focusing their a I dropped off
the sort of the intellectual scene for a
little while except in certain small
small parts for 10 or 15 years potato
food news philosophers weren't paying
that much attention I think a lot of
people weren't paying that much
attention to AI now suddenly my last
just in the last two or three years all
that has really changed again in part
because of the resurgence of AI
interestingly the very same neural
network technology that was big when I
was a student
now rebranded as deep learning powered
by much greater computational power much
bigger datasets and bigger networks has
proved to be able to do things far
beyond what it could do back in the
nineties that's that's different some of
the interest someone once said if the
mind was so simple we could understand
it we'd be too simple to understand the
mind so maybe there is something
essentially complex and explicable about
the mind and maybe deep learning part of
its charm is that it's machine learning
system that develops things we simply
could not have understood or predicted
you know
I mean the technology of deep learning
is not something new it's the same
technology of neural networks and back
propagation that was big 25 years ago
it's crossed a threshold though into
being useful in a way which it just
wasn't it image recognition speech
recognition and so on have just gotten
to the point where they're now useful in
a widespread way and with companies like
Google and Facebook and so on that have
all that data it's made things possible
it simply weren't possible before and of
course autonomous vehicles self-driving
cars I've got to be a big part of that
so I suspect there's not exactly gonna
it's not going to be an AI winter um you
know the technology is just too useful
and now it's kind of massive amounts of
funding poured into it through the
industry whether it's brought on immerse
vehicles or machine recognitions or
whatever but it does leave the question
open is there actually going to be a
fundamental intellectual breakthrough
and I think we've had small
breakthroughs the last few years but not
yet a major breakthrough one thing I'm
really interested to see over the next
decade is what it turns out that these
deep learning systems can do and what
turned out to be the fundamental
obstacles and it wouldn't surprise me if
we we come to the view that you know we
still need three fundamental
breakthroughs to get to human-level AI
and that ends up taking another 50 to
100 years I always swore as I've never
got a write about ethics
even though ethics is part of philosophy
and philosophers are supposed to be
experts on ethics I don't have any
special ethical inside that's not where
my talent lies why should anyone listen
to me on this stuff but lately I've been
getting drawn in a bit ethical questions
I was an invitation from the
Presidential Commission on bioethics to
talk about the Obama brain initiative
was Lobby potentially recording brain
patents and that's to bring in ethical
questions about uploading your mind onto
a uh onto a computer and privacy and
identity implications I think AI
artificial intelligence in particular
raises some pretty deep ethical
questions because of the impact the huge
impact of AI on the world I mean it's
coming up even in the near term
with for example debates about
autonomous weapons and autonomous
vehicles and how we can control those
that have killed too many people more
subtly with things like machine
classification technology how to avoid
for example yeah deep learning systems
basically giving you racist or sexist
outcomes when they for example classify
people from sort of certain races or
from certain zip codes as being
ineligible to receive loans or as more
likely to commit criminal offences I
mind sort of ethical issues there we had
a whole conference at NYU recently on
the ethics of AI focusing partly on
those issues but especially on the long
term issues what happens when machines
are as intelligent as powerful as humans
and beyond because everything that's
going to happen then is gonna be at
least in part a function of what those
machines want what they have as their
goals what they have as their their
values so we need to think very
seriously about the values that go into
those machines and how machines will go
about following them this is a place
where philosophers have had something to
contribute over the years about what the
fundamental values I don't think there's
at least an interesting project of
thinking about what are the kinds of
values you could instill in a machine
who controls the values and the goals
that go into the AI is is it Google and
Facebook the industry that gets to
program these things doesn't the
government is it somehow our collective
is it just whoever is lucky enough to
invent the first greater than human
level yeah you know this is a debate to
have about that you know whose value is
because we don't have a single set of
collective human values whose society
and I think what's gonna happen as it
already happening people thinking about
the future of AI or having this this
debate so I started out as a
mathematician there was always a math
geek growing up I was doing math
competitions and nothis and math lab and
I got through my undergraduate degree in
Australia and I went to Oxford then I
was always gonna study math but but
something partly because it seemed to me
that math was the most fundamental level
of
explaining things and reality you see is
a great chain of the sciencism chemistry
explains biology and physics extract
explains chemistry no it seemed to me
that that mathematics was at the basis
even in physics and somehow with more
fundamental and that was why I was drawn
to mathematics but you know I never
really knew about philosophy eventually
came to me to see if you really want to
understand all of those things
mathematics physics chemistry biology
how all of them fit together you have to
ask some philosophical questions about
the nature of reality about explanation
about how everything fits together and
in particular I was drawn to what are
the really fundamental questions about
reality as so much seems you by this
time late 1980s so much of the world is
still now well understood math pretty
well understood physics not perfectly
understood pretty well understood what
is it that we really fundamentally do
not understand and the thing that stuck
out to me like a sore thumb was
consciousness you know the human mind in
general but in particular consciousness
subjective experience we just did not
have a clue as to how subjective
experience fits him to a standard
scientific picture of reality I think
that's something which many people will
still concede today so I said I can well
that's what I want to think about
there's a topic here which is absolutely
fundamental
absolutely familiar it's still
absolutely a lender's to it it's a
complete mystery to it
how could we study consciousness and to
me the best way into the subject was
through philosophy I could have gone
into psychology on neuroscience and yeah
sound of the bench or done experiments
but it seemed to me those were always
going to be fairly limited and piecemeal
approaches especially at the beginning
for young scientists before tenure and
so on it seems we do a portrait from the
to take the big picture on consciousness
really the best way to do that was
through philosophy where you can exploit
the work that scientists are doing but
try to integrate them all together and
you know people like Dan Dennett and
many others have have shown the deaths
that's possible so I got drawn in which
are thinking about consciousness while
still thinking about computers
and everything else and eventually came
to seem to me there was very huge
problem here we didn't understand the
name of that you know writing a book all
about the hard problem of consciousness
and I spent a lot of my life working on
on that topic the place of the mind and
consciousness in the in the physical
world but the same time this past nation
with computers has never gone away and
as a philosophy you get to think about
the nature of the mind and the nature of
the world and my focus has lately been
going more and more to the technology
and more and more to the world side of
the equation actually I mean an
intermediate point was when I started
doing work with Andy Clark on the
extended mind which is the idea that the
technology we use somehow becomes part
of our minds so you know my smartphone
for example has becoming part of my
memory system we all know we used to use
our biological brains to remember phone
numbers who use of the brain to remember
a phone number in law your uh your
smartphone does it instead and Andy and
I argued that our technology has
literally become extensions of our of
our minds this is extending the mind out
into the world and this is certainly
which digital technology does for us but
let you know virtual reality technology
is taking this just another step further
with its artificial world actually
coming very soon there's going to be all
mental reality technology where everyone
is going to be a augmented reality
technologies where you see the physical
world but there's also virtual objects
and virtual entities that you perceive
in the middle of them maybe will will
put on you know virtual augmented
reality glasses and will have augmented
entities out there maybe computer
screens that we're using maybe to
recognize someone my face recognition
snuffs are great but maybe my augmented
glasses will will tell me ah that's Jon
Brockman and a bit of AI inside my
virtual my augmented reality glasses
will recognize people for me my firm
prediction is that smartphones are gonna
disappear the way that pagers did and
part of the reason is we're gonna start
everything's going to be in our glasses
who's gonna need a yes muffin what
you're wearing glasses
our contact lenses it just project
screams into the world in front of you
far bigger more readable more engaging
than anything you can get on a smart op
on a smartphone or even a desktop
computer and much more interactive so it
means it's or this in development and in
two or three years that kind of stuff is
gonna start to be out there more but in
ten or fifteen years I think it's gotta
become out my guess is that's gonna
become our fundamental way of
interacting with computers and though is
actually gonna there's not going to be
such a need for screens and in everyday
life that's just my prediction you know
there are gonna be things AI is gonna
start to be integrated with those things
so then although I've been talking here
as if AI is one topic and virtual
reality is another topic for the day is
coming when they are integrated when for
example we use glasses to projected
augmented reality computationally
generated environment with all kinds of
information probably driven by AI will
recognize people for us it will give us
recommended routes you know Google Maps
will be there in the in the in the
glasses two minutes at that level AI is
going to stop to become artificial
intelligence will start to become an
extension of my mind I suspect before
long we're all gonna become very reliant
I'm already very reliant on Maya on my
smartphone and my computer's at these
things gonna become more and more
ubiquitous part of our lives it's just
for for philosophers maybe the mind
starts bleeding into the world you know
so many parts of the world are becoming
parts of our parts of our mind that
eventually we start moving towards this
increasingly digital reality and that's
raises the questions I said with how
real is all of this and it's ultimately
going to be an interaction of artificial
or augmented minds with artificially
augmented worlds and I think it's this
augmentation this mixing of the natural
the physical and the artificial both on
the side of the mind and on the side of
the world that's in our our future ai
augmenting the mind virtual reality of
menteng the world and the two of them
all and interaction that's my vision of
the future
