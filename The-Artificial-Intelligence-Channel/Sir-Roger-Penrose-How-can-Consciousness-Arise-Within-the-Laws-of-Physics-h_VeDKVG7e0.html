TSC 2017 I can show you it does get
sunny here and in fact that we were all
in bikinis in on December the 15th and
now I put a really horrible image into
your head something right no not me
right not me anyway so I think we live
in a very exciting times for this
discussion of sort of conscious as an AI
because we're getting to the point where
computers are getting more powerful
enough that they can start to maybe pass
the Turing test and give us some run for
money as human beings some people find
that a bit scary some people find it
very exciting and it'll change
everyone's lives it will certainly
change their own lives let's hope all
for the better
generally scientific change has improved
our lives over the years and not being a
disadvantage so I think many of the sort
of the very negative things that we see
mainly coming out of Hollywood are you
know it's sort of a bit bit too negative
so we have three speakers today
the first one is roger penrose roger
penrose got stewart and i both
interested in consciousness many years
ago when he wrote his book the emperor's
new mind and roger is going to explain
to us how he thinks that humans have a
different type of intelligence the
machines and that maybe it's a quantum
gravity computer our second speaker is
Yoshi bark he thinks that computers
indeed could be conscious and and it
sees no reason why not
and indeed will explain to us that the
theory by which they would achieve that
sort of consciousness and our third
people speaker is haben heben from
google and he is building the world's
most powerful computers or at least they
hopefully will be the most powerful
computer in a few years time when he
perfects all of the things so quantum
computers not the quantum gravity
computers that Roger is saying that we
need but these quantum computers and
he's going to explain to us how come
quantum computers work and how far
they've got with building a quantum
computer a very fascinating talk and a
very fascinating guy so I won't talk any
further because I'll use up valuable
real speaker time let's have Roger
up to the stand for this first speech
well it's great pleasure and honour for
me to be able to address this meeting
and I want to present the point of view
that I've had for some while although
modified in various ways which is that
consciousness is not the result of
computation it's something else let's
see if I can get this thing to work here
it's an old-fashioned technique I'm
afraid I can't read what I've written
unfortunately because my eyesight is
deteriorating somewhat but I hope you
can I can get the gist of what I said
and that is well consciousness there are
many aspects to consciousness and people
often refer to many of them like things
that we feel which might be pain or
which might be the appreciation of
beauty or love or a color or something
like that and the experience that we
have however what I want to say
something very very specific and the
argument is that if this very specific
thing is something that can be shown to
be not a computational thing then this
raises the question of whether these
other qualities could ever be explained
in fact it's more improbable in a way
that the perception of the color blue
for example is a computation than the
things I'm going to talk about because
I'll talk about mathematical things and
people tend to think mathematical things
well well that must be computational so
I want to try and explain why that's not
the case and why understanding I want to
concentrate on understanding I mean of
course as I say that it's not it's a
very limited aspect if you like of what
consciousness is because we can be
conscious of all sorts of things without
understanding them but understanding I
claim is something which is dumb
demonstrably not the result of a
computation of course even in the way we
use computers see where we use computers
is to do complicated calculations the
computer doesn't know what it's doing it
doesn't understand anything that it's
doing I can illustrate that a bit more
and what I want to say in a moment but
we have to present the understanding
which tells us what computation to do
and what the computation means in the
end so in from that point of view it's
something rather different now I am not
sure I can see that's the trouble with
this system I can't see what I'm doing
here let me move this to the so I hope
you can see the whole transparency I
think you can okay I think perhaps I've
covered what's on that so let me move on
let me give you an example this is one I
made up recently it's a chess position
and it's an example which is stimulated
by one an example which was made up a
long time ago but let me give you this
one so so long as you understand the
rules of chess you will see this is
rather strange position black has an
enormous advantage you see Queens and
rooks and bishops and things you might
worry about all those bishops bringing
up being on the same color it's not an
illegal position because the two of the
bishops were Bishop by pawns you see you
can move the pawn up to the end of it
and change them into a bishop that's
perfectly legal and they're also on the
same color which you might worry about
that but that's perfectly legal again so
the position is a genuine one and it's
easy to see that it's a draw because the
black piece is here or trapped by the
barriers of pawns they can't move if you
don't if if what does it leaves them
alone they're completely trapped and the
bishops can't do anything because the
the barrier is impervious and the
bishops they're on the wrong color so
it's obvious if you know much about
chess that this can't be won by black
but if you show this to any of these
very high-powered chess-playing
computers these will say that it's a win
for black and you can see it's
completely wrong in fact I think some of
these
well actually because there's a rule
about about a draw if you go on and on
and on without a piece being taken or a
pawn moves and if you do that for 50
moves then it's announced as a draw now
the thing is here that what black may
according to one of these chess playing
machines the black starts sacrificing
these bishops which is ridiculous to do
of course because it thinks that it
doesn't want to draw because the win you
see but it's not and so all you have to
do is move the King up to here and then
you checkmate in a couple of moves so
that's a stupid thing to do so what I'm
saying is that the little bit of
understanding of what the game is about
can get this particular position right
even though what's going wrong now okay
anyway it just shows that a little bit
of understanding in certain
circumstances it can defeat what a very
very powerful computer can do which
could defeat almost every well defeat or
at least draw with any human so let me
move on this is just to demonstrate that
there's something a bit different about
human understanding and simply computing
of course you could put rules like that
into your program and make it make the
right answer for those positions but
that's being wise after the event now of
course you could argue that chess is a
finite game and so no matter how clever
your position is if you had a powerful
enough computer it could simply work the
whole thing out to the end this isn't a
very good system can this be made more
horizontal or not yeah that's better
thank you right just leave that down
there oh okay
anyway so what about the infinite and
this is where you start to see real
differences now you might say we can't
think about infinity that's completely
wrong for example you could think about
the statement if you add two odd numbers
together you always get an even number
now that's a statement about an infinite
number of things and it's very very easy
to appreciate you don't have to think
very hard to realize that's true for all
numbers and for all numbers that's an
infinite number of numbers so in
mathematics there's no real problem
about thinking about infinity however
the rules that you use to talk about
infinity that's where you can raise the
question about the difference between
understanding and pure computation again
I can't see what I've written here so
that's not worry I hope it's on there
whatever I want to say now let me
explain how one often deals with the
infant in in mathematics actually some
of these I may need back again so I'm
not quite sure what to do here we go
this is one of the ways that one learns
at school how about how to deal with the
infinite suppose you had a proposition
which depends on the natural number when
I say a natural number I mean 0 1 2 3 4
a whole number a non-negative whole
number now if you want to have a
proposition which depends on the number
N and natural number N how would you
prove that that's true
without running through all possible
ends well the standard way of doing it
is to prove it's true for 0 and then
prove that if it's true but for n then
it's true for n plus 1 for some
particular n then it's true for that
particular n plus 1 and that is what's
called mathematical induction
now that's an example of a something you
could put on a computer so you could put
that rule on the computer it's fun and
you can do all sorts of other rules on a
computer what I want to show
is that rules actually let me keep my
can I keep that gonna flop off like the
others there's a very famous theorem and
my position on on this was very much
influenced when I was a graduate student
at Cambridge and I went to various
things which weren't at all what I was
doing one of them was a course on
mathematical logic and I learned about
the girl theorem and I previously
thought well a girl theorem says you
can't prove certain things in
mathematics that didn't like that idea
but that's not what it says so what it
says is described here and again I'm
afraid I can't read it but never mind
it's if you're given a system of clear
improving rules let's talk about
theorems in mathematics about natural
numbers they could be things like
Fermat's Last Theorem that Andrew Wiles
proved a few years ago or it could be
Goldbach conjecture which is still
unproved that is that every even number
greater than two is the sum of two prime
numbers very simple thing to state but
nobody knows for sure if it's true it
probably it's true
but nobody has a proof of it but the way
you could prove these things is have a
system of definite rules and these rules
would give you a proof now I'm calling
the rules are and the thing is that if
you want to use the rules you've got to
believe that the rules don't give you
nonsense like two equals three that of
course would be an example of an
inconsistency now the famous girl or
theorem what girl showed was if you have
rules which are checkable by a computer
so that is to say if you have what you
claim to be a correct application of
these rules and the computer can then
check to see if that's true or not so
that's the kind of rules I'm talking
about so I should have said that this is
not just girdle's theorem but it's the
Turing version of girls then I think I
want you to hold these things too if you
could
so let me see if I'm fine this yeah hold
all that thank you
yes this is the curing version worthless
theorem which is actually a lot easier
to prove than the tip in the original
girl healthier than the girl of theorem
was horrible to proof the point about
this no don't take it away the point
about this is it is in the right place
it's not in the right place
oh it should be in the right place okay
thank you yeah so what girl shows is the
for any assist system of computational
rules of proof you can construct a
particular statement about numbers and
this sounds like what I call G of our
the girl or statement of our which has
the strange property but first of all
it's true and secondly it's it's not
derive herbal by means of the rules now
how do you know it's true well because
it states something about the rules that
you have to trust if you're going to use
the rules they see the rules if you're
going to use them and believe the
results you've got to believe that the
rules only give you truth and don't
enable you to prove two equals three so
those rules have to be well they have to
be consistent if they were inconsistent
then you could prove two equals three so
they have to be consistent and they well
they let's say they have to be they have
to be sound which is the world logicians
useful they have to give you only right
results so as long as you have that
faith in the rules if you're allowed to
use the rules and believe that using
them gives you the right answer then you
must know that G of R is true however
it's not drivable using your rules
so you it's your understanding of why
the rules work and allows you to
transcend the rules to the rules
whatever they are be good and aren't
good enough to prove d'ivoire yet your
understanding of what the rules do does
tell you the G of R is true so we've
somehow transcended the rules by use of
an
standing and an interesting point here
is you've got to know you've got to
understand what G of our means and
meaning is an essential feature here see
what people don't think is well what's
meaning you just use the rules and it
doesn't matter often in mathematics you
have systems where you don't you're not
interested in what the symbols mean
you're just interested in the rules
that's fine that gives you a useful kind
of area like group theory and things
like that
but for this particular case
you really need to know what the
elements that the rules are operating on
are and what these elements are are
natural numbers 0 1 2 3 4 etc and there
are other systems where you have funny
kind of funny kind of numbers where the
G of our wouldn't be true so it really
does depend on your understanding what
they are the operations you what things
are you're operating on what things mean
and the meaning is something which is
not encapsulated by the rules and it's
an important point that meaning
something different ok well what this
basically tells you is that our
understanding is not rule driven it's
not a computational thing but it's
something we do in our heads it's
something that enables us not just to do
things like this but to write computer
programs and make them do what we want
and we know they do what we want because
we understand what the operations are so
that's the way computers are used and so
on well I want to show you see what this
tells me is that what is actually going
on in our heads is not rule driven it's
not algorithmic there's something else
now you see the laws of physics let me I
wasn't quite sure which order over do
this and let me do it here I I'm going
to talk about you see I've just been
talking about yeah maybe I'll take this
is helpful thank you I've just been
talking about some mathematics you see
and I said at the beginning that
mathematical understanding is something
very limited you could understand lots
of other things
what about understanding in general well
I'm saying if mathematics understanding
you might exceed think this is the most
likely to be something you put on a
computer but that's on the other hand
it's that it's the thing you clearly
can't quit on the computer that's that's
well-established piece of mathematics
that mathematics itself there are many
things in mathematics which are not
computational and I'll give you an
example in just a minute but what about
other forms of consciousness well
conscious understanding or what about
consciousness human yet human
understandings when I said human
consciousness animals like well I would
certainly believe with at least many
animals have consciousness I'm sure
they're enough like us people talk about
their dogs and believe it they're
conscious I think it's absolutely right
squirrels I would think that birds are
conscious all sorts of things but I
don't know how far down it goes what
about life well I think not all life is
conscious but there is a line between
what's conscious and what isn't and all
I am saying that conscious things are
making use of something that unconscious
things aren't do we have a problem ok
now I don't believe that our
consciousness is some mystical thing
which comes flying around and whatever
it is I think it is something to do with
the way the laws of physics operate now
if the laws of physics are not
computational and I said I was gave you
an example I think I put the slightly
other order from what
I'll give you an example of something
which is not computational and these
things are quite easy to some examples
are very easy to explain I think this is
one of the easiest ones to let me say
suppose you have a finite set of
polyominoes now what's a polyomino it's
let me cover this up for the moment so
it's not to confuse the issue polyomino
is well in these shape shapes like one
of these things now just to say a set of
equal squares stuck together to make a
shape and the part of the problem what
were that we're trying to address here
is can you use that particular shape to
cover the plane completely if it's an
individual square obviously a corridor a
little rectangle clearly you could but
what about shapes like these well
individually none of them would but you
might have a set of such shapes with
that set of shapes tile the plane well
in this case it will and here I've given
you an example of how it's done now you
might say that it would be a nice
computational issue to decide whether
they could tile the plane or not and in
fact if it were true that they tell to
tile the plane they would have to do it
in a periodic wave that is to say that
you form some arrangement with those
shapes and that arrangement repeats and
repeats and repeats and repeats in all
directions that would be a tiling of the
plane and then that would give you an
announcer that would tell the plane that
if that was the only way you could do it
then you could make a computer decide
yes or no whether a set of shapes will
tell the plane but this is an example
where that's not true if you look at it
you will I hope you can see it it
doesn't look as though it repeats it's
sort of almost repeats but it never does
and in fact you can't tile with these
shapes and make a repeating pattern you
can only do it by a non repeating
pattern and that's a central feature of
the fact that this polyomino problem
tiling problem these things it's called
polyominoes if I didn't say that before
the polyomino tiling problem
is not computable it's just a nice
example of such a thing
so you can have them and you could
imagine laws of physics which were based
on the computer the tiling of a plane or
something like that that's not the laws
of physics we know but that would be the
sort of thing it could be now let me I
think it's at the bottom of this one
here if you can see what's going on what
are the laws of physics as we understand
them today
well there's Newtonian mechanics I
should make a point here that starting
with Newtonian mechanics the laws that
we know depend on continuous parameters
they're not just discrete numbers so
that's a little point one has to worry
about and I worry about it sometimes but
I'm not going to worry about it here I
think it's not the central point it
could have been I don't think it is you
can certainly approximate Newtonian laws
very closely by discrete elements that's
not quite answering the question but at
least it's it's an indication that
continuous numbers are something which
are going to make the story different ok
Newtonian mechanics what about some
maxwellian electromagnetic waves
electromagnetism add that to Newtonian
mechanics
what about relativity theory and general
relativity theory to it quantum
mechanics do they make any difference
are they things you could put on a
computer where people put these things
on a computer all the time so you might
say yes they're computational however
there is a little problem with quantum
mechanics a little problem well I'm
going to say it's a big problem let me
say I'm afraid that I have to describe
what quantum mechanics is and that's not
so easy let me give you a rapid
description of the central points and
here at the top I have an example of two
experiments idealized experiments where
you might have a laser here emitting
individual photons and here we have a
mirror when it's a half-silvered mirror
what's called a beam splitter so that
this photon see a half silver where a
beam splitter half the light gets
through half light is reflected so what
happens then where you might say that
half of the number of photons get
through and half of the moon reflected
and we have detectors here and here this
one or this one will receive the photon
not both not neither and that's that's a
particle nature of the photon being
Illustrated it's behaving just like a
particle but suppose I have ordinary
mirrors here and here and another beam
splitter and I put detectors here and
here remarkably you find that these two
roots that it might take cancel out as
going upwards and they all come this way
and that wouldn't work for individual
particles because if you had a single
particle it might go this way in this
way image this one it might go this way
in this way that means half of them will
come this way half of them would go that
way that's not true they all go this way
and you can only understand that really
if you think of it as a little wave and
these waves cancel each other out when
they come this way and they end up going
this way so that's the way we think
about quantum mechanics but let me see a
little bit more the way we think about
quantum mechanics you see this is an
individual part of course but but here
you see these have these different roots
and what you want to says that the
photon takes this root and it sort of
takes this through it at the same time
so it does two things at once and that's
the way we think about quantum mechanics
particles can be in two places at once
it's a crazy thought but that crazy
thought seems to be true of the way
individual particles behave and the way
we think of that in quantum mechanics is
that you sort of add together the two
possibility could do one thing plus it
could do the other thing so your
combined state is adding the two things
together and we don't just add them
together we add them together with
complex numbers or complex numbers
nothing with square root of minus one
don't worry about the details here I
just want to give you the general
picture so that you have these weighting
factors which are these funny numbers
you need them to do that
make the interference work and
everything but let's not worry about the
details now this I've used the letter U
here what does that mean that's the
Schrodinger equation the evolution
according to quantum mechanics and the
thing I want to say is this what's
called linear that is to say if you have
a superposition of one thing and another
thing and if one of the things would do
such-and-such record of the equations
and if the other would do such-and-such
according to equations then the
superposition of the two together will
be the superposition of the two results
I'll see a little bit more about that in
a minute
that's what unitary evolution of the
Schrodinger equation says that's half of
quantum mechanics the other half is
what's called making the measurement or
the reduction of the quantum state and
there's a little paradox because quantum
mechanics is a paradox with itself
that's sort of self inconsistent people
don't usually illustrate emphasize that
point the thing is that when you make a
measurement you then say oh well this
superposition of two things one of them
happens all the other and the
probabilities are given by these with a
squared modulus of these complex numbers
and that's what's called ah that's the
reduction of the state that's what the
thing does when you make a measurement
now let me go on because I can't
remember what I said in the bottom of
that slide I want to give you an
illustration even though a little
illustration of what quantum mechanics
linearity means now here we have I think
I'll start with this one here here we
have an example here's a laser emitting
can you see that you're those things
which should be off off off screen and
they're not here is a laser which emits
an individual photon and it goes if it
goes this way it hits the brown thing
and it produces a whole lot of junk okay
that's one thing it might do suppose we
put a mirror in the way then it's
reflected off the mirror it's the green
thing and produces a lot of junk now
what quantum mechanics says is suppose
we make this a beam splitter so it's a
half-silvered mirror half the light goes
through and half the light is reflected
then whatever this does produce
that does produce that thing both these
things happen together in superposition
but that's the way it works looks
strange but that's the way it works I'll
make it look even stranger in a minute
because here is an example a sort of
example that Schrodinger himself with
love I like to do here we have a poor
cat which is here's the laser again
which hits this detector and that fires
the gun and kills the cat
no if I have it the right one yes that's
a great one here's the cat suppose there
was the mirror there then it reflects
off the mirror and the cats alive but
suppose it was the beam splitter of
course that's the problem
it's a beam splitter then the cat is
alive and dead at the same time and
Schrodinger was saying that's that's a
load of rubbish
you see people sometimes quote
Schrodinger's cats and say well
Schrodinger said you could have a lot of
cat which alive and dead at the same
time what is more more saying was no
it's just showing a weakness in our
understanding of quantum mechanics
because if you follow his equation
because it has this linear property that
means that you have to if this beam
splitter says this and this happened
together that carries right up to the
level of a cat often people say oh well
that's not enough you should worry about
the environment you should worry about
the observer coming along and all that
kind of stuff
okay well let's worry about them to some
degree and here we have an observer and
we have an atmosphere and here we have a
living thing being reflected and what if
what happens to the beam splitter well
it doesn't help doesn't matter whether
the environments there or not it doesn't
matter whether it's coming somebody
comes and looking at the cat
you might here's the cat of the person
looking at the cat and of course one of
them well I don't know whether you can
see that this difference one has a
smiling expression and the other
frowning expression and the point is
that the observer seems to be in a state
of confusion about seeing a live that
live cat and a dickhead of the same
you might say well how do we know what
the thought processes of The Observer
are do they satisfy quantum mechanics or
something and well you just look at the
expression you see that's a
superposition so there's something funny
something going wrong well many people
take different views on this and one of
the common views is that you have to
take both of them at once and it goes
right the way up and there are two
worlds and the cat's is alive in one
world and dead in the other world and
they could come and look at it then
you're in another world whichever it is
and so on it doesn't quite make sense
because you've got to have a world which
involves or usually have a multiverse or
something where all these different
things are happening and we really want
a theory which describes the world we
perceive we don't want a theory which
describes all sorts of worlds we don't
perceive so it seems to me or a world
which is of some kind of superposition
of all the work these worlds so we
really need something else now my own
view on this is that what we need is
something to do with gravity now people
often say gravity well that's
ridiculously tiny how is the effect of
gravity going to make a slightest
difference to most of these things it's
an incredibly weak force that's correct
statement but it's not a relevant
argument because the way gravity comes
in is just in changing the way we look
at things not so much that its
gravitational forces are irrelevant it's
not the forces at all I want to remind
people of the foundational fact of
Einstein's general relativity which is
goes back to Galileo and you have to
imagine Galileo dropping a big rock and
a little rock from the Leaning Tower of
course he probably maybe he never did
that it may be apocryphal never mind he
certainly thought about such things and
let's imagine the big rock and the
little rock dropping they drop together
as we know we forget that must be air
resistance that's secondary effect not
important here the big rock and the rock
dropped with the same speed and if you
were an insect sitting on one of the
rocks looking at the other one
it would seem to hover as though there
were no gravitational field so you can
get rid of gravity
locally by falling freely and this is
now familiar space travelers can be
floating around in space without feeling
the field of the earth which is sitting
right there and that Earth's
gravitational field is not felt by the
astronauts at all because the astronaut
is falling freely falling can be around
the Earth in an orbit that's fine and
doesn't feel the any gravitational force
okay that's the principle I want to use
now this is a detailed argument which
I'm not going to go through here I just
want to flash it at you if you have a
quantum mechanical experiment which
involves gravitation and let's suppose
this is it's sitting on the table here
so the Earth's gravitational field is
supposed to be taken into consideration
now you could do it the Newtonian way
which you say gravity is just another
force and you do the usual thing that
quantum mechanics people do they do
what's called putting a term in the
Hamiltonian and so on don't worry about
what that means if you don't know
doesn't matter but there's a standard
procedure that people use and then
gravity would be like everything else
and it wouldn't cause any problems with
standard quantum mechanics but if you
take an Stein's view and it's the one I
just showed you with a really falling
gets rid of gravity then you say gravity
is really just the effect of an
acceleration immunity's it's just like
an acceleration so that you you use a
frame of reference which falls freely
under gravity and then the gravitational
field is gone now this gives you two
ways of looking at your experiment and
they almost come out the same if you go
through the details you find they almost
come out the same except there is a
funny thing called a phase factor and
that funny-face factor has a rather
irritating term which involves the time
cubed and that's a technical point the
point is though it tells you the
following that the if you were doing
these these two different ways of doing
gravity they give you what are called
two different quantum field theories
and you cut to stick with one or the
other it's fine here if you only got one
gravitational field you could stick with
one or the other that's fine but suppose
you had a gravitational field of an
object you see this is my Schrodinger's
cat a big object which has been
displaced into two places and its
gravitational field it's thing I'm going
to worry about now this one will have a
different gravitational field from that
one and since the quantum field theory
is different for this one from what it
is for this one this means you're not
allowed to make these super positions
and so the super positions are not
consistent if you take the ant standing
in view for gravity so this tells you
that there's a basic conflict between
einstein's general theory of relativity
beautifully I should say confirmed
quantum mechanics is enormous number of
confirmations but so also on quantum
mechanics usually put on a small scale
in one sense or another in the gravity
it's on a large scale in one sense or
another but you want it you want these
things to come together and make sense
as a as a theory as a whole and what we
see is that they're fighting against
each other they don't live together in
the way that we normally do quantum
mechanics so my viewer on this the way
to get out of this problem is that this
our process which I think I had about
five minutes over this our process which
I travel with this system is probably
sitting there somewhere which is the
measurement part of quantum mechanics
you see they've got Schrodinger equation
chugs along until somebody makes a
measurement and they're making the
measurement you violate the Schrodinger
equation yes it wasn't that one sorry
nevermind let's not worry about it
it's it tells you she following the
Schrodinger equation you have these
superposition so you say this thing and
this thing happened together the
laRocca's in this place units in this
place at the same time but the
measurement part says no it's flopped to
one or it's flopped to the other and
usually people say well somebody comes
and looks at it but that's I'm saying
that's not the point at all because of
what I was just saying it happens
spontaneously it becomes one or the
other no that's not something that most
the physicists will say if you ask them
they'll go on to one of these other
explanations which I don't think work
but what I'm saying is that the correct
answer is that it does spontaneously
become one or the other now I'll say a
little bit more about that in fact what
I was really going to say is probably
not the one I have next yep I'm not even
sure I have it nevermind you see you
could have experiments there is
currently an experiment which has been
going on for about maybe a couple of
decades where you have a little tiny
mirror and this little tiny mirror is
about the tenth a tenth of the thickness
of a human hair it's very very tiny just
a little bit too small to see and the
idea is to put this little mirror into a
superposition of two little different
slightly different places and you can do
this by hitting it with a photon banging
it a million times for the photon and
maybe that will be enough to displace it
so the nuclei in that little mirror are
displaced a little bit away from where
they were before and you then work out a
calculation from the argument that I
just didn't show you but the kind of
caring that argument to its conclusion
you deduce that this slight displacement
between the two instances of that mirror
will make it spontaneously become one or
the other in depending on details
seconds two minutes something like that
this experiment is being done by dirk
Baumeister and he's been working at it
for a long time I don't know when there
will be a conclusion on that I'd be
fascinated to see and we want it to be a
positive conclusion in other words that
quantum mechanics is violated that scale
and the scheme that Stuart Hameroff and
I the orchestrated objective reduction
does involve this idea so I should say
when people say isn't that scheme wild
and crazy because it's involves quantum
mechanics in the warm wet environment of
the brain
I'm saying it's even crazier than that
because it's not that quantum mechanics
has to be sustained in this warm wet
environment and we believe it can be
done in microtubules things like that
was the idea that not only that you
sustain this quantum coherence at that
level but that you can actually get it
up to the level at which we need
something new in quantum mechanics now
why are talking about this reduction of
the state Innova because this is the
only place I can see where there could
be a non computable physics going on and
it's not what sometimes people say well
here's a mystery and here's a mystery
there must be the same and that's my
argument haha it's not what I'm saying
I'm saying that the argument is that we
need something which is different from
conventional physical theory but which
is also a big enough effect that it
could be relevant to what we're seeing
it's not the consciousness of some
mysterious particle running around and
we finally collect them in our heads or
something like that it's not that at all
it's that this process of a reduction of
the state and here is my last
transparency which I hope explains what
I'm saying this is a sort of space-time
picture and here we have a lump being
put into a superposition of two blit
places now time is going this way
upwards here and here we have a picture
you're supposed to think about a
space-time and the gravitational field
of this lump warps the space-time a bit
and you have this little channel which
goes along which follows the history of
that lump now if it's put into this
superposition you pull the two apart and
then you see these two channels
deviating and the space times now don't
fit together properly now the argument
is that in a spacetime volume of order
one in what are called Planck units now
you see people who work in relativity
theory in quantum mechanics know what
Planck units are they're completely
stupid units from the ordinary point of
view but I've got them done in the
picture here I can't read them off but
maybe you could see them the point is
that in Planck units Planck's constant
over 2pi they reduced planks Condon is
put equal to one
gravitational constant is pretty equal
to 1 and the speed of light is pretty
equal to 1 you just get away with doing
that that's perfectly alright if just
with crazy units but nevertheless but if
you use those units it's the measure of
the space-time splitting how much volume
is there in that is of order one before
one of them persists and the other one
dies so this is the idea you have a
universe with a lump in one place then
it's in two places superpose and then
one of these dies and the other ones
survives now the point I'm making is
that in current quantum mechanics well
they don't even think about it this way
but in current quantum mechanics this is
a purely random process what I'm saying
is it's something much more subtle than
that it's something which is a non
computable process but not necessarily
it looks random but it's not necessarily
random and there's something which I'm
referring to
we Stewart and I refer to as a moment of
protech consciousness so if you like
this is the building block in this
scheme of what consciousness is made so
I'm not saying this is conscious because
it's not got any meaning to it it's not
related to other things it's just an
element of what you need to build
consciousness so the argument is that
whatever consciousness is it's a
physical thing but it's not part of the
way physicists normally think about
physics it's part of the extension to
current quantum mechanics that I believe
is necessary and which I hope will be
revealed in experiments and that that is
the building block out of which
consciousness is constructed of course
it's a real challenge to see how this
idea can actually be playing a role in
well we presume microtubules maybe other
structures in the brain as well in an
organized way in an orchestrated way
such as this objective reduction that's
the O R of the
the orchestrated objective reduction can
actually be playing a role the role that
consciousness does in fact play in the
way we behave thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
