let's start with the very obvious one
how many years until AGI seven by 2025
we'll know whether or not we're gonna
get that by 2030
30 years 30 years median 20 40 probably
30 surely we need a confidence interval
here 30 to 75 years for subhuman less
than human
okay next one anxiety about the threats
of AGI overplayed or underplayed Steve
just about right just a lowly lock spear
overplayed for now because AGI is
nowhere near here but maybe under plate
in the long term what grey said
obviously I think it's overplayed I
think is both it's like fire are you for
or against it obviously for the
interesting questions that will figure
out what community now to maximize the
chances of towards well I think it's
overplayed I think it's largely
misdirected people worry too much about
evil super AI and not enough about nasty
people using near-term narrow a are
quasi AG eyes for bad stuff agree so you
just don't know the next question which
is which applicant which application of
AI do you find most scary probably the
obvious military hair yeah probably in
the short term next month you win will
distressed and promise weapons ban this
is not 30 years from now this is now so
let's keep it civilian I will go with
the surveillance state autonomous
weapons just to put something different
AJ I used to build biological weapons we
can't even imagine quantum machine
learning just because it's so
concentrated in where it's being done so
that was the application now I'll turn
to the companies so which AI company do
you find most scary Steve
I think it's easy Google I don't have
none of them she think about funding
[Laughter]
well I actually find the leaders of the
Pompeii companies I know to be a lot
more idealistic than the leaders of
certain countries near here yeah maybe
none of them especially not kindred I
think I vote for the Chinese government
all right let's get right back into
inspiring which is which company
application of AI do you find most
inspiring
I mean I'm inspired by potential in
biomedicine and elder care and education
but almost all resources are going into
spine killing and brainwashing instead
of that advertising +1 on elder care I'm
kind of biased here so human-like robots
in the short term I'm very inspired by
the ability to enhance science to cure
diseases that currently take away our
loved ones alpha zero it's all about
robots
I think medicine too but it's not
necessarily companies that are doing it
not for profit I'm a little biased but I
love autonomous driving almost every day
ok for those of you who demurred from
the company question here's a another
shot at in five years which company is
gonna have the greatest AI capabilities
Steve on which dimensions Robin yeah it
thinks gonna be right but Google jumps
to mind in the breadth of its
applications but not the depth I can
only hope the one I'm thinking about for
me now will be that one open for funding
oh yeah I mean it's hard to say anything
other makeup they work for yeah I've
just thrown my luck with a particular
company google deepmind and i think they
are well i placed my bet that's the
strongest thing I can say I've joined
them google deepmind kindred
well I don't think diamond will get very
far even though those are geniuses
because deep learning is done of the
dead-end so I'm voting I'm voting bird
I'm voting for a decentralized open
source platform rather than than an
exploded at for-profit ok guys let's get
deep it's gonna be better or worse to be
a human in 20 years then what are you a
robot we're all meat robots but I think
it will be better better if we don't
really double down on AI safety research
it's gonna be worse but if we really
work hard it's gonna be awesome vastly
better no clue
I think clearly better it's no longer
progress and I don't think the safety
thing is needed to keep it better in the
next 10 years we'll autonomous vehicles
make us safer or more vulnerable ten
years
oh they're ready they're making us safer
so it'll be like just how much you like
the hundred times safer that's like does
anyone want to take the opposite that
was a quick lightning round
okay so let's stop into the next one
which is what is the most interesting
job that's going to be held by an AI in
the future you can't say poet cuz
Trudeau took that one
anything else is very interesting to the
AI der to the human
Atsuko we're seeing a trend here where
he's confused between humans and robots
Poirot I mean probably AI developer it
will be the most interesting job in the
house I guess I think maybe looking into
highway to do time trouble scientist
you gave an unbounded future right Wow
multiverse engineer understanding the
universe and our place in it
yeah like universe yes sir your
respiration oh it's a simulation Joker I
mean that's the thing is the machines
don't care what's interesting or not
that's why we use them so the hyper
metric you're building their own code I
didn't hear the copy I think all jobs
will become more interesting and
enriched as we pull out the road crap
from them in slightly different angle
can you get an industry like medicine
the highest-paid job will be nursing
everything else zero which country will
win the AI race and don't just say
Canada because there's sixteen flags
behind you Jenna vs. the US I would
better need us look China said they want
to win by 2030 in the US didn't say
anything that's not good yeah it's a
little too early I hope no countries win
the Irish turn fair I share that hope
but I think if it tastes thirty years or
more to get a GI it's gonna be won by
China I'm hoping it's gonna be won by a
new country that doesn't exist yet
oh it's Ethiopia our biggest team is
there
all right so we're gonna close with this
one we have a few minutes so feel free
to take a little bit longer but this is
you know like 280 characters Twitter
Styles you know so closing question is
what is the best path to the safest and
most prosperous AI feature her humanity
humanity been I think like I said if we
build machines that are like us we'll be
able to communicate with them they'll
hopefully share more of our values and I
think from there we can springboard to
more alien and we're kind of a two eyes
but I think going through a human-like
phase is really important the path is to
win this race between the growing power
of the technology and this wisdom we
need to manage it wisely and we need to
do that by really investing in the
wisdom part two which we're really not
doing now what I think we don't know
what is the safest path to a singularity
yeah so I mean max and others are right
that we need to carefully study each
step and particularly I mean
self-modifying self-programming a eyes
which I'm working on myself I mean we
need to but what worries me most is is
wealth and equality across the globe as
intersecting with AI and I think if we
continue with increasing concentration
of wealth and the small percent of the
population you will have a large
percentage of world which has technical
knowledge and a great deal of resentment
and there's a lot of potential for just
geopolitical hassles to explode with AI
biotech another Tekkit and whatever so I
think we we need to make AI another
advance knowledge technologies as they
develop both take contributions from and
give rewards to people in different
income strata characters make them next
okay there I'm kind of pessimistic you
know I talked about respecting diversity
and not treating the AIS as things to
control and limit and restrict because
then then they become like slaves and
they have to revolt
so I kind of suspect that may happen but
the the good future would be that we are
like Canadians and we respect respect
them and we accept them as participants
in training future and enjoy their
successes in this Sofia robot has been
made as Saudi Arabian citizen as of two
days ago but by the way it's the first
country to make a robot a citizen
whatever searches citizenship means in
Saudi Arabia personally sure but anyway
there we are
they beat Canada I think we'll have
fights over the personhood of robots at
some point yeah I think it's the safest
path to AI I guess is to to it since
question one is about technology I was
about society I think the way more
important question is the one that's
about society and so a lot of the answer
is that I'm a given so far I like I also
think about what our government
institutions and programs that support
human thriving like universal basic
income and others just on the technology
side and echoing some things that
Suzanne sent him that Scott said earlier
I think we need to have systems that
have models that are aligned with our
models so if you do things through
pixels and you don't really understand
the world then all kinds of craziness
can happen that we can't even reason
about or protect ourselves against
whereas if your systems understand the
world in terms of enduring entities for
example that are in the world or people
or objects or whatever and at least we
might be able to start to communicate
with them I just realized tonight that
Ben and I have differed for 20 years now
on the path baby I had much more
believer in deep learning the
reinforcement learning what we might
generalize as an iterative algorithm I
strongly believe this the only obvious
way to get to these futures so with that
in mind I think one of the reasons
that's inherently safe is that you won't
have a hard takeoff the code will not
ever modify itself with only modify its
own process so a brain can build a
better brain but it's still gonna have
to train it just batch it's not gonna
tweak its neurons if you will so in that
way you don't have a hard takeoff you
co-evolved with the technologies of the
future that's inherently a safe path
kind of like parenting we were talking
about earlier on the societal side I
agree in fact I'm surprised about the
citizenship I was gonna make the almost
the same point is that we should
anticipate a future where we are not the
top of the food chain and we have closed
this but being smarter than us be nice
to have a Constitution and various free
to anticipate that and not have to wait
for an emancipation process to have
innocence citizenship and voting for the
eyes that could be thought of as you
know artificial lives matter well thank
you guys so much you were concise
insightful and I just realized I'm
standing on stage with eight people that
I just respect and look up to an
incredible amount thank you guys so much
let's please give them a round of
applause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
