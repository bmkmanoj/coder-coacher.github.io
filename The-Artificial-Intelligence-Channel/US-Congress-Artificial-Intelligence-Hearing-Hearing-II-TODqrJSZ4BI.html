technology will come to order
and without objection the chair is
authorized to declare a recess at any
time good afternoon welcome to the
Oversight and Government Reform hearing
on artificial intelligence this is the
second in a series of hearings on
artificial intelligence and this series
is an opportunity for the subcommittee
to take a deep dive into this issue I
have three main objectives when it comes
to AI in government first it should make
every interaction an individual has with
the federal government take less time
cost less money and be more secure I
have wonderful caseworkers on staff who
spend their time working to help
constituents receive their veterans
benefits - or to help with Social
Security they're speaking every day with
people who are frustrated with how long
it takes to resolve problems in the
federal government I believe with the
adoption of AI we can improve the
response time and in some cases prevent
these problems in the first place second
AI should produce efficiencies and cost
savings that will help us do more for
less money and help to provide better
more transparent citizen facing services
this should help to restore the bonds of
trust between citizens and their
governments
we have innovative companies brilliant
minds hard-working people and the rule
of law so we in the United States should
lead on AI and the federal government
needs to be an active participant
whether it is through basic and applied
research and development that DARPA NSF
and DHS are doing or GSA's work on
procurement the AI within the government
needs to benefit those whom the
government serves I think the witnesses
for being here today and I look forward
to hearing and learning more from all of
you and I'll be honest at the beginning
of this endeavor I was prepared to not
see much use of AI throughout the
federal government and I think our
panelists here today are going to show
how
doing some very interesting things in
the government and as always it's an
honor to explore these very important
issues in bipartisan fashion with my
friend and ranking member the one and
only Robin Kelly from Illinois Thank You
mr. chairman mr. chairman thank you for
calling today's important hearing on
federal agencies adoption of artificial
intelligence or AI this is the second
hearing in a three-part series of
hearings on AI today's hearing focuses
on the federal government's adoption of
this technology AI has the potential to
make government more efficient and
decrease costs across agencies to fully
realize the benefits of AI the u.s. must
maintain its leadership role and promote
in technological innovation yet
preserving the United States leadership
role in technologies like AI will
require robust federal funding for
research and development but at our
first hearing on AI intel's chief
technology officer for AI warned us that
quote current federal funding levels are
not keeping pace with the rest of the
industrialized world in fact president
Trump's proposed budget for FY 2019 cuts
or flattens non-military agency budgets
for R&amp;amp;D as you can see on the screens
the trend is so clear that the National
Science Board and the National Science
Foundation believe that China will
surpass the United States and R&amp;amp;D
investments by the end of this year the
chart displayed demonstrates China's
rapidly growing investment and the u.s.
seating its position as a leader in AI
the future of US innovation is at stake
this should be a cause of concern for
everyone outside of the Department of
Defense the President's budget proposes
an overall cut to research and
development of 21.2% consider for
example the National Science Foundation
whose investments in R&amp;amp;D have led to
innovations that improve our everyday
life from Google to LASIK eye surgery to
cloud computing all can be traced to NSF
investments and technology this chart
shows president Trump's precipitous drop
in non-defense R&amp;amp;D spending in an agency
like the National Science Foundation
which supports basic research in college
and universe
and in the private sector this budget
represented almost a twenty nine percent
decrease from the agency's actual
spending levels in 2017 these budget
cuts take the United States in the wrong
direction another troubling trend for
the u.s. is that we are not making the
critical investments today to educate
the workforce we need to sustain these
industries of the future the display
chart shows a number of science and
engineering undergraduates in China
compared to the United States as you can
see we are not keeping pace with China
which is displayed in red yet another
troubling factor is this
administration's hostility to immigrants
until recently the US was able to
attract PhD students from other
countries to help supplement the
domestic workforce the New York Times
reported last year that not only is
Google opening AI innovation hubs in
Canada because of concerns with American
immigration policies but that the US has
already turned away promising people in
the AI field unfortunately this
administration science immigration and
education policies are all working
together to reduce the u.s. lead and AR
technologies I hope today we can discuss
the policies and funding necessary to
ensure we remain competitive in this
area again I thank you mr. chair for
having this hearing
thank you I'm pleased now to introduce
our witnesses our first is dr. John
Everett he's the deputy director of the
information innovation office for DARPA
mr. Keith now Cassone he is the deputy
assistant commissioner for the Office of
Information Technology category for the
Federal Acquisition service at GSA say
that three times fast dr. dr. James
Krause is the assistant director for
computer and information science and
engineering at National Science
Foundation's always a pleasure to have
you here sir and last but not least dr.
Douglas Mong is the division director of
the cybersecurity division in the
Homeland Security Advanced Research
Projects Agency at DHS welcome to you
all and pursuant to committee rules all
witnesses will be sworn in before you
testify so please rise and raise your
right hand
do you solemnly swear or affirm that
you're about to tell the truth the whole
truth and nothing but the truth so help
you God thank you please let the record
reflect that all witnesses answered in
the affirmative in order to allow time
for discussion please limit your
testimony to five minutes your entire
written statement will be made part of
the record and as a reminder the clock
in front of you shows when your
remaining time the remaining time you
have let's go turn yellow when you have
30 seconds left and when it flashes red
that means your time is up and also
remember to press the button to turn on
your microphone before speaking now I'd
like to recognize dr. Everett for your
five minutes of opening remarks good
afternoon chairman herd ranking member
kelly and distinguished members of the
committee I appreciate the invitation to
give testimony on the state of AI
research today my name is John Everett
and I'm the deputy director of the
information innovation office of the
Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency DARPA DARPA mission is to create
and prevent technological surprise we do
so by funding research programs each
with a specific goal to advance the
state-of-the-art in a particular area
the strategy has served the country well
by leveraging academia and industry R&amp;amp;D
labs to develop the enabling
technologies for new defense
capabilities and to plant the seeds for
new industries such as the internet and
self-driving cars since the 1960s we
have funded more than 50 programs in ai
ai technologies had developed in two
waves the first wave focused on abstract
logic and reasoning tools that require
explicit representations of knowledge in
the form of handcrafted rules the second
wave machine learning uses algorithms to
extract implicit representations of
knowledge from large amounts of data the
first wave started in the 1950s and
explored many hard problems in reasoning
understanding natural language and
robotics it produced many algorithms
that are in common use today such as
planning and scheduling systems
researchers quickly discovered the
importance of world knowledge in solving
problems and created experts
items that use rules to represent
knowledge about a particular subject
area such as diagnosing infectious
diseases an early DARPA funded expert
system rivaled human performance in this
area however as we all know for every
rule there is an exception and the work
necessary to capture sufficient
knowledge proved impractical in many
cases the second wave started in the
1990s and reacted to the difficulty of
capturing world knowledge by writing it
down the most successful form of machine
learning today is called a neural
network because it is inspired by the
structure of the human brain machine
learning uses large amounts of data to
train an algorithm to do a specific task
such as recognize speech drive a car or
search for pictures of say people
playing frisbee on a beach however these
algorithms cannot explain their
conclusions which makes them hard to
trust also researchers have shown that
sometimes imperceptible changes to an
input image say of a panda can cause the
algorithm to confidently miss classify
it as a monkey nonetheless the second
wave of AI has yet to crest and
researchers will continue to improve the
technology and develop interesting in
innovative applications we believe that
the next wave of AI will combine
insights from the first and second waves
to produce systems that are aware of
context so they can interact more
effectively with people this will
require major advances in common sense
reasoning and natural language
processing context is the shared
understanding that people have with each
other in any of those highly concise
communication through speech intonation
facial expressions and gestures such
communication is extremely difficult for
current algorithms to understand making
this an ideal area for DARPA research
thank you thank you sir mr. naka Soni
you're now recognized for five minutes
good afternoon chairman herd ranking
member Kelly and members of the
subcommittee thank you for the
opportunity to appear before you today
my name is Keith naka Sonia and I am the
Deputy Assistant Commissioner for
acquisition operations in the office of
information technology category
at GSA I've been a participant in the
growth of emerging technologies in
government over the past 20 years
including during my years at the Defense
Department mr. chairman at the first
hearing in this series you stated that
it was your hope agencies would use
today's discussion to inform Congress
how we plan to use artificial
intelligence to spend taxpayer dollars
wisely and make into each individual's
interactions with government more
efficient effective and secure I would
like to discuss four ways in which our
agency is supporting government AI
evaluation and adoption to accomplish
that first our Federal Acquisition
service provides contracting vehicles
and mechanisms including schedule 70 as
well as several other government-wide
acquisition contracts which encourage
competition and help connect agencies
and businesses to allow government to
efficiently procure the most effective
new AI services and capabilities GSA's
IT schedule 70 contracts provides
federal state local and tribal
government agencies with access to over
7.5 million best value IT and
telecommunications products services and
solutions for more than 4,600 pre-vetted
vendors including firms whose offerings
use AI as similar technologies since
emerging technology businesses
frequently tend to be startups schedule
70 offers to shortcuts startup
springboard and fast lane as part of the
making it easier initiative which aims
to streamline the process for younger
innovative companies and suppliers to do
business with government second GSA is
piloting robotic process automation and
related technologies designed to augment
our workforce and achieve more with less
while establishing a foundation for
greater data-driven decision-making
through AI GSA has developed a new pilot
using AI for prediction of regulatory
compliance the solicitation review tool
uses natural language processing text
mining and machine learning algorithms
to substantially of the alleviate the
human resources needed to identify audit
and enforce compliance of solicitations
posted
FPL gov further GSA recently launched
two pilots exploring the use of robotic
process automation and distributed
ledger technology foundational
technologies that can open our programs
to better decision making through AI
these pilots aim to increase GSA's
operational efficiency reduce costs
improved processes increase accuracy and
redeploy staff to higher value functions
third our interagency emerging citizens
Technology office unites more than 2,000
government managers from over 300
federal state and local agencies and
representatives from businesses startups
and research and civic organizations to
support and coordinate government-wide
development of citizen facing AI and
other emerging technology programs
including through resources at emerging
digital gov recent initiatives include
the launch of an interagency venture
capital advisory group in a new
education and training pilot fourth
along with our private sector and
federal agency partners we are pursuing
a greater understanding alignment of IT
modernization through cloud adoption
data services and emerging technologies
including AI that deliver the greatest
benefit to the American people for
instance through data gov and a CTO we
are learning how to improve the
standardization and accessibility of
government open data to help fuel
innovation we have solicited input from
industry partners on how to improve data
hosting so data sets are more easily
digestible for AI and machine learning
GSA is essentially a shared service and
we are constantly seeking ways to
develop government faster better and
smarter AI is a tool that can expand the
value proposition for federal agencies
vendors and the American people alike
thank you again for the opportunity to
testify I look forward to your questions
dr. Krause you have now have five
minutes thank you very much good
afternoon chairman herd ranking member
Kelly and members of the subcommittee my
name is Jim Carosa I'm the assistant
director at the National Science
Foundation for the Directorate of
computer and information science and
engineering as you know NS
contributes to national security and
economic competitiveness by supporting
fundamental research in all areas of
science and engineering as well as
education for the next generation of
discoverers I welcome this opportunity
to highlight NSF's AI investments
federal investments in foundational AI
research are critical to achieving and
sustaining us Science and Technology
leadership fundamental fundamental Aird
challenges can be broadly classified
into two categories
first there's narrow AI that is focused
on solving specific tasks in
well-defined domains such as speech
recognition or image classification here
nsf-funded researchers have pioneered
new machine learning techniques and
applied these techniques for example to
analyze breast cancer and predict sepsis
to your opening remarks chairman Hurd
NSF is piloting the use of AI clustering
techniques and its own business
processes to help program managers
select proposal reviewers the second
broad category general AI is about
transferring what is learned in one
setting to another and ultimately
appreciating intent meaning and
understanding several witnesses in your
earlier panel have noted that these
goals remain an AI grand challenge in
which we're also investing in fiscal 17
the National Science Foundation invested
more than 120 million dollars in core AI
research AI will continue to be an
important part of our research portfolio
including NSF's big ideas
indeed NSF director dr. France cÃ³rdova
my boss recently described AI as quote
the universal connector that interweaves
all of our big ideas data science is
changing in the very nature of
scientific inquiry and AI use of data
has the potential to revolutionize
everything we do in science the AI
innovations that we are seeing today are
built on earlier fundamental research
for example NSF's investments in
reinforcement learning decades ago are
enabling today's deep learning systems
in autonomous vehicles as Eric Schmidt
former Google alphabet CEO has said NSF
is quote we're all interesting research
gets started well you know yes we're a
starter but we're also more than that
part of a larger very uniquely American
research and innovation ecosystem among
academia industry and government with
the flow of ideas artifacts and people
across these sectors this ecosystem has
given rise to multi-billion dollar
industries including AI but truly it all
begins with investment in fundamental
long-term research often made with
federal research dollars at NSF we're
constantly exploring new partnership
models to grow this ecosystem we've
partnered with industry on joint
research solicitations recently we
combined 50 million dollars from the
National Science Foundation with an
equivalent amount from an industry
consortium to advanced wireless
technologies these public and private
partnerships serve as models for
potential future Aird collaborations
federal agencies like my colleagues here
are other partners NSF co-chairs the
networking and information technology
research and development subcommittee of
the National Science and Technology
Council and we co-chaired an NSTC
committee that developed the 2016
national AI R&amp;amp;D strategic plan you've
heard that much of the AI revolution has
been enabled by the availability of
large data sets and computing NSF has
invested in open training datasets and
is committed to public access to data
resulting from federally funded research
NSF has also long invested in high
performance computing to complement
these investments we recently announced
a partnership with three commercial
cloud providers Amazon Google and
Microsoft to make 12 million dollars in
cloud resources available to academic
researchers through our Big Data program
beyond data and computation there
remains the most valuable resource of
all people
NSF investments here include research
that builds the foundations for rigorous
engaging computer science education at
all levels K through 12 University and
lifelong learning for example working
with the teaching community and many
partners NSF support led to a new
Advanced Placement computer science
principles course whose launch last year
was the largest ever in the College
Board's history more than 50,000
students took the exam we saw
markable strides and participation of
groups long underrepresented in
computing as well more than double the
number of african-americans hispanics
and women took this new AP exam in 2017
as compared to the existing CS AP exam
the year before NSF's investments and
partnerships have helped sustain the
nation's leadership in AI and enhanced
our nation's economic competitiveness
and security we at the NSF are committed
to continuing this investment in
fundamental AI research infrastructure
and workforce to maintain u.s. global
leadership this concludes my remarks and
thank you again for the opportunity to
address this subcommittee thank you sir
dr. mom you now recognized for five
minutes
chairman herd ranking member Kelly and
members of the subcommittee good
afternoon and thank you for this
opportunity today I will be sharing
important aspects of how the Department
of Homeland Security Science and
Technology Directorate or S&amp;amp;T as it is
known is using artificial intelligence
based technologies in research and
development and working across all DHS
mission areas to integrate innovative
technologies into everyday use as the
R&amp;amp;D arm of DHS S&amp;amp;T develops the tools
technologies and knowledge products for
DHS operators and state and local first
responders ensuring the R&amp;amp;D coordination
across the department to develop
solutions for the needs of today and
tomorrow
Smt partners with federal agencies as
Jim said industry academia and
international government to create and
test solutions that help the nation's
homeland security officials prevent
respond to and recover from all hazards
and threats SN T's goal is to provide
real-world solutions in a realistic
timeframe AI offers much promise from a
government perspective it holds the
potential for enhanced insight into
public service operations and improve
delivery of citizen services examples
span the range from helping people
navigate immigration systems to
predicting and pre-empting threats and
enabling resilient critical
infrastructure that today are under
attack
AI technology is improving our knowledge
and actions fuelled by sensors data
digitization and ever-increasing
connectedness
Ã¡i filters prioritizes classifies
measures and predicts outcomes which can
have significant impact on people
private industry is leading the way in
AI development because many see its
implementation as a key competitive
advantage government must be informed
and ensure AI technology is being used
to create efficiencies and enhance the
public good at DHS S&amp;amp;T AI is a part of
several ongoing cyber security division
research initiatives which are using AI
and machine learning techniques for
predictive analysis of malware evolution
against future malware variants
detecting anomalous network traffic and
behaviors to inform decision-making and
helping identify categorize and score
adversarial telephony denial of service
techniques for example S&amp;amp;T developed a
machine learning based policy engine
capable of blocking more than a hundred
and twenty thousand calls per month
including robo calls this same
technology can be used to defend 911
centers against life-threatening
distributed denial-of-service attacks
DHS S&amp;amp;T also is working closely with the
nation's startups on AI through our
Silicon Valley Innovation Program or SV
IP launched in 2015 the department is
connecting with innovation communities
across the nation to harness the
commercial Rd ecosystem for technologies
with government applications and help
accelerate transition to market with the
goal of reshaping how government
entrepreneurs and industry work together
to find cutting-edge solutions for the
department operators SV IP and Customs
and Border Protection are partnering on
AI and machine learning topics including
visualization predictive models and
entity resolution and currently our
funding startups to exchange information
and intelligence build capacity and
increase worldwide security and
compliance standards looking forward in
AI DHS continues to support the design
of AI systems in a manner that makes the
actions and decision-making of
technologists government officials and
other users both transparent and
understandable the design development
implementation and
evaluation of AI solutions should
generate trust that the government and
industry are innovating responsibly by
demonstrating that the government is
balancing risks in delivering on its
mission to serve the public fairly and
justly and influence responsible
evolution and the role for AI in the
private sector in order for the
government to be relevant in this
fast-moving and competitive future that
is being defined by AI innovation should
be advanced through an emphasis on
responsible R&amp;amp;D in addition Aird should
involve multiple multiple multiple
disciplines and those those perspectives
that involve experts not only from
computer science but also the other
physical and social sciences mr.
chairman and members of the subcommittee
AI is here to stay this reality means
that S&amp;amp;T must aggressively work with its
research development test and evaluation
partners throughout government and
industry so Homeland Security
applications of AI and machine learning
are both effective and trusted thank you
for your thoughtful leadership on these
issues I look forward to your questions
thank you dr. Monde my first question to
the panel it's for all y'all and and
y'all here as the representation of some
of the best things that are happening
when it comes to AI across the federal
government and one of the things that we
heard in the last panel and we've heard
in conversation on this topic two things
that the federal government can be doing
research obviously all right continued
basic research applied research like
some of the things that dr. bond is
doing at DHS I mean we get it we're
gonna try to figure out how to do that
all right this is this is a bipartisan
issue the second thing we've heard is
also data you know how do we unlock data
with that the federal government has
that can be used to train and teach
these these various algorithms I get
those two things but I'm asking each one
of y'all and this is not to apply to
just your agency but across the federal
government what is one thing that the
federal government should be doing now
in implementing artificial intelligence
something that's available something
that can be used that we we should be
doing
it's not a fair question dr. Mon you
what you shaking your hair yeah dr. mom
sure so I mean we things we are doing
already include as I mentioned with our
Customs and Border Protection folks they
have something called the Global Travel
assessment system cheetahs which they
make available to all of our
international partners as well and we
have been working with them to add in
capability into that open source system
that rai based and so we're starting to
see that rollout as new capability for
not only CBP but all of our
international partners dr Carosa well
thank you and thank you for mentioning
the importance of funding basic research
and open data as well you know I had
mentioned in my own testimony about what
the National Science Foundation is doing
testing the use of some AI techniques
actually built with open software on
making recommendations for panelists for
program managers and it's an example of
the broader challenge I think an
opportunity of adopting AI tools and
having folks in government use AI tools
to help inform decision making that they
are it's not going to be a magic press
the button and get the answer out but
using that to help complement already
existing activities dr. Nagatani maybe a
more specific question for you
you mentioned 7.5 million different
kinds of applications and tools that GSA
makes available are there tools that
other agencies are not taking advantage
of and they should when it comes to this
topic so when we speak about the 7.5
solution sets that we're talking about
you know crosses the the scope of
telecommunications IT services supplies
commodities right so we have access and
we are learning every day on how to
build these solution sets by by looking
at use cases best practices and things
alike with of course the working groups
that we have to understand how we can
deliver these broader acquisition
solutions to cover
you know things like distributed ledger
technology with the robotic process
automation and and so let me ask them
ask it this way we bring in a lot of
federal CIOs when we go through the
futurus scorecard talking about how are
they modernizing their digital
infrastructure what give me a question I
should be asking them you know are you
using fill-in-the-blank right so what
you know something that we could be
asking is what emerging technologies are
you using to do your IT modernization
uplift you know we we recently have GSA
has a big part in the IT modernization
plan and I think one of the things that
we need to look at is how are we
leveraging emerging technologies and
injecting it into our infrastructure dr.
Everett wrap it up for us I think
there's a temptation to think of AI is
magic and is being able to solve all our
problems when you talk about
implementing something that will be
effective for the federal government I
think we should take the perspective of
first understanding what the actual
problems are and then working our way
back towards how AI could actually
address those problems and not just up
front but looking at what is the
lifecycle cost of implementing those
technologies thank you dr. Everett a
gentlewoman from Illinois is now
recognized thank you mr. chair I think
we all agree that research and
development is essential to continuing
to improve the government's use of
artificial intelligence and in my
opening statement I talked about the
concern about China passing us by are
there any other countries that you think
are putting a lot of money into research
and development and our passing aspire
could pass us by when it comes to AI
loved ones answer the one that I hear
about all the time is China certainly
the international community however is
very broad and in the AI community
started out internationally in 1970 so
the the basis for
the technology is international whether
or not that is an issue at the
individual country level I don't know
let's live from China I already again
just add I think it is international so
absolutely the comments that you had
made in your opening statements about
China I'd note that deep mind if was
that Google has acquired is from from
the UK that Microsoft acquired a really
tough flight AI research company from
Canada and so really it's it's a global
phenomenon and I think we all would
agree that funding is extremely
important so that you can continue the
good work that you're already doing and
we can progress further the other
question is beside funding finding
people that are educated and trained to
help us progress in this area and what
are suggestions that you have of what we
can do to find people interested in the
field that want to get involved in the
field
so my encouraged s tchen is we need to
make so at the core of AI is computer
science and so it's making computer
science attractive and so again
depending upon the application area
cyber security which is what some of us
work on is one of the most attractive
but we're still not attracting as many
as as we need so we have to find those
things that make it exciting we've been
for example funding competitions high
school and collegiate competitions as a
way to try to get students interested in
cyber security and computer science as
early as possible and I think we just
need to continue to push that agenda
earlier in the school system the sooner
we can get youth interested in computer
science as a career they use the tools
all day anyway so let's teach them that
there's a career in that direction I
know we knew the statistic I showed it's
amazing the difference between US and
China
people in the field and the phd's
graduating so I'd like to second Doug's
recommendation about the focus on
pipeline and also the importance of a
broad computer science education in my
testimony I had mentioned the computer
science principles AP exam and how
popular that has been there are other
investments that the National Science
Foundation is making an exploring
computer science in the middle schools I
think at the undergraduate level also
computer science now is becoming a much
more popular major and also programs
such as what's called computer science +
X so it's the application of computing
in other disciplines and to Grand
Challenges and two challenges that look
that the country faces and there's also
a movement afoot of AI + x so applying
AI and data science for good so I think
at both the high school and the
undergraduate level that there are
programs afoot and universities
innovating in that space at the PhD
level we always face a challenge in that
keeping PhD students in academia there
are lots of interesting challenges to be
addressed in industry and it's important
to keep our ph.d pipeline cranking a
full speed as well so I guess one thing
that GSA focuses on you talked about
recruiting and we actively search out go
to universities and and also when we
look at the diversity aspects we are we
you know recruiting from a minority
perspective as well just want to save
for GSA's overall workforce you know 40
percent are minorities and 46 percent
are female and within the IT field we
have 39 percent that are minorities and
33 percent that are females so you know
we work hard to try to recruit talented
and and the the best of the ability to
to try to get highly educated people
into the workforce and we have to as we
build out these emerging technology
solution sets I think by showing us or
we federal government agencies need to
figure out how to get that message out
there that no kidding we are leaning
forward in building out and using
emerging technology solutions how much
do you rely on do you think AI relies on
students educated outside of the United
States to supplement the work force
whoever wants to answer you can answer
don't be as far as that that I don't
have that data in front of me but
however we can take that back as a
question okay the distinguished
gentleman from the great state of
Michigan is now recognized for his first
round of questions I thank you sir
chairman I think one of the questions
that one of the issues that's arisen is
we look at adoption of AI an expansion
of it is is really getting a broader
understanding of what it is now it
impacts our lives currently write a
couple of articles recently whether
Sisson seems to me be an eighth fear
that of what AI is how do we at the
federal level overcome or get the level
of understanding among the population as
a whole not the tech weeny population
they also think it's cool it's the other
folks about what AI is how it makes
decisions and why it's of value to them
if we're going to continue to expand
investment and get more people into
training anybody wants to tackle that
please go ahead mr. Mun you're smiling
chuckle I got you to go pass those bad
to cross wait wait waiting to see if dr.
Cruz he wants to go first actually I'm
very happy to go first
it's it's it's a really great question
and it really comes to the question of
decision making and you know there's
there have been computer and software
assisted decision-making for a long
period of time and when we do
predictions we do regression analysis so
I mean these are there's there's a long
history of relying on computation to
help in making decisions and I think the
key phrase that you you mentioned was AI
making too
and in the end it needs to be people
making decisions and needs to be people
making decisions with AI software how do
we get enough transparency of how that
happens so that people understand that
in the real world outside of here and a
handful of other places how do we
achieve that because we need to do that
if we're going to get the level of
acceptance engaged with education that
we want how do we achieve there folks
right well so I agree a hundred percent
it's absolutely a question of outreach I
think was some AI techniques that are
that are in use today there's an issue
of explain ability which I think dr.
Everett and ARPA's had a program on
explain ability of AI so maybe I could
pass it down to my right ping pong go
ahead dr. Everett we are just starting a
new program called explainable AI and it
directly addresses the issue that a lot
of the machine learning software that we
have today cannot explain why it has
come up with a particular answer and so
the objective of the research is to say
tell me why you think this is a certain
kind of bird and it will tell you well I
think it's it's got a red crest and a
black stripe on the wing and then it
will show you that it is actually
looking at the right part of the image
to start to build trust another aspect
of this is assuring autonomous systems
so we have a autonomous ship called sea
hunter and to make it and to ensure that
it would operate safely within shipping
lanes for example it has to pass the
commercial collision regulations so
we're looking at ways in which to do to
use mathematical techniques to verify
that the software will behave as
expected in a wide range of
circumstances that it might encounter in
the real world you're not likely to get
beyond a ton of a ship in your backyard
I have to have to be honest how soon
would that research know that
information become available to the
population at a broader level do you
think I think it will diffuse rather
slowly particularly as the popular
culture tends to portray AI with a mix
of science and science fiction yes
and evil is some level or fear of evil
let's put it that way but then begins my
second question is time is running a
little short is uh what's your agency's
approach and in dealing the difficult
question of ethics in the use of AI
which kind of goes what you're
suggesting how are you approaching that
with you with the general population or
even within your agency certainly I
think that in the case of the research
piece we need to look at that as I
mentioned in my testimony you need to
make sure that the AI itself is
transparent and understandable and and
you can actually see the decisions being
made are balancing risks and are fair
and just to the recipient of those and
and that requires us to have not only
the AI piece of it but a kind of
watching the AI how do I ensure that the
AI is working and doing what it wants I
think we're still early in the day but
certainly agree that the ethics
questions was raised in your in industry
panel as well anybody else do you sir
yes I I'd like to say that I think the
ethics question is also often very tied
up with data and how data is used in
inferences from data it's an active
research area and it's Efes funding a
number of activities there I think it
also calls calls to the front the
importance of interdisciplinary
collaboration here because it's not just
computer scientists and engineers it's
also social behavioral and economic
scientists who have to be involved in
this as well I appreciate my time is
expired thank you sir chair the
distinguished gentleman from the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and now
recognized for his five minutes thank
you very much mr. chairman and and two
ranking member
Kelly for your persistent attention on
on something I think that should be a
huge priority for both Democrats and
Republicans in this Congress I do want
to note that miss Kelly and her opening
remarks put up a good slide there that
demonstrated that the Chinese recent
announcement
in the last few years announcement on AI
they're intense focus and funding on
that you know has them eclipsing the US
investment not only because of their
additional funding but because the Trump
administration has backed off somewhat
on on research and development funding
for a number of our agencies I know that
that NSF is looking at a cut in funding
of I think nine billion dollars and I
know that DHS as well especially in your
Science and Technology Directorate
you're looking at a I think it's a 1.3
billion dollar cut so I'm concerned
about whether we're recognizing the
priority with our our budget as well and
you know you you've been very helpful in
terms of demonstrating the the
importance of this issue but do you see
any need for additional funding or we
and also you know dr. Everett and mr.
Tanaka Sony you see this as well I know
that DARPA has been considering projects
from companies in my district from you
know underwater radar systems to you
know enhanced antibiotics you know for
use against these resistant strains of
bacteria to climate change and so we
really do need as dr. Carosa has said an
interdisciplinary approach but but all
of that is affected by the amount of
available dollars for research and
development and we've had such great
success in the past through NASA and
other agencies where basically
non-defense research has really helped
us enormous Lee across society and I'm
just wondering dr. Everett are any of
you for the the whole panel do you see
that the lack of funding here could
could trip up or
basically prevent some of the wonderful
discoveries and advancements that we
anticipate in this field
well DARPA supports the President's
budget request for our agency we are a
projects based agency our projects last
roughly four years our PMS are not civil
service but rather they come from
industry and academia for a limited
period of time so what that means is
that every year 25% of our programs are
turning over 25% of our PM's are new
this enables us to rapidly shift our
budget to meet turn priorities that we
see emerging in the technology space
okay
do you have any opinions about the
National Science Foundation or in any
part of HHS that that also might benefit
from some further funding or we're just
talking about DARPA I'm speaking for
DARPA okay all right let me let me we've
got other witnesses as well mr. necklace
Tony sure thank you for your question
when it comes to funding as far as GSA
is concerned you know I just want to
thank Emily Murphy who is our new GSA
administrator and Allen Thomas who's our
faz commissioner and Kaley who I work
under supports the the efforts on the
distributed ledger tech technology and
the robotic process automation I'm sorry
eating all my time I can't go with this
in English you think more money would
help for from a GSA perspective that's
who you represent yes I I think okay
that's good just a Carosa that's all I'm
asking for
thank you nothing complicated just to
say that the president's fiscal 19
budget request with the addendum funded
NSF at 7.5 billion dollars which is the
17 enacted level but to your question I
want to stress there is capacity to do
more when I mentioned that the National
Science Foundation funds 122 million
dollars in AI Corps research if we look
at proposals that were not funded but
rated either competitive or highly
that's one hundred and seventy four
million dollars in proposals there so
there is capacity to do more that's
helpful thank you very much mr. Jim and
I yield back my esteemed colleague from
the count from the Commonwealth of
Virginia is now recognized I thank you
mr. chairman and other white
congratulations I think in yury
nomination last night right all right
let's stipulate you all support the
President's budget and it's perfect and
you wouldn't change a word or a number
let's stipulate that so you don't have
to demonstrate any further loyalty we
got it but but let's talk a little bit
about the relationship between R&amp;amp;D and
technological innovation and its impact
on the economy and I'm I'm particularly
interested in federal R&amp;amp;D so dr. Everett
there used to be something called DARPA
net correct that's correct
and what's it called today the internet
the internet so DARPA net when we first
went your agency was smart enough to
make that in critical investment was
where the commercial dollars flowing
into that Ardi effort at the time no
certainly not
no it was entirely a federal R&amp;amp;D effort
is that correct that's correct and
somewhere along the line someone decided
this is so nifty this is so useful to us
internally but maybe it might have some
other applications is that correct yes
and I'd like to point out that it became
in SF net before and then it became NSF
that thank you very much good point so
would that be the same story of GPS
technology that would be so GPS which is
now ubiquitous we all take it for
granted you can't even lie about getting
lost going to a meeting anymore kind of
put paper maps out of business but GPS
was also a federal R&amp;amp;D investment is
that correct that's correct your agency
yes
what about robotics your agency get
involved in robotics at all we just
concluded the DARPA Robotics Challenge
so yes yeah so a lot of the research in
robotics again a federal investment your
agency being one of the pioneers
yes drones developed by the private
sector or was that a federal R&amp;amp;D
investment as well initially a federal
R&amp;amp;D my goodness
what about noise cancellation
technologies not directly familiar with
that technology well for example we did
a lot during the Cold War we did a lot
of hush-hush work no longer hush
annoying noise cancellation technologies
for reasons you can surmise but after
the Cold War when we're looking at
civilian application for our D in our
possession of the federal government
we took noise cancellation out of your
agency and out of the Pentagon and we
applied it to things like cars and and
even other things like parts of a room
that we can cancel noise to allow
privacy we use it in courtrooms today
that all came out of federal Rd
technologies for defense at the time
human genome is that your area dr.
grossie human genome research excuse me
not my personal area of research but
certainly bioinformatics and
computational role but the Human Genome
Project
so that was run by some private entity
in New York right golly it's not a trick
question dr. OC the answer is of course
of course it was a federal R&amp;amp;D
investment and I'm trying to make a
point here you know there's a lot of
loose talk about the government can't do
anything right that's not true you four
represent the face of a federal
government that has transformed the
world with its R&amp;amp;D investment and we're
not even talking pharmacological
research almost all basic research in
pharmacologic goal areas is federal
because the private sector won't take
the risk and right now we're counting on
the federal government to save us from
antibiotic resistant bacteria that could
unfortunately transform health worldwide
because it's not profitable for the
private sector to engage in that R&amp;amp;D
right now so we got to do it but we've
transformed the world so when we say
we're going to cut a couple of
million dollars out of federal Rd and I
look at this record high tremble at what
are we cutting is it the next GPS is it
the next drone is it the next Human
Genome Project is it the next Internet
we don't know but the opportunity cost I
fear is enormous and so it may be that
DARPA is happy with the budget it's got
but this member of Congress trembles and
a 21% cut that mr. Kelly pointed out to
us at the beginning and her opening
statement because there is an
opportunity cost we can't calculate we
can't even know for sure but I do know
this whatever amount of money we spent
on DARPA net it was worth every percent
the return on that investment cannot be
calculated and that's true for GPS and
that's true for drones and it's true for
the Human Genome Project
these are investments worth making and
America does not make itself great again
when it retreats from the field of Rd so
thank you for being here and know that a
number of us up here are going to
continue to push hard for your budgets
for the sake of the country thank you
mr. Krishna Murthy
you're now recognized Thank You mr.
chairman Thank You ranking member Kelly
I really appreciate the opportunity to
be able to ask a few questions of our
distinguished panel last month I along
with others including my distinguished
colleague Paul Mitchell who's on this
subcommittee introduced a bill call the
AI Jobs Act which basically requires for
the first time that the Department of
Labor study the impact of artificial
intelligence on our workforce
you know what areas of the economy are
going to be impacted the most how do we
prepare our workforce for this
artificial intelligence for evolution
and make sure that they are ready to
take advantage of it as some of you have
talked about I wanted to just start out
with mr. Carosi
kuroh see what specific industries do
you think are most like
kind of experience the impact of
artificial intelligence in our economy
well thank you for your question and the
interest here actually I want to do a
short promo if I might for a National
Academy study on information technology
in the u.s. workforce that came out just
late last year and was funded by the
National Science Foundation and it was
actually written both by economists
there was the committee that chaired
this was an economist Erik Brynjolfsson
from MIT and a machine-learning
professor from Carnegie Mellon Tom
Mitchell and what I found very
interesting about this to answer your
question is that they talked about the
broad application of IT technology and
AI technology specifically across you
know across the whole US workforce so
it's not so much a question of which
jobs will be lost with jobs will be
created but really how AI will transform
work across broad broad swatches of the
US workforce and again not just even in
automation in terms of robots replacing
jobs but also AI software helping
doctors and lawyers and high cognitive
skilled jobs and and so I would
recommend this to you and to everybody
just a very insightful report right
right well thank you so much I don't
know if robots will replace members of
Congress we might write a bill about
that beforehand well I want to switch
subjects is something that congresswoman
Kelley brought up before which I thought
it was really interesting important
which is kind of the rise of China and
the field of artificial intelligence I
want to ask kind of the corollary
corollary set of questions which is how
do we catch up and overtake them what is
our strengths in this area that we need
to leverage to basically come back and
Eclipse them over the short or long term
who wants to dr. Everett can you go for
it we have a very different system than
China but I think we can leverage it so
I think as mr. Connelly pointed out a
lot of the original investments came
from DARPA and from other parts the DoD
and the federal government that
ultimately led to an
mentioned such as the cellphone if we
look at the DARPA Grand Challenge which
in 2004 but if a 1 million dollar prize
for any car that complete 132 mile
course in the Nevada desert driving
autonomously we then know cars did so we
then had a 2005 challenge five cars did
at that time that laid the basis for the
self-driving car industry so I believe
that we are effective in de-risking
technologies at the federal level so
that we can then enable venture
capitalists and well-funded companies to
take on the substantial business risk to
bring them to market and to make them
reliable for consumers miss Rebecca Soni
yes thank you for the question I think
one of the things we can do is do a lot
of cross collaboration leveraging the
emerging citizens technology office to
convene facilitate collaborate and help
rapidly deploy and also from an
acquisition standpoint is have this
private public engagement and provide
acquisition solutions so that we can
support the entire federal state local
government if I might add it sounds like
I mean both of your answers kind of
include an element of the private sector
playing a substantial role in the in the
development of artificial intelligence
if I might it sounds like what one
strengths we have is that we are not
necessarily going to pick and choose
what is the best technology in any given
sector of artificial intelligence we may
let the best one bloom and then the
private sector helps to fuel it whereas
in China they might kind of decide
something is the best and it may not end
up being the best is that a fair point
dr. Monde do you want to comment
certainly I believe you know let the
market decide let's let these new
technologies come out that are AI based
and those that are successful in helping
people and their applications they'll
survive and things that don't they'll
die right so but the market decide great
thank you so much thank you
mr. Mitchell dr. Everett I I appreciate
you know my colleagues left unfortunate
I asked him to stay cuz I promised him
and be interesting
I appreciate the new things I learned
every day is a new member of Congress
only been here about 14 months I found
out something new as you share with me
that so the internet was invented by
DARPA that's correct so it wasn't a
former politician formerly a vice
president it might have been popularized
by a former politician that helps a lot
I was confused about that up until just
a few moments ago a question for all of
you in a serious question sort of and
sort of not but I think I want to make a
point if I had a magic wand and could
have been a giant wad of cash a big
bushel basket full of cash around here
and had three thousand dollar bills or
something many million dollar bills
is anybody any of you gonna turn it down
anybody here gonna turn down more money
no takers exactly my point which is
priorities have to be made by your
agencies by the president nine states by
Congress in terms of what it is how we
prioritize funding to get things
accomplished on a broad range of things
and it's not a bushel basket that
suddenly dreary generates cash or as I
tell my teenage children owe them what
the cash was you know the cash tree I'll
back is kind of a bear I'll with fixed
priorities and at some point of time
there isn't enough cash or anything so I
suggest that if people want to spend
spend more on this we had a hearing this
morning on transportation infrastructure
on the highways and putting more money
in the the federal trust fund highway
trust fund decisions that we made where
the cash comes from and I'm hopeful that
there's concerns about artificial
intelligence or how we fund our highways
that discussions can be held not just
about how we either go further in debt
or we tax more how we save some money
and actually find a way to pay for these
things rather expect the American public
is go deeper in debt or pay more taxes
I've not heard a lot of that from some
of my colleagues he left it's too bad so
I appreciate your time and I apologize
for the little bit snarky question but I
think it made the point I appreciate
thank you you're back mr. chair
dr. everett you said earlier one of the
things that we should be looking at is
in the federal government what is the
problem set that you have what is the
problem that you're trying to solve and
maybe there are tools that use machine
learning artificial intelligence how do
we get a senior manager in the
government in that mindset who would
they go to to say here's my problem
are there other tools that I should be
using to help improve citizen facing
services
well there's that's a really broad
question and does GSA have anything in
their toolkit is NSF or DHS have have a
way or you know here are some some
potential tools that could solve this
problem that may or may not be being
used do we need folks within the
government to better define the problem
set and maybe dr. mom goes out and finds
some you know some company that may be
doing it and do some of that Applied
Research you guys are so good at it is
that how we're thinking about this how
we should be thinking about this problem
dr. Evert well a few years ago we ran a
program called X data and it was an in
the area of big data analytics we open
sourced much of the software that we
developed there that software has
subsequently been used by startups in
the private sector iBM has made a major
investment in spark which is a big data
platform so this information that we
have published it and made it available
to the private sector directly that
doesn't get directly to your question
but it does at least start to enable the
private sector to create solutions in
this area yep that's across within the
National Science Foundation we're taking
up a process of agency reform and one of
the pillars there is making ite work
and so for example understanding what
are the open-source tools that we may be
able to combine to help us do our work
more efficiently exactly what you were
saying the example that I mentioned
earlier about using AI clustering
techniques to help program managers
actually identify the most appropriate
really the best panelists and reviewers
for proposals one example of that so
having those decisions made locally and
knowing what's available is proven to be
very valuable so if we had someone in
the US Census Bureau that one to learn
more how would they do that well for
this particular project we could
certainly put them in touch with people
inside the NSF who are working on this
project dr. Martin looks like you were
going to say something I was just going
to say that you know when we talk to
operators in the field and they're
looking for solutions they don't
necessarily say I need an AI solution to
my problem right they come to us and say
I need a a new widget or new this but I
looks like this and then our job is to
go find the researchers at the
universities or the companies or and a
lot of it ends up being how do they
think about solving it and do they think
about solving it in an efficient manner
that can take advantage of new
technologies because we are in an
innovative country and innovative
mindset and I think that's one of the
benefits from an earlier question is we
do have an innovative community out
there that really is trying to bring
cutting-edge solutions to the operations
community the operations community don't
know they need an AI based solution but
if you give them a solution that solves
their problem they don't care if it's AI
based or not they'll use it they'll
deploy it the companies can be
successful if we had mr. Mitchell's cash
tree and not let's say we had a hundred
million dollars and what kind of basic
research should we be putting that
towards and dr. Everett dr. Carosa
Fianna so I will say and I will just
echo what Doug Mont said we have a very
very creative community and many of the
best ideas are there they're bottom-up
ideas so we say to the community here
are broad
that are very important I might label a
couple of grants some of the Grand
Challenges I talked about earlier
explainable AI fairness accountability
transparency and decision-making for
example are all really really important
areas the ideas are going to come from
the research community itself I think
you referenced one hundred and forty
five million dollars worth of research
proposals that you've been given that
you haven't been able to fund I'm
assuming 174 million in having some
artificial intelligence Wow right so in
our area we are more project driven so
we would have reached out to the
community to find people interested in
starting programs and relevant areas one
area I think that is very important for
us to be looking at is common sense
reasoning that is what people are it's
people are so good at it it's hard to
even describe I know some people that
may need help with that computers are
definitely challenged in this area but
if we're going to move past graphical
interfaces with computers where they're
simply tools and fitter computers are
going to become more active partners in
decision-making we're going to need to
imbue them with common sense and in my
last question and whoever would like to
answer it what is the equivalent of
going to the moon with artificial
intelligence right because yeah I will I
will say this it's been interesting as
we've been looking at this and talking
to folks I went out on the plaza of the
Capitol and asked people about what do
you think about artificial intelligence
is it good or bad I was shocked at how
many people are scared of it you know I
think we've had too many movies where
the the robot with the plastic face
that's getting ready to snatch yeah all
right you know Will Smith and and so so
one of the things that we all understand
the importance of this I always you know
if a lad Amir Putin said that whoever
masters AI is going to be the sole
hegemon and we should listen but to be
able to to explain this in a way to
folks that don't have y'all's experience
or
crown what should we what is that
moonshot in in artificial intelligence
to Carosa so maybe if I could start I'd
come back to earlier in my testimony
talking about narrow AI versus general
AI and in narrow AI it's what we're
hearing about image classification
speech understanding phenomenal leaps
forward on that but if you look at for
instance what an 18 month old child can
do and how the child can transfer
learning from one environment to another
how a child can understand intent and
meaning that that's really the Grand
Challenge general AI still remains a
very grand challenge I would second that
right now we're building tools and the
popular press makes it seem as if these
are going to become autonomous and think
for themselves but that is very far from
the actual case of things right now we
we know that people learned by having
excused one examples and yet we need
terabytes of data to get our systems to
learn we may look back on this time as
the era of incredibly inefficient
machine learning so a moonshot might
take us to the point where computers
actually do understand us in ways that
our tools today don't but what we have
today are tools I would just add to
something earlier said by dr. Everett
which is the program at DARPA which is
the explainable AI it may just be that
the moonshot is AI that is just in and
around us all the time and we don't even
think about it we don't call it AI it
just is it works and it becomes part of
our everyday life and we don't we don't
worry about it and that's not locking us
out of our house doesn't look at it but
I mean it might just be that explainable
piece that might be the moonshot
excellen well I appreciate that dr. Mona
I want to thank all the witnesses for
appearing before us today we're gonna
hold the record open for two weeks for
any member to submit a opening statement
of questions for the record
and if there's no further business
without objection the subcommittee
