I'd Leslie well it's a tremendous honor
and first of all to have this lecture
series which I was not my idea I may say
but I'm very appreciative of it but much
more I am very honored and very grateful
that Stephen has agreed to be the first
speaker in this series of lectures I
mean who else on introducing Stephen I
mean it's ridiculous it's like you know
you know people say he needs no
introduction well I can't think of
anybody else who needs less of an
introduction so what am I doing here but
let me not introduced him and describe
his many achievements in science through
black hole that say a few things about
that of course the major thing was his
achievement in understanding or
producing a precise formula for the
entropy and the temperature of a black
hole which was I guess probably the
first and almost the only contribution I
think where general relativity and
quantum mechanics come together in a way
which makes such an amazing prediction
prediction well that's something we
don't know yet we might have to wait for
a few millions and millions of years
before we know exactly when black holes
disappear and so on but that's the
prediction and an amazing achievement I
think I won't talk particularly about
his science because that's the sort of
thing people know but maybe I should
make a few comments about experiences I
had with Stephen abroad sometimes he
would have a very faithful student to
help we wheeled him around and so on but
occasionally this fell upon me to help
him out and I remember one occasion in
particular I think it was in in Brussels
in Belgium when we were with a colleague
there who knew the place very well so he
said and it was a question of getting to
the airport and he was going to drive us
and the he said he knew a good route to
the
which would avoid all the traffic
instead of that he got completely lost
and so Stephen and I were getting there
more and more worried as the time got
later and later and later creeping up to
the time of the flight and eventually he
found the right route and he whizzed off
a great speed and we got in there and we
managed to check in and and was ticking
away and there was no help I remember
wheeling I had to push Stephen in the
wheelchair and we went down ramps and up
ramps this way in that way at great
speed and I could see Stephen was
enjoying himself tremendously it's one
of these things which I had no idea that
later on of course he was going to be
weightless in an airplane well that sort
of thing but I suppose it was the kind
of preparation for that later experience
and I got some sort of a feeling of the
enjoyment that Stephen got out of
thrills of this kind this man and by
comparison with other things he's done
another occasion I think I can't
remember was earlier on and where it was
but I just remember thinking this
occasion this was a time well here I was
with Stephen Hawking nobody knew who he
was he was completely unknown and why is
he so unknown why is this chap who
fighting against these tremendous
disabilities and yet producing wonderful
fantastic results in mathematical
physics and nobody has heard of him well
I wouldn't say that they the common
people make about is the rest as well
the rest is a brief history of time
thank you very much and I'm looking
forward very much to Stephens lecture
thank you for coming
can you hear me I am pleased to be here
at Oxford today to get the inaugural
Roger Penrose lecture in honor of my
longtime friend and colleague my talk is
on black holes the set at fact is
sometimes stranger than fiction
and nowhere is that more true than in
the case of black holes
black holes are theatres and anything
dreamed up by science fiction writer but
they are firmly matters of science fact
to understand him we need to start with
gravity although it's by far the weakest
of the known forces of nature that has
to Drasil advantages over other forces
first enacts over a long range the earth
has held in orbit by the Sun 93 million
miles away and the Sun has held in orbit
around the center of the galaxy about
10,000 light years away the second
advantage is gravity is always
attractive
unlike electric forces which can be
attractive or repulsive these two
features mean at first sufficiently
large star the gravitational attraction
between particles can dominate over all
other forces and lead to gravitational
collapse
despite lead facts the scientific
community was slow to realize that
massive stars collapse in on themselves
under their own gravity and how the
object left behind what behaved Albert
Einstein didn't wrote a paper in 1939
claiming stars could not collapse under
gravity because matter could not be
compressed beyond a certain point
many scientists shared Einstein's blood
feeling the principal exception was the
American scientist John Wheeler who in
many ways is the hero of the black hole
story in his work in the 1950s and 60s
he emphasized that many stars would
eventually collapse and the problems at
posed for theoretical physics
he also for so many of the properties of
the effects which collapsed stars to
come that is black holes
during most of the life of a normal star
over many billions of years that will
support itself against its own gravity
by thermal pressure caused by nuclear
processes which convert hydrogen into
helium eventually however the star will
exhaust its nuclear fuel the star will
contract in some cases that may be able
to support itself as a white dwarf star
however Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar
showed in 1930 that the maximum mass of
the white dwarf star this about 1.4
times out of the Sun a similar maximum
mass was calculated by Soviet physicist
LED leant out for a star made entirely
of neutrons
what would be the fate of those
countless stars with greater mass and
the white dwarf or neutron star when
they had exhausted nuclear fuel the
problem was investigated by Robert
Oppenheimer of later atom bomb fame then
a couple of papers in 1939 with Lord
Volkoff and heartland Snyder
he showed that such a star could not be
supported by pressure and that if one
neglected pressure a uniform very
systematic symmetric star would contract
to a single point of infinite density
such a point is called a singularity all
our theories of space are formulated on
the assumption that space-time is smooth
and nearly flat so they break down at a
singularity where the curvature of
space-time is infinite in fact that
marks the end of time itself
that is what Einstein found so
objectionable
then the Lord intervened most scientists
including Robert Oppenheimer slipped
their attention to nuclear physics on
the issue of gravitational collapse was
largely forgotten the interest in a
subject revived with the discovery of
distant objects called lasers the first
place ur 3c273
was discovered in 1963 many other lasers
were soon discovered they were right
despite being at great distances nuclear
processes could not account for their
energy output because they release only
a percent fraction of their rest mass
and pure energy the only alternative was
gravitational energy released by
gravitational collapse gravitational
collapses of stars were rediscovered it
was clear that a uniform spherical star
would contract to a point of infinite
density a singularity but what would
happen if a star is uniform as a ripple
goodness caused different parts of the
star to miss each other and avoid a
singularity in the remarkable paper in
1965 Roger Penrose showed there would
still be a singularity using only the
fact that gravity is attractive
Penrose gave a seminar in King's College
London in January 1965 I wasn't at the
seminar but I heard about it from
Brandon Carter with whom I shared an
office in the new dam premises in silver
Street the original singularity theorems
of both Penrose and myself required the
assumption that the universe had a Koshi
surface that is a surface that
intersects every particle path once and
only once it was therefore possible at
our first singularity theorems just
proved that the universe didn't have a
cosy surface while interesting this
didn't compare an importance which I am
having a beginning your end I therefore
set about proving singularity theorems
that didn't require the assumption of a
ghostly surface in the next five years
Roger Penrose Bob Garrick a knight
developed a theory of causal structure
and general relativity it was a
wonderful feeling having a whole field
virtually to ourselves how unlike
particle physics where people were
falling over themselves to latch onto
the latest ideal they still are
the Einstein equations can't be defined
at a singularity this means at this
point of infinite density one can't
predict the future this implies
something strange could happen whenever
a star collapsed we would be affected by
the breakdown of prediction if the
singularities are not naked that is they
are not builded from the outside
Penrose proposed what is now called a
leap cosmic censorship protector that
all singularities formed by the collapse
of stars or other bodies are hidden from
you inside black holes a black hole is a
region where gravity is so strong that
light cannot escape the cosmic
censorship contactor is almost certainly
true because a number of attempts to
disprove that have failed
I shall return to cosmic censorship at
the end of the lecture
when John Wheeler introduced a term
black hole in 1967 that replaced the
earlier name frozen star wheel earth
climate emphasized that the remnants of
collapsed stars are of interest in their
own right than dependently of how they
were formed the new name caught on
quickly that suggested something dark
and mysterious but the friend being
friend saw a more risque meaning for
years they resisted the name true you
are claiming it was obscene but that was
a bit like trying to stand against the
weekend another friendly in the end they
had a Goodman we can resist a name that
is such a winner
from the outside you can't tell what is
inside a black hole you can throw
television sets diamond rings or your
worst enemies into a black hole a null a
black hole will remember is the total
mass and a state of rotation John
Wheeler is known for expressing the
discrim sick alas a black hole has no
hair to the friend this just confirmed
their suspicions a black hole has a
boundary called event horizon that is
where gravity is just strong enough to
grab light back and prevent escaping
because nothing can travel faster than
light everything else will get dragged
back also falling through the event
horizon disappeared like going over
Niagara Falls in the canoe if you are
above the falls you can get away few
paddle fast enough but once you are over
the edge you are lost there's no way
back as you get near the Falls the
current gets faster this means it pulls
harder on the front of the canoe in the
bag there's a danger that the canoe will
be pulled apart that is the same with
leg holes
if you fall towards a black hole
feet-first gravity will pull harder on
your feet and your head because they are
near the black hole
the result is you will be stretched out
long wise and squashed in sideways the
black hole has the mass of a few times
our Sun you would be torn apart and made
into spaghetti before you reach the
horizon however if you fell into a much
larger black hole with the mass of a
million times the Sun you would reach
the horizon without difficulty so if you
want to explore the inside of a black
hole make sure you to submit one there
is a black hole in the mass of about
four million times that of the Sun at
the center of our Milky Way galaxy
although you wouldn't notice anything
particular as you fell into a black hole
someone watching you from a distance
would never see you cross the event
horizon instead you would appear to slow
down an average just outside your limit
would get dimmer and dimmer and redder
and redder until you were effectively
lost from sight as far as the outside
world is concerned you would be lost
forever
I had a Eureka moment shortly after the
birth of my daughter Lucy while getting
into bed which my disability makes a
slow process the surface of a black hole
is called the event horizon I realized
that the event horizon of a scenario
theorem if general relativity is correct
and the energy of matter is positive
than the area of the event horizon has
the property that it always increases
when additional matter or radiation
falls into the black hole
moreover the two black holes collide and
merge to form a single black hole the
area of the event horizon around the
resulting black hole is greater and the
sum of the areas of the event horizon
surround the original black holes
the area theorem and O'Haire theorem can
be tested experimentally by the LIGO
dravot ational wave observatory on the
14th of september 2015 the event TW 1 5
0 91 4 ly blow for the first time
detected gravitational waves from the
collision and merger of a black hole
binary since then largo has reported
more detections of black hole mergers
and most recently a neutron star merger
gravitational waves were predicted by
Einstein almost a hundred years ago a
gravitational wave is a ripple in the
fabric of space and time that's produced
somewhere in the distant universe and
travels across the universe when any
massive object moves it's changing the
nature of space-time that's what
Einstein told us so you have a motion
that stretches space in one direction
and compresses space in the other
direction
nobody really believed at the time of
the prediction that you could ever
detect them because the size of the
effect is so small it was what we call
it chirp and it was strong everybody
thought it was a fluke it was too good
and I thought my god
this looks like it's it oh my gosh this
is this is real it took us 25 years and
two detectors to finally detect a
gravitational wave
we have interferometers one in Hanford
Washington one in Livingston Louisiana
to detect the stretching and compressing
of space we literally look for changes
in the space-time distance in our
instruments as the gravitational wave
goes by and the gravitational wave
pushes them together in a part by one
1,000 diameter of the nucleus of an atom
no wonder is taking so long to pull
itself however what's even more
remarkable about this is what we
detected we have observed gravitational
waves from two black holes forming a
larger black hole for the first time two
black holes spiraling together
coalescing merging and creating a wild
oscillations the storm in the fabric of
space and time they're moving at the
velocity of light
damn near that velocity 30 solar mass is
moving that fast
I mean I'm putting out an incredible
amounts of energy and when they collide
with one another they produce a bigger
black hole but they also produce
gravitational waves and in that process
about three solar masses just disappears
and goes into gravitational
oh it's going to be amazing we have
always said that this is going to be a
field called gravitational wave
astronomy gravitational waves carry
information that you can't get from any
other way a supernova two neutron stars
colliding even the Big Bang itself the
beginning of the universe all produce
gravitational waves this first detection
by LIGO is the very first step it's just
the start of the story nature is about
to tell us I would love to see Einsteins
face I mean he would have been as
dumbfounded as we are because it's a
wonderful proof that all of this
incredible stuff has strong field
gravity is in his equations just imagine
that to me that's a miracle from the
gravitational waves emitted as the final
black hole settles down to equilibrium
that should be possible to test whether
his black hole is described by the Kerr
solution as predicted by the no-hair
theorem from the early part of the
waveform one can estimate the mass it's
an angler moment of the initial black
holes and by the no-hair theorem he's
determined the horizon areas which can
be compared to the area of the final
black hole to test the area theorem the
data is not yet good enough to do this
but in the near future that should be
possible to test the area of no-hair
theorems using gravitational wave
observations
with many more gravitational wave
detection expected on the opening of a
third laser interferometer called Virgo
earlier this year I am excited by a
possibility this new era of
gravitational wave astronomy will bring
his property suggest that there is a
resemblance between the area of the
event horizon of a black hole
unconventional metallian physics
specifically the concept of entropy and
thermodynamics entropy can be regarded
as the measure of the disorder of a
system birth Wibbly as the lack of
knowledge of its precise state the
famous second law of thermodynamics says
that entropy always increases with time
this discovery was the first hint of
this crucial connection
the analogy between the property select
holes and the loss of thermodynamics can
be extended the first law of
thermodynamics says that a small change
in the entropy of the system is
accompanied by a proportional change in
the energy of the system Brandon Carter
and I found a similar law relating the
change in mass of a black pole to a
change in the area of the event horizon
here the factor of proportionality
involves of London II called the surface
gravity which is a measure of the
strength of the gravitational field at
the event horizon if one accepts at the
area of event horizon is analogous to
entropy then it would seem that a
surface gravity is analogous to
temperature the resemblance is
strengthened by the fact that the
surface gravity turns out to be the same
at all points on the event horizon just
as the temperature is the same
everywhere in the body at thermal
equilibrium
although there is clearly a similarity
between entropy in the area of the event
horizon that was not obvious to us how
the area could be identified as the
entropy of a black hole itself what
would be meant by the entropy of a black
hole
the crucial suggestion was made in 1972
by a publican Stein who was a graduate
student at Princeton University and then
at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
that goes like this when a black hole is
created by gravitational collapse that
rapidly settles down to a stationary
state which is characterized by only
three parameters the mass the angular
momentum and the electric charge apart
from these three properties the black
hole preserves no other details of the
object that collapsed
the theorem has implications for
information than the cosmologists sense
of information the idea that every
particle in every force in the universe
has an implicit answer to a yes/no
question the theorem implies an alert
amount of information is lost in the
gravitational collapse for example the
final black hole's data is independent
of whether a body that collapsed was
composed of matter or antimatter or
whether atlasfera coal or highly
irregular in shape in other words a
black hole of a given mass angular
momentum an electric charge could have
been formed by the collapse of any one
of a large number of different
configurations of matter so what appears
to be the same black hole could be
formed by the collapse of a large number
of different types of star indeed if
quantum effects are neglected the number
of configurations would be infinite
since the black hole could have been
formed by the collapse of a cloud of an
indefinitely large number of particles
of indefinitely low mass but with a
number of configurations really the
infinite
the uncertainty principle of quantum
mechanics implies that only particles
with the wavelength smaller than that of
the black hole itself could form a black
hole that means the wavelength would be
limited that could not be infinite that
therefore appears at the number of
configurations that could form a black
hole of a given mass and your momentum
an electric charge although very large
may also be finite shape replicant Stein
suggested that from this finite number
one could interpret the entropy of a
black hole this would be a measure of
the amount of information that was here
with reasonably lost during the collapse
when a black hole was created
the apparently fatal flaw and began
Stein's suggestion was that if a black
hole has a finite entropy that is
proportional to the area of its event
horizon that also ought to have a finite
temperature which would be proportional
to its surface gravity this would imply
that a black hole could be an
equilibrium with thermal radiation at
some temperature other than zero yet
according to classical concepts no such
equilibrium is possible since a black
hole would absorb any thermal radiation
that fell on it but my definition will
not be able to emit anything in return
it cannot emit anything that cannot emit
heat
this created a paradox about the nature
of black holes the incredibly dense
objects created by the collapse of stars
one theory suggested that black holes
with identical qualities could be formed
from an infinite number of different
types of stars another suggested at the
number could be finite this is a problem
of information that is the idea that
every particle in every force in the
universe contains information an
implicit answer to a yes/no question
because black holes have no hair as the
scientist John Wheeler put it one can't
tell from the outside whether it's
inside a black hole apart from its mass
the electric charge and rotation this
means that a black hole contains a lot
of information that is hidden from the
outside world but there's a limit of the
amount of information one can pack into
a region of space the information
requires energy an energy has masked by
Einstein's famous equation e equals MC
squared so if there are too much
information in a region of space that
will collapse into a black hole and the
size of the black hole will reflect the
amount of information that is like
piling more and more books into a
library
eventually the shelves will good way and
the library will collapse into a black
hole
if the amount of hidden information
inside a black hole depends on the size
of the hole one would expect from
general principles and the black hole
would have a temperature and would glow
like a piece of hard metal but that was
impossible because as everyone knew
nothing could get out of a black hole
parcel it was thought this problem
remained until early in 1974 when I was
investigating what the behavior of
matter in the vicinity of a black hole
would be according to quantum mechanics
to my great surprise I found that a
black hole seemed to emit particles at a
steady rate like everyone else at that
time I accepted the dictum that a black
hole could not emit anything I therefore
put quite a lot of effort into trying to
get rid of this embarrassing effect but
the more I thought about it the more it
refused to go away so had an E and I had
to accept it what finally convinced me
it was a real physical process was at
the outgoing particles at the spectrum
had as precisely thermal my calculations
predicted that a black hole creates and
emits particles and radiation just as if
it were an ordinary hot body with a
temperature and is proportional to the
surface gravity and inversely
proportional to the mass
this made a problematic suggestion of a
public and stein that a black hole had a
finite entropy fully consistent since it
implied that a black hole could be in
thermal equilibrium at some finite
temperature rather than zero I told her
about my discovery on January 4th 1974
he told Penrose who phoned me during my
birthday dinner
I talked so long at my booth was spoiled
since that time the mathematical
evidence at black holes emit thermal
radiation has been confirmed by a number
of other people with various different
approaches one way to understand the
emission is as follows quantum mechanics
implies that the whole of space is
filled with pairs of virtual particles
and antiparticles that are constantly
materializing in pairs separating and
then coming together again and
annihilating each other these particles
are called virtual because unlike real
particles they cannot be observed
directly with a particle detector their
indirect effects can nonetheless be
measured and their existence has been
confirmed by a small tip called the lamb
shift which they produce in the spectrum
energy of light from excited hydrogen
atoms now in the presence of a black
hole one member of a pair of virtual
particles may fall into the hole leaving
under member without a partner with
which to annihilate the forsaken
particle or antiparticle
may fall into the black hole after its
partner but it may also escape to
infinity where it appears to me
radiation emitted by the black hole
another way of looking at the process is
to regard the member of the pair of
particles that falls into the black hole
the antiparticle say as being really a
particle had a travelling Evert in time
Yosi antiparticle falling into a black
hole can be regarded as a particle
coming out of the black hole but
traveling backward in time when the
particle reaches a point at which a
particle antiparticle pair originally
materialized that is scattered like a
gravitational field so that it travels
forward in time a black hole of the mass
of the Sun would leave particles at such
a slow rate that would be impossible to
detect however there could be much
smaller many black holes with no mass of
say a mountain these might have formed
in the very early universe if it had
been chaotic and irregular a mountain
sized black hole would give off x-rays
and gamma rays at a rate of about 10
million megawatts enough to power the
world's electricity supply it will be
easy however to harness a mini black
hole you could keep it in a power
station because it would drop through
the floor and end up at the center of
the earth if we had such a black hole
about the only way to keep hold of it
would be to have it in orbit around the
earth
people have searched for many black
holes of this mass but have so far not
found any this is totally because if
they had I would have not a Nobel price
another possibility however that we
might be able to create micro black
holes in the extra dimensions of
space-time according to some theories
the universe we experience is just a
four dimensional surface in a 10 or 11
dimensional space the movie interstellar
gives some idea of what this is like we
would see these extra dimensions because
light would propagate through them but
only through the four dimensions of our
universe gravity however would affect
the extra dimensions and would be much
stronger than in our universe this would
make it much easier to form a little
black hole in the extra dimensions it
might be possible to observe this at the
LHC the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in
Switzerland this consists of a certain
Laura tunnel 27 kilometers long two
beams of particles travel round this
tunnel in opposite directions under made
to collide some of the collisions might
create micro black holes these would
radiate particles in a pattern that
would be easy to recognize so I might
Nobel Prize after all as particles
escape from a black hole the hole will
lose mass and shrink this little
increase the rate of emission of
particles eventually the black hole will
lose all its mass and disappeared what
and happens to all the particles and
unlucky astronauts that fell into the
black hole
they can't just read emerge when the
black hole disappears the particles had
come out of a black hole seemed to be
completely random and to bear no
relation to what fella that appears at
the information about what fell in is
lost apart from the total amount of mass
and the amount of rotation but if
information is lost this race it's a
serious problem that strikes at the
heart of our understanding of science
for more than 200 years we have believed
in scientific determinism that is that
the laws of science determined the
evolution of the universe this was
formulated by pierre-simon Laplace who
said that if we know the state of the
universe at one time the laws of science
will determine it at all future and past
times in a poll Yunus said to have asked
Laplace how God fitted into his picture
Laplace replied sire I have not needed
that hypothesis
I don't think that Laplace was claiming
that God didn't exist that is just that
he doesn't intervene to break the loss
of science that must be the position of
every scientist a scientific law is not
a scientific law if it only holds when
some supernatural being decides to let
things run and not intervene then law
blesses determinism one needed to know
the positions and speeds of all
particles at one time in order to
predict the future but there's the
uncertainty relationship discovered by
Walter Heisenberg in 1923 which lies at
the heart of quantum mechanics this
whole said the more accurately you know
the positions of particles the less
accurately you can know their speeds and
vice-versa in other words you can't know
both the positions and the speed
security how then can you predict the
future accurately the answer is and
although one can predict the positions
and speeds separately one can predict
what is called a Blondin state this is
something from which both positions and
speeds can be calculated to a certain
degree of accuracy we would still expect
a universe to be deterministic in the
sense that if we knew the quantum state
of the universe at one time the loss of
science should enable us to predict any
time if information were lost in black
holes we wouldn't be able to predict the
future because a black hole to them in
any collection of particles that could
emit a working television set or a
leather-bound volume of the complete
works of Shakespeare so the chance of
such exotic commission says very low it
is much more likely to limit thermal
radiation likely to blow from red-hot
metal it might seem that it would matter
very much if we could predict what comes
out of black holes there aren't any
black holes near us but it is a matter
of principle
if determinism the predictability of the
universe breaks down with black holes
that could break down in other
situations there could be virtual black
holes that appear as fluctuations out of
the vacuum absorb one set of particles
and with another and disappear into the
vacuum again if worth that determinism
breaks down we can't be sure of our past
history either the history books and our
memories could just be illusions that is
the past that tells us who we are
without it we lose our identity
it was therefore very important to
determine whether information really was
lost in black holes or whether in
principle that could be recovered
many scientists felt that information
should not be lost but no one could
suggest a mechanism by which it could be
preserved the arguments have gone on for
years finally I found what I think is
the answer I am working with my
Cambridge colleague Malcolm Perry
Anandi's drummer from Harvard on a new
theory based on super rotation charges
to explain the mechanism by which
information is returned out of the black
hole the problem is that the quantum
state of the negative energy particle
falling into the black hole was assumed
to be impossible to know but unless the
quantum state of the England particle is
known the full quantum state cannot be
determined on the outgoing radiation is
a mixed quantum state rather than a pure
state however it now appears at
information thus encoded on the horizon
of the black hole as an infinite head of
super translation and super rotation
softer
to describe how the information is
retained I will have to take you down a
more technical path super translations
act on the generators of the horizon by
a finite shift of each point on the
generator by an amount which varies from
generator that generator super rotations
interchange the generators in a manner
which varies across the horizon together
these symmetries may determine the
quantum state of the outgoing radiation
the terms of the ongoing flow of matter
and linearized gravitational radiation
across the horizon it is not necessary
to analyze the effect they have on the
outgoing radiation the so there will be
no loss of information the plenum states
of the outgoing radiation will be
determined by the super translations and
super rotations of the horizon which are
in turn determined by the quantum state
of being glowing matter
the information may be retained in a
very different form for example that
would be possible to create a black hole
purely by electromagnetic radiation and
it will evaporate partly into
gravitational radiation what happens in
more general cases including nonzero
rest mass fields that's not clear
there will necessarily be a naked
singularity when the black hole
disappears but by then it will have
radiated away all its mass so one might
expect that there would be some smooth
resolution of the singularity in the
semi-classical approximation with that
proviso that would be reasonable to me
Penrose is strong in cosmic censorship
contact her that space-time has causally
burned eggs what does this tell us about
whether it is possible to fall in a
black hole and come out in another
universe the existence of alternative
histories with black hole sickness this
might be possible the hole would need to
be alert and if it was rotating that
might have a passage to another universe
but it would be a Penrose destroying a
cosmic censorship conjecture
the message of this lecture is that
black holes in tests lack as they are
painted they are not the eternal
presence they were once taught things
can get out of a black hole both on the
outside and possibly to another universe
so if you feel you are in a black hole
don't give up there's a way out thank
you very much
[Laughter]
a wonderful lecture and I would like to
thank you the name of the mathematical
Institute as you know I'd like you to
stay put while Stephen Hawking goes away
just so give us a few minutes I'll give
you the clear as soon as we can so thank
you again for coming in for this
wonderful lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
