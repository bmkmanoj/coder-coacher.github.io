past is a very narrow conception of
history I think that history is the
study of change not the study of the
past and we studied the past not in
order not for the sake of to remember
past events but in order to better
understand our present condition and the
future possibilities that we are facing
and in this history is just like you
know other other disciplines like
economics that basically economists are
also historians I mean all the data of
economists most of the data comes from
studying the past like you study the
previous financial crisis in history
such as the 1929 financial crisis or the
dot-com bubble of 2000 and we try to
learn from that about the nature of
economic crisis in general so that the
next time there is an economic crisis
you have a better understanding of
what's happening and what can we do and
what are the possibilities and the
historians are doing the same thing just
on a broader scale we don't just focus
on economics which right understand
change in general we the real subject of
history is how humanity changes how
human society changes and this involves
not just economics but the connections
between technology and economics and
culture and religion and politics
everything together
humanism in essence is the belief that
the highest source of authority in the
world is human feelings and the free
choices the free will of individual
humans and this is what democracy is
built on this is what the free market is
built on the customer is always right
the free will of the customer is the
highest authority in economics the free
will of the voter is the highest
authority in politics this is the
humanist idea and it's it's it's all
based on outdated understanding of
feelings and and in choices its and for
you know for centuries we didn't have a
better understanding of human beings and
how humans make choices so even though
this was always a mythology it was never
true that humans have free will for all
practical purposes it made sense to act
as if humans make choices freely because
nobody could understand you didn't have
the biological knowledge and he didn't
have the computing power necessary to
really understand how humans make
decisions what humans feel what humans
think even if somebody like the KGB
followed you around all the time all the
day and watched everything you do they
didn't have the biological knowledge and
the computing power to understand what
was happening inside you they couldn't
understand how you think and feel but
now we are facing a tremendous
revolution resulting from the merger the
confluence of two scientific revolutions
we have a revolution in biology we have
a better and better understanding of how
the human body and especially the human
brain functions we are deciphering the
human organism and at the same time we
have a revolution in computing in
computer science and we are
gaining enormous computing power and we
are gaining the powers of machine
learning and artificial intelligence and
when you put the two together we are
close to the point when we can have a
computer algorithm analyzing the data
about a person especially biometric data
to such an extent that it can understand
how this person feels what this person's
thinks and can predict and manipulate
and make choices on behalf of that
person for the first time in history we
are approaching a point when an external
system can understand me better than I
understand myself and once we reach that
point then institutions like free
markets and democratic elections no
longer make sense
because an external system can not just
understand me it can also manipulate me
without my understand without my own my
understanding what is happening and and
this is the this is the crisis either
the big crisis I think of of humanism
and we are going to see more and more
the authority to make decisions in the
world shifting from voters and customers
and individuals shifting to algorithms
that understand people better than the
people understand themselves
initially it's humans who control the
system that manipulates you it's humans
who write the algorithms and who use the
algorithms maybe to manipulate you to
sell you something to make you vote for
somebody but in the long term even these
unions will lose their power because the
algorithms will become so complicated
and so powerful that even the people who
initially created them can't really
understand what is happening to take a
concrete example more and more banks are
now giving the authority to decide loans
and mortgages to algorithms you apply to
a bank to receive a mortgage and
previously your application goes to a
human banker who goes over the
information and decides now it goes to
an algorithm that goes over immense
amount of information and says yes or no
and the algorithm becomes so complicated
and goes over so much data that no human
is able to understand how the algorithm
which is a decision the the whole idea
of machine learning today and knowing
what is known as neural networks in
artificial intelligence is that
algorithms can recognize patterns that
humans can't and when it comes to
banking it means that algorithms can
just by going over immense amounts of
data they can recognize a pattern of
people who don't repay their loans when
humans can't and what is likely to
happen is that the banks will
increasingly trust these algorithms to
make decisions without the human bankers
understanding why the algorithm reached
this particular decision so you apply to
the bank the bank says no we don't give
you a mortgage we don't want to give you
money and you ask why not and the bank
says the algorithm said no and you ask
why not what's wrong with me and the
bank says we don't know we just trust
the algorithm so this is a concrete
example which we are likely to see in
more
more situations when even the people who
control the system like the bankers they
don't understand they just trust the
algorithms in the stock markets decision
to buy or not to buy a stock and in
things like security now you have people
being identified as terrorists by an
algorithm based on recognizing patterns
and it's not that you have solid
information you have an agent inside
Isis saying this person is a terror is
known you have an algorithm going over
data from drones and from all kinds of
surveillance system and based on that
data the algorithm concludes this person
is a terrorist and the NSA or whatever
they just believe the algorithm and
there are cases when people are
identified as terrorists just by an
algorithm which we increasingly can't
really understand how the algorithm
reached this conclusion
miss is that the real power of AI
manifest itself only in combination with
with with biotech because the really
powerful AI what really gives a AI power
is the power to understand humans but to
understand humans you must have also
biotic you must have biometric data
biometric sensors you must have some
model of how humans function and make
decisions and so forth and this comes
from from biotech if we didn't have the
revolution in the biological sciences so
the ability of AI to understand human
beings would be far far reduced I mean
to be just getting a concrete example
just yesterday there was a big scandal
when there was this new research from
Stanford about a new AI program that
allegedly according to the research can
identify the sexual orientation of
people just by analyzing their face they
say they have almost a 90% success in in
distinguishing gay men from straight men
just by looking at the single picture or
maybe it was three pictures again just a
few pictures and I don't want to go into
the control I mean there are all kinds
of problems with the with the with the
experiment but at least according to the
communication they took images from
dating sites of people who self-identify
that I publish a profile on a gay dating
site on a straight dating site so I
guess you can trust the person that he
really wants to meet men and not women
and you just take the code that the
picture that the person puts on on the
dating site and now you give me the two
pictures here are pictures of two men we
don't tell you which we took from a gay
dating site and which from astray I
usually can't guess but the AI at least
the comic is a research with a very high
success rate of up to 90
it can do it now this is a this
ultimately this is also based on biotech
it's understanding the human body it's
understanding how human sexuality
functions it's not just computers
it's organisms if humans if we did not
understand the human body you couldn't
do such you can build such an AI and
it's not a coincidence that people
realize how frightening the situation is
only when you have this kind of meeting
of the computing power and the body then
people are so we have computers that are
able to to recognize some very deep
biological characteristic like sexual
orientation and this is this is
frightening and you know as a gay man I
know that for years I didn't know about
my own sexuality but I guess that you
know I try to remember myself as a 15
year old teenager back in the 1980s I
guess that if an AI if they just a man
when I was fifteen I didn't know I was
gay but I'm absolutely certain that if
they if they had an AI that just observe
the way that I look at boys and girls in
school the AI would immediately
recognize please gay for me now what
does it mean I try to think about myself
today let's say you open and you open an
internet site based on this kind of
software and a teenager who is unsure
about his sexual identity can go on this
web page and within five minutes the web
page tells very organic and then you can
take it to all kinds of a frightening
directions but just stay with the mean
what took me years to understand about
myself may now be possible you know two
minutes on the internet and
good day I and that's it that your
identity is determined
it's a technical problem in the sense
that for most of history people thought
that death was the kind of metaphysical
problem we died because God said so or
because the universe said so and the
only way to overcome death and you had a
lot of epics and mythologies about
people trying to overcome death and the
way to do it was by some kind of great
metaphysical gesture like you have the
epic of gilgamesh from thousands of
years ago about the great hero Gilgamesh
who goes to an on a search for how to
overcome death and you have you know the
basic mythology for instance of
Christianity that tells you the solution
to death is Christ you believe in Christ
and Christ will overcome death for you
and now you have the scientific
establishment and more and more private
corporations saying no that is not a
metaphysical problem it's a technical
problem in the sense that people don't
die because God said so people always
die because of a technical problem in
their body like the heart stops pumping
blood and you die and every technical
solution has a technical every technical
problem has in principle a technical
solution we can give you a medicine we
can give an electric shock to that to
the heart we can replace the heart and
give you a new heart we took from
somebody else we can even maybe in the
future create an artificial Bionic heart
and replace your organic heart
they are finding billions of believers
already today I mean the the basic
belief of this new religion is that
algorithm is no better than humans and
in more and more fields that again if
you collect enough data and you have
enough computing power you can build
algorithms that can decide for us on
things like what to eat where to drive
what to study whom to marry were too
well to work and all kinds of things
like that and it's succeeding
yeah I mean you see that people are
giving up our trusting these algorithms
in more and more fields so you know it
starts with things like many people
today lost the ability to navigate
around the city because they just have a
smartphone you want to get from here to
the central bus station or to the
central train station so we just follow
whatever the smartphone is saying and
you lose the ability to find your own
way around space now I'm not saying it's
all bad the wonderful things coming out
of this of these new abilities but when
you look at the big picture what you see
is a shift in authority from humans from
human feelings from human intuition to
the calculations of big data algorithms
I don't think we can stop technological
progress in a broad field like the
Internet of Things or like artificial
intelligence
you can stop particular projects or
particular inventions but you can't you
can't stop an entire field and however
it doesn't mean that technology is
deterministic you can use the same
technology for very different purposes
so I think the key question shouldn't be
whether to stop all research in the
Internet of Things the key question is
how to direct research in this field
towards more responsible and in
beneficial goals for example there is
now a growing concern with security that
in the early days of the Internet
there was very little concern about
security everybody had this utopian
vision that the Internet will be free
and it will bring harmony and democracy
and so we don't need to worry so much
about security and now it's especially
with the Internet of Things it's an
enormous problem because suddenly you
can have hackers that take control of
your car of your pacemaker of your
toaster in the kitchen and start doing
things so we need to shift a lot more
attention to not just due to how to
expand the Internet of Things but how to
make it secure and similarly there with
a lot of issues about privacy how to
make sure that the Internet of Things
doesn't turn into some kind of a well
Yin surveillance system that follows
everybody 24 hours a day and completely
annihilates privacy
inclusion is yes we are becoming gods in
the sense that we acquire divine
abilities of creation and destruction
but we are becoming very irresponsible
gods we have the power we create the
power we don't really know how to use it
responsibly
so I think yes humans are becoming gods
but they are becoming very irresponsible
gods thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
