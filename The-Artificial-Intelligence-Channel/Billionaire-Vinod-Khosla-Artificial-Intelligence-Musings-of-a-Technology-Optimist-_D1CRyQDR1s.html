Vinod Khosla the notice adventure
capitalist he was the co-founder of Sun
Microsystems and the first president CEO
then he was a general partner at Kleiner
Perkins the venture capital firm and
then his own company his own venture
firm Khosla Ventures he is just as a an
interesting note in the first paper that
first example that was raised in Scott
and Rebecca nians paper of Adam wise
that was a graduate student it came from
Toronto but couldn't get financed in
Canada and so got on a plane and went to
the bay and the note is that was a an AI
to basically predict binding affinity
between proteins and molecules for drug
discovery and Vinod financed his
business along with many others so why
he was such a great choice for us for
our lunch conversation as he is one of
the most prolific investors he and his
partners at his firm in artificial
intelligence and so he's going to talk
to us about how he thinks about AI and
how he did it makes his capital
allocation decisions with his vision of
how this is unfolding great so my my
goal today is not to leave specific
points with you but the impression that
something large is happening and it has
many more implications than people
realize the fundamental discussions
around causality in models all that will
be laid relatively irrelevant in my view
because the large structural changes
we'll see
driven by this technology so it's more
about impressions as a world really
whirlwind tour it's much more about
speculation it's much more about asking
you to keep your antennas up for
something completely orthogonal and
different so that's my goal today but
I'll put it in the context of the topic
here the implications in economics of AI
I started with the top 20 job categories
in the United States and I asked the
question
for at least 15 of the 20 do I believe
there's more than a 50% displacement of
current employment within some period of
time and I'll come back to that and the
answer was clearly yes and it's happened
before the yellow line is employment in
agriculture industrial employment is the
blue line it's starting to go a
different way
sorry and I wrote about it first when I
was mostly very fuzzy in 2014 and I said
we'll have great GDP growth great
productivity growth all the things
economists like to map matter and
increasing income disparity at a level
where it will render traditional
economics largely irrelevant capitalism
is by permission of democracy in my view
and when democracy doesn't work for most
people
we'll see Lord changes and I want you to
keep this idea of going from wind to a
hurricane or from a wave to a tsunami in
mind in in the next 10 or 20 years most
of the jobs that is well north of 50
percent we can speculate how much will
become replaceable even though they're
not yet replaced because diffusion takes
a while and this is much more
fundamental than even the notion of a
general purpose technology in my view so
let me start by a couple of areas and
I'll go through this very very quickly
this is company that john deere just
bought last year that reads fields if it
reads fields and a changes the nature of
agriculture and lead to every plant in a
millionaire plant field being treated
differently it completely up ends the
need for herbicides or insecticides this
company building assembly line robots
that's a large part of employment in
whether these companies work or not
somebody will work in this area in the
next 10 to 20 years then they're more
illustrative they're meant to be this
will succeed
Amazon course trying to do retail worker
last grocery stores other companies are
working on the same retail workers
subject to this strand janitors this
company is doing robots that sort of
clean good in this case grocery stores
evening cleaning without janitors this
company that replaces all of McDonald's
about 150 burgers in our capacity with
no workers everything from slicing fresh
onions to tomatoes to customizing the
hamburger even grinding the meat this is
delivery on the streets delivery workers
this is warehouse workers in and I'm not
trying to give you the details of any I
want to leave as much time for questions
as possible this is security guards
patrolling driverless cars that replace
taxi drivers and uber drivers truck
drivers these things are closer than
most people believe this will happen in
the next three years especially since
most of the truck driving happens on
freeways that's a simpler problem it's a
few years away customers sport wraps
being replaced with a I dialogue systems
and only that 10% of most difficult
cases being escalated to humans we can
come back to the role of humans but
human AI systems will be important but
it'll be 90% less humans even business
process automation trade finance
compliance filings all that sort of
backroom work in finance security
analysts for cyber security start
trading of course we know the yellow
line is the Cointreau
that doesn't need traders in fact the
statistic I saw Goldman Sachs in the
year 2000 had 600 traders they now have
two in this particular area 602 -
they'll be very typical this is forensic
accountants even legal workers law
should be done with an AI system because
it's a structured language in fact
there's only a certain number of laws in
only 7 million cases interpreting all
those laws but that's real estate or
employment law it is relatively simple
in this context to do and Yan can talk
about the progress in natural language
processing healthcare I'm very excited
about I see no reason to ever consult a
human being in medicine in the next 15
years after the next 15 years just no
reason to have a doctor radiologists
clearly this service is now being
offered to do radiology reach and this
is one of those important points
it isn't about more education because
the highest skilled jobs may be the
easiest to replace radiologists this
radiology reads are now being offered
for a dollar per read and it happens in
minutes not three days as happens with
an MRI scan today this company with a
$99 device you can buy on Amazon called
the live code device or of the watch
band for the Apple watch will
essentially build personal neural that
models tell you way more and understand
very more about your heart then a
cardiologist possibly can because it
considers hundreds of variables and this
is this this is now a $10 a month
service to monitor conditions like
atrial fibrillation I have to be careful
we are certain things I have to have
proved in certain aren't drug discovery
atom buys is one of those companies deep
genomics another Toronto company
discovering a new class of drugs there's
no
amount of effort with traditional drug
discovery that can keep up with this
scale because you're talking about 10 to
the 3 10 to the four orders of magnitude
improvement in the capability to
discover drugs this particular company
is not only interpreting your
ultrasounds cardiac MRI eltra sounds are
really hard you need specialized
technicians it replaces the technician
and the cardiologist who reach the
ultrasound this is my favorite
psychiatrists somebody was talking about
facial expressions this thinkin's he'll
predict when a bipolar episodes coming
on by just the data on your phone
milliseconds you take to respond to a
text message where you spend your time
at home when you get out of bed whether
you go to the dining room for dinner
without you ever opening the app
diagnosticians so healthcare it's hard
to see now there's interventional
medicine like surgery but even that is
becoming more roboticized
I wrote this the second piece I wrote in
2012 that was six years ago when things
were very fuzzy
the other piece speculates that almost
all of medicine will be without people
other than the human element of care
I actually got laughed at because three
years ago I suggested to the Dean of
Howard medical school that they ought to
changed their admissions criteria to be
the same as the USC film school because
they were selecting for IQ and they
needed to select for EQ and then there's
lots of clumsy stuff that's happening
that all just mentioned in passing
personal robots Alexa is the robot it's
a new interface still very clumsy I
don't consider it real yet agronomy you
don't need agronomists and you can do
much better and more often with every
plant
even food is being designed with machine
learning so this particular company
Hampton Creek has a Mayo you can buy at
Whole Foods or Lucky's or your favorite
Kroger's or your favorite local grocery
stores you buy just mail they have tens
of thousands of proteins characterized
with their properties that they use to
design new products that are designed
with machine learning this construction
robot can lay bricks six times faster
than a human can
laying bricks this is one of my
favorites I'm gonna this is a Boston
Dynamics robot let me see if I can click
on this oh no sorry
let me go back I'll skip that this robot
can do things humans can't this is a
helicopter that taught itself
aerial maneuvers things humans couldn't
possibly do because they can't respond
fast enough to the capabilities of a
current machine this is another one of
my favorites
machine learning used to teach judges
with higher accuracy when parole is
warranted because they can analyze
behavior better this is a mature company
that builds software that optimizes
software so you can optimize a website
without humans a be testing IT
operations translation of course robots
with gums link come back to this issue
of autonomous weapon systems and then
there's new domains that are not human
domains and you or these are all the
reasons I think economic life will
change so much Google search is now
significant component is starting to be
AI not traditional techniques even
coming up with algorithms in there's
this notion that somehow the creative
casts are for humans
Hempstead machines are designing for
video compression optimizing the power
consumption of data centers Google had a
data center they're the best optimize
data centers because power is a huge
cost human optimized data centers will
and a human might do really well with a
one or two percent improvement in power
consumption this machine learning
algorithm in already optimized data
center did twenty five to forty percent
depending upon how you measure it of
course
faces are being used for all kinds of
things the economist this is recent
cover from The Economist then the other
question can machines be creative in
there's no question mining machines can
be a lot more creative than human beings
goal was of course an example and that
was not even a lot of very creative data
science it was taking a couple of
existing techniques and putting him
together
but as judged by the human opponents the
machine had way more intuition than the
goal players that was the court from the
opponents human opponents that were
experts in go way more intuition not
intelligence more not more search space
this is another one of my favorites that
painting above was submitted to a system
to paint that painting in a different
style you can take any photograph or any
painting and paint it in a different
style
so painting this is maybe my most famous
thing this is I bought off haiku of
Amazon last week all three pieces on the
right bottom is a book on digital art
done by a machine on the left a book a
haiku done by a machine entirely you can
buy all three on Amazon and classical
music composed this is CD I bought by a
machine that passed the following test a
classical music professor objected to
the notion that a machine could design
so they mix three pieces six pieces from
Bach
self three pieces designed by sari six
pieces designed by the computer and six
pieces designed by this classical music
professor and an independent panel in a
blind test was asked to judge which was
human which was not interesting the
machine was judged as more complex and
more nuanced and obviously original ball
bark was judged as the music professor
and the algorithm what was judge to be
algorithms music was really the
professor so this hopefully answers this
question but there's way more this is
inventing new instruments by combining
the spectral qualities of existing
instruments to allow more tools for more
creative things and as the complexity
increases humans won't be able to
leverage them but machines well so
better music so let me talk about the
new dimensions of AI very roughly are is
that little yellow and red Lego block
thing in AI today because we have a few
components like well put together in
alphago what we will see is the ability
to build a Sydney Opera House out of
LEGO pieces as the numbers explored what
are some of these pieces and dinner
you'll hear more about these but gains I
won't go through what these are but just
to tell you that a lot more is possible
probabilistic programming
how do machines learn as fast as humans
do unsupervised learning reinforcement
learning that I won't go through any of
these because they're not enough time
I just want to convey the impression
there's a dozen new things that are
being experimented with and some will be
more valuable than others
even learning to learn was a recent
paper for the Google research so and
this is without the tools to turbocharge
this research and that's happening to
the number of the best data scientists
graduate students in the world going
into data science is one of the biggest
turbochargers
it's always about where the best PhD
students are going and this is where
they're going it's custom hardware being
designed to accelerate these experiments
it's much more data becoming available
it's about open source research
it's about tools made so everybody at
every level can start to play with this
and look at new applications and they
really help define the problem because I
don't believe in AI we've actually
defined the problem fully yet of course
quantum computing would be a
game-changer potentially it just met
with a company this morning saying we'll
specifically and narrowly address one
problem of AI learning so let me talk
about the potential impact I think the
traditional notion of labour and capital
will change very dramatically labor of
course will be devalued traditional
situations like more education won't
work when machines exceed human
capability the old correlation with new
technology creates new jobs new
opportunities which is much more
correlation than causation will die
because the assumptions have changed
enough in my view in fact it's not clear
whether even capital will be as
important as ideas so I call it an
economy of labour capital and ideas and
ideas are becoming way more important
it's not incidental that you see so many
new billionaires being minted on
individual ideas it has changed the
relationship between labor and capital
very quickly and things like
education and if everybody can live like
a king because if I'm right and
productivity goes through the roof over
50 years and and I'd like to emphasize
timing it very hard to predict so it's
all speculation I couldn't tell you what
that's 20 years or 50 where do you find
meaning life I think that an income
disparity would be the biggest issue we
will have lots of possibilities you know
I always say Kickstarter's an indicator
of new jobs being created in the
traditional economic sense or America's
Got Talent if you want to call that a
job or x-games or pick your favorite
maybe there's an emotional role for
humans even if he machines do emotion
better than humans maybe there's a role
let me switch to a different topic
something much more immediate and those
of you interested I wrote a blog on
medium last night I think AI changes
national defense national security and
geopolitics very very dramatically that
may disrupt trust which may disrupt the
economy in very unusual ways that we
haven't thought about yet and that we
should there's a lot of talk of sentient
AI and AI going rogue I think this is a
order magnitude bigger problem in the
next decade and if Putin had these tools
just hacking emails would be trivial
compared to everything else you can do
to cause disruption those of you
interested there's this blog was just
posted last night I think it's the
equivalent of a nation-state or a
criminal entity being able to be the
only ones with the atomic bomb and we
knew what we know what happened when we
exploded the bomb in Hiroshima there
were very little choice choice for the
Japanese that situation can happen in a
much worse way
I also want to just leave a little sense
this is progress
in image recognition and the line at the
bottom is the error rate for humans and
you can see systems have gotten much
better what I'm most interested in is
comprehension
this is comprehension in on a children's
book and you can see where this is going
and the dinner panel would talk about it
much more authoritative Leon where it
can go but you can imagine it exceeding
human competence very quickly we can do
not believe in change in 85 I had these
discussions and I was told can't imagine
a PC in every home I think that's right
you can only imagine a thousand PCs in
every home today 1990 I was actually
laughed at for having my email on my
business card in 1982 but by 1990
grandma was with email and wasn't
imaginable 1995 AT&amp;amp;T told me they would
never adapt never adapt tcp/ip when we
started a company called Juniper because
of that by the way juniper was the
highest ever venture returned a $2,500
multiple we kleiner perkins where I was
then made seven billion in profit on a
five million dollar investment but I you
can go on and on there's all these
assumptions so let me stop there and
open it up to questions
if you know that I tried to set high
expectations for your talk and you
exceeded them that was really that was
really splendid um
I am I am sympathetic to the basic
thrust of your talk in particular the
thrusts that went to large-scale labour
replacement here's here's a fact I think
it's a fact that puzzles me I I've
spoken to a note I've tried to do this a
little bit myself and I've spoken to a
number of labor economists and in the
spirit of demonstrating what you are
saying I looked at data on occupations
and my idea was that we would see now
more destruction of occupations than
we've seen traditionally so my idea was
if you sort of said what fraction of the
occupations shrink by what fraction of
the people are in occupations that
shrink by more than a third over a
five-year period I expected there that
those numbers would be higher now than
they have been through most of time I've
not been successful when basically I
believe what you said and I was trying
to torture the data to demonstrate what
I believed I have not and I've asked
others you can't look at data on
occupations and find a higher rate of
occupational churn than the kind of
historical norm which is pretty high you
know it turns out that there used to be
huge numbers of people typing things
because there didn't exist Xerox
machines and so so this idea of a new
faster rate so I guess my question would
be what's you mean you live it and you
see
but I think my method is not an
unreasonable one and I think it doesn't
bear out this belief of yours which I'm
inclined to share and we kind of believe
in empirical science so I guess I'd be
interested in your reaction to that
puzzle so I've seen the argument I've
heard the argument I don't buy it
what what you call causality is really
an extrapolation of the past and it
works as long as that chain that
extrapolation is unimportant the only
time it's important is when radical
change happens when assumptions change
this field is so new it can't possibly
show up in the data a facebook AI
research Jana and I were talking last
night was started three and a half years
ago and this field didn't exist the
turbochargers aren't there they haven't
reached the level of maturity to go
through the five iterations of any
technology it takes to get to the level
where it can hardly deploy this we will
prove there these jobs are replaceable
not that they replace so I'm saying so
here's the fair so just show me just
make it me make sure I got it you're
saying who knows whether the internet
was bigger than the destruction of
agriculture maybe it was maybe it wasn't
but you're very confident that AI is
truly transformative relative to
everything before and it hasn't been
going for 20 years so there's nothing to
look at and you probably say that if 10
years from now I was able to do some
occupation calculation and found that
there hadn't been more occupation
destruction whether there was new
creation or not if there hadn't been
more occupation destruction over the
next 10 years than there had been
historically then you'd probably say
you'd gotten something wrong or maybe
you just right the time and I'd go I'd
agree with that I'd go a little bit
further in the next
I want to prove that off the top 20
categories most become the majority of
the jobs become replaceable because I
think the model you'll see is economic
deployment whenever one of these
technologies can cut the labor content
in half if UnitedHealthcare can take
10,000 of its claims processing experts
and replace them with AI system plus
5,000 that's when these technologies
will get deployed because there's a
barrier to change in large institutions
then once you get to that 10,000 goes to
5,000 you'll see annual increases
reductions at a certain right so I'm
saying what we should be watching for is
in the fringes because all systems
change at the edges not at the center
and there it doesn't show up in
historical data because it's such a
small point just the change from an
industrial economy to a service economy
is a much larger change which is still
going on then this technology change
would into it and I think it'll get
white lost in the noise so one has to
fundamentally look at what's going on in
weird exponential male 8 so you're doing
more of a linear extrapolation I'm
taught saying this is an exponential
phenomena yes
thank you so on the last point you made
regarding these barriers to shifting I'm
wondering if one of the implications of
that is that companies like I have ten
thousand claims processors I'm gonna
need something that is going to mix
between before I could shift does that
suggest or do you think it suggests that
a lot of the change is gonna come from
entrants who are early on adopting these
new technologies disrupting business and
making incumbents go out of business
or do you think that accumbens will be
able to adopt despite these barriers to
adoption so my experience with
technology has been large institutions
almost never in a wake in fact I went
through the exercise of a separate paper
I'm doing on finding an innovation where
innovation comes from in the last 25
years I couldn't find one material
innovation that came from a company this
group would consider relevant but at GE
or Siemens or Bank of America or IBM
they're largely relevant and in our
world non technology companies with
technology veneers and I'm happy to go
into the detailed discussion of that but
let me just put it the following way did
Volkswagen or General Motors innovate
cars or did Tesla and then vamo which
wasn't in the business and by the way
that change because of its if you'll
follow it through will likely replace
public transportation my view public
transportation will be replaced it'll be
a dollar to go from anywhere in the city
to anywhere else point to point or
dispatch service that's public
transportation I think that's the model
we'll end up with not that even the
current automotive model and the
automotive industry will completely
change in my view did Walmart change
retail or Amazon did Boeing in lockheed
changed space or space
did I could go on and on
did NBC or CBS change media or YouTube
and Twitter and Facebook so it's hard to
think of a large innovation the answer
to your question a few will adapt it
later though the macro characteristic
makes sense from an economic sense the
micro the cost to an individual making
that micro decision in a company is too
high if they're wrong and innovation
depends on ability and willingness to
fail and because of that big companies
can never lead that's a whole long
discussion so I only look at non
institutional approaches to change as
opposed to any kind of institutional
approach and Trump was an example you
know I know John Podesta well he ran the
campaign like a political expert would
and there was this other thing
Twitter mainly that was used to change
all the assumptions of a traditional
campaign so yes some will adapt it a
little bit later I think the bigger
companies are getting better at
following the startups more and giving
more credibility now and believing
there's massive destruction John Deere
bought this company because they
believed they could do more with this
informing then then they could without
it I'm sorry I'll try and go a little
bit faster because I can go on on any of
these topics for a long time two
occupations to watch one is translation
and the other is transcription where we
already have really quite advanced
capabilities but but in my view
initially you're going to see employment
in those areas increase because the
computerized translation and
transcription can be first run that the
human then polishes so we end up with
lower prices more translation more
transcription being done in the long run
we think that they would take over
pretty much completely but for the
short-term future you would expect to
see this happen now we can watch the
data for the next 20 years and see what
happens to translate exactly right and
in our AI lingo we'd say the humans are
training the AI to get better enough to
supersede them yes would you mind
telling me one thing just one thing that
you think people really will be able to
do better than machines forever about it
I thought the emotional connection would
be the most important variable but some
of the research shows that patients are
much more honest with machines than with
doctors they disclose more data how much
have you been drinking way more accurate
data when a machine asked and when a
doctor ass look it's possible that an AI
machine can write music then we would
not be able to recognize from the real
Mozart but before Mozart there was no
Mozart will a machine be able to create
not a fake of motor but something that
will be as new as Mozart was to music
Indians and I very little doubt the
answer is yes what I don't know is when
okay almost and that's why I had that
example of synthesizing a new instrument
because allow a range of capability a
set of tools for the machine to use that
may be hard fun and the more complexity
the more you can do the purpose of music
is really to resonate with the human
brain I actually believe and I've seen
startup started trying to compose music
for each person's individual brain not
for seven billion people because each of
our brains is wired differently we might
respond differently and so the ideal
song for us may be a little different
than a generic song yes
oh okay hi Eric hi so look you're
talking I want to flesh out one of the
have you flesh I a little bit at the
point about replace a bowl but not
replaced and you invest not just in
technologies but business models so you
know that it takes a while for the
companies the ecosystem the customers to
adapt so can you just walk through a
little bit more what you see the
timeline let's take one of the examples
like you showed that killer robot the
one that kills the plants not the humans
and and you said John Deere bought it
it's working now how do you see the time
line working for that to be adopted by
say a majority of farmers in the United
States yeah I'm glad you brought that up
so you do this fairly narrowly because
farmers are conservative they generally
have debt outstanding and they can't
afford a bad crop season they go under
will first to introduce this in so we
did this first in lettuce which is a
small crop we've done hundreds of
thousands of acres of fields but it's a
very tiny business wouldn't show up in
any numbers next thing we're doing is
not is reading in cotton why because
herbicide resistance in cotton is
growing very rapidly and so there's an
urgent need beyond just cost savings
after cotton will do corn lettuce very
easy to do because there's three
thousand dollars of economic value per
acre per year
cotton is less corn is even less and as
the technology gets better so there's a
natural cycle so if you imagine and if
you read my medicine paper I imagine a
new version of a technology in a
particular area every three years as the
development cycle for a new capability
and so if you take seven doublings seven
of these improvements you sort of get to
a timeline see if it's seven times three
20 years is a rough estimate and I used
in my paper on medicine I used the
analogy my first cell phone was about
the size of a sewing machine that took
up the whole passenger side
that was version zero and then there was
this brick that Motorola iconic brick
and then there was the flip phone and
then there was the Motorola StarTAC and
then there was the blackberry and then
the iPhone you walked through these
generations and say that's a reasonable
proxy that's why I call everything I say
speculation not prediction but that's
sort of my I think I heard the number
twenty years in there is that sort of
yeah I sort of say seven cycles of
innovation before it gets good enough
okay so I share your views that we
humans will probably become less
efficient at every task at every job
compared to machines or artificial
intelligence the way I like to think
about it will work if you want to work
not if we need to work right and I guess
that includes economics and venture
capitalism and so on
at some point now what interventions do
you see that we as humanity can engage
in to ensure that we will let's say not
be out-compete it and basically
disappear from earth yeah well I don't
know the answer to that imagine the
following if full CAPTA average income
was $300,000 in this country how you'd
look at the question of redistribution
but that's minimum income whether it's
some sort of structure that doesn't lose
the incentive to work there's lots of
these sort of issues I can come up with
many Universal basic income or other
mechanisms that preserve the incentive
to work the transition is hard to
predict but you don't get to 300,000
average income and I use average not
median because it will be very lopsided
how we do it and what influence
democracy has on it because capital is
doesn't work without Democratic
permission that's the that's the piece
that's so hard to predict last question
yes inequality so going back to you know
Ricardo in 1810
that we know the fixed factor earns the
rent so to the extent that inequality
growth there must be some fixed factor
to earn the rents and whether it's a
owning artificial intelligence
algorithms or datasets or whatever is a
fixed factor or something that's
copyable and super competitive is the
result of policy choices we make and so
so I find it I just don't even know how
we could predict what the result of AI
and inequalities gonna be unless we have
some sort of insight into you know if
you look at say agriculture you so does
the graph of the enormous productivity
improvements agriculture in the early
20th century and you know the owners of
the tractors in the farmland didn't
become our major business Titans right
just the returns to dye agriculture and
and they they went to zero because the
super competitive industry and one can
imagine the same thing happening with a
I would becomes commoditized we have a
massive productivity improvement and the
returns all go to say people making
compliments or people who have high
income elasticity of demand to make
custom cabinets or whatever so as I I
just find this sort of assumption that
the return on capital in a competitive
industry will remain where it is today
in a non competitive industry it's it's
just an odd assumption to make about
what's gonna happen in the future look
it's very hard to speck like there is
very asymmetric development going on by
and large in the u.s. most AI research
is open source in parts of the world it
is not in fact the amount of for example
Chinese investment in AI in Silicon
Valley is going through the roof either
directly or surreptitiously we see this
all the time and that's where the
asymmetric what's yours is ours and
what's mine is mine kind of approach to
life worries me there's another aspect
of it that is different than other
technologies nuclear treaties work
because there was been
viability you could verify a nuclear
explosion there was no way for North
Korea to hide an explosion in AI you may
not have verifiability most technologies
become visible when they come to market
but if you have no notion of what's
behind the screen which is likely to be
the case with AI it creates a whole set
of other problems both in regulation and
in because the verifiability and and all
that thank you all very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
