speaker Bo a waltz who is a leader and
has held many hats in high-performance
computing systems and graphics companies
he is currently the president of d-wave
international the world's first
commercial quantum computing company
prior to this he was a chairman CEO or
president of perceptive pixel the
touch-sensitive display company computer
graphics pioneers Silicon Graphics and
Cray research the first supercomputing
company Bob began his management career
at the prestigious Los Alamos National
Labs and the head of its and he was the
head of its computing and communications
division he is involved in various
industry organizations and was appointed
to the president's Information
Technology Advisory Committee by
President Clinton and Bush he has also
served on the boards of several public
and private companies for computing
students in the audience
bowhead Stan ullam as advisor and had
several interactions with Feynman so
today is going to demystify quantum
computing for us certainly talk about it
maybe we will try to find out which
universe were really operating in so
thanks so much it's it's great to be
here my good friend Jeff Harris is one
of your trustees Jeff is in the back of
the room and we talked about a month ago
and he said that you all were doing this
and and it might be interesting though
we're not exactly down the line of AI
yet
but to learn a little bit about this
different technology so we'll try to
take you on kind of a tour an
introduction to quantum computing and
then sort of the way d-wave is has been
approaching it so how many of you have
used a quantum computer
how many of you will use a quantum
computer in your lifetime I think you
should probably almost all raise your
hands because I think it's gonna be be
part of where we're going whether d-wave
is going to be like UNIVAC who's heard
of UNIVAC they were an early computer
company or whether we're going to be
more like IBM or someone and sustain it
is yet to be determined but that's it's
very early days than it sort of is like
it must have been in 1955 or something
in the traditional computing industry
and so you know this is a an industry
that's been building or an ideas that
have been building on people whose names
you've known anybody ever heard of
Boltzmann yeah I bet all of you have
well he he laid some of the foundation
for this and interestingly enough how
many of you heard of his brother
restricted Boltzmann sir so in fact you
know our machines may be able to be used
or mapped onto a quantum version of a
restricted Boltzmann approach and so
we'll just look at that a little bit and
who is the most famous Swiss patent
clerk ever Albert Einstein and of course
he in 2000 not 2000 1905 postulated in
fact that you know light could be
photons we came up kind of with what we
today call photonics photons and that
was part of the idea here behind what
we're doing and then there was another
German fellow who I don't know maybe he
wasn't too confident or something he was
uncertain about things who was that
Heisenberg and the uncertainty principle
and then following that there was
another fellow who kept losing his cat
who was that Schrodinger and his cat was
it in the Box was not in the box if it
was in the Box was alive or was a dead
well let's open the box and see and that
sort of laid the foundation again for
some of the things that we'll actually
talk about even even a silly as it would
be and then there was this Hungarian guy
in 1932 who wrote a book that sort of
formed the mathematical basis of quantum
mechanics
we know what today you know what his
name was john von neumann yeah isn't
that astounding in a way and his name
will come back and then later on or
about the same time Einstein said you
know I don't know about this quantum
stuff or some parts of it this spooky
action at a distance I don't really
believe it and today we call that
entanglement and it's been shown that
things can be come entangled over
distances now a little over a kilometer
the folks at Delft University showed
that so so spooky action at a distance
in fact is something that we use in our
computers though in our case the
distances are quite small so we'll talk
about that and then you know along came
some world wars and that sort of stuff
and some of the theory behind all this
kind of quit for a while and john von
neumann and others went to Los Alamos
during the Manhattan Project and Richard
Feynman was a young student there and
Fermi was there and all kinds of these
brilliant folks were there and they kind
of got to working on other projects for
a while but then as that moved along and
you know in transistors were invented
and then Gordon Moore wrote his famous
paper
how long ago 50 years ago when he wrote
that and it was published in a magazine
how many of you have ever read a
magazine that you know they were paper
they were mailed to you and it first
came out in this magazine and that was
50 years ago and then for 50 years we've
been trying actually we've been building
computers that are doing quantum things
but we fight against letting them do the
quantum things because in traditional
computers quantum things will cause bits
to flip from a zero to a one
they'll cause current leakage so we sort
of have been building anti quantum
computers and fortunately for us there
were some young folks just like
yourselves who 17 years ago had taken
they were PhD physics candidates at the
University of British Columbia and they
had taken a class on entrepreneurship
and said let's start a business just
sound familiar max and and and we'll get
to that part of the story in a second
but it was
sort of the same story of let's start a
business what should we do quantum stuff
and then what and then so this is kind
of the rest of the rest of that story
and which leads us then to richard
fineman again who in 1982 said that you
know it looks like you could build a
computer using quantum effects he
postulated that in 1982 and in 1983 I
had the good fortune I was at Los Alamos
and was running computing there and we
had a big celebration for the 40th
anniversary of Los Alamos of the
Manhattan Project and as you may not be
able to see here the first speaker the
keynote speaker was Richard Fineman and
Jeff you'll notice who was the host it
was our friend Don Kerr Richard Feynman
was the first speaker and his talk was
tiny computers obeying quantum
mechanical laws in 1983 and a couple of
days later after this seminar was over
Fineman and Edward Teller and Stan ulam
and Robby and Hans bethe and others
wanted to see what computing was like at
Los Alamos now 40 years later compared
to using the calculating machines that
they had had during the time so I'm
taking them around and at the time we
were the largest scientific computing
facility in the world we had five craze
which is about the equivalent compute
power as the phones on this table today
but at the time it was the largest
computing center in the world and so
I'll always remember Fineman standing
there you know and we were showing them
these things and he said and I can't do
his accent very well or at all but he
said you know young man some day all of
these big cray computers are going to be
replaced by by quantum computers and I
said something really remarkable I'm
sure like cool you know Wow or something
like that so so that in 1983 was the
first time I at this talk had ever heard
about them and here we are now you know
30-some years later and in fact they're
starting to be able to maybe do
something useful and I'll use the word
probably quite a bit because it is a
problem
ballistic word world that we live in and
so basically what our machines are are
rather than fighting quantum mechanics
we try to take advantage of it and
quantum mechanics you know we live in a
quantum mechanical world computers today
that you're using or the quantum
mechanical stuff is going on in there
but we fight it we fought against it for
the last 50 or 60 years and we try to
take advantage of it in at least an
early or a simple way to do that and so
maybe just a quick reintroduction to the
world of computing and sort of how it's
different so the world that we come from
or that we're familiar with is one which
is a binary world the bits in the world
that we use are a 0 or a 1 and they
shouldn't be both and those bits if my
fingers represented 10 bits those bits
are all independent and unique and if
we're doing something on a transistor
and we hit a barrier on a transistor we
have to put more energy in to climb over
the barrier or if we're doing a search
and we're in a valley we have to do more
computing to climb the hill to look over
the side to see what's on the other side
so that's that's how we face barriers in
that world and in our world we use the
principle of superposition where we
start our quantum bits or qubits we'll
call them
we are qubits at the start are a 0 and 2
or a 1 and both simultaneously so we use
superconducting circuits that we'll show
you in a minute
and they're clearly in superposition and
then and at the end of the calculation
our qubits settle out to the low energy
state for the entire configuration and
they will become 0 or a 1 and that's
what we read out as part of the solution
and then entanglement has been
demonstrated on our machines across I'll
show you what our unit cells look like
and and these are not physics machines
but we're trying to build actual
computers so when you start trying to
measure this stuff on a broad scale you
disrupt the computing and it turns into
a big physics experiment but Google and
others have demonstrated entanglement at
at our unit cell level and then probably
across 40 of our qubits or so it's not
that others aren't entangled as well but
but that's all
it's been measured so far and the idea
behind entanglement is that rather than
you remember these 10 unique bits that
we had before if we can cause them to
become entangled then we can make moves
in a coordinated way across this
landscape that we're going to describe
so ours are clearly using entanglement
and then the last one and the one when
we talk about it our architecture in a
second that's probably the easiest to
think about is when we hit a barrier we
don't have to put more energy in to
climb to the top and look over the side
rather we use quantum tunneling and if
there's a lower energy State on the
other side of this barrier this mountain
range if you will in fact quantum
tunneling will take us to that lower
energy State and so that one is again
probably going to be the easiest to
visualize and if this works look at that
graphic look at that did you see that
moving to a lower energy State and the
ideas then for all of this and I'll just
hit this real quickly will give you
copies of the presentation if you want
but a little bit of the sort of the
theoretical background behind this and
by the way if you have questions as we
go along please ask we'll try to save a
few minutes toward the end as well but
in 1984 David Deutsch took the idea that
Fineman had then been talking about for
a couple of years and said you know
maybe you really could build one of
these things and then they and it was a
sort of a the idea was a universal
quantum computer what was really being
espoused one that could solve many
different types of problems and then
Deutsch himself and others started
writing algorithms theoretical
algorithms or maybe the algorithms were
real but the it was a theoretical
computer they were writing the
algorithms for and the most famous one
is Peter shores and that's the one which
promises that if you had one of these
theoretical Universal quantum computers
you could probably factor any arbitrary
number and then what would that let you
do probably break any and all codes that
had ever existed at least that were
encrypted using that sort of mechanism
so that's either a great thing or a
horrible thing depending which side of
the fence you're on to our knowledge no
one runs Shores out it doesn't run on
our computer and
doesn't run on any others but that's a
thing that you'll read about or hear
about most both the good side and the
bad side of these theoretical quantum
computers nobody can do it yet so these
were sort of this got a lot of impetus
or more thinking behind quantum
computing and then that led to people
looking at all kinds of different ways
to be able to create qubits or quantum
bits and this is an article that was in
science a couple of months ago and I'll
just it's in the in the packet for your
reference but it shows multiple ways
that people have been attacking building
qubits we've been using superconducting
circuits some folks at the Air Force
Research Lab over in Rome are using a
different approach IBM has a little
different approach and etc etc so again
very early days how to build qubits and
then the way that you connect the qubits
is sort of the next question so it's as
in a traditional computer I'm kind of
missing something here but in a
traditional computer you know you have
the the physical devices that you're
going to build a machine from and then
you assemble those into gates and into
arrays and then you put those pieces
together into an architecture whether it
be a GPU type architecture or a
general-purpose architecture in our case
the qubits are the basic thing that the
building block and then the architecture
is how you put them together and the
universal I mean I'll try this one more
time know some of those blobs had names
on them and representing different
architectural approaches to quantum
computing so one of the blobs you pick
which one it says topological and that's
an approach that Microsoft is following
that's probably they're waiting upon the
discovery of a non-abelian anyons
which is still maybe out there so that
you know so that's an approach that's
probably 20 years away if can be another
of those blobs represents the approach
that IBM is taking with a universal or a
gate model architecture iBM has a five
qubit machine that you can access on the
web today if you get a Peru
before you can apply for it and try it
we've done that and lots of folks have
they say it's probably 10 years or so
away from being able to be a product and
then with order of magnitude 50 cubits
and then d-wave is one of those other
blobs there and what we've done has
taken this other approach of an
annealing type of an approach a more an
analogue type of computer which was
easier to build at the start but more
special-purpose not general purpose so
the ideas for and this is a couple of
slides this is the the IBM press
announcement from about a year ago not
quite a year ago about people being able
to access their machine and they talked
about it being available in the next
decade and then Microsoft this was an
article from science or some nature or
science Scientific American about theirs
and there's my guess is probably quite a
long ways away but the point to all this
is it's early days here early days
different types of qubits different
types of architectures will enable
different types of algorithms to be
created and run and in second we'll try
to link this back to what does all this
have to do with artificial intelligence
or machine learning the answer is so far
not much but I think the promise is
there so maybe now switching a little
bit to d-wave itself and this first type
of quantum computer that's out there the
ideas go back in the late 90s some folks
that in Tokyo Institute of Technology
and another group in Europe and then
Eddie Farhi and folks at MIT sort of
said you know if you could build certain
types of qubits maybe you could hook
them together and actually build an
annealing type of quantum computer and
so these were the ideas that came along
this is far he's paper and there was
another one from some folks at yulish in
Germany and Delft and as an approach to
be able to to start working on quantum
computing and this was about the same
time that these two young PhD physics
graduate students were taking this
entrepreneurship class and they said
let's start a business and that was a
business it became d-wave and first they
said okay we've got business going
what should we do this will sound real
familiar let's write some patents and
aggregate some patents and we'll become
rich doing that
well I've hadn't been in other you know
really big businesses where we thought
we had huge value in our patent
portfolio and we were sure of it and
sometimes you do but not always so after
a few years they said ok well that's a
great idea but now let's see what else
we can do with some of this IP we have
and at about the same time this is one
of those serendipitous things I suppose
that happened was that the US government
had had been investing and having TRW
and later North Grumman building
superconducting circuits for them and
TRW decided they were kind of at the end
of that road and they were getting
acquired and so they got rid of the
group who was building these
superconducting circuits and the
superconducting circuit people met these
two other guys and they said you know we
think we could build a quantum computer
but we don't know how and the TRW guy
said well we know how to build what we
think could be qubits you know let's try
to work together and see and so that in
fact then after a few years led to them
starting to work towards seeing if they
could build a quantum computer and in
fact after a while they were able to and
the machines have been available for
about five or six years Lockheed Martin
was the first customer
they bought a system that had 128 qubits
to start they've upgraded to 500 and a
thousand and we're now up to 2,000 cubic
machines and I think I'll probably
upgrade it to 2,000 in the next year or
so and their application is basically
seeing software validation and
verification but doing it in a different
way instead of trying to prove program
correctness that all of the sensors and
controls and things on an aircraft all
work together the computers and the
networks all work together with army in
a traditional computer you have inputs
and then you have a simulation and then
you get answers out and that's how it
runs inputs run the program you get
answers with our machine if you know any
two of those three big chunks you can
kind of figure out the third so what
Lockheed said was you know it
create a simulation of this aircraft and
systems and controls and we'll give it a
bad answer and run the d-wave machine
backwards let's see if there are any
inputs which then would have caused this
bad answer so as an answer they would
have said okay pilot pulls back on the
stick and the airplane goes down very
bad and so yeah so let's postulate that
bad answer that anomalous answer and run
the program backwards and see if there
are any inputs which would have caused
that bad answer
and in fact in doing that after a short
period of time they've demonstrated that
they in fact they benchmarked it against
problems they'd had on fighter aircraft
and found some of the same problems in a
short period of time that it had taken
them six months I think to find using
another the older tried-and-true
mechanism they had so that gave them
Hart and hope and that machine is
actually at the University of Southern
California it's housed there and USC
runs it for themselves in Lockheed and H
have about half of it USC does sort of
performance characterization
optimization work and physics
characterizations Google became the
second customer and they bought their
first machine about three and a half
years ago it had 500 cubits they
upgraded it to a thousand cubits and we
haven't announced this yet so it asked
you to not do that but they're headed
for 2,000 cubits you're shortly and then
Los Alamos National Lab became our third
customer a little over a year ago with a
thousand cubic machine and then our
fourth customer we just announced is a
small company called temporal defense
systems working on cyber security
problems for unnamed
people and so that's that's you know
this little business these are super
computer class machines they sell for
about ten million dollars each of course
you can lease them if you want to break
those payments into yearly or monthly
payments we're glad to talk to you about
that but it but they are they're you
know super computer class machines and
the way they work is or at least a way
to think about how they work is if you
have a problem that you can map onto an
energy landscape very that's I love the
way you use your hands so if you have a
problem you can map on to an energy
landscape what this machine does is
natively or naturally it sinks to a
lower energies its lowest energy
solution and it finds the lowest Valley
or valleys in that energy landscape
probably it's also probabilistic so it's
not guaranteed that you're getting the
best answer so you don't run it once
it's not a deterministic machine you run
it many times and get a sampling of
answers or a distribution of answers
back which again is going to come back
to sound like some of the things that
some of you do there is there is an
annealing schedule exactly so which
which at the start so maybe a word about
annealing so basically what what we do
with this machine is that we'll set it
up in a superposition state and you
program you give basically waits for the
qubits and the strengths of interactions
between qubits and doing that you can
build this this landscape and then we go
through an annealing cycle where we
excite it a little bit and then let it
settle out into a low energy state and
that's like annealing at the low energy
state then is we where the metal if you
were doing real real annealing the metal
has hardened so we let it harden and
then we read out what the qubits are and
then we go through that cycle again and
again and again and we can do five to
ten thousand of those complete cycles a
second and each time it goes through one
of those cycles it doesn't add a number
it doesn't subtract but it rather seeks
this low energy solution and ends up in
that low energy solution and it searches
through a potential solution space of
two to the however many qubits you have
so we now have systems that have two
thousand cubits so we're searching a
solution a potential solution space of 2
2 mm that's a pretty big number and and
it's you know it's kind of a sparse set
of salut
typically but that's what it's doing
it's really looking through this huge
solution set and then it will give you a
sample of answers back and so if and
it's also dependent on the problem so if
the problem that you have the energy
landscape is like the Alps so very steep
skinny mountain ranges and somewhere at
interlaken a low valley or something and
you run it a hundred times you know you
might get ninety one of the answers will
be at interlaken and then some will be a
couple of other places and there will be
some crazy ones but if the energy
landscape is the Sahara Desert which is
flat where the highest elevation is a
grain of sand you're going to get
answers all over the place so again
quite different than the deterministic
world that we've come from but that's
the way to think about the way this
machine works and so the little
challenge is it's real simple to use
there's one instruction so it's it's you
know this is a really really really
reduced instruction set computer it's
also a very very very long instruction
word computer because in that one
instruction you give all of the values
to specify your problem but the little
challenge is how do you map real-world
problems into this sort of a thing and
so what it looks like it's good for is
certain classes of optimization problems
may be machine learning that Google and
we are doing a little bit of work on and
then Monte Carlo are sampling sorts of
applications and so just quickly what
it's not is it's not like anything
you've ever done before unless you grew
up in the 40s and did analog program to
analog computers that would be the 1940s
not the 1840s and here is a traditional
intel 64-bit processor and over on the
far right as ours we don't do any
floating-point operations so we do zero
flops and the precision is four or five
bits so when you're specifying this
energy landscape there's not a lot of
dimensionality to it which is a
challenge today and we do about 10,000
instructions a second but each of those
instructions solves this complicated
energy landscape and there is only you
know not 500 instructions you have to
learn this one it's really easy to learn
but the challenge again is putting stuff
on to it machine runs it near absolute
zero as we'll see in a second and it's
and it's really a chip I'll show you the
chip in just a second and it it's
superconducting consumes no electricity
virtually we're up to about two thousand
cubits today and it really must be like
it was in the 1950s or something like
that in traditional computing it's very
early days and it's a place for pioneers
but if you get an algorithm to run
you'll probably be the first person in
the world to ever have run on a quantum
computer to run that algorithm on a
quantum computer so just a couple of
things I'm going to show you two things
real quickly that and these are from
Google so these are now three and a half
years ago so Google gave us a set of
benchmarks these are random optimization
benchmarks that they wanted us to run
and to see how our machine would do and
so this is a timing chart so going down
is better down the chart is better and
the problems range from very small up to
larger as measured in qubits here and so
these are discrete combinatorial
optimization benchmarks and they had us
run them and then they ran them on IBM
SEAPLEX and Tabu and some other
optimization software and they're d-wave
line is the red line and it's sort of
uncharacteristic to what we're used to
and that no matter the problem size it
does about you know five to ten thousand
instructions a second so it's flat no
matter the problem size and the other
lines are more characteristic of what
we've seen in high-performance computing
for many years and at the for the
smaller problems the d-wave machine was
a you know a factor of a hundred slower
but as the problems got larger it was
about ten thousand times faster and
Google said oh wow you know maybe if we
could this is no guarantee of success
but if we could map problems on to it
there at least is the potential that it
might be able to perform and then
secondly they said okay let's now see if
we can map if we can teach the thing to
be able to recognize a car out of this
set of training images so they and we
worked on this for six months to turn
this optimization engine into something
that could
classify cars and it turned out that at
the end of that six months by about six
people so a lot of work by hand
in fact the d-wave machine was able to
recognize cars correctly out of this set
of training images about ninety four
percent of the time compared to eighty
four percent of the algorithm they were
comparing us to on the traditional
machine which was great but more
importantly for them was when they took
the classifiers from the d-wave machine
and put him back on the traditional
machines it only used about one third of
the CPU cycles and what was driving the
problem the program at the time was
Google glass who have a battery operated
computer and if you can save two thirds
of the CPU cycles you that's the big
thing so that was actually more
interesting to them than getting a
little better at it so they said you
know gee it looks like it might have
performance potential and then secondly
with a lot of work it looks like we can
map a machine learning problem on to it
and so it has promise and so let's get
get go on and see if it could work and
so that led them to get it and then as
they learned more about it so this is
now a result from a year and a couple of
months ago they said you know let's look
at another problem and put it on the
d-wave machine and this one is a really
rugged energy landscape and they ran
that against simulated annealing which
is same sort of approach running on a
traditional computer simulating what the
d-wave would do and that one turned out
to be about 100 million times faster
it's a really little corner case it's
not a fair comparison it's all of those
things but you should read the paper
because again it gave them I think more
heart that at least the direction that
we're going at some point if it becomes
a little more generalized there is
performance potential or that's a pretty
big number too and the way that we've
been able to move forward is it in rough
numbers so this isn't Moore's Law but
it's gonna sound pretty familiar where
every 18 to 24 months we've roughly been
able to double the number of qubits so
from 128 qubits which was the first
commercial machine to 512 a thousand and
now two thousand qubit machines are out
there and we expect
you know in two or three years from now
to probably have a four or five thousand
cubit machine and then there's a path to
about ten thousand sort of in the same
packaging so looking beyond that then
this is what the this is actually 2d
wave machines the new one is called a
2000 Q and the machine itself is a chip
but it comes in this big box which has
some racks in front and the racks are
cooling and equipment to interface it to
the outside world if you open that big
box which is about ten feet by ten feet
by ten feet high it's mostly open open
space and it's big enough so that in
these early days you can have three
people in there at the same time working
on the machine and if you open the door
and stepped in you'd see this big can
that's about that tall and about that
big around and inside that big canister
are other canisters and you take them
off one by one it's sort of like though
the Russian dolls that stack one inside
the other and inside each of those
layers each of those containers is a
gold disc that they connect to and you
can see the temperature going down and
so this isn't the Terminator brain but
rather like the Terminator arm is what
some people have called it you can see
where it gets colder as we go down so
it's actually in that big box it's room
temperature inside and then liquid
nitrogen temperature at the top of the
Terminator arm and then we're running at
about 12 to 15 Mille Kelvin at the
bottom where the processor is it's
probably the coldest at least the
coldest known spot in the universe and
sometimes we get into debates about
negative temperature and stuff which you
know may or may not exist but for the
known universe this is it's pretty cool
and we've been able to we've done a lot
of work in trying to make them reliable
and in fact we have systems in the field
that have run now for about 22 months
without fail you're running at that
temperature we have some maintenance
that we do on them from time to time
again it consumes no power since it's
superconducting and that is the quantum
computer it's a chip it's the size of
your thumbnail and this one is what the
next picture
is even breaks that day if you look at
this picture you would see little can
you see little squares on the on the
chip itself so it's about the size of
your thumbnail and then we build it like
we do in other parts of the computing
industry by creating unit cells and
replicating those side-by-side so in
this case there are six array of 16 by
16 by 8 which if we multiply all that
together should give some number you've
heard of before but each of those unit
cells looks like this
so this we've taken one of them apart
and in red are the qubits and the qubits
are really superconducting circuits made
of niobium and there are in this picture
four horizontal ones and four vertical
ones we've outlined two of them and so
for each of those qubits to program it
you give a weight or sort of a value to
the qubit and then you can specify the
strengths of the interactions between
qubits there are couplers between the
qubits so a qubit can have an influence
on its nearest neighbors more or less
and then also on the adjacent qubits off
cell so that's how you program it today
one of the big challenges with it is the
connectivity is not general or broad
enough for big problems but you can at
least start using it to create this
energy landscape and then be able to
solve it so that's you know at the core
that's what it looks like we build these
chips at a in a Cypress Semiconductor
plant in Minneapolis and put them
together into the system and you know
and ship them out so it's we figured out
how to do this work we do a little bit
in our offices in Palo Alto of the fab
work as well but that's that's you know
sort of the nuts and bolts of it in the
programming environment this is a fancy
chart but the reality is it's it's more
chart than software so you know and big
hat no cattle is sort of a part of this
I live in Montana by the way and that's
appropriate saying for there I suppose
so at the bottom are chips and at the
top you know are what you would hope for
it
time our applications but those don't
exist yet and so we've been building the
software environment in a way that will
look familiar to you we've been trying
to do prototype software figure out what
works and at the start you program it at
the machine language level at the sappy
level and then we created libraries and
C C++ MATLAB and Python to let you more
easily do that and dispatch programs and
get them scheduled and run and come back
and then borrowing from what we've done
in traditional computing we said ok you
know maybe rather than having to think
about the machine on its terms let's
create an intermediate representation of
a problem to map onto it and that's a
cube Oh quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization form that I think any of
you and the computer science side would
know and then the machine the problems
you want to solve are actually a lot
bigger than the machine so we said well
let's create sort of a virtual cube oh
that can be a lot bigger than the
physical machine solve it in chunks and
glue it back together and so we've run
problems that are about 20 times larger
than the physical machine now starting
with is virtualization approach and so
we've run problems that are order
magnitude 40 would have would have
consumed 40,000 qubits worth and then
we've started doing some prototype
software I won't bore you with that but
little prototype tools that are
specialized towards subject matter
experts for optimization constraint
satisfaction and there will be others
and then Los Alamos has written a macro
assembler there's a startup company
called one qubit that's created
environment for the machine so they're
starting to be an ecosystem around
software just this week in Washington
was a seminar quantum quantum software
testbed workshop or something like that
and there were three days and people
from all around the world came and gave
talks about this building software
environment so it's great and then still
looking for you know there's no compiler
yet but if we ever had one I would call
it core Tran you can tell where I
started or
whew plus plus or something and you'll
see these are all just fictitious
make-believe things but someday there
will be those and then real applications
that run on it we just open sourced rqb
solve that intermediate representation
software and I got good good coverage
and good reception from it and so that
was a cute headline about it this is the
way that you actually program it is that
you specify the weights of the cubit and
the strengths of the interactions
between them it's the representation of
what the machine is doing is the
Hamiltonian that's at the bottom and
that's what it what you think it's
resolving it's it's doing something
close to that but that's what that's
really what you're programming and this
isn't my speech writer but to show you
how easy it's become to use this is
Scott Pei canoes the technical project
leader at Los Alamos this is his
daughter Sophia who we believe was the
first person to ever program a quantum
computer before a traditional computer
and so he was fiddling with it at home
and she became interested in it and he
showed her how to do it and sort of how
the machine works and her first program
was to take her class these qubits each
qubit was a classmate and then did this
classmate get along well with this one
or not and this one and that sort of
thing so I think what she really did was
separate her class into kids she liked
and kids she didn't like but that was
that's the first five-year-old program
that we know of on on our machine and
then lastly just potential applications
here and so I'm gonna take you on a
little tour these are again we'll leave
you with this but you can look up these
papers this was from Lockheed and and so
now I've targeted most of these toward
machine learning so early days prototype
stuff but at least pointing the way that
there will be some applications here so
Steve Adachi and Henderson of Lockheed
Martin application of quantum annealing
to training of deep neural networks I
won't bore you with that but that was
one and then a fellow Alejandro
Ortiz there's now at NASA Ames gave a
talk at our first-ever users group
conference about quantum assisted
algorithm for sampling and these are
again you'll have access to all of this
stuff and you know said you know it's
hard to do but there's potential to it
and what you'll see in some of these in
fact is that the the way the machine the
the way the qubits are coupled together
you can make it look like a restricted
Boltzmann machine and so you can get a
quantum Boltzmann sampling back from it
and then go off to use it in your
problems so this was another one from
folks at Los Alamos Boltzmann sampler
restricted really and then here was
another one from Los Alamos and these
are from our users group but I've
included this because there are a couple
of websites here that have presentations
that you might be interested in looking
at the one at the bottom here and these
are some of the Los Alamos they when
they got the machine they said if you
want to try to run on the d-wave machine
we'll give you some time and you can
take some of your own time at work to
run on it and see you know and see what
happens try it and see what happens so
they had about ten rapid response
projects that are at that website and
the idea was let's let's see how well
the machine would work and holy cow
that's a different color than it started
but hopefully you'll be able to read it
in there and you can go to some of those
papers and see what they're like but
these were some of the again I won't
read these to you but these were some of
the conclusions that they came to and of
the first ten or so projects they tried
I was shocked about half of them found
results that were wrong you know sort of
in the same order of magnitude as on
conventional computing and there was one
of them that came up with a little
better results than on a conventional
computer so this was there right out of
the bat the first things they ran on it
about half of them at least showed
promise and of those one or two of them
showed like there might be real promise
and and they
ranged from a signal processing
application on the bottom of this
optimization at the top this was this
one was wild graph partitioning for
electronic structure problems and in
fact they found that the d-wave machine
was comparable to existing methods and
sometimes better after this this initial
thing and then this was another one I
love this one of course and this was a
fellow who really started off as kind of
a skeptic and looked at optimization
problems and in the end he drank the
d-wave kool-aid and this was his chart
with the heart around d-wave and now so
we felt you know we've made progress
starting from sort of scratch here again
very early days lots of work to do but
if you like to do things that are both
at the cutting edge of your world and
the cutting edge of what will be
computing of tomorrow this is a place to
do it and more than anything we need a
couple of sets of things we need more
smart people thinking about applications
and then we need another set of smart
people thinking about how do you create
software tools to be able to let this
thing run so with that I may have a
couple of minutes but thanks for your
attention I'll be here all day
and so really appreciate it and I forgot
to show you this at the start I have a
new shirt because all I've been on road
for two weeks and so all my other
clothes are dirty so I bought a new
shirt and this is like the coolest shirt
I've ever owned I'm not very stylish as
you can tell this shirt is not a
button-down collar but this is a
button-up collar look at that isn't that
cool who would have ever thought you
needed buttons underneath your collar
and the reason I bring that up is it
makes the call or horrible to try to
attach the microphone to so I'll never
wear my button up collar shirt for
another time like this
thank you for a very engaging Choctaw
now we have a few moments for questions
from the audience it's on Talk and I
like the idea of q+ buzz by the way so
I'll be the first one to use my main
question is in the early days of
parallel computing you know we built
machines especially in those government
labs say thousand core computers it was
the biggest thing ever
what they did was they they done the
interfaces made the at least they're to
submit their problems or model their
problems and run them in those so my
main question to you is looks like you
have a machine which is doing something
phenomenal but it's not available for
everyone everyone is not Google
certainly arc Edition academicians don't
have that type of resources my question
is as you have these software being
developed around your machine and as you
made your code open source which is
great when or is there a plan to make
your machine to be available to the
academicians or professionals which have
really hard problems but they don't have
any hardware to run on and if that's a
possibility that's that will speed up
the process of making this quantum
computing actually leap more than
doubling up every year yeah so I agree
completely we would love to do to do
that that was probably my neck or
something rather than this thing but the
we would love to be able to do that
we're trying to turn this into a
business which means you need to sell
computers and make some money so let's
talk to our friends whether they be at
Air Force Research Lab in Rome or DARPA
or wherever and figure out a way to at
least get part of one funded and and put
out somewhere you know and if that
doesn't happen seriously in the next
during this year then I'm gonna find a
way to put one out
there because you know I mean you saw
the results of Los Alamos really using
it for three months and we need
thousands and thousands of really smart
people trying it so we'll figure out a
way to do that and I would envision you
know then we'll have student contests
and one thing in another and you know at
some point get round to like the Bell
prizes and those sorts of things
just very quickly catch out what you
just said I really like you example of
Sophie the five-year-old and I think
it's also a good tour to think about
teaching problem formulation exactly not
just on a computing program but also
problem formulation as I'm wondering
there where they have an interest to
work with RIT kind of feel some
collaboration tools education tools not
for college students or K through 12
about that problem formulation you know
yeah exactly we would love to do that
and in fact we yesterday had a great
session with the Durr sick people that
talked a little bit about what we're
doing and what they're doing so would
love to come back at some point and
maybe bring our fellow who wrote some of
those tools that Sophie used and we can
talk about that because again you know I
would like to focus focus things on two
or three or four projects some on
software tools and some on applications
and then figure out a way to to get
going so absolutely we'll we'll be back
talking about very efficient computing
using quantum computing but where does
the memory reside yeah so this is
different you know this is there's not
really a memory so you formulate where
we're like early days of memoryless GPUs
even cashless GPUs is the way to think
about it and basically you create your
problem on a host machine somewhere and
then you send us over the the strength
or the values of those qubits and the
interaction strengths between the qubits
and then we solve that problem and
you'll tell us how many times you want
it solve like a hundred and then we'll
give you a hundred of the results back
so there are there are buffers on it and
things but it's really it's in a in a
way it's almost like maybe an active
memory itself and that you you program
it and then it solves the problem that
you've programmed on to it and then you
read the results of the the memory back
but it's you know is it's a different
animal I don't even know if we should
call it a computer you know it it's
doing something but it's it really is
quite this different animal so maybe
with it I think we're out of time so let
me let me just say one other thing and
sort of follow on what max said earlier
and that is that you know as you all go
go forward through your careers and
you're going to create software and deep
learning models and programs that are
gonna do things that you and I aren't
going to know how they got to that
conclusion so with that sort of freedom
and the ability to do those great things
there's also responsibilities and I'm
going to just go back to you know make
up a mythical car company like one a big
one in Germany it has two initials we V
or something and you know imagine that
you're you're there ten years ago or
something and you're a business the Big
Shot business person and you say you
know we've got this new new line of
diesel cars coming out and you know the
people who've been testing them the
emission results aren't going to pass
the u.s. standards I you know I don't
know what the problem is we need to fix
the problem fix the problem
and so they call in software people who
have been you know creating the software
that drives the that operates the engine
and reports the results back and say you
know we got this problem can you guys
fix the problem and they say well you
know I don't know you know we can fix
anything with software let's think about
it and they come back the next day and
say yeah we can fix the problem and the
the business people say great go fix the
problem you know you know we got that
emission problem solved and the software
the software guys don't exactly talk to
the business guys and they probably
don't say well you know by fixing it
we're we're gonna fix it you're gonna
get the get numbers you like but we
fixed it and the business people who
knows what really happened but the
business people didn't maybe really say
how did you fix the problem did you
really you know did we make the engine
more efficient did you tune the software
so we made the engine more efficient but
so you know here's a silly case and
we're gonna see how this plays out over
the next few months but you know you're
gonna have a receivin more
responsibility in your world to be able
to explain what you're doing and do
critical thinking about what's happening
as it gets applied in business or as it
gets applied in medicine or other areas
so so we're gonna end up with these
great unbelievable fantastic things that
you can do but behind them we need to
have at least some idea that what
they're doing is right and when you fix
a problem that you've really fixed the
problem so that would say again thank
you and really appreciate the invitation
