six games over nine days deep blue the
IBM computer beat Garry Kasparov
considered to be the best chess player
in the history of the game
the great Russian champion was not a
graceful loser well it has been 20 years
since that epic battle between man and
machine the news report was from 1997
and Garry Kasparov vs. the IBM computer
deep blue the russian grandmaster and
former world chess champion is
undoubtedly one of the greatest players
in the history of the game but it is
that battle against a faceless opponent
that he will perhaps be best remembered
for a year earlier he had defeated deep
blue but they rematch belonged to the
computer and it certainly seemed at the
time that by extinct and by extension
the future belonged to the computer as
well Garry Kasparov is reflecting on
matches against deep blue and much more
in his new book it's called deep
thinking where machine intelligence ends
and human create creativity begins and
he joins me in our Toronto studio
welcome good morning when you look back
at that loss they called it a blow
against humanity was it that I guess it
was an exaggeration but obviously it was
a milestone in the history of computer
science and we should remember that the
founding fathers of computer science
like Alan Turing or Claude Shannon they
believed that if machine could beat
human champion in chess that would be a
moment for artificial intelligence in
fact they were wrong because I don't
think that you can call deep blue
intelligence it was as intelligent as
your alarm clock though that's losing
210 million dollar arm clock didn't make
me feel any better
I want to teach you to be very cautious
when people keep using this term
artificial intelligence because we have
to agree what on and on the definition
do we mean by saying AI result or the
process deep blue reached the result
but by the definition of its output it
was intelligent it played world
champions level chess but when you look
at the process it offered us very little
input into the mysteries of human
intelligence and you actually won the
first competition against deep blue the
year before yeah yeah people people
don't recall it but that's why I'm
saying but but I think it's if you look
at the milestones I think the game one
of the first match that I want
eventually I lost this game that was a
real milestone because the moment
machine could beat the world champion in
one game
the rest was you may called matter of
technique it's matter of time the
signing was already on the wall and
analyzing the games of that match and I
used modern computers and I have to tell
people that the free chess app on your
mobile phone it's probably stronger than
deep blue today is that right yeah
absolutely because this machines are
just getting stronger faster and and
what's happened was chess that the game
could be could be crunched by brute
force
once Hardware got fast enough database
got big enough and algorithm got smart
enough it's it's interesting that you
say that because we have spoken here to
Geoffrey Hinton who's seen as the The
Godfather of artificial intelligence and
he's at the University of Toronto and
now has some association with Google as
well but he talked - he talks about the
fact that when he was first starting to
work on that the machines just weren't
fast enough and now they are that that
part of what it went when it comes to
artificial intelligence it's about the
capacity of these machines yes I know
absolutely machines getting faster
that's why they could solve many other
problems though chess as most of other
games is mathematically infinite the
number of legal moves in the game of
chess is more a number of atoms in the
solar system but it's not about solving
the game it's about beating human
opponent and we're all vulnerable
because we don't have the same steady
hand as machine does and inevitably we
make mistakes only inaccuracies that
that are not so important when one human
face is not a human but was
sheen's you know you'll be punished
instantly for making a mistake then when
I just looked at our games analyzing
them today I found that not only I made
mistakes but also deep blue made you
know quite quite a few mistakes which
shows that machines machines progress is
is is is very natural so they're
incessantly getting better and better
well in fact you make the point that one
of the reasons it beat you in 97 was
because they looked at 96 when you beat
it and they reprogram that this
reprogrammed it's there it's I recommend
they read the book because while I'm
very complimentary about about IBM
science and and the team that were was
behind it then I still have many
questions to to the corporation and then
the way they organized the event because
only one player in the match was under
tremendous psychological pressure and
some of me when I'm talking to him
stupid stupid mistakes stupid mistakes I
made they were just result that I
couldn't I couldn't cope with this with
the pressure and I would say
questionable behavior of the organizers
and they called you a sore loser I said
in the book I'm a sore loser yes but you
can't stand top for 20 years if another
so loser you have to take it almost as a
physical pain and I blame myself for
making these mistakes but also you know
I now twenty years later I could see
that certain of these mistakes were more
inevitable because I wasn't ready for a
match win or lose for me
it was still very much a great social
and scientific experiment and I have
been treating IBM when the process of
the preparing for the match as as more
like a partner than an opponent and just
when I you know when I go to my wake-up
call about harsh realities that IBM
wanted just to win the match and didn't
care much about about continuation of
this experiment so that was too late how
was playing chess against a computer
different than playing against a human
oh when I first sat against the blue
across the chessboard in 1996 first
match I was a world champion for more
than ten years I played I think hundred
eighty two games in the world
championship matches and hundreds of
other games against top grandmasters and
I knew my opponents I knew what to
expect from them I knew what to expect
from myself
I used to watch their body language and
look straight in the eyes to to gauge
their intentions and to measure their
plans and then I you know I face deep
blue it's it's so different because you
don't know what to expect this is
something that literally comes out of a
black box and psychology which is a very
important element of any human game just
is no longer there in fact actually it's
there but there's only one way because
you could be under pressure you could
make mistakes the blue doesn't care what
happened in a previous game it doesn't
even know what's happening one moved
before so there's so many things that
could work for you in any normal
quote-unquote chess against other humans
they're just even not working or working
against you when you when you face the
faceless how did you prepare for that
that was a big question because not in
1996 or even in 1997 I had any access to
to deep blue games in 1996 it was
natural because this was a first event
of the machine then we had an agreement
that I would I would look at the deep
blue games in interim period but then
there was a look at was a mistake in or
a slip in the in the contract and I've
been pointed out that the contract
referred only to the official games
played by the blue which meant that all
the games played in lab all training
games and that's the only games the blue
played were not available to me so I
still didn't know what to expect and
it's it's quite a challenge for for
someone like me who's used to prepare a
lot analyzing the games for my opponents
facing again black box because I didn't
know what was there no games it was
quite tough so I after winning the frost
match losing the second one I wanted to
play the rubber match the decisive match
but IBM decided to retire the computer
hmm yeah okay how do you prepare
physically for that physically for the
blue or full out up over and for others
somebody know I prepare oh I kept myself
in shape of four for my for my entire
chess curry career and even
by late by the late 90s I was in my
series much older than most of my young
opponents but I kept winning tournaments
because I was in excellent physical
shape
I knew that there's always the
correlation between your your health and
and your physical shape that could give
you confidence and your your performance
of the chess board where is it push-ups
or seven my personal records 107 shops
before a game if it's my personal wreck
okay that's that's not asking too much
okay you know when you play for for two
weeks or more and it's and games could
last for six hours so that takes a lot
of a lot of use of your strengths and it
needs you know it puts you just under
this constant pressure physically
exhausting and exhausting yeah okay well
let's keep talking about artificial
intelligence you know there's an
expectation that intelligent machines
will displace workers what do you think
of that fear cuz you've been spending a
lot of time looking at us I'm surprised
that people are surprised because that's
the history of our civilization history
of progress machines replacing farm
animals machine replacing manual labor
now machines are coming after people's
college degree and Twitter accounts and
that's why everybody's talking about it
but this this is not nothing wrong about
it I would say it's excellent use
because every profession eventually
should feel this pressure or else
humanity will cease making progress
machines will take over more menial
parts of cognition and that will help us
to boost our creativity and curiosity
and by the way let's not forget about
beauty and joy so we can do a lot of
things if we keep pushing the horizons
if we're looking for new challenges I
always say machines won't make us
obsolete our complacency might it's a
new challenge for us but I think it's
it's a great challenge because if
machines getting smarter we're getting
smarter and intelligent machines can
help us to turn our grandest dreams into
reality did it take you a while to feel
that way I read
somewhere that you actually wanted to
rip that deep blue apart the reason I
stayed on top for 20 years is because I
was very good at analyzing my mistakes
and coming back with new ideas and after
that match in 1997 and while licking my
wounds I looked for an opportunity to
combine human skills and machine skills
and I came up with a concept I called
advanced chess when humans and a plasma
scene could play against another human
plus machine and there are many now
games played on internet what they call
freestyle internet where people could
get together with machines and and and
play against other other humans that
using different computers and what
what's happened that chess proved to be
another fruit of a perfect field to test
human plus machine combination which I
believe is the future because there's so
many things that we can combine machines
brute force of calculation machines
algorithms but on other side we have our
experience we have our strategic
overview and look we have purpose
machines don't have purpose we have
passion so the many things that in that
that could go together and I think
that's it's these kind of artificial
intelligences that people are afraid of
it's it's it's it's it's a way way to go
and I'm I don't want people to be
overwhelmed by by the dystopian views
promoted by great movies like The
Terminator on the metrics I'm wondering
how you are watching and reacting to
these the big cyber malware attacks the
the wanna cry ransomware
and the the use of computers for that
kind of thing but that's very natural
you have hundreds of millions of the
billions of people whose access to two
to two computers and Internet and even
if you have one percent of those that
would like to use it for crimes or other
illegal activities you already have a
few millions of experts trying to go up
to you that it's it's a it's not a
reality every every new technology every
step of the progress has been a company
company bye-bye illegal activities bye
bye-bye attempts of some to get an
advantage over you
and this cyberattacks you know they will
become part of our life and we just have
to realize that we need to think about
it seriously and we have to understand
that combining privacy and security will
be more and more difficult you are also
a human rights advocate and I'm
wondering how I'm I'm wondering how you
see computers that the misuse of
computers by government you've raised
concerns about the the use of the
government use of computers and
artificial intelligence to to threaten
freedoms talk to me about it some that's
that's that that's one of the one of the
greatest challenges for any any
democracy when you just have to look at
the privacy and security now it's moved
to a to to these problems moved to
digital era I think it's it's it's it's
wrong to expect that our day that could
be protected hundred percent data
collection is inevitable when aids by
the government or by the big
multinational corporations the question
is what will be done with this data and
here in the in in Canada or in the
United States or in most of European
countries you are still protected by by
the legal system by the by the rules by
the courts while in countries like
Russia Turkey Iran China if your
information is available to the
government you'll be prosecuted with
disrespect to to any any any legal
restrictions even if they do exist so I
think it's about what what the
government can do with this information
and we have to look more at that side
how can we limit government's use of
this information because it will be
collected anywhere but let's be honest
it's is going to happen because we want
our data to be protected but at the same
time we want governments to make sure
that the hacking attacks that's by the
way could be far more dangerous because
that the hackers they don't respect and
rules and if it's the of the states like
Russia or China they will just go after
you and after your data with the with
the malice intent let's talk a little
bit more about
so there been a lot of accusations
against President Putin that he and his
intelligence agencies are using cyber
warfare to undermine democracies in the
West what do you think that end games
about it's a part of Putin's plan to
stay in power endlessly because since
Russian economies is falling and he
doesn't expect it to you to to to to get
better nobody thinks that oil will go
back to $100 plus price tag he needs to
to justify he's his staying power and
confrontation was the free world is a
very important element of that Putin
meets confrontation Putin needs to
spread chaos and and attacking democracy
as an institution helps his propaganda
machine in Russia to demonstrate that
democracy is what is a cover-up it's
just you know everything is reaped and
dismantling the the aura of democracy as
an important part of the human progress
helps Putin and other dictators to send
a message domestically that people
shouldn't feel shouldn't go to the
streets demanding free and fair
elections and well and you know well
about this I said you ran for president
you actually wanted to run for president
in Russia they wouldn't let you run I
mean it's the running for president in
Russia it's it's quite an exaggeration
because in countries like Putin's Russia
you cannot participate in a political
life the same way you can do it here in
Canada you cannot register political
party you cannot do fundraising you
cannot campaign openly the only debate
in Russia is the date with riot police
on the streets so my companions 2007 was
just to bring attention to the fact that
even if you wanted to run you will be
stopped by by by rules that are imposed
imposed by the government to make sure
that nobody who is not approved by
Kremlin could get to the ballot where do
you live in New York Upper West Side
do you spend time in Moscow now or two
that I left Moscow four years ago
because I know now that three back to
Moscow would be one way trip to me yeah
that says a lot about human rights in
Russia look it's it's a dictatorship I
think it's it's amazing that
people still asking about the nature of
Putin's regime after what he did in
Ukraine after what he did in Syria and
not even saying after what he did in
Russia Russia a proper and now he keeps
attacking other countries you it's not
only the United States you can look at
Europe France Great Britain now Germany
Putin keeps raising stakes because again
he knows only the confrontation could
could help him to justify stay he stay
in power so how do you process the the
news today and when the news yesterday
from The Washington Post the president
Trump shared classified intelligence
information with the Russian Foreign
Minister on Isis are you surprised
well they're denying it no no they did
they they said unless I'm wrong but the
statement from the White House from
general McMaster the head of National
Security Council was that neither
sources nor methods have been released
but that what's right but the post is
arguably the post is saying they got
enough information that the Russians
nobody yeah this is I guess that's
typical for Trump he was bragging they
talked about Syria Trump I think again
as as Obama administration has
mistakenly looking for Russian
cooperation in Syria though Putin has no
interest in in in in helping Americans
there and Trump was bragging about about
some of the US operations there and I'm
not surprised that in the process of his
conversation trying to impress his his
counterparts he revealed I think there
was no there was no it was unintended
but it's typical for Trump he is
uncontrolled he could tweet it and then
just get lover off and Russian
ambassador kiss lag so when he told that
he told him something that I have no
doubt has been already used by Russian
intelligence to identify the source on
the ground and to turn it into their
advantage you think Trump has actually
been good for a lot of Americans Oh
Trump effect was good for many Americans
because for many years I've been talking
to Americans about problems with human
rights elsewhere and many of them
shrug their shoulders very dismissive
reaction that's having some happening
somewhere else in Russia in Iran and
China never in America aha welcome now
they realize that as once Ronald Reagan
said freedom is never won one generation
away from extinction
so Trump effect I think will have a
long-term positive impact on bringing
young Americans into politics people now
are learning about US Constitution about
the foundation of the Republic
independent judiciary and by the way one
thing that worked in favor of all human
rights activist in the world is the
clash between Donald Trump and US courts
I I could see how Russian propaganda
machines stumbled when after Trump
signed the executive order American
Court just a judge from a backward state
simply now just overruled and instead of
arresting the judge Trump went to had no
choice to go to the to appeal court and
lost again
so for countries like Russia or Iran
that tells that older people that
democracy and separation of power works
and it's this is quite an important
message so I think the conflict between
Trump's ego and personality and US
political institutions could produce
good results both in America and an
outside though of course in it we can we
can expect such such blows as has
happened two days ago because the man
definitely is not qualified for the job
what's next for you I'm so engaged in
promoting the game of chess a super
sport of chess foundation in across the
world I'm engaged in promoting human
rights as a chairman of humourous
foundation I keep writing books I'm
doing more and more speeches because
people are concerned about future of AI
and the future of humanity so that many
things were I could apply my my
experience and my own intelligence and
the life was busier than ever do you see
the world through the prism of the
strategies that you learned in chess
like learn like for such a long time and
from such an early age you learn to
think very strategically now I try to
apply my chest no
what I learned from the game of chess to
analyze different situations around the
world and I have to say that we are now
in a great need of the long term
strategy that's one of the biggest
challenges for the free world that after
the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
end of the Cold War there was no
strategy to replace the strategy that
helped win the Cold War Garry Kasparov
thanks for coming in nice to talk to you
