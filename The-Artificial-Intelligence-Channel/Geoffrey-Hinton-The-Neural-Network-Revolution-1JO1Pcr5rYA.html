it's a great pleasure to be here
geoff hinton we'll be we'll be out here
in just a second
and so I'm just going to offer a few
preliminary remarks one being that it is
really an extraordinary honor to have
Jeff in here he is was you know slightly
modestly described as the founder
pioneer of AI in Canada but really even
more than that he's really truly one of
the the true pioneers and the Giants in
the field so that is a that is a great
privilege he he has another I don't know
if you'd call it an achievement but it
sort of explains a little bit the stage
set up here is that he told me that he
is not actually sat him down in a chair
since 2005 maybe some kind of world
record for our standing up but he has a
he has a herniated disc which prevents
him from sitting down so he'll be he'll
be standing here well while we talk now
you know AI and this is you know part of
what we'll get into in the beginning of
this discussion
AAI means a lot of different things to
different people these days it's it's
thrown around a lot as what could really
be thought of as a marketing term as
much as anything and so that's that's
how we're going to start out the
conversation here and first of all I
welcome Jeff thank you so much for being
here
and Jeff was also he noted to me
recently named just to give you a sense
of both his own personal importance in
the field and and the importance of this
field in general that Jeff was named one
of the 50 most influential people in the
world which is quite a quite a statement
actually so congratulations
now just to start out as I was just
saying you know AI artificial
intelligence machine learning these are
terms that get thrown around a lot
especially these days it's often hard to
discern what they really mean I mean
computer computing by itself is can be
thought of as a form of AI so well what
is the what is the definition of
artificial intelligence so the
definition is doing things that would
make a person seem intelligent if a
person did them but that doesn't get you
very far
what happened was about 60 years ago
there were two schools of thought there
was a clash between two paradigms for
how to make an intelligent system so one
paradigm was logic so if I give you some
true premises and some valid rules of
inference you can derive some truth
inclusions and the people who believe in
logic thought that's the way the mind
must work and somehow the mind is using
some funny kind of logic that can cope
with the fact that sometimes you
discover things you believed were false
normal logic has problems with that and
so one paradigm said we have these
symbolic expressions in our head and we
have rules from repairing them and the
essence of intelligence is reasoning and
it works by moving around symbols in
symbolic expressions there was a
completely different paradigm that
wasn't called artificial intelligence it
was called neural networks that said we
know about an intelligent system it's
the brain and the way that works is you
have lots of little processes with lots
of connections between them about 10 to
the 14 connections between them and you
change the strengths of the connections
and that's how you learn things so they
thought the essence of intelligence was
learning and in particular how you
change the connection strengths so that
your neural network will do new things
and they would argue that
everything you know comes from changing
those connection strengths and those
connection strengths change to have to
somehow be driven by data you're not
programmed you somehow absorb
information from data well for 60 years
this battle has gone on and fortunately
I can tell you recently it was won and
the neural Nets was the right branch so
when when was the battle won what was
the what was the tipping point when do
people realize that this that the neural
net approach was a fundamentally better
one than a sort of a logic so I guess in
about 2009 people doing your own nets
showed that you could make a better
speech recognizer and that quickly got
taken up by the big companies and in the
Android in 2012 was the first system to
complete all the engineering to put that
into a system and when speech
recognizers on yourself and got a lot
better in 2012 that was neural nets
so that was one sign another sign was in
2012 people made neural nets much better
recognizing objects and images so now in
google you can upload your photos and
it'll tell you what's in them you say
finally a photo of a hug and it'll
recognize a hug and a hug it's quite a
complicated thing or jewelry of where
Claire's jewelry and a small glittery
thing isn't necessarily jewelry but if
you see a small glittery thing and then
a woman's neck that's jewelry and so
you're Nets able to cope with all that
kind of stuff and you can't do it with
rules there's too many rules too right
you just have to learn it from data and
in that case you'd have a big label data
set of lots of images and labels and say
what's in them and you train your neural
net and until about 2012 people hadn't
been able to train really big neural
nets on millions of images and when we
first did that we suddenly got much
better results than computer vision
stanley computer vision and the whole
field of computer vision flipped between
2012 and 2013 in Bac 2011 if you
submitted a paper bright neural nets it
would be sort of more less automatically
rejected and by 2013 if you submitted a
paper that wasn't about neural nets it
would be more less
to magically reject it so it was
complete flip sir because it worked so
much better and and you referred to this
going back 60 years I mean so so visited
going on for 60 years and then suddenly
in one year the whole thing flips over I
mean what what was that about
I guess paradigm clashes are like that
um suddenly there was enough evidence
the neural networks really would work
really well given a lot of compute power
and a lot of data and at that point
for example 10,000 smart Chinese
graduate students go into the field and
we've been laboring away with kind of
only a few hundred people really working
at this stuff
suddenly you get this big infusion of
very smart young people who push the
field forward and that's what's
happening that there was one other thing
I didn't mention which was machine
translation so if ever there was a
problem where the symbolic approach was
gonna win it was machine translation
because what comes in is a string of
symbols and what comes out is a string
of symbols and there's all these
linguists all over the place will tell
you how to manipulate symbols they'll
tell you what the rules are for how you
find structured strings of symbols that
are language and so that was that was
what I think of as the final battle
if symbolic I was ever gonna win it was
gonna be for machine translation if you
asked how cool does translation now what
you do is you take in words in one
language you break them up into a
thirty-two thousand different fragments
which things like eing but also all the
common words like that and then you
produce the other language and it's done
by a great big neural network and the
neural network has no hand wired
knowledge in it it just takes these
thirty-two thousand alternative
fragments of stray loads and it produces
thirty-two thousand alternative
fragments in the output language and
it's just trained to do it from data and
if you ask how many linguists did you
need to do that well you needed lots of
linguists to prepare the data and
understand that there are different
languages and things like that but how
many linguists were involved in actually
creating the network none
you didn't need any linguist at all you
didn't need any prior knowledge it was
just all learn from data what you needed
was a lot of data so what does that look
like when you say you know you need a
lot of data what so you need millions
and millions of pairs of a sentence in
one language and a good translation in
the other language and you take your
neural network and you feed it the
sentence in the first language then
initially it has random weights and
it'll produce garbage in the second
language that is what it'll produce at
each time is the sort of probabilities
of what the next word might have been in
the new language let's first we're doing
English to French you give it an English
sentence it'll then produce
probabilities for the first word of the
French sentence you pick one of those
words according to those probability and
say okay suppose that was the first word
what you think the second word is and
it'll give you probabilities you pick
one of those you say okay suppose that
was the second one what do you think the
third word is and it'll produce garbage
because you put random weights in and
then what you do is you say okay you
thought the first word was love and
actually the first world is LA so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try and make
you think there's higher probability for
LA and less probability for LA so you
inject an error signal that tells it you
know God you got that wrong you were
betting online it should be lower and so
what we do is we inject an error signal
and that error signal goes backwards
through all the connections in the
network figure out how to change those
connections so next time it'll say
whichever I said no rather than laugh
and you just keep doing that
this is dumb as out you just keep doing
that for actually billions of times and
eventually it starts producing good
strings in the other language
what's more you make one net that will
through translate all pairs of languages
will give it a language you tell it what
the output language should be and it'll
be used in the other language just one
name so when it was the specific story
of how how this kind of machine
translation went from your laboratory to
the Android phone okay the machine
translation wasn't done in my lab that
was done at the University of Montreal
and
Google but the speech recognition and
the object recognition will first stand
in my lap and in 2009 we've got a speech
recognizer working and it works slightly
better than the existing technology but
our one was done by two graduate
students working over summer and the
existing technology was a result of 30
years of hard work and so it was very
obvious that if you developed our system
it would get much better which you did
and so my graduate students went off to
the various big labs to IBM and
Microsoft and to Google and all those
labs then switched to doing speech
recognition using your own s Google was
by far the fastest to actually do the
engineering to get it into production
that's what Google does really well it
eventually came out in Syrian things
because IBM helps with the speech
recognition for Siri but yeah so the
speech recognition I was very impressed
by how fast Google did the engineering
mm-hmm
so what are what are some of the most
important applications for this when it
comes to financial services I mean I
know it's a it's a kind of a that's
probably a very long list but if you
could give us a couple of examples of
where this technology has really really
had a big impact on the financial system
and and and when you look over the
horizon a little bit what do you think
are the big problems that could be
solved with these technologies okay so I
know about how you get a network of
simulated neurons to change the
connection strengths to work better I
all I know about finance is each time I
look at my bank account the monthly fees
have gone up
I do have a former student who knows a
lot about finance he's the CEO of a
company called Renaissance which is our
a successful hedge fund and he tells
Mary Lee Bob Mercer right no no that
will be Peter Brown okay there's two
guys those two guys is Peter Brown and
this is evil twin Bob Mercer Peter Brown
is a very nice guy
everything I know about finance I
learned from him and I don't know much
so I probably should refrain from
telling you how this is going to be
using finance but I can tell you
something much more general anytime you
have a lot of data you want to predict
something neural nets are now a very
good way to do it they weren't better
than the alternative technologies at
present so all you need is lots and lots
of data and lots of information about
what the right answer is which might
just be what happened next and you'll be
able to train a big neural net to do
really well of course I actually I know
a tiny bit more than that about finance
I was actually once the technical guy on
a little mutual fund for Nesbitt burns
that works extremely well we had a
neural net in the 90s that he was
actually there was a neural net that
decided what sort of phase of the market
you're in and there's another neural net
that told you which stocks would do
better than the market in six months
time and so it bought things and held
them for six months and it actually
performed extremely well it performed
extremely well a small fraction of that
was because it worked and a bigger
fraction that was because we were lucky
and then he stopped working well because
the Ontario teachers pension fund copied
it that started running a large amount
of money so took all the signal out of
the market but back then it was very
clear that the main issue in finance in
for example predicting which a good
stocks topic is noise so there isn't
enough data there wasn't enough data
then to be able to tell for sure what
was signal and what was
noise and protecting yourself against
thinking that noise is signal was really
important as you get more data that
becomes less important and it gets
becomes more important to be able to see
structure in the data when it's
complicated structure back in the 90s
you could only find simple structure
because the data sets weren't big enough
now as J sets get bigger you're gonna be
able to learn more and more complex
structure and I guess one thing I can
say that it's generally useful is that
it supposed to give you a great big data
set and there's lots of complicated
structure and you know for all these
examples what the right answer should be
historically can you find rules that
will predict the right answer and
basically the answer is no you can't
what's gonna go on in a big data set is
there's gonna be millions of weak
regularities now among those millions of
weak very garetty's hundreds of
thousands will be due to the fact that
you've got that particular sample of
data and if you try and generalize those
to the future it won't work if you get
another sample even from the same data
set you'll get different regularities
they're what's called sampling error
just the particular quirks of the
particular examples you've got and your
big neuron that will model all those
quirks and a statistician will tell you
that's a complete disaster when it is a
complete disaster unless your big neuron
matches also model lots of other weak
regularities is really there and given a
danger that you can't tell the
difference between regularities that are
there as quirks of the sampling and
regularities that are real and so what a
statistician will tell you is that have
a strong threshold so you won't be
confused by regularities that aren't
real you won't accept a regularity until
there's enough evidence for it but that
means you can't use all these
regularities a much better way is to
find gazillions of weak regularities and
just pray that the ones that are true
will outweigh the ones that are spurious
and to do with your limited data set and
that's what these big neural nets are
doing now particularly in areas like
healthcare where you're trying to
predict medical things
you're really grabbing gazillions of
regularities and hoping the correct ones
will overwhelm the incorrect ones rather
than being a sort of uptight
statistician who says I'm gonna have a
significant threshold for a rule and I'm
not gonna accept any rule unless so
something like predicting you know
you're talking about the power of
prediction from these systems right and
obviously in finance you want to predict
future prices but but to the extent that
one can predict prices that affects the
prices right so yeah I mean so is it a
logical goal to think like well I can
develop a neural network system that
will be able and enable me to predict
future crisis better than the other guy
I mean is that a realistic way to think
about it temporarily yes mm-hm
so I think back in the sixties I don't
know much about finance like I said but
I think back in the sixties people
started using linear models in finance
and they really cleaned up Peter Brian
told me that anyway um they really
cleaned up because they were using a
more powerful tool than what other
people using and by the end of the
sixties sometime rands and linear models
wouldn't buy you anything anymore
you got to go into more complicated
models in fact in the mid-90s we came up
with a model called Gaussian processes
but I'm not gonna try and explain to you
because it's complicated but it's a very
good way of protecting yourself against
mistaking noise for signal and the
mutual fund I was managing for Nesbitt
burns or giving a technical input to we
showed that if you use guessing
processes you could actually make it
work much better instead being getting
it right predictions right sort of 51
and a half percent of the time it will
get the predictions right 53 percent of
the time which were noisy data was much
better and allowed you to make much more
money but it turned out Nesbitt burnwell
wasn't really interested in that because
I couldn't explain how Gaussian
processes worked
I still can't explain how they work and
so they couldn't sell this mutual funds
so one thing I discovered about the
financial industry was banks don't care
whether the mutual fund works they care
whether they can sell it to people
so so you raise a very interesting point
there which is that these these
technologies and what you do them are
sort of fundamentally not explainable
right so so the the neural net is kind
of doing something in there and coming
out with a conclusion but you don't you
don't know how it generated that result
right yeah and so that so I think you
suggested that that opaque quality made
it hard to sell because you couldn't
really explain to people what the
methodology was and it seems like that
would also in various context raise a
lot of regulatory issues where you know
you if you you can't really tell the
regulator why you're doing what you're
doing it's just well the Box said we
should do that I mean is that gonna be
an issue yeah it's gonna be a big issue
particularly in Europe where they want
to legislate this kind of thing there's
been this paradigm pool situation that
we don't know how our brains work right
so if if I ask why did you decide to ask
me that question rather than some other
question you could make up a story you
could say you know because it seemed
relevant at the time and I can say but
why didn't seem relevant at the time and
you would then sort of fish around and
your story will be a bad as plausible as
a story by a press secretary trying to
explain why somebody says some crazy
thing you'd be making it up to try and
justify it but you don't really know why
it happened so we're currently willing
to accept people's opinions even though
we have no idea why they said that and
we're not willing to accept neural nets
opinions when we also have no idea where
they said that we're gonna have to move
to understanding that you have a choice
you can have something that's absorbed a
lot of information and is using lots of
weak rules and using the consensus of
all these weak regularities is
discovered to come to a conclusion where
you can't justify the conclusion in
terms of nice simple rules those are the
systems they're going to work best but
if you don't want that you can have a
system that doesn't work nearly as well
that uses a decision tree or something
that uses nice clear rules that's fine
you can have your system with clear
rules but it just won't work as well
because in reality the only way to make
a good decision in a big messy world is
to be sensitive to a gazillion
regularities and take the consensus of
what they imply and you're never going
to be able to give a simple explanation
of that the simplest explanation of the
neural net that does machine translation
for example is well it's got these
billion connection strengths in and if
you run these 32 fragments through these
billion connection strengths that's what
comes out so you you know it works but
you don't know why it works yeah and you
never will know why it works that's not
quite true
because you can train a neural net to
behave like a press secretary you can
train your own nets to say why they
worked and it'll be a badge of reliable
as people may be a bit more reliable
than people and so we already do that
for images so you can train in your like
to recognize things and images and if
you ask yeah but what's in your nets
scene so you take the neural net that
was classifying the images and you hook
it up to the second half of a machine
translation system so instead of putting
an English sentence you put in an image
and out comes an English sentence sorry
said I putting in a French sentence you
put in an image and then I will come on
English sentence that describes the
image and so now you've got a neural net
and you are and you can ask it what do
you see and it'll say I see a close-up
of a baby holding a stuffed animal and
that's as good as you can do and that is
what it sees and that's when you're
elected that and so we if you want to
explain in your neck get another neural
net to explain it but don't necessarily
believe that's what's really going on so
that's fascinating so you know the one
of the great fears this this raises
right is that the you know you've got
these machines kind of doing their own
thing essentially without us really
knowing what they're doing or how
exactly does that raise any other kinds
of concerns I mean without getting into
the more apocalyptic scenarios of you
know how the computer locking you out of
your spaceship but I mean that's you
know is it completely ridiculous to
worry about those kinds of things no
it's not ridiculous but I think we're
gonna have to treat you the same as we
do with people
um if I get in a taxi and I want to know
is this taxi driver gonna kill me
basically what I do is I don't I don't
ask for a printout of what's going on
inside the taxi drivers head
I don't ask protection over what rules
he's using I just look at the statistics
and all my friends get in taxes and most
of them are still alive and I think it's
probably a good bet certainly when you
get on a plane you know you know that
because of the whole system at the
airlines the pilots probably not drunk
and you know it's a good bet that the
plane will actually land safely but you
don't derive that conclusion from
knowing exactly how the pilots brain
worked you do that from Statistics and
it'll be the same with these AI systems
if you want to know that your driver
list car is not going to mow down
pedestrians you just measure how often
in most an pedestrians preferably in
simulation to begin with and that's
going to give you a much better answer
than trying to understand how its vision
system works so you just kind of look at
the results as their as the way you do
what you do for understanding yeah so so
you know really so this doesn't you
don't think there's a risk of things
sort of producing kinds of nefarious
conclusions let's say or or you know
leading us down and you have to worry
about people manipulating these things
so with a big neural net that's
discovered lots of weak regularities in
the data you can use the neural net like
that for proof recognizing road signs
for example so you just train it up so
when it sees a stop sign it says stop
sign and when it sees a speed limit sign
it's the speed of a sign then when it
sees a school bus sign it says school
bus and stuff like that but after you've
trained it the question is can an
adversary come along and figure out how
to make something that looks just like a
stop sign to you but looks like a no
speed limit sign to somebody else so the
neural net we can't make something that
looks just like a stop sign to you and
looks like a nose
limit sign to another person but we can
make things that look pretty much like a
stop sign to a neural net that's been
trained sorry I pretty much like stop
sign to you and look like some other
kind of sign altogether to a trained
neural net and that's because we can
sort of cash in all what weak
regularities is picked up on and if
you're clever you can make something
that a person won't mistake for some
other sign but these neural nets will so
there's a lot of work remains to be done
on how to avoid that kind of adversarial
attack on these systems you know as long
this is a bit of an aside but since
you're bringing up image recognition
stop sign stuff it you know I I think a
lot of question a big question a lot of
people have is around self-driving
vehicles and you know there's you know
are they sort of a next year thing or 20
years from now thing I mean do you have
a view on that
I think they're definitely between next
year and 20 years from now I think you
can predict the future about five years
in advance and after five years it's all
just crazy
I mean you've no idea okay so now I'm
gonna I'm gonna pin you down on that one
so five years from now are we gonna have
self-driving cars
probably
I didn't say you can predict yes or no
you got a probability distribution of
these yeah sure I understand all right
so what do you think I mean what should
we be looking for what are the next kind
of major things coming out of in terms
of actual applications so we've talked
about machine translation voice
recognition pattern recognition these
things would what are some big really
important breakthroughs that we can look
for say in the next five years out of
these technologies so there's a database
called PubMed that has abstracts of
medical papers and if you look in PubMed
for the last year and you search it with
deep learning you'll discover that those
there must be about a hundred abstracts
come out of systems that use deep
learning to understand medical images
and everybody in the field understands
that the object recognition that these
neural nets can do is now good enough so
you can make systems that are about as
good as doctors and possibly a bit
better
so that's true for for example if you
take an image of your retina called a
fundus image and you look to see if
you've got diabetic retinopathy there's
five stages and now a neural net can do
slightly better than a doctor telling
you not quite as good as the best
doctors but slightly better than your
average doctor telling you
ophthalmologist are telling you what
stage you've written diabetic
retinopathy it is that's really
important because in India for example
you could stop a lot of people going
blind if you could cheaply figure out
which ones to treat and there aren't
enough ophthalmologists but this system
is going to in a few years time it's
going to be it's already being field
trials and things it's gonna stop a lot
of people going blind because it's going
to be able to do it fast and cheap and
that's going to be true for lots of
other medical images like when you get
old you wake up one morning you discover
this is funny patch
and you want to know so I go to the
doctor and I say I got this funny patch
and I'm fairly sure it wasn't there last
week and the doctor says yes actually
actually a burn you must have splattered
hot fat on yourself when you're frying
something see oh yeah I remember that
right
that's embarrassing right that's one
kind of error the other kind of error is
you have this little black thing that
you ignore and it turns out that was a
malignant melanoma and if you got it a
bit sooner you would have lived that's
the opposite kind of error pretty soon
we're going to be able to make something
in your cell phone and you just show it
this thing and it tells you what it
probably is and whether it's worth
taking it to a doctor and in fact pretty
soon the cell phone is gonna be a lot
better than the dermatologists it won't
be as good as taking a sample of it
putting it on a slide and doing the
pathology on the slide which will also
be done by a computer which going to be
a lot better than the pathologist that
stuff is coming quite quickly obviously
there's a normal enormous commercial
incentive for it because medicine is
expensive and we'd like to make medicine
better and cheaper I doubt it'll make it
cheaper and I just mean we get a lot
more treatment and more efficient
treatment I present the system trained
on a hundred and thirty thousand skin
lesions he's about the same as a
dermatologist slightly better but he was
only trained on one hundred and thirty
thousand skin lesions once had been
trained on 10 million it'll be much
better than dermatologists paper came
out last week for example of looking at
cat scans of the head and they're
looking for like 30 different things
aneurysms and hematomas and all sorts of
things that I don't even know what they
mean the computer system now gets a
clinically significant error rate of
0.03 percent actually point over three
seven zero point oh four percent and the
average doctor who who's trained the
average board-certified person for
looking at
these CT scans gets a clinically
significant miss rate of 0.8% so the
computer is 20 times better has 20 times
less misses than the doctors
what's more the computer can be fast and
for a lot of these things if you've got
a hematoma or something you want to
diagnose it fast now this is an archive
paper so you can't necessarily believe
all the results and I'm sure the
referees will make them modify their
claims but that's just a sign of things
to come and the reason they could get
such good results was they put together
the results of 29,000 studies so they
get this itself a database of three and
a half million cat-scans normally these
studies have just a few cats cats and
that was the crucial thing a crucial
thing was getting big data which you
guys know about once you've got that big
data then you can make systems that have
much more experience than any doctor and
therefore would be much better than
doctors one other thing if I may not
sure that's in image analysis where it's
dead obvious this is going to happen I
get into trouble with doctors for saying
you're all going to be out of work in
five years so I won't say that um that's
just radiologists so
they're not actually give me an ax work
they're going to be able to spend their
time with patience explaining what their
options are and what this all means
which is a much better use for human
empathy so the other thing that's going
to happen is there's a huge amount of
data that about every patient and that
the amount of that data that doctors
actually used to decide what to do next
you decide what tests to decide how to
treat you is miniscule there's your
whole genome
pretty soon that'll be cheap to get
there's your whole medical history not
just the results of tests but all the
things you said when you were talking to
a doctor in among which are all sorts of
information the doctor didn't pick up on
this does your microbiome
there's your epigenome which is your how
your genome has been messed with by
environmental effects all of that
information could be to much better
medical treatment it could lead to sort
of predicting what's gonna happen to
this patient next fairly reliably and
treating it before it does so things
like screening will look very primitive
we'll have the equivalent of screening
each person by taking into account all
their properties and how that relates to
all the other properties of all the
other people for whom we know the
results it's going to be hugely better
and that's going to happen but that's
going to be slower a lot of people
realize that now is going to be a lot of
regulatory issues like how did you get
hold of all this data but it's very
clear that a present medicines making
almost no use of the data available and
it's going to get much much better when
it uses all this data and it's going to
be much too much for a person to you so
it's gonna have to be computers that's
that's a great example very specific is
there anything in the world of say
Business and Finance similarity that you
could point to with like you know this
thing is really gonna change in a big
way like we do it this way and five
years from now we're going to do it
totally different way most of what you
do like I say don't really know much
about finance anytime you have to
predict something you're gonna get
better predicting it I mean already
things happening like big neural network
so reading everybody's tweets to try and
figure out what this says about whether
Facebook shares are going to go up or
down much more of that sentiment
analysis you know and so on that point
of you know Twitter and such just to
shift gears slightly as a Google
employee you're certainly very much
aware of a lot of the controversies
around the role of the internet and fake
news and you know accuracy of
information and how it influences
elections and all those things I mean
and generally speaking I think the
there's a lot of criticism at the moment
of the of Google and Facebook especially
in Twitter of doing sort of a poor job
of policing for fake news and other
kinds of abuses that happen on these
systems is is our neural nets going to
be able to help us with that problem or
are they already helping Google with
that problem
your onus will certainly help with that
problem so one nice example of that is
with spam so it used to be that spam was
a real problem and you're on it's a no
very good at detecting spam also the
other day I got this very plausible
thing saying I owed money to the
University and I failed to pay this
request for payment from the University
and could I just click on this to find
out what the payment should be and I
almost fell for it so I fact I did fall
for it so it was from my university was
from a plausible account and I thought I
would you know I must have just missed
that so I clicked on it
and Gmail said do you really want to
open this link it's
it's a highly suspicious link and then I
looked and I realize yeah I was stupid
to click on that it was clearly trying
to get information out of me
so neural nets are going to be very good
at providing a sort of envelope of
protection against these things mm-hmm
what what do you see as the kind of
philosophical implications of neural
nets in other words how do you know if
you look even out you know beyond where
we can predict you know how do they kind
of change the society change the culture
change the conception of self even yeah
I think well one thing's obviously going
to happen if we're right about this
approach to making intelligent systems
and it is related to how the brain works
we can understand a lot more about how
the brain works which is going to be
better for fixing brains that have gone
wrong and it's also going to be better
for things like education but something
even more important it's going to change
our understanding of the nature of what
we are that's why I'm in this field I
want to understand sort of how brains
work and what we are and the conception
50 years ago was that we're rational
beings and we do reasoning and what's
inside our heads these thoughts inside
your head a big symbolic expressions and
I think that's pretty much nonsense
there was something that happened about
a hundred years ago where the concept of
people as rational beings was sort of
undermined somewhat by Freud who pointed
out that there's all these unconscious
goings-on most of them to do with sex
but that's not the main point yet the
main point is that we most of the
reasoning we do is not conscious
deliberate reasoning Freud said there's
unconscious reason I wouldn't call it
unconscious I just say we are devices
that work by using analogies and that's
much more basic to how we work than
reasoning and I'll give you one piece of
evidence for the
you know from biology that there must be
male cats and female cats and male dogs
and female dogs otherwise they'd all be
gone by now but if I say to you I'm
going to give you a false choice and the
first choice is you have to decide which
of these two is more true all cats are
female and all dogs are male or all cats
are male and all dogs are female well at
least in our culture everybody knows the
answer to that cats are female and dogs
are male and little kids know that right
away they didn't even notice as a
logical problem there that's clearly not
logical reasoning that's something about
the fact that you're inside your brain
when you think of a cat there's a huge
vector of features there's lots and lots
of active neurons to represent different
features of cats and also when you think
of a one room when you think of a man
there's lots and lots of features and it
turns out the big feature vector for cat
is closer to woman and the big feature
than it is to man and the big feature
vector for dog is close to man that is
to woman and that's because these
features come from experiencing these
things in the real world and big stupid
loud dogs chase small smart discreet
cats that's the way it works that's not
a political statement that's just how so
that kind of understanding of the world
is the primary understanding we have and
it's not logical we we absorb
information from data from this data to
explain the data we get concepts which
are huge vectors of features and if you
do that with a neural net if you're
training your own that for example to
predict the next word in a sentence and
the way it works is it first turns each
word symbol into a vector it learns to
do that such that these vectors are good
at predicting what vectors will come
next and then you look at these vectors
you discover that without you telling it
how to do analogical reasoning it can
automatically do
your reasoning so what you do is you
take the vector that is extracted for
King and you take the vector this is
extracted for male and you actually
subtract the two vectors this is vector
algebra so you take this big bunch of
numbers a represents King and another
big bunch of numbers of represents male
and you should have tracked the numbers
from male from the numbers for King and
then you take the big bunch of numbers a
represents female and you had those
numbers - what you got left and so now
you've got King - male plus female and
you'd look up the numbers you got left
and hey presto you've got a big vector
that's very close to Queen in other
words it knows that King - male plus
female is queen and it learned that just
from modeling which word comes next in
strings of words similarly if you take
Paris and you subtract France and you
add on Italy you get Rome this kind of
automatic analogy is how these systems
work logic is something that comes much
later on top of these systems doesn't
happen till far far later this is
happening in two and three-year-olds
logic is happening later that's really
the essence of how we work and it's very
like Freud's idea of the unconscious
that there's all these inferences so
you're making very thinking you're
making inferences they just happen
automatically and if you want to
understand how to manipulate politics
you need to understand that's how people
work that's fascinating so I you know I
have a final question because we're
about out of time here but you know
these things you described are very very
powerful and and obviously extremely
important and I think one one thing that
people wonder is like is all of this
ultimately just going to reside all this
kind of power
really and and knowledge going to reside
and in a few big companies you know
Google Microsoft where all your students
are now running these programs but I
mean these companies are so giant and so
powerful and seem to be so far ahead of
most in having the capability to really
advance these technologies so is that
going to be the case that that really
will be reliant on you know
big five companies to sort of develop
and hand down you know these these
technologies or is it kind of evolved
differently than that I can't speak for
the other companies but what's happening
at Google is they developed this very
advanced software for creating these
neural net models and they've also
developed very fast chips for making the
models run really fast and they're
putting all they made the software
public and they're putting all that on
the cloud so what's gonna happen is
people will be using a lot of Google
cloud services but what will be
available on the cloud is the same
technology as Google has and in fact
even within Google there's so many
applications that it's hard to get
people to design all these neural
networks so we now have neural networks
designing your networks and those neural
networks that design your own networks
will be available on the cloud so if
you're if you're a medium-sized company
that has lots of data suppose you're a
small supermarket chain you've got a lot
of data you'd like to predict what
special offers will suck in the right
customers who will then spend lots on
perfume or whatever you'd like to model
your data you don't want to have your
whole in house team of neural net
experts that aren't enough to go around
you'll be able to use the software and
use the neural Nets for designing neural
nets in the cloud so that the the
ability to model data this way is going
to be available to everybody of course
Google would like you to use the Google
cloud but I'm sure Microsoft will like
use the Microsoft right so will kind of
have neural networks has a utility yeah
I don't think an use yep okay well that
that's really fascinating well we are
out of time now and want to thank you
