the title is Pamela's vision industry
2022 2015 that's way in the future and
our panelists are Rodney Brooks Tom
Copeman and Andrew McAfee and why don't
I give you the floor first right oh
thanks thanks John so I'm gonna talk
fairly briefly I want to start by saying
you know we've heard a lot about AI
today and I think it's actually being a
good meeting because people have been
more realistic about the future of AI
than in many meetings but I want to say
a few words about the future of AI I
think a lot of people are confused about
how powerful AI is right now how many
jobs it could take what sort of jobs it
could take etc because they make some
fundamental errors in understanding AI
we've heard about the word suitcase
words today and I think people have
gotten very confused about what you know
I have had VCC but does your robot learn
oh it learns that's great it learns but
you know Andy and I both live in
Cambridge portney near here and we both
had to learn how to navigate around the
maze of one-way streets which is very
different experience from learning how
to use chopsticks which is a very
different experience from learning in
ancient Latin which I once did but just
because we've got one sort of machine
learning doesn't mean we've got broad
coverage of machine learning a second
thing I think people make mistakes about
is that we have good models of when we
hear a human performing some task we
know how to generalize that to what sort
of competence they have whereas we don't
know that with AI algorithms so Antonio
was talking showing pictures of people
carrying umbrellas in the rain and out
of those sorts of training sets you can
expect Google or you know Faye Bailey
from Stanford now Google have their
system looking an image of people and
and put a given label people carrying
umbrellas in the rain
now if a person does that you would
expect to be able to ask them for
instance well what does it mean in Japan
when people are carrying umbrellas in
the Sun what is rain do people get wet
when it rains what are people 10
raccoons carry umbrellas you'd expect a
person to be on answer all those
questions with these systems can't
answer any of them and the third thing
I'll just say I think people
overestimate this guess the topic
industry 20 20 20 20 50 people
overestimate how quickly top-down ideas
will trickled out into manufacturing
I was recently well first I'll tell you
because we just had a legal panel in
Europe the legal standard for industrial
equipment is under the Machine directive
and according to the Machine directive
any safety-critical code in an
industrial machine in Europe can they
either use pointers nor stacks and one
letter use them so they say I stuff
forget it
it isn't going to get there in those
safety critical systems lastly industry
today is based on automation is based on
programmable logic controllers PLC's
invented in Bedford Massachusetts in
1967 and what they do
PLC's is emulate electromagnetic relays
may remember them from early physics
classes a electromagnet pulling down a
piece of metal and making a contact they
emulate those and for a while after 1967
they started emulating the 24 volt wires
with an RS 486 character-based standard
now it's an Ethernet based standard but
the PLC manufacturers and people who
built PLC systems now use an Ethernet
cable as a one-for-one replacement for a
24 volt DC signal often but under
underneath it they're emulating
electromagnetic relays and even the
Tesla factory in the Bay Area has today
advertisements for PLC technicians
they're using emulated electromagnetic
relays to build self-driving car
good afternoon well I'm gonna shift the
debate because I think that's what we're
really here to do and that is to ask how
can we gain some control over technology
in the future of work so that we're all
better off 20 years from now and I
believe that we've heard a lot about the
the need to be a more inclusive society
a need to use technology more
effectively but we haven't really yet
engaged the strategies that need to be
put in place to do so so I'm going to
suggest four things that I believe if we
do these things than in 20 or 30 years
and indeed not even that long we will
all be better off we will use technology
more effectively we will be more
productive and we will have better work
with a whole variety of different jobs
and it starts by a redefining who makes
these decisions let's think about what
problems we're trying to solve let me
make it concrete
I think driverless cars are a silly idea
who wants driverless cars we want a safe
we want an efficient and we want a more
accessible transportation system that
augments and the work that humans do
behind the wheel and maybe that will
eliminate them completely but maybe it
won't and if we think about defining it
from a societal standpoint from the
stakeholders who really have a stake in
this that is the users maybe even the
drivers and I'll come to that in a
moment then we can start to think
creatively about how to augment the
technology and augment the work
effectively that's point number one
point number two is we tend to think
about technology and then we worry about
the workforce that's the wrong approach
that we'll never get this problem
address we need to integrate the design
of work systems and the design of
technology at the same time and make
them simultaneous choices and decisions
let me give you an example in the in the
auto industry a long time ago General
Motors was getting beaten up by Toyota
and they said we'll solve that
problem will automate we spent fifty
billion dollars at General Motors and
they still wear the high cost producer
why because they didn't listen to the
workforce about how to improve the
operations how to bring technology in
how to make those robotics and all the
the advanced manufacturing processes
really more efficient Toyota took that
approach and they continued to have the
highest productivity in the highest
quality that's an old example but I've
seen it in healthcare I've seen it now
in the airline industry where we over
invest because we don't let workers give
wisdom to these machines if we'd make
that our second principle I think we
will make progress the third is you've
heard a lot about training well I do a
lot of work on workforce development and
one thing we've learned over the years
is you have to train on a lifelong basis
before the crisis those same auto
workers who were trained to engage in
quality control and teamwork flexible
work systems a design of a work system
that made sense could then integrate
that technology effectively and really
make it sing to produce high-quality
cars at low cost but they couldn't do it
under stress by seeing the technology
coming in and then thinking they're
gonna get displaced it's too late to
retrain at that stage we need to train
on a lifelong basis and that means we
and universities and community colleges
in industry have to do our part to make
sure that the training is is preparing
people to participate in this process
and then finally we are going to have
some people displaced we are going to
lose some jobs there's no question
that's the history of technological
change we may lose more now I don't care
about these predictions about how fast
or who's gonna win the race are we gonna
create more or lose more jobs
that's a crapshoot that's the wrong
question the question is what are we
going to do to help those people who are
effective and you heard a number of
suggestions about that already we have
to compensate people for the losses we
have to help them make the adjustments
frankly I don't think our society can
afford another up
sowed of a big gap between winners and
losers like we're experiencing the
consequences of right now if we deal
fairly with those people who are who are
affected negatively then I think we will
make progress if we follow these four
principles and start now we will control
the future of Technology in a way that
does produce a more shared prosperity
and reduce some of the problems that
we're experiencing right now if we let
it to the technologists alone we'll
replicate the winners in the losers hi
all first of all thank you for hanging
in here for what has been a fantastic
day but a long one the good news is that
this is the last participant monologue
that you're going to have to listen to
today I want to take advantage of this
panel about industry 2020 to 2050 to
tell you what the three most common
questions I hear are about the future of
industries the future of economies the
future of competition and what my
personal answers to those are the first
question that I hear a lot is has our
economy been hijacked you can look at
the gap between rich and poor you can
look at the fact that we've got these
really powerful dominant companies you
can look at the fact that some people
are just doing just extraordinarily well
and there's a line of thought out there
that says our economy has been hijacked
it's been taken over by the financiers
it's been financialized and and we got
to take our economy back there's
probably more than none of that going on
but I think what's going on is that our
economy is just changing it's going
through structural transformation
brought on by the tectonic forces of
tech progress and globalization and that
does a good job of accounting for all I
think most if not all of the changes
that we're seeing for example it is the
case that more and more industries are
becoming more and more concentrated in
the u.s. it's also the case that most
industries are becoming more and more
concentrated around the world and if the
phenomena that we're seeing is a global
phenomenon it's a little harder for me
to believe that the plutocrats have
hijacked every economy around the world
so I'm much more on the side of
structural change as opposed to
hijacking of the economy the second
question that I get asked a lot is
do we do we need to worry about these
great big especially technology
monopolies have we finally created
permanent tech monopolies and my
prediction on that is almost certainly
not my career is long enough to remember
when we were worried about IBM as a
permanent tech monopoly I was I
certainly a lot been around long enough
to know talking about Microsoft as a
permanent tech monopoly we were worried
about AOL and for that one as a
permanent tech monopoly ten years ago it
looked like the worldwide phone industry
had been sewed up by a Finnish company
Nokia and a Canadian one research in
motion
so the pattern that we just keep seeing
is dominance relief powerful companies
come along take advantage of big markets
and technology but then disruption
something unseats them and the question
confronting us these days is is this
time finally different are the Google's
Amazon's Facebook's and apples of the
world categorically different only
honest answer is nobody knows but I
think there's a lot of reason to be
cautious about that the fact that I
can't identify what's gonna unseat those
companies doesn't tell me a thing I
couldn't have identified what was going
to unseat the previous generation of
company so I'm a lot less worried about
these you know the idea that we might
have a permanent class of technology
monopolies we should also keep in mind
that we're hearing a lot right now about
bringing antitrust actions against these
companies because some people feel
they're too big and too powerful the the
job of antitrust is not to protect small
companies from big ones and it is not to
protect a company from becoming not to
protect us from companies becoming too
dominant that's just not what that law
is therefore so I get really really
nervous when people talk about taking
that antitrust hammer out of the toolkit
and going to whack companies with it the
third question that I get asked all the
time is are there gonna be jobs in the
industries of the future and the answer
to that is yes but there is no guarantee
that there will be as many jobs in those
industries of the future as they as
there are today I hear a lot and I've
heard a couple times today that we
always benefit from bringing together
minds and machines and there's kind of a
Tharin implicit and explicit follow-on
to that which is therefore we're always
going to need more people to do jobs
that is flat not correct and history
shows us
but that's not correct there are many
fewer longshoremen for example in
America today than there were half a
century ago that's a job that is just
shrunk in the face of tech progress the
year of peak manufacturing employment in
America was 1979 we manufacture a lot
more stuff than we did in 1979 we do it
with many many fewer people so there's
just no iron law that says that
employment goes up as tech progress
continues we don't know what's going to
happen over the course of the next three
decades we are still going to have some
jobs around but they're gonna be fairly
different and in some cases they're
going to be less and number than the
ones we have today went a little bit
over damn thank you so as a reporter in
Silicon Valley I used to sort of divide
the world into now two three years into
the future which was product planning
and anything beyond that was science
fiction there was a lot of science
fiction which sort of puts me I think a
bit in Ron's camp but I wanted to start
by asking the three of you to respond to
high food today at lunch where he gave a
pretty relentlessly optimistic and
perhaps Pesa pessimistic and otherwise
view of the rate of progress of this
field of AI okay I mean are you on board
to what extent are you guys not well and
that's the second part of that question
it also was evocative to me and just the
sense that I had on the audience of I
guess you're all old enough to remember
the Japanese fifth generation and what a
potential threat it was to our computer
industry so could could you respond to
what what Caillou said today if you if
you heard it what's that's the AI guy
first well but first you know remember
Cathy was got a venture capital fund in
China his job is to be optimistic and
remember that there are a lot of people
in China a vast number of people in
China and the metrics he pointed out you
know are going up in China I was I don't
know where the Chi Foos still here or
not but I was you know a little taken
aback by some many other things he
talked about well we give up privacy in
China we give up this we give
that at least in the US we'd like to
believe we don't give up privacy that
may not be true but we like to believe
we thought I so the the risen from
Anderson mound oh and he also very
conveniently sort of skipped over
ripping off IP where he said well we
weren't ripping off IP no no no what we
learned how to do things the Chinese
companies doing and how to do things
I spent many hours in the last month
being in being deposed by lawyers over
IP total IP ripoff I mean down to the
point of stealing tooling for physical
devices in China so there's a lot of
lawless lawlessness there to which the
and the barrier around that is that US
companies and European companies can
only fight back by by fighting on the
edges as it comes out of China so he has
a very rosy view I I have a much more
sanguine view of what's going on there
is there is a battle going on there is a
fight and the US for the last I don't
know how many decades it says we don't
do industrial policy here China does
industrial policy with daggers out and
that says well that tells you where it's
gonna go long term well let me rod Nate
has to fight the IP battles I got thrown
out of China for trying to teach about
conflict management at the workplace and
in the experi the Chinese authorities
didn't didn't thought we were creating
the conflict I guess but in any event
the the the point here is if we have the
right institutions and policies we can
let AI evolve at its own natural pace
but I think to reinforce what rod just
said the difference between China which
doesn't want to
recognize any democratic rights and
wants to suppress all of the the
different voices and the different
institutions the rest of the world
largely is a world where people can't
express ideas can have a voice in
shaping things like technology can have
a voice in shaping what problems it's
going to resolve and if we have
institutions that allow people to engage
with AI and bring the different
stakeholders together so that the
technologists talked to the - to the
social scientists and so that the CEOs
talked to their workers and talk to
their customers and hear about the real
needs in their communities then we will
shape AI and I think we will probably
even maybe accelerate can't say
accelerate the technological frontier
but accelerate the acceptance of it and
the use of it to address big problems in
society that's the vision that I think
is available to us and that's why it's
it's so great to be an environment where
people are now recognizing that that's
what this conference is all about how do
we get some some control over the use of
it I don't mean limiting it regulating
it discouraging it channeling it in its
most productive ways the impression that
I get when I listen to people at events
like this when I talked to folk like Rob
is that we're getting really good I
don't know if exponential is the right
adjective or not but we're making very
fast progress on some pretty
long-standing pretty well-defined
problems in the domain of artificial
intelligence recognize images understand
human speech play go at a high level the
fact that we're making progress on those
to me is existentially insignificant and
i one of the it pains me to agree
categorically with rod Brooks but but
one of the one of the areas where he and
I are in violent agreement is that this
the silliness around the singularity is
exactly that it's just silly but these
the progress that we're making is
clearly economically significant and the
fact that most of the time when I talk
to my phone these days there is no other
person there and I'm not insane I'm
actually dictating
with very very high accuracy rates
that's it that's already economically
significant it's gonna be much more
economically significant there are a lot
of people whose job it is to listen to
what another person wants and try to
give that to them those jobs are going
to be confronted by a lot more
automation very quickly so um we're at
this juncture I mean none of you were
semiconductor guys but let me pose a
situation we've lived off of Moore's law
for five or six decades there's now an
active debate in Silicon Valley of over
whether Moore's Law is in abeyance at
this point and you know the most
interesting there's all kinds of data
you can cite but there is a school of
thought that the cost per transistor has
stopped falling and it hasn't fallen for
a long time intel hasn't turned the
crank and tick-tock for a while so if in
fact the AI revolution has been riding
on this free ride of you know falling
cost of computing and some good ideas
from the 1980s and all of a sudden we're
at a plateau how would it look different
yeah
Silicon Valley engine in general I
noticed AI has been riding on Moore's
law and Moore's law fundamentally works
on the idea that you know is is there a
csail cup on the table take away half of
israei seek sale cup on the table the
answer is still the same it's only when
you get down to one or about 20 atoms
which is where we are now in the silicon
size that it doesn't work anymore so
Moore's Law is coming to an end from
what is classically driven I happen to
think that that's the greatest thing
that's happened to computer architecture
for 50 years because 50 is everyone knew
exactly what was gonna happen two years
four years from now and they couldn't
afford to experiment now you see new
players like Nvidia with different
architectures coming about being driven
by AI problems because they they don't
have to go lockstep in that old design
although I have to tell you a story at
this juncture but I think is hilarious
there is a company that is a competitor
to Nvidia and this is notion of these
new architectures guide new problems
it's called graph core and graph core is
in Bristol and
people I know who've looked at it have
gone holy this is just like the CM
one so I mean we may still be making
progress off of old architectures they
were just too too early I think you've
already answered your own question we're
seeing really recent examples of what I
think are a pretty striking process at
the same time when if you're right
intel has not been able to increase the
the cost per you know transistor of its
chips so we're in this fallow period at
that level and in a very exciting period
at another level I have a lot of faith
that the that the different geeks around
the Moore's Law industries are going to
keep innovating whether or not they do
it at the at the coffee cup level in
ways that are going to continue to give
us all kinds of amazing progress so you
know we're talking if we're talking a
decade two three decades out how much
are we at the mercy of Hollywood in
terms of shaping our views of the way
tech now I mean I believe rod Brooks
once told me that you got into this
business after seeing a Hollywood movie
isn't that sort of proof of the fact
that does have an effect on the world I
can't tell you how many people I've run
into who saw the movie Space Odyssey and
decided to go into AI I believe rod as I
was already trying to build intelligent
machines but 2001 I was 13 years old or
something
validated for me that there was stuff
out there and I just fell in love with
how you know it was a murdering
psychopath but I think I think Hollywood
movies I think Hollywood movie style
thinking leads astray and and Hollywood
movie style thinking since we've got the
world just as it is and we put some
super technology in it but super
technology in real life doesn't come
from nothing it gradually builds up and
and so you learn about the technology
and adapt to it along the way and a lot
of the Hollywood movie plots I have an
adapted the technology which apart from
aliens arriving doesn't really make
sense technology versus culture I mean
what's driving us I mean is it I mean
it's interactive or yeah sure it's
always interactive I'm a lot more
worried about prominent voices outside
Hollywood scare mongering and
fear-mongering than I am Hollywood's job
is to tell us really compelling stories
these prominent voices I would wish that
they would be a little more grounded or
reasoned about some of the things that
they're saying are you without naming
names you talking about Elon Musk and
Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates those are
names yeah but it's so it's it's
technologists it's it's it's actually
the community that you're worried about
none of those three is an AI researcher
when I talk to AI researchers not just
rod Brooks I'm gonna channel Andrew in
here who has made a lot of the advances
in the field he's had a front row seat
he's been on the pitch he says worrying
about about big scary AI and killer
robots is like worrying about
overpopulation on Mars we are spending
way too much time on this
sophomore dorm room BS topic did I say
that strongly enough elin also said that
he wanted to die on Mars just not on
impact which I thought was one whose
guys go spend their money to colonize
Mars awesome go do that just stop with
the killer robots so it's getting laying
the day where we just letting loose you
also seem to have a grounded sense why
does this field tend to over promise do
you have a sense of what what well we
all we all technologies over-promised
that's the history of technology that's
why people get afraid of it and and we
fantasize about it we have movies about
it and we popularize it but when you
look at how it's being used on the
ground and you look at how people are
embracing it as users of technology
that's where the innovation the
continuous innovation comes from and so
I'm much more interested in seeing how
we can bring more people into the
discussion of how we use technology so
that we it both shares the benefits but
so that we get it's full utilization
we've seen way too many technologies
take too long to diffuse I mean that's
been the history from the Industrial
Revolution it took a long time for
us to make figure out that mass
production could actually use all of
this new energy that was available but
if you start to bring the workforce in
you start to Bing the users in they
begin to see the value of the the
innovations and the inventions and they
create new opportunities that's how our
laptops have freed up many of us up to
do some parts of our work and other
people to do some of the work but then
we see all kinds of new applications and
new innovations and new developments
particularly from young people so I
would look not to the Elon Musk's and
those characters yeah they're important
I would look to the next generation if
we educate them to be facile with the
use of technology and to give them the
opportunities to be creative that's
where the real value and that's where
we'll see the diffusion and the better
utilization of of all this wonderful
stuff I'd like to build on what Tom just
said there in a way I
I left my smartphone behind stage but
how many people you know have to go and
take a course on how to use a smart
phone right now smart phones teach you
how to use them right they come in at
just the level where most people are and
then they teach you how to use them and
so people are using these powerful
machines without having to do training
which is exactly opposite of how people
in the industrial equipment think about
oh this is a complicated machine there's
gonna have to be training I think you
know we should look for those models
where the machines teach the users and
teach the people how to be how to make
use of them and and use and be more
productive and and that's that getting
that blending of people and machines by
being open to the user the factory floor
user being open to it and encouraging it
is the way that we make progress go to
the Midwest where there are a lot of
people who worked in industry and who
came off farms and you'll find in every
garage a bunch of tinkerers people who
will take machinery and they'll fix it
and they'll modify it and they'll make
it a more fancy motorcycle maybe a more
powerful one or they'll
no uses for all of this stuff or they'll
create what some people are not talking
about fablabs that's that's a that's
that's a very decentralized
manufacturing they'll use old technology
to match with with new technology
because they they're very practical
that's the kind of innovative spirit
that we haven't fully tapped yet and I
think if we learn to tap that kind of
spirit from people who who have
practical problems to solve and see this
stuff whether it's a smartphone or an AI
system or or some robotics or advanced
manufacturing that's where the growth
and that's yeah the creativity comes in
and and and partially that requires a
cultural change in some of the companies
so well I'm putting robots in factories
that a minute for ordinary workers to be
able to train at us some companies want
to put passwords on them so they so the
factory workers can touch them instead
of encouraging other other companies
small companies tend to say who wants to
be in charge and someone steps up who's
never maybe only has a high school
education steps up becomes in charge and
becomes the expert and that's a change
in how you think about those two
different cultures that do you
understand why one one might be one side
like that dividing the other and the
other is there easy explanation for what
easy it's militia
just listen to them give them some power
workers have been beaten down in this
society both economically as we've seen
with the numbers and we all of have
those same numbers but our institutions
we don't have a voice at work anymore or
what used to be unions are essentially
powerless today so we got to create the
next generation of opportunities for
workers to have a voice and I don't mean
necessarily in the old ways but to
listen to the workforce and listen to
the the communities and listen to the
spouses who have a problem in their
house that they want it's fixed and the
husband who might have some skills will
will then figure it out yeah we may be
both ways maybe both ways
that's right I'm sorry one of the
interesting distinctions that that Eric
and I came across mere writing our book
was between companies were management
with a formal hierarchy of the
company thinks that one of the really
important jobs is to get keep the good
ideas and to be the guardians or the the
the judges of what's a good idea or not
when we talk to companies the ones that
I really respect I we saw over and over
again managers trying hard to get out of
that business and doing things like
giving not putting passwords on Baxters
and giving people access to stuff and
trying to you know for example say okay
that might be a good idea can you go run
an experiment and give that back to me
my job is not to like arbitrarily assess
your idea and tell you whether or not
you can go ahead with it and that that
shift is is it I think it's in its early
stages I think most managers have come
up in a world where they think their job
is to pass judgment on ideas that come
up the hierarchy I think it's going to
be a sharp differentiator between
successful companies and unsuccessful
ones so your point about sort of
reinforcing workers if increasingly
people are coming to the workplace
through these what are called talent
platforms these things these systems
that hire people through the the ubers
and what have you I mean can you see a
way forward where workers can
participate in a more meaningful way
when they're when they're actually being
atomized well I think that's a big
problem we've separated you know used to
be if somebody in Los Angeles had a job
open and they put an ad in the Los
Angeles Times and somebody came and they
went to work well obviously those days
are over that you have all these
intermediary staffing organizations and
we've got a project with the PhD
students that shows the number of
different organizations that touch the
person before she or he ever gets hired
that's a travesty because that's
productivity lost but but let me give
you the concrete example of how we can
use these platforms and and and benefit
from them and how workers are benefiting
do the experiment those of you who live
here in Boston do the experiment and go
on and you've got your uber app there's
something called fasten like fasten your
seat belt a competitor get go on get the
fast and I don't have any stock I don't
have any stake in this get fasten zap
use it sometime ask the driver they all
have uber
and fastened on their phones what's the
difference they all have the same
technology exactly the same the same
little car tells you two minutes three
minutes whatever it is before they're
gonna pick you up and so on it but the
drivers will tell you they respect us we
earn more money with fasten than we do
with her boob whereas the customers so
we got to stay with them but the same
technology they've listened to the
drivers this is what when a driver has a
problem with a customer or a customer
has a problem with the driver they
listen to both parties they don't just
blame the driver or drop the driver they
they pay the driver a higher fee rather
than then what uber does there's a whole
system of involving the workforce that
gets loyalty and I've done the careful
research I probably talked to ten of
them now or so and they all say the same
thing we like working for fast and more
we just wish they had more customers so
we can use this same technology exactly
the same to either drive down the work
force and maybe serve customers better
uber does a pretty good job of that or
we can use that same technology to
empower the drivers treat them better
have more loyalty and serve the
customers just as well okay last
question I think that was a surprise it
didn't come up more today but I you know
there's there's a debate on jobs I think
there's more of a consensus on growing
inequality in our society and I was
wondering if if you had a view on
whether technology was the culprit and
to what to what degree technology is
playing a role in driving us toward more
economic inequality yeah wait are you
asking us if technology is increasing
inequality I am what's Mark Zuckerberg
is net worth well okay my answer is yes
yes yes yes yes yes yes yeah that's the
wrong thing to focus on I I'm not
bothered about Mark Zuckerberg is net
worth I'm worried about the stagnation
of the middle class we we are having a
discussion about inequality which is a
somewhat important
discussion we are missing the bigger
point which is that that people have
stalled out and we have bad stagnation
in our city those two are not the same
problem we are focusing on the wrong one
so but the stagnation in wages
technologies had an impact with skilled
by as technological change no question
about that
but it's a minor piece it's a piece and
it was more important in actually in the
1980s than in the last two decades
that's the empirical evidence the other
aspects that that stake lead to
stagnating wages our globalization
especially in the last decade with China
in the in the World Trade Organization
so that's a peace technology and
globalization can't be separated anymore
they're there interacting so those two
are there but the other big thing that
has driven inequality and stagnant wages
is the decline of our institutions we
have kept the minimum wage at the
national level very low we have
destroyed unions unions had bargaining
power we have studied this for years
after 1980 they lost that bargaining
power they've gone down and that
accounts for about 20 percent of the
growth in inequality or stagnation of
wages since 1980 so we can deal with
these issues but we gotta have the right
set of policies and the right set of
institutions no we can't bring unions
back in their old image exactly but we
can build the next generation of worker
institutions that can add value to the
economy and then negotiate for their
fair share of the distribution of what
they hope to achieve and yes we need to
raise the standards so that we put more
pressure on firms to invest in sensible
technologies to be more productive so
the inequality or the stagnant wages
they're they're twins essentially our
don't worry about the Zuckerberg I agree
I don't care about him I do care about
the middle class what we used to have
the middle class lower wage workers we
can address those issues and we can use
technology to help advance their
economic welfare if we're smart about it
and if we're willing to make the tough
political decisions and and to bring the
work forces I am a little redundant in
this but bring the work forces voice
into this process they will do better
they have in the past great let's stop
there I think we're halfway there today
I think we're gonna get more of an
economic prism tomorrow but I wanted to
thank the three of you thank you John</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
