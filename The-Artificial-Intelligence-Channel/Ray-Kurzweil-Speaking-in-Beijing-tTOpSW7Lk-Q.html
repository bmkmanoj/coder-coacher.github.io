this group is pretty phenomenal this
conference was 200 people five years ago
now it's 2,000 that's exponential growth
which I will talk about and I think this
industry of innovation and high
technology has the potential to change
the world for the better
and I think we're well on our way to
doing that so let me share with you some
ideas quickly because I want to leave
some time for dialogue and one major
theme that I talked about is exponential
growth I decided I wanted to be an
inventor when I was five years old
thirty years ago I realized that the key
to being successful was timing yet to be
in the right place with the right idea
at the right time so I started analyzing
and looking at technological progress
and I started with the idea that you
cannot predict the future and I gathered
a lot of data and I made a very
surprising discovery there's one thing
about the future which is very
predictable there's a lot of thing
that's a lot of things that are not
predictable but the price performance
and the capacity not of every technology
but of information technology follows a
very predictable trajectory and that
trajectory is exponential not linear for
example the amount of computation you
can get or the amount of computer memory
you can get for the same price
approximately doubles every year and
that's a pretty phenomenal pace and our
intuition about the future is not
exponential it's linear we expect things
to go one two three four or five and
when you get to step 30 you're at 30 but
the reality of information technology is
it goes 1 2 4 8 by the time you get to
step 30 you're at a billion and that's
not an idle speculation I mean this
little device here is several billion
times more powerful for the same cost
than the computer I use when I was an
undergraduate at MIT and we're gonna and
that's going to keep happening 25 years
from now this will again be a billion
times more powerful for the same cost
it's also a hundred thousand times
smaller that'll happen again in 25 years
this will be the size of a blood cell
and it'll be a fantastic amount of
capability both in hardware and software
that gives you some idea of what will be
feasible so I want to talk a little bit
about the implications of exponential
growth and give you some examples of how
it's going to ultimately change
everything we care about this is the
first graph I had I had this actually in
1981 through 1980 this is the power of
computers for the same cost calculations
per second per dollar or per any unit of
currency and I had this through 1980
this is a logarithmic scale so as you go
up the scale we're not adding to
computer power we're adding zeros orders
of magnitude so a straight line on a
logarithmic graph is exponential growth
so every labeled level on this is
100,000 times greater than the level
below it so in 1981 I had the data
through 1980 and people look at this and
go our Moore's law but Moore's law
hadn't had hardly started in 1980 and
Moore's law which is shrinking the size
of transistors on a chip was not the
first paradigm to bring exponential
growth to electronics and the computers
it was the fifth paradigm they were
shrinking vacuum tubes in the 1950s to
keep this going that finally hit a wall
then we went to transistors and then we
went to chips and very soon we're going
to go to the sixth paradigm which is
self-organizing molecular circuits in
three and three dimensions already 30%
of all memory chips are 3-dimensional
so this little curve here represents
trillions fold increase in the amount of
computation you can get for the same
cost since a hundred years ago
and we're gonna multiply it again a
billion fold in the next 25 years but
look at how smooth a curve that this is
all the big events of the 20th century
where are they on this curve we don't
see them this has a mind of its own and
so this is very predictable and it it's
corresponds to every aspect of
information technology not just
computers so for example you could buy
one transistor for a dollar in 1968
today you can buy ten billion for a
dollar and they're actually better
because they're smaller so the electrons
have less distance to travel so they're
faster the cost of a transistor cycle
that's a measure of price performance of
electronics comes down by half every
year so that's why you can buy a cell a
smartphone today that's twice as good as
the one two years ago for half the cost
that's a four-fold increase in price
performance that's a that's a doubling
every year of capability for the same
cost that's a 50 percent deflation rate
The Economist actually worried about
deflation we had massive deflation
during the worldwide Depression of the
1930s but we actually more than keep up
with that deflation demands for every
type of information technology more than
doubles every year we've had 18 percent
growth in constant currency for every
form of Information Technology every
year for the last 40 years despite the
fact you can get twice as much of it
each year for the same cost
this is bits of memory shipped and it
actually more than doubles every year
and this is going to keep going and in
fact economic growth in the world comes
from information technology even though
it has a 50 percent deflation rate okay
this is the number of bits we move
around wirelessly in the world so a
hundred years ago that was Morse code /
AM radio today it's 4G networks but
again look at how smooth a progression
that is that's a logarithmic scale
every label level is a thousand times
greater than the level below it that's
again truly installed increase over the
next century but look at how smooth and
predictable a trajectory that is this is
Internet data traffic smoothly doubling
every year this is the size of the
Internet I had the first few points on
this graph and in the early 1980s it was
called the DARPA and at that time was a
predecessor to the Internet I did the
math and said wow this is going to be a
world wide web connecting hundreds of
millions of people around the world to
each other and to fast knowledge
resources by the late 1990s people
thought that was ridiculous when it
could only connect a few thousand
scientists every year but that's the
power of exponential growth that is what
happens and this is a whole nother area
of technology biology and biology and
health and medicine used to be hit or
miss we would just find things
accidently so progress was linear there
was still useful life expectancy was 19
a thousand years ago it was 37 200 years
ago but the progress was linear because
we just find things accidentally now
we're actually treating our biology as
software which is fundamentally what it
is
and the genome project which was the
enabling factor for this was itself
exponential the amount of data we
sequence doubles every year the cost
came down by half every year
halfway through the genome project which
was set to be a 15 year project only one
percent of the genome had been collected
so mainstream scientists declared it a
failure saying okay seven years one
percent it's gonna take seven hundred
years just like we said my reaction at
the time was oh we finished one percent
we're almost done because one percent is
only seven doublings from a hundred
percent and indeed seven years later the
project was finished and these
technologies today are now a thousand
times more powerful than they were a
decade ago and that general project was
completed and as such a sequencing the
data we can actually change this
outdated software
runs in our bodies and these ideas are
now entering clinical practice for
example if you have a heart attack you
have a 50% chance of having your heart
damaged today that can be fixed by
reprogramming adult stem cells to
rejuvenate the heart and if we had more
time I could give you many more examples
but 10 years from now these technologies
will again be a thousand times more
powerful than they are today they're
being assisted by computers that are
also doubling in power every year and it
will be a very different era we're going
to be able to dramatically extend human
life starting in about ten years from
the exponential growth of biology so one
field after another is becoming an
information technology
how about the the technology of physical
things three-dimensional printing it's
not quite ready yet to really change the
world but I think by 2020 the precision
will be submicron and we'll be able to
for example print out clothing
ultimately to go through the 2020s we
can print out food we can already print
out human organs
there was a girl actually had a damaged
windpipe and they scanned her throat
they designed using the computer a new
windpipe for her printed it out with
biodegradable materials using a 3d
printer then grew then grew out a new
windpipe for her using stem cells and
installed it surgically and it work just
fine we can we can also do that with
more complicated organs like kidneys and
animals and soon that will be done in
humans ultimately we'll be able to print
out human organs and all the other
things that we need in life and these
technologies are going to go inside our
bodies there are already already very
close to us when I was a student in at
MIT I had to ride my bicycle across
campus to get to the one computer that
all the students shared today we carried
them around on our belts or our pockets
that are on our wrists they will
ultimately go inside our bodies
one ideas actually have little robots
the size of blood cells to basically
augment the human immune system we have
these little devices they're natural
they're called t-cells it's our immune
system that fights disease but it
evolved thousands of years ago when it
really was not in the interests of the
human species to live very long so for
example our immune system doesn't work
against cancer it thinks that's you
ultimately we can create a device just
like the immune system but that is
programmed against all types of
pathogens so it could destroy cancer it
could destroy retroviruses which our
immune system doesn't work on and really
finish the process of the immune system
also they will go inside our brains and
put our brain directly on the internet
we have a limited capacity in our
neocortex which is where we do our
thinking so you know I mentioned that
this is thousands of times more powerful
than the computer that all of MIT shared
when I was an undergraduate there but
that's not even the most interesting
thing about it if I need 10,000
computers I can access it in the cloud
so we can multiply the devices we carry
around with cloud computing but we can't
do that yet with our brains ultimately
we will directly connect our brains to
the cloud and expand our thinking and
I'll talk a little bit more about that
I've been thinking about thinking for
about 50 years I wrote a paper as a high
school student as to how I thought the
neocortex works which is a part of the
brain where we do our thinking and I got
to meet President Johnson and that
started me on thinking about how the
brain worked today we have a lot of
neuroscience evidence that confirms the
thesis I had 50 years ago and I'm
actually working now on trying to
implement a synthetic neocortex and
ultimately we'll be able to connect to
that directly from our brains that's a
2030s scenario so and our information
about the brain is also increasing
exponentially the spatial resolution the
precision
of non-invasive brain scanning being
able to see inside the brain is doubling
every year the amount of information
we're getting about how the brain works
is doubling every year in this book I
have a model of how I believe the
neocortex works
it's a hierarchical system and I'll
can't describe all of these slides and
the time we have but let me describe
briefly how it works we have 300 million
modules in our neocortex and they deal
with patterns they can detect the
pattern
identify it remember it recognize that
pattern when it sees it again and these
little pattern modules are organized in
hierarchies and if our brain creates
that hierarchy from its own thinking so
that very quickly is a summary of how
the neocortex works so I'll give you a
simple example these are English letters
so I have modules in my neocortex that
can recognize the crossbar to a capital
A and that goes up to a higher level and
at that higher level that it can
recognize a capital A that goes up to a
higher level that might say the word
Apple information floats down also if
the Apple recognizer has seen a ppl but
is not seen E it will send a signal down
to all the e recognizers saying well I
think in E is on its way beyond the
outlook for it
the e recognizers will lower their
recognition threshold and that they see
something sloppy could be an e
ordinarily wouldn't think so but we're
expecting an e so it says yes I've seen
an AIDS good enough and since says yes
we've seen E and then Apple says yes
we've seen an Apple so information goes
up and down in the hierarchy in this way
go up another five levels you now at a
very high level of the hierarchy the
hierarchy now stretches into the
different senses so there could be a
module that sees a certain fabric smells
a certain perfume hears a certain voice
quality and says oh my wife has entered
the room go up another 10 levels and you
know at a very abstract level of the
hierarchy and you may have modules that
that say
that was funny that was ironic she's
pretty and you might think that those
are more complicated but actually
they're the same
it's the hierarchy below them that's
more complicated a very good example of
this there was a girl who was having
brain surgery and she was conscious and
talking to the surgeons you can do that
because there's no pain receptors in the
brain and they wanted to talk to her so
whenever they stimulated these points in
red she would start to laugh so at first
they thought that they're triggering
some kind of laugh reflex but they
quickly realize that no they were
actually triggering the perception of
humor she found everything very funny
whenever they stimulated these points
you guys are so funny just standing
there was a typical comment they had
found the points in her neocortex which
were at the top of this hierarchy that
actually recognized humor you may have
heard of the IBM computer Watson that
won this American TV game called
jeopardy now people tend to dismiss
artificial intelligence saying oh it
only deals with very narrow capabilities
but jeopardy is actually a very broad
game it deals with very subtle forms of
language humor and irony and puns and
riddles and it deals with all of human
knowledge so for so for example Watson
the IBM computer got this query correct
it was in The Rime category a long
tiresome speech delivered by a frothy
pie topping and Watson quickly said what
is a meringue harangue which is the
correct answer
the humans didn't get that it's a pretty
difficult question really showing the
sophistication of being able to deal
with language in a computer and Watson
got its knowledge not by being hand
coded by the engineers but actually by
reading all of Wikipedia and several
other encyclopedias difficult natural
language documents 200 million documents
and all and it's a good example of the
state-of-the-art in artificial
intelligence so my vision my
calculation is by 2029 we will have
enough information about the brain
computers will be powerful enough that
we can do we can actually achieve human
levels of intelligence pass what's
called the Turing test where computers
are indistinguishable from humans in
terms of human levels of intelligence
and what we'll do then in the 2030s is
we will actually merge with these
computers will have nanobots which as I
mentioned will be augmenting the immune
system but they'll also go inside the
brain and basically put our brain on the
cloud so I have 300 million modules but
if I'm walking along and I see somebody
important and I have to think of
something clever to say and I've got two
seconds to do it and my 300 million
modules and my brain is not going to be
enough I can actually access billions
more in the cloud just the way you can
access billions of computers in the
cloud from your smartphone and the basis
of this has already been demonstrated
but this will be a routine technology in
the 2030s and this is my idea of how we
will apply artificial intelligence we're
going to merge with it and make
ourselves smarter technology has always
been something that enables us to go
beyond our limitations a thousand years
ago we couldn't reach that fruit at that
higher branch so we've invented a tool
that extended our physical reach and
then we invented tools that enabled us
to build grant structures like the
pyramids and and then we invented
computers so that we could remember
things effortlessly and we now have
access to all of human knowledge with a
few keystrokes and ultimately we will
very literally expand the size of our
brains in the cloud and that's my vision
of how we will use these technologies I
think that will also keep these
technologies safe because it's not you
know you see a lot of movies where
there's one person that has the
artificial intelligence and threatens
the world it's not going to be like that
artificial intelligence is not in one or
two hands it's already in one or two
billion hands and will be in everybody's
hands you know within a decade
so there's controversy
as to whether these technologies are
helping or hurting the world and people
look at very short-term impacts but if
you look at the broad scale of
technology and read about what human
life was like a few centuries ago when
life expectancy was 37 200 years ago and
life was very very hard and filled with
disease and poverty we've come a long
way I'll just show you one graph of the
impact of these technologies over the
last 200 years these are all countries
these little circles the x-axis is
income per person wealth in today's
dollars on the y-axis you have human
longevity in years so this is 1,800
human longevity was in the 20s and 30s
were worldwide average 37 income per
person was in hundreds of dollars per
year of today's dollars so what happened
over the last 200 years well there was
the Industrial Revolution started in
England and the textile industry a few
countries were experimenting with it but
if you look at what happens in the 1900s
is a wind that carries all of these
countries towards the upper right hand
corner of the graph towards greater
wealth and greater health and I have
other charts like this showing education
and other parameters of human well-being
and at the end of this process there's
still a have have not divided but at the
end of this process the countries that
are worst off are far better than the
countries that were best off at the
beginning of this process and I
shouldn't say end of the process because
the process isn't ending this is going
to go into high gear as we get to the
more more mature phases of the
biotechnology revolution the
three-dimensional printing revolution
and so on and we've made great gains in
education we've actually tripled the
amount of education the child gets in
the developing world doubled it in the
developed world over the last half
century we're making fantastic progress
in energy solar energy is doubling every
two years and it's not only six
doublings from 100
which means it's now 2% of the world's
energy so people say that 2% that's not
very important ignoring the exponential
growth just the way they ignored the
exponential growth in the internet when
it was 1% or the genome project when it
was 1% 12 years from now that's going to
be another 6 doublings it will achieve a
hundred percent according to Deutsche
Bank were only two years away from the
cost of solar energy being equal or less
to the cost of getting energy from
fossil fuels and China is the world
leader in solar energy because it sees
the potential for this to be quite
revolutionary and ultimately this will
be very inexpensive and here's the
progress we made before health and
medicine was in information technology
this is the linear growth of Health and
medicine so we've multiplied by for life
expectancy in the last thousand years
we've doubled it in 200 years but this
is going to go into high gear very soon
10 20 years from now it's going to be a
whole different era in human longevity
as we begin to master the information
processes that underlie biology and
health at an exponential rate according
to my models 15 years from now or less
we will be adding more than a year every
year to your remaining life expectancy
so as you go forward a year your life
expectancy will move on away from you so
if you can hang in there for another
10-15 years we may get to see the
remarkable century ahead thank you very
much
you
