together an experience in virtual
reality
it's can clear that the future of
entertainment is built with imagination
and creativity and again enormous
amounts of data the data is the
foundation of innovation and of course
it's impossible to talk about data
without thinking about the future of
computing itself this is something we've
been tackling at Intel since our
earliest days tonight at CES I want to
give you a preview of where computing
will go next one of the fascinating
developments is the rise of neuromorphic
computing we've been building something
that truly mimics the way that the brain
observes learns and understands our
research efforts have produced a
prototype chip called Loihi to
understand more let's hear from some of
our team that has been working on it
traditional computing rests on this
basic idea of you have two computing
elements a CPU and a memory and
neuromorphic computing is throwing that
out and starting from a completely
different point on the architectural
spectrum our own brains are remarkable
in what they can do we're simply trying
to learn from what our brains the brains
of animals can do to make systems that
are smarter and more efficient and what
we're looking for is to connect all of
the neurons in the chip much like we
would with an actual brain so
neuromorphic computing is basically the
concept that we're going to simulate the
brain in silicon neuromorphic computing
will show up where they find an
application that benefits from being
able to embed the intelligence into a
device initially in areas of robotics
atomic
vehicles where the power and the size
and the adaptability are really
beneficial there's a number of different
ways that can go and we can see it
filling out the whole extent of machine
learning as people have envisioned so
it's a generalization of computer
architecture to really provide the right
tool to implement artificial
intelligence
what Luisi provides is just like your
brain it's going to connect up neurons
to get together and the way your brain
learns is it changes the connectivity
between your neurons what Louie gives
you is the capabilities to build a
network and then you feed in data and
then it will change the network as
you're going and learning and then will
tell you what the result is online at
the edge in low power it's really fun to
be a part of a project where we have the
strength of a company like Intel to
invest in these areas and to really
solve these hard problems with the whole
portfolio of great technology and talent
and normal for computing is it is an
extremely hard problem but it's one that
Intel's scale and expertise can really
be brought to bear and make a real
difference in the industry and for the
world so as you just heard neuromorphic
computing has the potential to change
the way devices understand and interpret
data but of course that doesn't happen
automatically and these devices have to
be trained with data in the same way
that the brain learns something new for
the first time this has been a major
research effort at Intel and today we
have a fully functioning neuromorphic
research chip our low e research chip is
the most advanced neuromorphic chip yet
developed and after only a few weeks
it's already performing simple object
recognition in the labs this incredible
technology is going to influence future
products and innovations and in the
years ahead
Intel will put Loihi in the hands of our
research partners to unleash the true
potential of our prototype we're really
optimistic about what this new kind of
computing can achieve over time
I'd like to take another leap in
computing though and this time make it a
quantum leap let's talk about quantum
computing for a second
the quantum computing represents an
entirely different approach to computing
this technology will be able to solve
problems that are insurmountable today
quantum computers are composed of
quantum bits or you often hear the term
qubits these massively parallel
processing to solve problems but today
the best supercomputers will take months
or even years to resolve so what can you
do with all this computing power well
one possibility is you could model
chemical molecular interactions for drug
development and this often requires in
testing endless combinations of
molecules to find the right solutions
with quantum computing this process is
dramatically accelerated this is just
one example of how we're thinking about
quantum computing today just as we usher
in the era of our classical personal
computing
we're pushing the boundaries of the
quantum computing revolution our labs
and researchers are committed to these
innovations and we see it as fundamental
scientific and an engineering challenge
now we've been working with the leading
Q tech labs or Delft University in the
Netherlands to test and build full
quantum computing systems and you've
probably heard us talk about our 7 and
17 qubit systems well today I'm proud to
show you the next step I'm proud to
introduce to you our 49 qubit quantum
chip this 49 qubit chip pushes beyond
our ability to simulate and is a step
towards quantum Supremacy point at which
quantum computers far in a way surpass
the world's best supercomputers we
expect to solve key technical challenges
that must be overcome to move quantum
computing forward it's quite a bit more
work
inquired than just this chip but this is
a major breakthrough in quantum
computing we're going to continue
innovating in this space to tackle
life-changing complex problems and
believe the most impact will be in
things like material science and the
discovery of new materials such as super
conductors and new molecules to advanced
pharmaceuticals the future of both
neuromorphic and quantum computing are
coming much faster than anyone imagined
and I'm confident that will transform
our lives for the better the next
generation of computing will be more
than about technology it will also focus
on how the industry positively impacts
Society this is where Intel has made
significant investments and impacts over
the years four years ago on the stage at
CES I talked to you about conflict
minerals and after careful researching
about where our minerals were coming
from we committed to use only conflict
flee conflict free minerals in our micro
processors now through further effort
with third parties and direct
validations by our supply chain
we've gone well beyond micro processors
to ensure that every product is labelled
conflict free
three years ago we took a hard look at
the data about women and
underrepresented minorities in the
technology industry and we knew change
was needed in 2015 we set a goal to
invest 300 million dollars over five
years to improve diversity in our
workplace and I'm pleased to share with
you that we've had great success we've
increased the diversity of intel's US
workforce and we'll reach our full
representation by the end of 2018 a full
two years earlier than we committed and
that's a major milestone for the
industry
we'll continue to publish our data on a
regular basis to prioritize diversity
and inclusion allowing Intel employees
to be part of a culture that positively
impacts society now there's a next area
that we believe we can go and impact
society and that's in safety and
transportation it's not an exaggeration
to say that the rise of autonomous cars
will be the most ambitious data project
of our lifetime it's significant and
will reshape our cities our
transportation systems and beyond that
will be one of the most positive social
forces technology is ever unleashed
because it's going to save lives
autonomous driving studies estimate that
over 1.25 million lives could be saved
as a result of fewer fatal car accidents
over a hundred and fifty seven hours of
commute time can be saved per person
every year through autonomous vehicles
and over a hundred and fifty billion
dollars in fuel costs can be saved in
the US economy over the course of a
single year as you can see the impacts
will be enormous we want to push this
technology even further we want to build
a platform that allows autonomous cars
to become a reality from commercial
fleets to passenger cars everywhere on
the road this isn't just an experiment
it's a path to the future it's not just
the technology it's about the safety as
well so to help us understand why I
believe autonomous vehicles are closer
to reality than anyone realizes
let me introduce one of the world's
great entrepreneurs and an expert in
autonomous driving the co-founder of
mobile eye professor Amnon Joshua
you
welcome to CES I'm not a great entry
thanks Brian it's great to be here so I
saw no hands on the wheels but this
doesn't look like the traditional
autonomous car there's no big lighter on
top there's it just looks a little bit
cleaner and smoother
well first I'm proud to introduce our
one of our first vehicles out of the
fleet of 100 cars that we announced last
year and indeed as you said all the
sensors are very discreet unlike what
you normally see in the media so last
year we had the pleasure of welcoming
Mobileye to the Intel family we believe
Mobileye has developed the most powerful
technology for autonomous vehicles
including this car you arrived in Mobile
is proud to be part of Intel and we are
excited to be working together on
building a world of safer cars yeah so I
think this audience would be interested
a little bit and understanding how
exactly the mobile AI technology can
lead us to a safer future with fewer
accents and and how you really see it
playing out well it starts with sensors
we have cameras about 12 cameras around
the car we have a cocoon of radars and
and laser scanners ladders all fed into
high-performance computing system on
ships from mobile I and an atom
architecture by by Intel so when we talk
about cameras we have three cameras in
front three different fields of view
which gives you about 180 degrees and in
total and an very high resolution so you
can see about 250 300 meters range we
have cameras wing cameras and side
cameras that give you half a sphere on
the side a rear camera and then for
parking cameras altogether twelve
cameras and then radars and and ladders
for a redundancy and I think we'll say
bye-bye to to Yemen thank you so the
social cost of proud accidents is just
too great and we believe building trust
between our consumers and the vehicles
is critical so we have identified four
areas that we are addressing to make
autonomous vehicle wheel first is
sensing and that's includes all the high
performance computing and mapping
driving policy which is about planning
and merging into traffic and then models
that provide safety guarantees which are
coordinated with the government
regulations okay so so let's start with
sensing since that's like really the
root of these cars I had this great
visual of a car behind us can you help
us understand what role Mobileye plays
in the sensors well let's start with
today today mobilized system-on-chip and
software powers driving assist cameras
on over 24 million cars so 9 million of
them installed during 2017 now we had 30
design wins with 27 car makers during
2017 and will be launching 15 production
programs in 2018 so most likely if you
are driving a vehicle equipped if you're
driving a vehicle is equipped with the
mobile eye and and this is real reality
and our technology enables driving
assist function such as automatic
emergency braking lane keeping support
traffic stand coordination and and much
more and we are in many different car
brands on the road this includes for GM
Aldi BMW Honda Nissan Hyundai and and
many more ok so can we talk about how
this all works and so I've got the
sensors now how does it really come
together well there are three pieces
though in the car that you have just
seen you have an architecture of
computing that processes the raw sensor
signals and create an environmental
model with every detail around the car
so we're talking about road users
objects and drivable paths then we have
massively advanced driving policy in
software and using a reinforcement
learning that makes decisions of driving
maneuvers that are and including
assertive ones and providing safety
guarantees together into this mix comes
also high-definition maps which creates
further redundancy and foresight of
drivable paths to make sure that nothing
of value is missed by the by the system
so I think you and I are big advocates
of this technology how fast do you think
this is advancing with what's the rate
of advancement here well actually very
rapidly we are developing faster
processing chips and superior software
and the very best architecture combining
iq system on chips and Intel's anthem
architecture to be more specific in few
months we are sampling our fifth
generation system on chip the IQ 5 that
is expected to run 24 terror operations
per second at an extremely low power of
10 watts role computing density is
important that's the 24 tear-offs
diversity of course is also important in
order to run different workloads but
power power is crucial right you know
this machine needs to fit in a car most
likely powered by a battery so every
what counts so that 24 tear offs at 10
watts is is an important set of
parameters it's not only important it's
the best on the planet now the industry
knows that we're pushing the boundaries
in addition to our level 4 partners BMW
fiat-chrysler active neo our latest
addition to build together a level 4
fully autonomous car is psychomotor the
largest automaker in China so you've
told us about the sensing but you know
one of the real breakthroughs that you
and I have talked about is in the
mapping and after all mapping is that
data that's so important so can you tell
us how you see that all coming together
with mobile I well first when we say
mapping we're not talking about the
conventional navigation maps that we are
all familiar with we're talking about
maps that are required for supporting
autonomous driving and their required
levels of details you cannot find in
navigation maps and creating these
high-definition maps is a big logistical
problem even more difficult is to
keeping these maps updated in real time
and we believe that crowdsourcing is the
only the only solution and this is
possible because mobile I has both the
crowd we have tens of millions of
cameras on on cars and we have a
technical solution capable of
compressing the data small enough to
communicate over wireless networks we're
talking about 10 kilobytes per kilometer
which is really nothing so cars equipped
with mobile eye cameras and chip act as
data collectors as harvesters and built
continuously update the high-definition
and we call this data collection Road
experience management or Remley let's
take a look at how it works in the
following clip so what you see here on
the left left display you see map data
these colored lines projected onto the
image frame and these lines are sitting
exactly on real line marks on the road
so I guess this gives you a sense of
accuracy we're talking about the
accuracies at the level of centimeters
on the right display you see the same
information that projected on Google
Earth again to give you a sense of
accuracy and accuracy comes from the
accuracy of the map data itself but also
accuracy of localization the system in
real-time localizes the car inside the
map so crowdsourcing is the most
affordable way to create real-time
up-to-date and accurate maps and the
industry is onboard we have production
programs this year launching from BMW
Nissan and Volkswagen they'll be
equipped with rim and begin
crowdsourcing and updating the rim map
in 2018 we have global mapping is
advancing rapidly and one of the most
exciting areas of photo no master
driving we're announcing today two new
mapping partnerships in China with the
psyche and also nav info and with these
new relationships Ram is in every every
major market so you know you and I have
been big advocates and believed in this
technology and the critical piece will
be getting the regulators and the local
governments to truly help us make this a
reality as well correct well I agree
Bryan we are embarking on the most
ambitious and comprehensive plan to
formalize the common sense of human
judgment human judgment of driving and
create a model of safety we call an RSS
that together we're the regulatory
bodies will make autonomous vehicles a
reality and this week will house
conversations on precisely this topic
there is a lot of interest and I hope
you join us okay so where do we go from
here
well I think it is time for you to take
a tour in our technology and take it out
on the roads and the car that you have
just seen is yours and you start driving
with it from home to work thanks hi
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
