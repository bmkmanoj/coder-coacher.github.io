this is Ontario today in this hour a man
you can bait with a tweet it's not a man
we can trust with no play or weapons
they will be met with fire and fury like
the world has never seen the board
concludes in no uncertain terms that
words matter the threat is real where do
we all fit him little rocket man we
can't have madmen out there shooting
Rockets all over the place if anyone
thinks such remarks that is nothing more
than a dogs barking can frighten us it
is really a wild dream every year the
clock is set by the renowned scientists
and security experts who consider
whether the planet is safer today than
it was a year ago the board takes the
unprecedented step the first time in its
history coming up one of the scientists
who helped set the Doomsday Clock it is
now two and a half minutes to midnight
North Korea just launched a missile
almost exactly one month ago on August
the 29th the sirens sounded in Japan
again two weeks ago run take cover
messages frozen on television screens
can you imagine how terrifying and yet
the most useful thing to do seems to try
to not feel anything at all what are we
supposed to do anyway my only other
touchstone is the 1980s way beyond Wham
leg warmers and crunchy mousse tup hair
the world was on edge Russia and Reagan
the songs the movies they all kind of
blur together although I do remember
that weird puppet video by Genesis when
the old president accidentally hits the
nuclear button instead of nurse how
gutted I felt after seeing the day after
it was a made-for-tv movie and the
images of those melted human beings with
wisps of hair weeping sores the
so-called survivors of a nuclear
holocaust those images stick talk about
teenage angst in the early 80s the
Doomsday Clock was at three minutes to
midnight today it's even closer it's
interesting to me to see that the
nuclear issue which over time has been
has raised and lowered in importance the
public doesn't seem to think about it
but it is still the major threat the
major existential threat to civilization
and we still have a thousand nuclear
weapons on a hair-trigger alert Lawrence
Krauss is our guest for the hour he is
the chair of the bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists Board of sponsors the group
that sets the Doomsday Clock the people
who weigh just how close to the brink
the world is today
a lot of us remember that song of Chris
sting if the Russians love their
children to transpose that to today this
is the toll-free number one triple eight
eight one seven eight nine nine five I
am NOT structuring a question at least
not here at the beginning because I know
we all want to hear someone like our
guest we can talk about perhaps even put
into words what we don't feel equipped
to do maybe you relate to this how
sometimes you know you feel afraid but
you just press ignore because it seems
like the only thing that's reasonable
for you know ordinary mortals to do one
triple eight eight one seven eight nine
nine five professor Lawrence Krauss has
an outstanding list of credentials where
would I start he exists in an orbit of
people like him who get very prestigious
scientific recognitions his connection
of course which I just stated to the
Doomsday Clock he is a theoretical
physicist the director of the origins
project at Arizona State University the
author of many many books including his
latest the greatest story ever told so
far why are we here and professor
Lawrence Krauss is actually joining us
by Skype from Oregon welcome thank you
for being here it's nice to be with you
virtually well we're thrilled actually
and I am because I thought about this a
lot you know I have to engage an
audience every day and I think how do i
how do I get at this and so here you are
with your unique insight and wisdom as
someone who calibrates the angst of a
civilization I'm curious actually just
to start because it played some music
there do you have cultural benchmark
yourself a movie a song something that
speaks these differently well yeah
that's the best I think that's why I was
happy using played the sting song
because I think relating things to work
popular culture it's a way to get people
involved the this from nuclear threat in
some ways it's overwhelming I think many
people would rather just not think about
it does it seem so terrifying but we
need to think about it and and and the
point is we shouldn't be you know the
Doomsday Clock isn't isn't designed to
fill people with despair the purpose of
it and it's been around for
seven years from since the physicists
who developed the atomic bomb decided
they needed to alert the public to the
dangers of nuclear weapons is just that
is to get people thinking about these
problems because it leader it's obvious
now in the world that our leaders are
not going to lead they're going to
follow and if the public is not does not
demand a safer world then they won't get
it and so I think that the intent of the
Doomsday Clock is to say look you know
we can do something about this that if
the if the public says look we just
don't want stand from world in which
we're increasing the number nuclear
weapons in which we're modernizing our
nuclear weapons in which would we have
thousands weapons on a hair-trigger
alert when we don't need them then I
think people will respond our
politicians will respond not because
they necessarily frankly want to do the
right thing but because they want to be
reelected hmm that's a bit cynical but
perhaps true right let me ask you just
because we started with in the 80s that
that sting song whatever I by the way I
remember an earlier movie called on the
beach which really affected me I don't
know if you you're probably too young
for that nobody know it's what you might
remind our audience a submarine right
yeah the submarine yeah and it haunted
me when I was a child which I mean I'm
not necessarily a good thing to do but
but but I think what the problem part of
the problem is a younger generation has
grown up in an era where we had over 70
years since the nuclear weapon was used
and you know and in the 1960s I remember
yeah and by the way I grew up in Canada
I didn't know if you know that but I
shouldn't tell the audience you grew up
in Toronto and then he went to Carleton
I went to Carleton in fact enough but
whatever matters I'll be back there in
October giving public lecture but but
even in Canada I remember the fear that
we get about about nuclear weapons we
didn't we didn't have to go climb under
our desks just in in efforts to try and
practice what you do in the event of a
nuclear attack but I have many friends
in the States who who did but but that
doesn't happen anymore and well and of
course it was ridiculous at the time but
I think people
I've also become a little bit complacent
because nuclear weapons haven't been
used in so long the assumption is that
we're fine we're stable and and we don't
have to do anything about it though the
status quo works but but but the status
quo doesn't work and Einstein actually
said it very well with a minute we have
nuclear weapons he said everything has
changed
save the way we think and that's the
point we have to realize that these
things are not useful weapons of war and
the world will be safer only when we
reduce their number and maybe eventually
get to zero but certainly reduce their
number and and the nuclear nations need
to act you know we sure we're worried
about North Korea and people are worried
about Iran but there is a
non-proliferation treaty which which has
been signed by most countries in the
world and the nuclear nations are not
adhering to the treaty part of the
treaty is not just that other nations
will not acquire nuclear weapons but the
nuclear nations are supposed to work
towards disarming and there's really no
movement in that regard in fact both the
United States and Russia are talking
about modernizing their nuclear weapons
fleet not what message does that send to
the rest of the world I want you to talk
a little bit more about you you you did
you've touched on it the Doomsday Clock
because people might have heard of it
they might have a DC comic reference for
it but because you raised Einstein you
know just give us just a thumbnail
history of where this came from you know
the the scientists who were behind it
way back when well yeah and it's kind of
daunting for me as chair of the board a
sponsored now because the board of
sponsors was created by Einstein
Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer robert
Oppenheimer was the physicist who led
the Manhattan Project and the first
atomic bomb and the tour then created
well hop create the bulletin because
because of the concerns after the first
use of nuclear weapons about the dangers
of nuclear weapons and the need to alert
the public and the board of sponsors was
a group of spoke distinguished
scientists who were there to try and
advise the bulletin on on issues
including the Doomsday Clock and that
and the clock has been around for over
seven years it's it's it's been moved
not always yearly but usually early or
semi early and or at least it's been
examined
and it's moved from the closest that's
ever been this is two minutes to
midnight the farthest is 17 two minute
minutes to midnight Anna and you know a
lot of people talk every year when we
consider we run we run symposium which
we used to call the doomsday symposium
which was a lot of fun but we know
looking at the real threats and then
trying to assess whether the world was
safe or not and and a lot of people who
would have every time we said it have
problems saying oh it's not it's not
more dangerous now than it was in 1980
or 1953 or whatever the point it is I I
will be the first to say it's not a
highly scientific process what's really
important is whether the truck clock is
moving forward or backward the absolute
value whether we're really a two and a
half minutes to midnight versus three
minutes to midnight as you said in your
introduction I think one can debate
those things but there's no doubt and
with the reason we moved it forward is
it the world is getting more dangerous
and and so in any case what we try and
do is not move it in response to
individual events people often contact
me and say oh you know because what
happened North prepared now because of
what President Trump just said shouldn't
we move it right now we try to take a
longer-term view so for instance it
wasn't moved at the during the Cuban
Missile Crisis at that time but we try
and look at the at the at the global
situation and ask what's happening in
the world so it's so we don't just
remove it every every day and and by the
way just to be clear about ten years ago
shortly after I became chair we started
to consider not just nuclear weapons but
the broader sort of existential threats
facing mankind and including carpa
climate change and and and now we're
considering biotechnology and cyber
terrorism those kind of things and it's
it I think what's really important about
the clock is as a symbol and when we set
the clock each year for one day tens of
thousands of newspaper articles are
talking about these issues which
normally aren't discussed and I think
that's what's important the real the
real motivation is to educate the public
and get people interested enough to
think about these kind of questions
which you know existential threats are
just not the kind of things that are
generally discussed in the news every
and and and and for you know many good
reasons but but once again if people
aren't alerted the intent is not to get
people to put their heads in the sand
and or or wait till the end it is to say
we can do something about this we've
done things like this before we
physicists and and the public for
example we're involved in that in the
non-proliferation treaty and then there
was a comprehensive test-ban treaty
which by the way the United States
hasn't ratified but we haven't we
haven't tested nuclear weapons the
atmosphere or no country has since the
1990s there's the kind of international
consensus and we can build that when the
public starts to be upset about things
it's not the public can actually make
things happen and so that's what we're
trying to do is reach directly to the
public and say this is of interest to
you help us do something about it so you
meet again in November like I do
physically all get together or dessert
you typically get together there's the
board of there's a science of security
board of the of the bulletin ism is the
board that strictly sets the clock the
board of sponsors on which I'm the chair
advises on that and I'm course at those
meetings and so we have up wait we we
have a series of meetings we usually
have a one day long informational
meeting where we bring in world experts
to discuss various issues to try and
help make us make sure we're grounded in
reality and then it's a long discussion
and always amazes me frankly although of
course the we keep it confidential
exactly how the details of what we're
discussing but but it moves in many
directions and then it arrives at a
consensus I'm always amazed each year at
that we we sort of eventually come with
consensus and and the consensus is last
year was clear that as you heard that
the the the executive director Rachel
Bronson I heard in the talking and early
in the show we we do feel that words
matter when they come from the president
and when they come in this case from
that from the head North Korea or at
that time with it was the the
rusha saber-rattling matters when when
when we need to in fact come back from
the brink and and we're and that we by
the way I should say when we set the
clock which we do in January we announce
it usually the end of January it was it
was four days after Trump was came to
power was inaugurated so he's actually
made the decision before he came to
power based on the statements he made
and also ongoing situations and around
the world including at that time North
Korea which we said was a an issue but
there other areas is India and Pakistan
there's there's many places where we
need to we need to look and ask is this
rational is what we're doing rational
and certainly for example this nonsense
that's happening in North Korea now is
not rational in any way in fact North
Korea and South Korea had early on in
fact discussed bilateral talks to lead
to a a nuclear-free area or at least a
zone where that where nuclear weapons
can be reduced we need to ask what are
we doing to try and encourage countries
to not have nuclear weapons is is
modernizing our own fleet encouraging
them not to have nuclear weapons is
potentially backing out of treaties we
made with countries how about nuclear
weapons does that tell people countries
that they should enter into diplomatic
relations with us if I can't anything
the United States is doing right now is
in my opinion sending the wrong message
professor Krauss I just want to remind
people because we do have callers I'd
like to get a few in before we break for
our local news and weather and and just
to clarify then you meet again in
November I get this picture in my head
like knights of the round table injury
all hello jury jurors but will there be
a new time set did you know and Jamie
were and the reason I'm asking is of
course the Winter Olympics are in 28
like start in February which according
to your timeline now means we would have
possibly a readjustment of that
hypothetical I should underline that it
is a hypothetical Doomsday Clock there's
no there's no physical clock I should
make that clear
well look we don't know we don't have
any commitment to move it in there
minute they're big years we haven't
moved it at all okay and years and since
I bet you're we moved backwards so it
does
always go in one direction yeah although
we're all listening to the news these
days that will cross-examine you on that
let's go - Irwin in Toronto Irwin go
right ahead
hi Lawrence I taught you calculus and
differential equations at Carleton give
you a pleasant boat discovery I'm very
aware of your tremendous contributions
to physics and dark energy expansion of
the universe etc the question I want to
put you hold on her when you were his
professor is what you're saying ok
Carlton ok go right ahead do you have a
question recently North Korea threatened
electromagnetic pulse attack on the
United States could you please explain
what that means and the implications for
Canada well yeah I mean once again North
Korea first we should make you clear
North Korea makes lots of threats but
it's not clear whether that's bravado
it's not even clear that they can put a
nuclear weapon on a missile and a
ballistic missile so that we should
recognize that a lot of this is talk and
and there's no clear evidence but we
should take it seriously but
electromagnetic pulse is just as the
fact if you exploded a nuclear weapon
the atmosphere it does produce because
because of a rapid movement of charged
particles it produces an intense
electromagnetic pulse that can knock out
communication systems over a region over
in fact potentially as in some cases
depending what you're doing as large as
the continental United States it would
have implications for Canada but so that
that kind of explosion could have severe
implications same thing that happens
when there's a solar flare by the way
with when charged particles of moving
past the earth any extreme
electromagnetic pulse
will will generate currents in machines
like computers it's the reason we can
charge iPhones now eventually without
without hooking them up we just have
changing electromagnetic fields that
causes currents in it in the phone that
can charge a battery and that same kind
of same kind of physics could could in
principle be used to knock out
communication systems and for a long
time people have talked about using
nuclear weapons to generate such a pulse
but once again whether North Korea could
do it or would do it it would be of
course insane for it to do it because
that's one of the problem
because you get to this I really want to
ask this question this week is a friend
of mine you know knowing that you were
gonna be on this program actually
reached out to me but I think it gets
into the insane or nuts or unstable and
pretty unpredictable right that for a
long time there's a feeling at least
even among the you know on the people
like ordinary people that some of this
has worked because somewhere along the
way the strategy was working and and he
was quoting Thomas Schelling in a New
York Stern's
obituaries idea of you know using the
example of a driver in a game of chicken
who rips off the steering wheel so his
opponent can see that he no longer
controls the car and so once you know
that your opponent is ripped off the
steering wheel or detonated something
like you swerve because you know he's
out of his mind
but you know what if both drivers are
completely unpredictable
well Korea has has often used bluster
but it's been but in fact it's been
fairly strategic about trying to achieve
some level of well frankly on some level
of internal security if they look around
the world and and I hate to say this but
they look around the world they say well
okay
Iraq was invaded didn't have nuclear
weapons and we're not and and and
there's there's clear evidence as I say
even in the Curtin Jim Jones father was
willing to negotiate and came to the
table with South Korea to talk about
potentially normalizing relations at
some level I think I think any any
country with any individual would
realize that that they are insane to to
to attack the United States or Russia or
any of the major nuclear powers because
the United States as I say has all the
countries have overkill
the ballistic missile that the
reasonable istic missile is called
ballistic is because it falls a
trajectory that is governed by Newton's
laws of physics that means when it lands
you know exactly where it came from and
it gives a big x mark for obliteration
and i think we have to realize at this
time that a lot of the bluster and and
unfortunately there's a there's a lot of
as you say game playing back and forth
and and games of chicken but
but so far the North Koreans of them
have always stepped back from from from
the break at this level because they use
their blustered internally and
externally but I can't imagine that kim
jongmin doesn't realize that that while
he could certainly maybe create a
devastating blow for the United States
or some other country that it would it
would be a result in essentially instant
obliteration and not just for him but
for millions around in the in South
Korea as well I think that that we're as
I and I want to indicate once again
there's no evidence right now the North
Korea has the capability to do any of
the things that claims to do we can do
what it is what people are confused by
that I'm sure they're like what do you
mean the sirens blowing in Jordan Korea
has been able to has been able to
demonstrate to things that it can
explode nuclear weapons and although
it's said it's had a hydrogen bomb
there's no evidence against a hydrogen
bomb that that the strength of the
explosion was not anywhere near the
large hydrogen bombs that were used in
other countries and it has it can
demonstrate to has ballistic missiles
but putting those two big things
together to make a weapon is very very
different you have to make sure the the
nuclear weapon is small enough but you
also have to make sure it can survive
the intense heat that when a ballistic
missile goes out into space it comes
back and you know when you see the
spacecraft come back from space is huge
fighters and and the heat generated is
intense and you have to be able to have
an incredibly sophisticated system that
can only survive that in fall through
space but also be able to operate and
have the electronics work to be able to
do what it's supposed to do and those
need none of those capabilities are yet
demonstrated the point though is that we
shouldn't wait till they are we should
try and develop diplomatic okay I have
told you they were wrong off killing
these maybe we'll get back to that in
the latter half the problem we've got
Peter on the line waiting as well and
Steve in Ottawa we have professor
Lawrence Krauss he's a theoretical
physicist at Arizona State University
one of the scientists who helps to set
the Doomsday Clock we're gonna take a
break you can hear here
naina this is the German version by the
way she apparently never liked to the
English translation of 99 red or lift
balloons as you may know it and has
never sung the English version version
we're opening up the phone lines one
Schiphol 8 8 1 7 8 9 9 5 maybe you have
a question you'd like to put 2 Lawrence
Krauss you heard one of his former
professors from Carleton gave him too
late pluses I think he said we're back
in 90 seconds
you're listening to Ontario today in
this hour a man you can bait with a
tweet it's not a man we can trust with
no player weapons
with fire and fury like the world has
never seen the board takes the
unprecedented step the first time in its
history it is now two and a half minutes
to midnight open lines with one of the
scientists who sets the Doomsday Clock
one triple eight eight one seven eight
nine nine five our twitter handle is at
cbc ontario today it's interesting to me
to see that the nuclear issue which over
time has been has raised and lowered in
importance the public doesn't seem to
think about it but it is still the major
threat the major axis natural threat to
civilization and we still have a
thousand nuclear weapons on hair-trigger
alert professor lawrence krauss is a
theoretical physicist at arizona state
university one of the scientists who
helps to set that Doomsday Clock he
chairs the bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists Board of sponsors he's got a
number of publications including his new
book called the greatest story ever told
so far why are we here
I say you tackle all the light subjects
let's go back to the phones Peter and
were you calling us from Toronto okay go
right ahead you've been I know you've
been on the phone for a while listening
maybe even your original impulses change
somewhat but what have you been thinking
about these days or do you have a direct
question for Lawrence Krauss well so far
I've heard the the issue brought up
about the public being should be aware
and get involved etcetera etcetera yet
it's just been vague very vague
generalities from your guest on that
issue
unlike taxes or say the h1n1 topic or
terrorism or climate change issues
individuals can get involved on their
own little world their own little way
yeah this is an issue where I don't see
anything being positively brought up on
the topic except to create stress and
make people anxious and create tension
let's face it there's not a thing your
guests or you or I can do to to bring
this tension down you can write another
letters you want to Kim jong-un and the
fact is he also said none of those
capabilities are seem to be evident yet
so why is the being moved ahead if
none of the capabilities are seem to be
evident that this guy's dangerous and
with his button and and also a judge
aspiring seeing Kim jong-un being made
less of an evil person often and then
Trump you know it's the bravado the
Trump of Trump that gets all the
airwaves and yet this lunatic and he is
a loose cannon lunatic there's you know
you can have a billion people write
letters who won't do a thing simple fun
well well actually that's you you were
incorrect in a few of your remarks so I
don't have time to go through all of
them but but first of all we've not said
we're moving the clock forward this year
so we'll wait and see what happens we
moved the clock forward in fact not
response to to to Kingdom on it that
exactly remove the clock forward in
response to that to the to the loose
cannon that you were talking about
earlier but but one thing where you're
very wrong is that is people think that
they can't have an impact on politicians
they can people in in the United States
at least and I'm pretty certain the same
as proofer for members of problem in
Canada if an office receives ten phone
calls in a day on a certain issue that
can have a huge impact and ultimately
what we're trying to do is encourage
politicians to take an attitude which is
one aware diplomacy will work the Iran
nuclear deal is a great example of how
diplomacy can work it diffused a tense
situation that might have been military
and came to a compromise which but with
both countries accepted which has
reduced that threat incredibly there are
clear examples where this can work what
if you think about people lashing out
usually people latch out when they feel
threatened if if if the United States
can convince and state publicly that
they have no intent for to destabilize
North Korea though they have no detent
to invade or attack
Faria that the intent is to try and
produce a peaceful coexistence of
countries and not infringe upon the
sovereignty of that country then that
will go a long way to to arresting the
situation that that that there's every
bit of evidence in qingyuan as an estate
it is using these as a defensive
mechanism he does not trust the United
States what the United States and other
countries need to do is demonstrate that
that as we did with Iran we can try and
live peacefully together and and so you
and others can by writing politicians
and of course in Canada it's probably
less significant at this point than the
United States you can actually impact
and in this case members of Congress or
an orb or you or Parliament
it doesn't take it doesn't take
thousands of people in this given
constituency if someone were in if a
congressman or a member of parliament
receives just a few phone calls and a
certain issue it can cause them to act I
wonder just a quick thought for me is
that do you feel like that's the tangent
is an answer the tenants just it's so
it's such a general statement if I can't
get responses on things that directly
affect my life like crushing taxes and
so on that has to do with me my country
my constituency any everything within
Canada if I don't get responses there
you disk I really expect Kim jong-un to
pay attention responses means yeah you
you know everyone is in a situation
where they can work locally to impact on
global events it seems it's it seems
very daunting but it's happened it's
happened many times from the war in
Vietnam to in fact
nuclear disarmament issues and and and
people can act locally you can work with
your local groups you can you get your
schools or churches or whatever you're a
member of and it you're right it seems
very daunting and I know it does but you
can either choose to give up and just
let let people go ahead and do what they
want or in fact one thing you can do is
choose to what
do what I try and do and what the bold
president which is educate people so
during the next election they might vote
for people who have rational policies
okay so I mean I'm gonna intervene and
democracy only works if you have an
informed electorate come on part of this
is informing the electorate
listen glad Peter you got through though
cuz - yeah it's good - this is where the
rubber hits the road right they're real
people so it's I I like that he made you
work hard Steve yeah Steve you're in
Ottawa go right ahead
do you have a question or comment I do
thanks I'm so glad we're talking about
this I mean this kind of thing does keep
me up at night and and there is I
understand the sense of powerlessness
but we are here in Canada and so we have
to focus on what our king government can
do and my question is about this you
know like like while the threats are
going back and forth at the same time at
the United Nations over the last few
months there's actually been a new
treaty working out called the ban
nuclear weapons ban treaty or the
prohibition treaty I mean it's not
perfect but it's the first movement in a
generation to begin to put the issue
back on the table and lots of countries
are signing it and when this was raised
in in Parliament people were really
surprised you know whether Canada would
sign on and join with the 50 or 100
other countries that are saying our
Prime Minister said it was useless
because the nuclear weapons States
wouldn't agree to give up their nuclear
weapons well that just seems kind of
ridiculous to me and very disappointing
especially since you know it's Donald
Trump and other nuclear weapons States
are actually sending memos to NATO
countries to say don't you dare sign
this well gee that says to me maybe this
thing is important after all Steve can I
ask you why does it keep you up at night
like and why do you know so because you
know you're obviously deeper along the
spectrum you know you do study this is
it a field that you work in well yes I
mean I've followed this for many years
and have worked for nuclear disarmament
I'm actually you know I grew up in the
Cold War I remember the day after and
all the movies and I read on the beach
when I was in seventh grade but Nevil
Shute it was my first experience with it
and continue to go to you know Hiroshima
and Nagasaki remember enjoys because it
is I agree this is the big issue
that could wipe us out in a wipe us out
in a flash well and I wondering if if
even our guests might Michael we reflect
on this because I've talked a lot of
friends obviously colleagues in the days
and how trying to figure out how do I do
a show on this
like what's different I mean do we need
even a Doomsday Clock to tell us that
we're in dangerous times you know you
know a certain generation ago people
would go to Europe and they go on the
trains with their past they weren't
worried about the trains blowing up I
mean they just feel that there's a lot
of other things in the world that are
different and that the nuclear threat
maybe has been a sleeper thing for a
long while professor Chris Chris well it
has been and I mean a good example of
why I think we need the Doomsday Clock
is I would be talking to you right now
about an issue that we need to deal with
if it weren't for that symbol and it so
it causes people to talk about these
things think about them and maybe to get
back to the last listener to act but
your current the current question asked
by the listener is a very good one yes
and Canadians may feel like they're not
part of the problem and therefore they
can relax and you know and then as
someone who grew up in Canada oh I know
that feeling
but candidates can be a force for good
or bad and and there's many times where
diplomacy in Canada has it has impact on
the world of course when I was living in
Ottawa
she Lester Pearson wanna know about
prize for for for impacting positively
differ with diplomacy and I think Canada
to say it I think it's perfect I think
realistically what the prime minister
said that that this won't cause the
United States disarmed is absolutely
true and but to say it's useless to send
a message that that other countries
around the world seriously think
something has to be done I think it's
very unfortunate and if and and it it
would be good it would be it would send
a strong signal if if other Western
developed countries all agreed to sawing
this particular nuclear weapons ban
treaty because it would indicate that we
really need to move towards a world with
fewer nuclear weapons do you see a world
of complete disarmament like from your
perspective because you know this stuff
do you ever imagine that that could
happen well of course I'm paid to
imagine things that we wrestle
you know but you know and so certainly
as possible is it possible the near
future no but what we can do is move
towards that goal and and the world you
know the United States will be safer
with half as many nuclear weapons
because it's not just it's not just the
use against other countries it's a it's
the possibilities for accidents here
it's the fact that that the
modernization of nuclear weapons is
going to cost a trillion dollars in an
economy that desperately needs money for
other things so we should realize that
money we spend in one thing it takes
away from money we can spend on other
things useful infrastructure the health
welfare those sorts of things and so we
can we can definitely say that we'd be
safer with fewer nuclear weapons and I
think that alone is an important goal to
just get countries to come back to the
table not just with North Korea but the
United States and Russia and as I say
Canada and other countries can be a part
of the solution I remember when I was I
was back in Ottawa bunch of years ago
you know create Carleton and at that
time there wasn't a push under the
George W Bush for the Canada become part
of a missile defense system which was
useless and and Canada can choose to
either agree to become part of the
problem or agree to become part of the
solution Lawrence Krauss is with us he
chairs the bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists Board of sponsors this is the
group that adjusts the Doomsday Clock
this an analogy that came out of the
Cold War of with the state of the world
the existential state of the world we
didn't get into this too much but you
folks also add in climate change now so
it's not just the nuclear threats I want
to mention we've tweeted out the link to
the website for this the the Bulletin of
Atomic Scientists a lot of really
interested curated article so if you're
interested in this or this is sparking
an interest for you you're listening to
our gassing you know I want to know more
really doesn't get factored every
listener we produce articles by experts
that are read by policymakers in this in
the United States and around the world
and that's one way we really can affect
things by actually trying to bring
reality and facts rather than I believe
so sorry to interrupt but I know that
the important aspect of the vote
been a bit of interesting bedtime
reading for me that's two nights and I
connected with you but even the headline
you know our Switzerland in Sweden the
keys to easing the North Korean crisis
it goes in a lot of we're not going to
be able to cover this in 50 minutes on
the radio maybe you'll come back
sometime Miriam you're next you're in
Windsor tell us some your perspective I
think you can your microbiologist yes
I'm not a clinical microbiologist and
just recently I knew you know new to
being a grandmother so my concern when I
hear this kind of news is like oh my god
number one I was worried about climate
change number two I know that
historically the world has suffered
plagues and all kinds of biological kill
effect from all kinds of organisms we
got this
malaria drug-resistant strain out there
now so now it's nuclear and I'm kind of
like if you factor in all of climate
change biological possibilities really
what can I do about it I know I can do
something for climate change I know
biological stuff I'm not going to go to
malaria written countries or parasites
with written countries but I I want a
future for my grandchildren and my
children and how can I do something
before I let our guests maybe answer it
I guess I know if you're asking for
specific remedy or not but let me ask
you how old is your grandchild by the
way oh okay just don't you we think well
what I was going to turn the mirror back
on you and say so in your real life
world right that's sphere of influence
of your life I mean how do you talk
about it how do you talk to young people
or you know do you play into it you just
turn away do you go looking for more
information you just sort of cringe and
turn off the TV yeah well on the other
hand I've also on a live aboard sailboat
person for five six seven months of the
year so I have a very small stamp on the
world as far as energy and needs that's
concerned and I can live really small so
my kids see us live this type of life
and it's great it's sort of like that's
how you talk that's what you do but yeah
do we have that
dialogue out on the table with them not
recently that's for sure yeah I mean I
have a friend it's not stuff I mean he
asked me every day what I do on the
radio you haven't answered the question
for today
what is Miriam have you thinking about
well you know I think it's important
that you know the purposes you know you
don't need to unduly scare children and
that was a big problem when I was a kid
because of those those ridiculous
exercises in school mm-hmm but I think
what we tried looked at there's a famous
statement if the only tool you have is a
hammer everything looks like a nail and
I'm an educator and I think what we can
do is try and educate people about the
situation so that they can act more more
positively and could certainly I know
which things can be we can do something
about it which things we can but let's
remember that then when you feel daunted
now the non-proliferation treaty which
was probably the major treaty reducing
reducing nuclear threats in the world
came to force in 1970 that was during
the time of Richard Nixon okay who
wasn't a notably pacifist president it
came into effect because it was a
massive public movement to support after
in fact it was the explosion nuclear
weapons in the atmosphere that convinced
people look this is this is not just
playing around this stuff is dangerous
even in it even in not having a war this
stuff has to be taken into account
we have moved backward many times and of
course and as people will point out
we've lived 70 over 70 years with
nuclear weapons without their use
against the civilian population and
there's been a lot of people working
hard and there are a lot of people still
working hard around the world diplomats
and other people trying to ensure that
we we can live in peace but the public
needs to demonstrate an interest in this
and you know I write pieces all the time
and lots of subjects and in lots of
magazines and newspapers around the
world and I'm often sadly surprised when
that when I write about nuclear weapons
there's almost no response it's the one
area where people seem to say I'd rather
not think about it wasn't just ugly you
know and it's one thing to say we
shouldn't scare people but we can't we
have to face the world as it really is
and there are real real dangers and to
pretend they don't exist and to pretend
we can't do anything about them is to
ensure that we won't do
anything about them and we have to
realize that we can and we need to that
our future is in our hands I this is a
perfect place I'd like to ask you
because it gives you an opportunity to
talk about perhaps your latest book but
I know we did tweet out a piece you
wrote about a year ago I guess in
October the real nuclear threat which
was in The New Yorker when you say what
what sorts of things two people contact
you a butter or is it more when you get
into debates about religion for example
is that where you hear from people and
not on pieces like this if I mention the
word religion response if I mentioned
Donald Trump Cruz and whatever I may say
about him or even you know or I'm happy
to say this when I write a positive
pieces I just did recently about about
the the Voyager spacecraft that left the
solar system of humanity finally has a
something that will survive no matter
what happens to us and go out into the
cosmos and maybe one day discovered
happily that kind of thing inspires
people but yeah religion individual
politics but but no matter kinds of
homes even climate change of course will
produce remarkable spots usually a
hateful one but nevertheless a response
nuclear weapons I don't even get hate
mail okay okay let's go back to the
phones because I have a ton of listeners
who aren't gonna all make it on the air
but I wanted them to understand the
breadth of who you are at least give a
glimpse because of course you were also
in a documentary called the unbelievers
they would know the name of Richard
Dawkins and you and it follows of both
of you you know as you go around the
world discussing science and reason and
again a number of books including this
latest one I should give the title again
called the greatest story ever told so
far why are we here now sometimes it's
they associate the greatest story ever
told to a biblical story but this book
is not that story which is I like to say
as the Goldberger is going to the
universe see now you're gonna get lots
of email your role here today with the
Doomsday Clock James and Oakfield you
have a question for our guest general
comment I guess about the situation I
mean your desk mentioned how technically
challenging it is to
launched one of these missiles and that
just got me thinking I mean it a lot of
people don't realize this but Canada is
actually in the flight path between
these two countries if they chose to go
to war you know and if there's any
problems I mean obviously it would be
bad if the u.s. got hit because their
trading partner and next-door neighbor
so we'd obviously been affected but you
know if there's a problem with one of
the missiles they could drop on us too
and so we certainly have some sort of
interest in that no it's just thinking
yum Canada it loves to play the
Peacekeeper role well why not have our
Canadian diplomats
I'm sorry chance in North Korea because
my understanding is Canada is actually
viewed positively in North Korea so we
would be an ideal broker between the two
and what for you James when you think of
Canada in the flight path what does that
mean to you
well I certainly don't want to see
anything happen to Canada in general I
mean I grew up during the eighties you
know watching all that that stuff from
love kind of confusion that was
definitely a as a child kind of a scary
time to grow up and yeah it's yeah
hopefully you really hope that the world
leaders understand you know war is a
last resort and there's no such thing as
a nuclear war it's a nuclear holocaust
but you know and I'm actually as your
guest also points out North Korea is
actually very strategic and I get the
feeling that might actually be some
wherewithal as to what they're doing
there and I I'm not so sure right now at
least on the American side you think
that something is very easy to go there
yeah and we said a lot James go ahead
lawrence krauss well you know you James
you point out something very interesting
and that that is it no country is an
island when it comes to when it comes to
these global issues and via climate
change or nuclear weapons Canada is true
is you know is not a major nuclear
player but but we all are will be
impacted by any kind of any kind of
nuclear confrontation
that's not just the economic aspects in
it
and the political aspects but you know
again III don't want to see I'm trying
to scare people but you know Indian
Pakistan and have a huge rivalry each of
them have about several hundred nuclear
weapons it's been shown that if there
was a nuclear confrontation between
those two countries with 50 nuclear
weapons for example exploded as far a
remote and removed as you can imagine
from Canada that in fact the effects in
the atmosphere would affect agriculture
around the world for 10 years and people
have argued that there could be as many
as a billion people die of starvation in
various countries because of that so
these no country is immune a and
Canadians should not imagine that that
the threat is just against the United
State States we all we're living in the
21st century we are having a global
impact on the world in many ways climate
change cyber issues and nuclear weapons
and we have to start acting like global
citizens and Canada you're absolutely
right is well-positioned in many ways to
take a positive role in diplomacy the
article in that Bolton was talking with
Sweden and Switzerland which are two
countries that are well known to have
how tonne and broker diplomatic
relations but Canada does have two
distinguished history in that regard -
and there's no reason that Canadian
diplomats couldn't take an active role
in that work okay that's like I thought
that was an interesting read I don't
think we'll have time to talk about it
because I'd like to bring in wrong - in
Toronto because I think you have a kind
of a personal dimension to add to this
go right ahead oh hi yeah thanks for
taking the call yeah well it's kind of
important for me I've been - I have
in-laws in Japan and I've been to
Nagasaki and Hiroshima and it's like
they're sort of you know there's nothing
they can do right and this is ramped up
the you know the politics in Japan the
Japanese self-defense force is changing
the constitution or obvious and trying
to change the constitution and you know
you know there's a number of things here
and I can mention for talking about
India and Pakistan because that's the
flashpoint because we're not we are
almost out of time in fact we're in the
last moment of the show but when this
happened even you know the the TV
screens did you talk about that in your
family cuz I have a friend actually
friends in Japan there's well you know
what we're talking about you know one
minute one minute and you know there
there's nothing that they could do and
even if there's a even if something the
United States tries to do something the
the missile flyovers would be over
Russia and China to retaliate so how is
China going to decide if it's a benign
nuclear missile flying over them towards
North Korea I'd like your guest to
comment on that okay go ahead we're
close to the end of the program but go
ahead Lawrence Krauss if you can't well
the point is that we shouldn't get to
that point that you're right that these
ballistic missiles can move across the
continent in minutes and and and and
there's no rational response there's no
there's no rational use of those things
we have to take the instead of work I
mean we should we should recognize that
danger but we should work be working
very hard to make sure that that isn't a
possibility and that means what that
means we have to engage diplomacy is not
to talk to people that you like is to
talk to people that you don't like and
that's the point listen we are at a time
when it's been really a pleasure to have
you and I'm not kidding I hope you'd
make time again because there is an
appetite I can attest to there's dozens
of people calling through who won't have
a chance today to talk with you
professor Lawrence Krauss thanks for
being with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
