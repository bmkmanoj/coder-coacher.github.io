wet the Bienvenue welcome and I wish to
welcome you to the social affairs
Science and Technology Committee there
you go
Scotia chair of the committee and I'm
going to start by inviting my colleagues
to introduce themselves starting on my
left articles and Senator from Toronto
and Deputy Chair of the committee
Tony Danes tennis shot that particular
senator from Quebec Caroline Stuart
Olsen runs with Judith Seidman from
O'Hare Quebec for everyone's benefit I
remind us that we continue our study on
the role of robotics 3d printing and
artificial intelligence in the
healthcare system and if we were very
pleased to have two witnesses with us
who I will identify as I as I welcome
them to speak and since there's no
predetermined order I'm going to go in
the order they appear on my list which
would mean that in the first instance I
will invite dr. Ben geo who is director
and professor at the University of
Montreal with the montreal montreal
institute for learning algorithms so dr.
ben Jill please thank you to be here so
I had this group at university of malaya
which has been a pioneer in artificial
intelligence in particular in the area
called deep learning which I've seen you
already heard about in previous meetings
and in the last 10 years since these
this breakthrough in deep learning
happened the lab grew a lot and we now
have the largest concentration of deep
learning researchers and students in
academia across the world so let me say
a few words about the progress that has
happened in AI computers are now much
better able to understand at least some
aspects of the world and take good
decisions that can help us in many
different ways but that's probably just
the beginning of approaching human level
intelligence we don't know how far this
is in the future but even with the
progress that's being achieved up to now
scientifically there will be major
economic and social impact of these
advances in the next decade so for
example there's been breakthrough in the
last few years using deep learning to
allow computers to recognize the content
of images to understand speech that is
to translate the sounds to words doesn't
mean they understand what they mean to
translate from one language to another
to control robots to control cars to
plan sophisticated sequences of actions
for example playing complex games like
the game of go and beating the world
champion last year so what's particular
about all this is that it's the same
underlying science the same technology
which is behind all of these advances
and more that you know I won't have time
to tell you so it's fairly horizontal
and general-purpose
which is why I can have such a big
impact on on the economy in general and
many different kinds of applications so
what's interesting about this for Canada
is that Canada has been a leader in that
science the science of AI and particular
deep learning with a lot of the progress
having happened in Toronto and Montreal
and to some extent in Edmonton in the
area of reinforcement learning
especially and these Canadian academics
have been really leading the world in
this area but unfortunately most of the
business investment in this area has
been elsewhere has been mostly in the
USA and to some extent maybe even more
actually now in China and to some extent
in the UK so a lot of Canadian academics
and former graduates have moved out of
the country so we had this brain drain
for a number of years however the tide
is turning the Canadian and
governments have realized the importance
the strategic importance of AI and are
starting to invest both for continuing
to advance the the fundamental research
and to promote innovation connecting
universities and companies in Canada so
for example in Montreal if we add up the
different grants and promises that
governments and companies have made just
over the last year for the next five
years and what we are expecting with
high probability and in the coming year
we're talking about more than half a
billion dollars just Montreal and
Toronto I guess is about the same so
something is really changing and the
Canadians seen both in universities and
in the the make up of you know the
ecosystems of small and large companies
that are investing in AI for example in
Montreal in less than the last 12 months
there's been less than six months
there's been announcements from major
multinationals to create research labs
in deep learning so it started with
Google and Microsoft now just last week
Facebook Huawei and IBM and others so
this is this is important to note
because the economic impact of these
advances is expected by economists and
scientists b-major probably comparable
or even more important than the impact
that electrification had in the previous
century at the beginning of the 20th
century but probably happening faster
which is something of course that we
could be concerned about for example
it's been estimated that more than half
of the jobs this is a u.s. study but we
can imagine the same thing happening in
Canada will be partially or completely
automated bringing new products and
services and increasing productivity
greatly but also leading to potential
negative impacts in terms of
unemployment now there will also be
new jobs created but it will be in
different places of course they'll be
and one thing you know we care a lot
about here is creating a lot of these
technology jobs but of course the people
who are losing their jobs are not the
same kinds that have a PhD or masters
and are going to be creating this
technology however there also be new
jobs in a non routine work and also jobs
that involve new jobs that involve more
work created for people who are involved
in jobs involving a strong relational or
human aspect I don't want to have a
robot take care of my children for
example so there will be a transition
and this transition could be painful and
involve a lot of human suffering so it
is important to start thinking about it
and to think about how our social
systems social security and education
systems and may need to be adapted to
these changes in the next decade roughly
one thing financially speaking that is
important is that a lot of wealth will
be created with AI but it mostly that
wealth would be in countries where that
technology is being developed in you
know where those companies that are
creating it are so we'd like Canada to
be a producer of AI and not just a
consumer every country in the world is
gonna be a consumer of these things and
and may suffer some of those negative
impacts so we'd like to have that wealth
created in our tax base at least
sufficiently so that we can pay for
those transitions that are coming hence
the efforts of governments to stimulate
innovation and technology transfer in
this area are very important in
particular crucial element of this is
talent the expertise that we have or
that we can attract and and for this for
example in Montreal and Toronto and
Edmonton we are creating AI Institute's
that
allow us to provide the best in the
world facilities for researchers doing
fundamental research in the AIA as well
as surround these people with groups of
applied researchers and innovation
technologists who will connect that
talent with local industry and stimulate
the creation of small and large
companies another important thing that
is being discussed in the community and
and also with governments is that it's
important not just to think about the
profitable applications of AI but also
to think about those applications that
have socially positive impact may not be
profitable but may be important for many
people for example I guess as is
important for this committee
applications in the medical areas but it
could be in other areas say providing
free services to the poorest that could
be useful for a lot of people so in in
milla my my Institute we're already
working with dozens of companies and
about a hundred companies are knocking
on our door to work with us and many
many new companies are created sometimes
by the students in the lab and sometimes
by outsiders who come and ask us for
technical help in particular we also
work with companies in in the medical
area and also with medical researchers
and hospitals to explore the numerous
medical applications of deep learning
and AI one example that I'm connected to
is a company called Imagi
which has developed a cancer detection
system for a particular kind of
intestinal cancer from medical images to
identify the parts of the image which
contain cancerous cells and according to
their test they can do that better
slightly better than the best doctors
and much better than than the average
doctors so
in addition to all this investment in
basic science and innovation one thing
that I and others believe is that we
must start thinking about the social and
ethical implications of these changes
and begin a discussion in our society
involving not just the scientists and
the engineers but also the experts in
social sciences humanities and ethics
who have something important to say
about how to handle those changes as an
analogy I think is a motivation for
doing this kind of work think about how
much misery human misery and political
turmoil could have been avoided if at
the end of the 19th century people in
power had realized that the upcoming
Industrial Revolution you know would do
a lot of damage damage before it would
bring a lot of wealth and if you know we
had put the Social Security that that
ended up happening in the 40s and 50s
and 60s earlier say at the beginning of
the 20th century a lot of that misery
would have been avoided so so this is
something to you know inspire us and the
last thing I want to mention regarding
the social aspects and the ethical
aspects is one of the concerns that
people in my community have and we are
having a lot of discussions already
around the world about this is how those
advances in the eye could be used in
ethically wrong ways and one of the most
salient example of this is the use of AI
in autonomously lethal weapons so you
know weapons that can kill without human
involved in the decision and there's
already being letters two years ago sign
that died signed and many others signed
to ask governments to work on this and
actually there is a committee of the UN
currently working on this question so I
will stop here for my
thank you very much I will now turn to
dr. Ferguson Pell who is a professor at
the University of Alberta but is
appearing before us as an individual dr.
Ferguson fell please thank you very much
I'm part of the Faculty of
rehabilitation medicine at the
University of Alberta so a lot of the
focus of what I'm going to talk about is
really the use of what I would describe
as a toolkit that can help us to address
problems in rehabilitation and chronic
disease management and that you're going
to sort of touch on three areas although
the scope can be much larger one of them
is the delivery of care to people in
remote rural communities the second is
in the area of prosthetics and the third
is in the area of enhancing the
effectiveness of education and so the
toolkit really comprises a whole series
of different kinds of technologies some
of them we linked closely to robotics
some of them more loosely for example
birch reality and augmented reality a
rapidly growing areas which I think have
enormous potential in the three areas
that I've identified and I'd like to use
my time mainly talking about the virtual
reality augmented reality side of things
so the problem we have for people who
live in remote rural communities is the
enormous expense of either getting
clinicians to them or getting them to
clinicians or both and in the area of
chronic disease management one of the
challenges is that a lot of the care of
these patients need is in a way serial
or longitudinal care it's not a single
face-to-face interaction and if
diagnosis is made and maybe a surgery
performed and it's all over and and the
problem solved but long-term care over
many years and this becomes extremely
difficult for people living in remote
rural communities indigenous reserves
and also in the military as well so when
we think of telemedicine we tend to
think I think of a webcam sitting on top
of a flat screen and maybe a group of
people in a room talking together and in
a way that's the way telemedicine tends
to be delivered
in that it tends to be more of a
discussion rather than a physical
interaction but at the University of
Alberta Faculty of rehab medicine for
the last five or six years we've been
delivering a master's degree for
professional physical therapists and
occupational therapists remotely at two
separate sites simultaneously so we have
our hub in Edmonton and then we have two
satellite programs one in cameras and
the other one in Calgary and the reason
we established this was because we were
finding that clinical professionals
tended to settle where they were trained
and that meant in a province like
Alberta we had very patchy access to
these professionals and so what we put
in place was a very advanced way of
delivering what we call synchronous
teaching to these students where we
would have a generalist instructor at
the remote site and a specialist
instructor at the hub site and so what
the generalists would do would then
follow the instructions of the
specialist instructor and take the
students through whatever the topic of
the class would be so our sense is well
if we can do that and instruct students
then why can't we do similar things in a
very hands-on way in the delivery of
care to patients in remote communities
one of the challenges is we need
information that we take for granted
when it's a face-to-face interaction
with patients but isn't available to us
when we have someone in a remote
location for example the sense of touch
or the sense of a force being exerted by
the patient or certain nuances in terms
of the anatomy of the patient that we
need to be able to monitor while the
patient performs a certain series of
activities these are all part of how a
typical assessment would be done and so
what we're now able to do and what's
interesting at very affordable prices
essentially is to put together a toolkit
less than ten thousand dollars that
could be located at a remote clinic with
a generalist clinician who would be able
to follow the instructions of a
specialist
clinician who would be based at a hub
urban center the Internet of Things is
essentially a whole toolkit of different
types of sensors that can be plugged
into the Internet and then the data that
they're generating received at another
location and so what we're doing is
beginning to put together the necessary
components to undertake a series of
different kinds of clinical assessment
in many cases longitudinal over a period
of weeks or months and this can include
the sensor force the ability to see in
detail certain features of the patient
the ability to measure movement of
different parts of the body in a very
accurate and quantitative way we can use
it for example to look at things like
the stability of the patient so if they
have a concussion or they may have some
other form of impairment that may affect
their ability to maintain an upright
stance then we're able to monitor that
someone who's had a stroke and we want
to be able to monitor what may be
happening for example with visual
neglect all of these things can be done
using these relatively inexpensive
sensors now the thing is that when
you're doing this you're generating many
channels of data at the same time and so
the the concept that we're developing
we've got and demonstrated in our lab is
that we send raw data down the internet
pipe to the urban center and then build
a series of apps that can then interpret
that data and present it to the
clinician to the specialist clinician
using a display system it could be VR
goggles or it could be something like
the hololens augmented reality display
and and the advantage that this gives us
is the ability to port to the data that
we're interested in so if you can
imagine you're sitting there and in
front of you virtually are displayed a
series of dashboards each dashboard
representing a different sensor so you
want to look at what's happening to
muscle activity so you glance across it
and then you move close up in in the
birch
world so that display then maybe you
want to look at something else you may
want to look at a force measurement so
you then look in the other direction and
then you move across to that now in the
package I sent you is what is inspiring
us and this is some work that Microsoft
is doing using a technique called hollow
portation
and what hollow portation does is truly
Star Trek in what it enables us to do is
to take a three-dimensional
representation of a person in a remote
location live and port that person's
image in 3d over to a second location in
our case the urban center so if you have
a look at the handout that I gave you
there's a link and you can play a little
YouTube video of Microsoft demonstrating
hollow portation I believe that within
the next three to five years this will
become a mainstream technology and will
revolutionize our ability to interact
with patients in remote locations so I
think that what we're beginning to do is
to put in place the building blocks and
then this technology will really able to
it will enable us to do some remarkable
clinical things now why is this
important to Canada I would say Canada
is in the perfect position to be the
living lab that develops these
technologies just look at our Berta
alone you have two outstanding urban
centers in terms of the quality of
medical care being provided in Alberta
we have a single healthcare system our
Berta Health insists health services and
we have a huge geographic footprint that
we're responsible for and so if we
wanted the perfect environment to start
to demonstrate these technologies Canada
is in a great position to do that and
why is that economically important
because when you start to put those apps
together those technologies together
they can then be applied to many other
remote locations around the world such
as China and Africa Australia Scotland
many other places to struggle with this
problem of delivering care to people in
remote locations so I just wanted to
bring to your attention what I think is
a very exciting opportunity both
clinically both
to patients the federal government is
responsible for such as indigenous
people and people in Canadian Forces and
also to look at the opportunity to
develop these technologies for economic
benefit as well thank you very much
thank you both very much and I'm now
going to open up the floor to my
colleagues and we will begin with
senator Eagleton to be followed by
Senator Stewart Olson to be followed by
sander Steven well thank you very much
for both of you for your presentations
they're both quite informative for this
purpose of meetings
dr. Benji we'll start with you thank you
for raising the issues of social and
ethical implications of these changes
you talked about the disruption in terms
of employment for many people yes to be
new jobs created but there'll be a lot
of ultimately will be lost I think those
are important issues to raise the
question also comes to mind as to how
far should we be going where should we
draw the lines in terms of artificial
intelligence automated systems you you
you've drawn one line yourself you said
you wouldn't want your kids looked after
by a robot well some of these things
particularly as you get into deep
learning as I understand it you can have
machines that could be quite powerful
quite influential and potentially could
be harmful in some respects it could be
very manipulative of a person exercising
undue influence and I'm and I'm talking
about this in the in the medical field
you you've already said well there's one
example something we shouldn't allow
that's Thomas lethal weapons but okay
let me take it into the healthcare area
I understand that agree with that
but let me take it into the healthcare
area where should we be drawing lines
here because we need to think in advance
where a lot of this may be going
so that we don't get down a path that
develops this in a harmful way so can
you comment on that comment on where we
might draw the line let's see for now I
think of the kinds of tools that are
going to be developed in the next few
years with deep learning for medical
applications mostly is providing simply
additional elements of information to
doctors at least in in countries like
Canada I don't see these things as
replacing doctors in any ways we still
want doctors to interact with people so
I don't have like a specific example of
where I could see this go wrong in in
medical applications one area of course
is that you know which is related is the
question of private private data right
so there is a social dilemma between on
one hand I'd like my personal
information to be not used for anything
that would you know make it in danger of
you know being available to people who
shouldn't have access to it and at the
same time for deep learning and AI to
really succeed we need to pull together
the data from millions of people and so
there's there's a balance here that
needs to be struck I don't see this as a
danger rather than you know trying to
find the right balance between
individual needs for privacy and and the
collective need for better treatment so
I don't know if you have something in
mind well let me give you one example
because it's been it's been raised here
before and that's what I think we're
calling dr. Watson Watson at IBM yeah
and its ability to perhaps have a better
record of diagnosis than some physician
so the concern here is over the
influence that this will have on the
medical community that the physician
will feel that they have to bow to the
machine when their instincts might
suggest otherwise simply because there's
a better statistical analysis and when
you're dealing with your patient looking
for the best odds is probably yeah so I
think it is an issue but I'm not too
concerned I think okay right now maybe
some doctors and probably many doctors
are afraid and and would say oh I'm not
gonna use this thing this robot or but
but really once you get used to having
machines do things and and compute
qualities for you and and you get to
know about their reliability from
experience it's not very different from
a doctor using tests that's being done
with a robot that looks at the blood of
the patient and comes up with numbers I
mean the doctor didn't actually do the
tests herself she trusts that you know
the Machine counting the cells is doing
it right so yeah I'm not I'm not that
concerned about this hospital okay I may
ask dr. Martin Ferguson tell the
question what you're describing here
it's fascinating stuff and and and I
think there has been a lot of concern
about being able to provide good medical
treatment to people in rural areas so so
you're telemedicine program would appear
to be quite quite promising in that
regard how is it funded how do you how
do you do you get to a most remote
communities you would still I imagine
involve a fair expense this is very
high-tech equipment and
are you able to have a very extensive
reach into Alberta so this is proof of
concept stage at this point so we're not
delivering care right now but we've been
very carefully considering that question
from several standpoints one of them is
the the funding and the other one is the
speed at which you can develop this
technology so that you can stay ahead of
the competition and one of the
challenges with any telemedicine system
when you're dealing with a primary
healthcare system is the privacy
management that is introduced by the
healthcare system which slows down your
ability to develop and so we're looking
at this in a sort of three-pronged way
we're looking at it from the standpoint
that many of the services that we're
getting started with are ones that can
be provided through the typical physical
therapy clinic which is a private payer
clinic so many of the services that
people receive this physical therapy is
out of pocket cost so that that enables
us to get started without getting caught
up in the complexity of how do we get a
policy change that were or a change in
the funding model within the healthcare
system that would deal with the fact
that we've got multiple clinicians now
generalist specialists and then also
maybe there are others involved in the
teams such as doctors and physical
therapists with different roles so
that's one way of expediting the
development from a technological
standards but hopefully eventually you
get into the healthcare salutely we
intend to and also that's why the other
third problem is the opportunity to work
with Canadian Forces thank you thank you
senator Stewart Olson to be followed by
Senator Stevens I thank you chair and
thank you both for being here I have one
question for each of you
professor Benjie oh one of the things
that we really see
with these technologies is the changing
world and I'm wondering have you given
thought to the preparation of our youth
and I think really it almost has to go
right back to either beginning high
school or even grade school when they
start to think about a career path what
should they be thinking about because
these are going to be the jobs the other
jobs are going to be changing so how can
they move forward with with that and
what should they be thinking about
so because the change is going to be
very fast I believe that it's really
important that our education system
prepares our youth to be fairly broadly
educated because if they specialize in
something and then that something gets
to be automated it's pretty bad for them
so that's one aspect the other aspect is
pretty obvious that we want to encourage
youth who are gonna contribute to the
development of these technologies so
computer scientists especially in
engineers and there's already an effect
of all the discussions in the media
about AI and and that the great clues
that have happened recently that I can
see so colleges you know calling us and
asking you know if they can visit and
students undergrad and high school being
interested so we need more of that
obviously because Canada needs to have
as many of these high paying salaries
we're gonna create that technology here
so what else and I think we need to
continue carefully evaluating where
things are moving and if you look at
what economists are writing or just your
good sense you can you can make
fairly good guesses and so the people in
charge of curriculums in schools and
colleges I think need to pay attention
to that to try to tell the students
about what's going on so that they make
the right choices thank you and dr.
Ferguson Pell your demonstrations and
what Alberta is doing are fantastic I
come from New Brunswick which is an area
we don't have a medical school and so
are these done in silos like would you
do your telemedicine strictly to Alberta
remote Alberta or can you envision a
Canada where a school in British
Columbia can provide this kind of
learning for someone in New Brunswick
for a school in New Brunswick or a class
in New Brunswick
absolutely so one example of this at the
moment in our faculty is around
stuttering so we have an institute
called ISTAR which is to help people who
start to overcome this disability and
we're delivering stuttering therapy
essentially to countries in the Middle
East and so this becomes simply a matter
I think of in a way financial logistics
in terms of how you manage the resources
that are needed in order to deliver it
and to some degree some harmonization in
methodology so that we we agree on some
basic protocols as to how to deliver a
particular kind of assessment so take
someone who's got an injured rotator
cuff we would have a rather like a
standard operating procedure that we
would want to follow using this
technology so that we go through a
systematic assessment of that person's
rotator cuff and we want that to be
harmonized with other collaborating
provinces or other organizations so that
we can get it done smoothly and quickly
with all of these things a lot of the
cost is around how
it takes to do the assessment and that
means that the technology must be
seamless and reliable so you plug it in
and off we go we've all had that
experience with videoconferencing and
secondly the protocols can help us to do
that but to give you confidence that
this is doable I would say the
experience we've had in teaching the
physical therapists and occupational
therapists in the remote locations
they're not so remote Calgary and
Camrose but that co-located groups we've
demonstrated that those students when
they graduate who sit the national exam
come out with equivalent or better marks
to the ones that have face to face so
I'm very confident this will work and
give good quality care but we do need
some degree of harmonization thank you
very much thank you cheering
understatement to be followed by Senator
Dean to be followed by Senator under
Thank You chair thank you both very much
for being here as a Montrealer I really
have to direct my questions to you
professor Benjie oh and just start by
congratulating you sincerely for the
enormous efforts put into creating this
hub in Montreal and and I have collected
the newspaper clippings are watching
Google and Microsoft and and and feeling
really energized and really excited
about that
in your presentation to us today
you have said very clearly that
something is changing you know and and
we're moving in in in new directions and
you've said that to keep our talent and
attract more we need to provide the best
in the world facilities and you want us
Canada to be a producer of AI products
not just a consumer so you're already
demonstrating that in Montreal and and
what I'd like to ask you is if you use
Montreal as a model for other potential
hubs in the country which I hope is what
happens this is what happens
mm-hmm and so I'd like to know what were
the positive assets you know what is the
model that you're going to transmit to
other parts of the country so what were
the positive assets and what were the
particular challenges that you overcame
so the core asset is a critical mass of
talent and I mean the top level of
talent so people researchers professors
PhD students postdocs who are doing the
best research in the world concentrated
in one place working together and
attracting the attention of not just the
scientific community but also the
business community so this is what
happened and another thing that happened
is a sort of shift in the attitudes of
investors and business people and I
think this is just the beginning that is
making it possible for AI startups to
actually happen here in Canada and not
be immediately sucked to the Silicon
Valley because it used to be the case
that Canadians would start companies
high tech companies and as soon as they
reached a certain level
they would be not necessarily bought but
investors who are sufficiently
risk-taking there wouldn't be enough of
them here in Canada and so it would be
essentially people from California and
they would say come to the valley
because we want to be close to you and
so a lot of companies left like this and
now that has changed both Canadian
investors are understanding starting to
understand that asset that we have here
and and foreign investors also
understand that if they want to be part
of this game they have to accept that
Canadian companies are going to stay
here in Canada and so you know just the
competition effect is really moving
things in the right direction but in
general I would say to come back to my
first answer about critical mass it's a
virtuous circle that's why the
intervention of bargains is so important
it's sort of you know pumping the motor
so to get it started and then it's sort
of you know self it's growing in the
right direction and we probably need to
continue pumping for some extent but now
you know big business is coming in and
there's still challenges so you asked me
about the challenges I think in general
there's still a lot to change in the
mentality of investors in Canada they're
very conservative and even more
conservative are the big corporate in
Canada big companies they're not used to
make these kinds of bold investments
into the future they want to be
reassured that whatever they're gonna
buy is gonna be safe so somehow we need
to change that and I know that some
companies are starting to open up but
this is something that needs to change
okay if I would like to ask you the same
question Mercer Ferguson pal and as long
as I can have a second round to us
professor
Bengie oh come on a second round but I
can't guarantee anything
okay bye
so if I can ask you because obviously
you're a huge innovator as well and and
I must say the idea of Halle portation
is really something that is Star Trek I
mean I can visualize it so I'd like to
ask you the very same question as I just
asked for Hester Benjamin so just to
make sure I remember your questions
first part of the question really I
think is what what are some of the
drivers for this innovation and what
resources if you like or investment is
necessary to make it successful and I
think that's a pretty challenging
question in this context because there
are actually a lot of stakeholders one
of one of the stakeholders in a way is
our moral conscience and that is the
importance of providing equity in access
to health care which is a very powerful
principle of Canadian healthcare and we
know there's a lot of data to show the
inequities the people who live in remote
and rural settings experience simply
because of where they're located and so
I can't promise that this technology
will necessarily directly reduce costs
in that you could do simplistic
calculations and say well that person
you know instead of them having to
travel from a remote location to
Edmonton it cost $5,000 that will pay
for house half of this toolkit that
could maybe be helpful to a hundred
patients that's a simplistic way of
looking at it because they probably
would never have made that trip in the
first place for a lot of the conditions
that we're talking about so this is an
investment in part in fairness as well
as an investment in I think developing a
technology that has potential for
economic benefit to Canada more widely
secondly the stakeholders then a pretty
diffuse because as we were saying a few
minutes ago this technology can be
beneficial to multiple provinces in fact
all provinces and beyond
it's
I think that federal support to help to
develop these technologies from an
innovation standpoint I think is
important and it has already provided
that support we have had CFI funding
we've had my tax funding they're exactly
the kind of funding we need to do this
kind of work it's more difficult to
position this kind of work in the CIHR
context so those programs are critically
important to enable this sort of thing
to happen industry investment I think
there is a there are opportunities the
my tax funding for example we received
was a consequence of an investment that
Tahlia tell us Alf made and so I think
companies that are involved in
communications can see benefits they may
be collateral benefits in that they're
seeing an increased utilization of their
IT infrastructure so they're not
actually investing directly because they
are obtaining a new industrial growth
around health technology but they're
getting these secondary benefits so
these are the kinds of complexities I
think we're working with in this area
okay and this contributes I'm just
thinking about professor ben Gio's point
that Canada must be a producer so we can
then export that technology and benefit
from from that aspect not only within
our country that outside our country is
that yes and there are some technologies
where it's more difficult to do that
than others simply because there are
many other players in the field and so
in order to be truly successful and
nimble and get to market fast you have
to have the kind of venture investment
and angel investment with the confidence
behind it the dr. Ben geo was talking
about to really be the first to market
and we are frequently not first to
market because we don't have that
culture in this particular case I think
what I'm suggesting is we have geography
on our side and that's I think our our
opportunity to maybe get ahead of this
game because we've got the we've got the
medical centers and the excellence in
healthcare we've got a publicly funded
healthcare system that is nicely
positioned to be
to do this sort of thing we've got the
geography we've got the technology so
we've got a sweet spot to work with okay
thank you thank you very much Thunder
Dean to be followed by sundar Unger to
be followed by Senator pretty crap
Thunder Dean thanks Chet thank you both
terrific and exciting stuff I want to
talk a little bit about the role of
government we've heard about government
priming the well or pumping and that
funding is important we've heard both of
you say that
are there other things when we think
about success factors in this terrific
decade-long success story that that
government can do other than providing
funding or is it just simply a matter of
provide the funding and then stay out of
the way so that's the first question and
the second one is to go back to we know
about the virtuous positive social and
economic impact so I want to return to
the negative ones and without without
the particulars because many of the
negative aspects of this by the very
nature of the technology will be
unpredictable boy virtue is kind of
disruptive nature where does
responsibility lie in terms of
governance you know who's got the lead
on I'm thinking about and looking at and
having responsibility for mapping
attempting to foresee some of the
downside consequences of this we've
heard that health inequity is one the
exploitation of benefits to others while
they may not be available to some in our
home countries obviously another any
thoughts on on those questions so about
the role of governments besides
initiating the kind of innovation that
we're seeing in AI as I mentioned our
ability to keep and actually bring to
Canada the best people in the area
scientists but also entrepreneurs for
example
is closely connected so one important
aspect of this is our immigration
process in my own life as a professor I
encounter a lot of issues with students
having trouble especially the students
coming on short term internships and
things like that but even a grad
students coming and being delayed one
session and then deciding to go to
another university elsewhere in the
world so I I believe that we could do a
better job to make the process of
getting visas and work permits and so on
seamless faster and especially for these
areas that are critical like this but I
think ideally for everyone so that's one
place I think where it matters in terms
of policy the other place which is
difficult is regarding sharing of data
so as you know health is mostly dealt in
the provinces and provinces for example
like Quebec and Ontario are doing pretty
nice work trying to centralize their
medical data and this is going to become
really important for AI but each
province is doing it separately so I'm
not sure you know how are we going to be
able to deal with this but as a country
we would be able to not only provide
better healthcare but export our systems
and and and you know be much more
competitive if we found ways for the
different provinces to allow researchers
and companies involved in the
development of these products to have
access to shared data of course you know
the with all the the techniques that are
used to make sure the data isn't leaking
in any way so it's it's a jurisdiction
problem where maybe the the
federal government could have a role in
bringing to the table the different
provinces I would add to personal I
would absolutely agree on the data point
and I would add an extra dimension to
that in that data can be used in a
number of different ways and as
academics are interested in using data
on the whole for research purposes so we
need to be able to access that data
supported by appropriate ethics approval
I think Sapru will becomes complex
because that means individual patients
in some way need to have given their
permission for that data to be used for
the purpose that we would like to put it
to as researchers and so creating a
culture which I think actually patients
don't have a lot of problems with where
they more or less automatically it's
more of an opt-out mechanism where their
data is essentially freed up for use for
research purposes as long as appropriate
anonymization is put in place could be a
real enabler and I think this is
something we really struggle with in our
berta particularly because I think a
berta tends to have a very protective
view relative to other provinces in
Canada so we certainly struggle with
this as academics in in Alberta but I
think it's a relatively common problem
across the country the second point I
would make is to do a joined up nurse in
in that whether it's at a provincial
level or a federal level when we start
talking about acute care and chronic
care we suffer from really challenging
problems in joining up a recognition of
what holistic care really is and this
occurs in age in the field of people who
are aging in place where appropriate
relatively inexpensive interventions at
the community level can save enormous
amounts of money at the acute level but
the ability to move money across the
divide and and and move policy across
the divide and move administrative
responsibility across the divide is a
perplexing problem and it doesn't make
common sense
but it's the nature of the way things
are put together and that becomes a real
barrier I think on the chronic disease
management side of things because it's
difficult in isolation to demonstrate
that you're saving money but when you
look at interventions and innovation
holistically and you include what the
benefits are at the cute side then it's
a slam dunk
and I think that's the challenge we have
both low provincial level in a federal
level so well I agree very much with
what you said and one connected element
regarding the opt-in of patients to make
sure their data could be used for
research is we have to make sure that
patients feel secure about that data in
particular you know it has come to the
Canadian government to the question of
you know what insurance companies could
be doing and asking from the data that
has been measured on patients and I
think this is you know I I don't want to
go into that debate but obviously from
the point of view of developing AI with
with patients data it's much much better
if patients feel confident that the data
is not going to be used against them in
one way or another thank you okay
senator Hunger to be followed by Sandra
Petty Claire extremely interesting
presentations dr. van chair just a
comment I really like your message about
if you want to do business with us come
to Canada please applaud that and it was
very recently that I read in one of our
national papers about a company in
California that packed up and moved in
specifically regarding a I moved to
who I be so that's that's a great
message you talked about you work with
dozens of companies and hundreds more
knocking on your door I'm wondering how
you would handle all of this potential
business well so precisely what we're
going to be doing with a lot of the
money that we'll be receiving from both
the provincial government and federal
governments in the next few years is to
make it possible for academics in my
group to recruit applied researchers who
are gonna actually do the work of that
technology transfer and working with
companies so the professors and the grad
students for the most part will continue
to do their basic research there and
long term research we don't want to stop
that otherwise we're gonna lose
eventually to other places in the world
where they are continuing to do this and
we won't have the attractive power that
we currently have for talent so what we
need to do instead is to bring together
in the same places that's what these
Institute's are supposed to be about the
ones in Montreal Toronto and Edmonton
both the fundamental researchers who are
already there but recruit a large number
potentially more than the number of
students and professors that we
currently have will be former grad
students engineers people recruit from
overseas will be the interface between
those companies and the research so for
example in my group but we're telling
those people is when we recruiting them
we're telling them so you were we will
be working your main mission is going to
be to do to work with those companies
and and but that will be like 80% of
your time and 20% of your time will be
essentially free and you'll be
able to collaborate with the grad
students in the postdocs training
fundamental research published papers so
they get to stay connected with the the
advances in science and they're
motivated to be here rather than working
in industry and maybe have better
salaries for both of you I had questions
that were have already been asked but
dr. Gerson's how you mentioned funding
because Alberta has that kind of system
do you see a role in the private sector
or for the private sector to get
involved with your work absolutely in
fact I I think the private sector might
be the early adopter and it might be one
way that we can get if you like soft
venture funding in order to get some of
this off the ground at an early stage
because if you can imagine there are a
number of of interventions that a
typical physical therapy clinic that
delivers fee for service care that is
out-of-pocket paid we're expanding the
the market for them by being able to
reach out more effectively into rural
communities would be a very appealing
thing to do
it relies of course upon those more
remote communities to be able to afford
to buy that so there is an underlying
inequity around the delivery of for
example physical therapy services but in
our Berta for example if you have a hip
replacement or a knee replacement you
get a certain number of physical therapy
visits associated with that so that
would be a very good starting point the
other thing that we're doing now which i
think is another opportunity where is at
the interface between the Health System
funding and the private funding is an
intervention called GLAAD which came out
of Denmark and and this is a physical
therapy intervention that is intended to
delay the amount of time needed for you
to have you
knee or hip surgery in other words what
the physical therapy program does is
essentially extends the period of time
that you can live comfortably and
functionally with your normal hip or
knee before you have to have an
artificial replacement so this this is
has economic benefit to the healthcare
system and also to the patient and
equality of life benefit to the patient
and also as an opportunity for a private
clinic to be able to deliver that
service so there are these sort of
overlap areas that I think are
interesting areas for us to look at at
the beginning because it gets kind of
everybody on board but we don't get into
complex conversations about where is new
money going to come from in order to
deliver this service which is always
challenging especially in difficult
economic times I'm wondering also about
security and privacy of data yes so the
the the data that relates to things like
force measurement and movement
measurements and things like that is
very easily encrypted so and and usually
that would not carry much in the way of
an identifier because the data is being
streamed across in real time so we're
and then it's being stored in a
relatively normal way the the tricky
part part is the video information and
there are protocols for doing that
already in telemedicine and they will
need to be enhanced as we go forward as
we use this technology more and more but
that this technology is in place to be
able to do that it's a matter of just in
a way getting the approvals and the
acceptance that the encryption
techniques are sufficiently robust for
the system to accept
Thank You mr. chairman thank you very
much for being here thank you for your
presentations my question
is for both of you perhaps mr. Benge oh
I too come from Montreal so I'll begin
with you how democratic if I may say
your sector and area are or will be I
get that you know this is it's very
exciting and and I guess maybe there's a
few parts like I'm trying to get a sense
of of where it's driven from does it
does it is it led by the businesses is
it led by the academics or or a
combination of both and I guess the
reason I want to know that is is down
the road how because I see that there's
a lot of investment and it's high
technology it seems to me a lot of this
would be very expensive research and and
products so so how do you get that to
the most Canadian how is it going to
help as many Canadians as possible
because I see it that it could remain a
very privileged access or it could save
the world and I don't know your opinion
on that and if you can get me a sense of
where it stands so maybe when part of
the answer is something really nice
happening and a machine learning
scientific community which is that it's
currently and has been for many years as
far as I remember very open so not only
do scientists publish their work in the
usual ways but the publish their work
even before it's being reviewed in
what's called archive so as soon as
somebody has a good idea that's
officially flashed it's it's posted on
the way
and this is not just the academics doing
this the researchers in industry at
least in the leading industry I industry
so that's companies like Google
Microsoft Facebook IBM they do the same
thing and there is a lot of movement of
ideas so students spend some time in one
place and then another place so it
really knows what everybody's doing very
fast the reason I'm saying this is that
for anyone who has the training and of
course there are you know thousands of
people around the world who do you
couldn't very quickly know you know if
there's something new happening so this
is not like what you see in movies where
this isolated scientists may be working
for a company discovering something big
that no one knows about this is not at
all how it's working that science is
moving by actually pretty small steps
even though the impact could be
important but the science itself is
moving by small steps on top of what
others are doing and and everybody knows
what is going on and in worse than that
the companies that are trying to be
secretive or losing they're losing
ground and that's why for example a
company like Apple which used to be
extremely secretive decided that as far
as deep learning is concerned at least
they would open up and they would start
publishing and for them it was the only
way they could recruit strong
researchers in the area otherwise they
would not they would not even be able to
recruit them because those researchers
care more about being part of the
community being able to talk to their
peers and getting their feedback than
having you know 10% or whatever better
salary so so that's that means that in a
sense you know anyone with the training
can build their own thing and even
regarding patents there has been a
movement in the last few years by those
major companies to either say that they
wouldn't use their patents they aren't
you would only use
their patterns in a defensive way in
other words they would not prevent other
companies from using the signs that
they're producing or even just not even
patent the the things that are more on
the science side of things that they're
doing so that's very good
also even though it's true that it may
take some capital to develop mostly its
its people I mean there is computing
equipment but it's mostly people so it's
not actually that capital expensive but
those things there are a lot of the
things that are being developed are
already mass distributed so if you use
almost any of the Google services or a
large part of the Facebook services
you're already using deep learning and
you're getting it almost for free I mean
you're getting advertisement but that's
another problem
so so that technology is you is being
used in sort of a mass distributed and
so it's everybody is gonna be a user and
it's already a user to some extent of
these things there's a question of
democratization at the level of
businesses so I could find it a company
called element AI which is trying to
make that kind of technology accessible
to the other companies besides those big
you know IT companies that those
companies which don't have the expertise
and this is true of many Canadian
companies even large ones even large
multinationals they just don't have the
expertise they don't have the talent so
they don't know how to jump into this so
it is there's a an issue there but
companies like element AI R and IBM are
making that kind of expertise available
to to other companies so I'm not sure if
I answered your question or if you had
something else in mind well maybe if you
could specifically when it when it comes
to health yes yes yes right
so is it your perception that it will
you know have a positive impact on the
health of canadian because in des that
would be the desired result right so so
Martin talked about just earlier so
there are cases where it's fairly
obvious that is profitable for a company
to build a product that will be used by
hospitals for example so the example I
gave earlier of medical images this is
an area that's booming because it's very
straightforward path from building
technology to making money out of it but
I'm sure there'll be other cases where
it's not so clear from a business point
of view and yet there could be really
important social positive social impact
and that's where having a strong role
for governments for example these
Institute's that are being created is is
good so academics are very motivated by
the idea that what they're gonna be
doing could impact positively a lot of
people and so in my group you know we
are ready to tackle problems where there
is no company that is interested but but
there are you know medical doctors or
hospitals we think that this is an
important problem that could you know be
useful for many people and then we just
go and do it and and basically we're
doing at the expense of you know we're
doing things for the common good and it
wouldn't necessarily work like this if
you were in a country where it was all
driven by the immediate profit motive
thank you okay before I move to the
second round I want to ask a couple of
things that have arisen with regard to
the confidence and the ethics of using
data that you and
Eagleton began to discuss I thought you
gave actually a very good example when
you referred to the counting of cells
and it's a in my opinion it it was a
very good example because it focuses us
on reality versus hypothesis that we
very quickly come to accept technology
that gives us information that is
beneficial to making a diagnosis or or
helping with issues we we see very
quickly
not to worry about the ethics of the
technology now let's move up one scale
the 3d imaging brain imaging how do we
know that the interpretation of the
brain image of a particular individual
hasn't been influenced by the data that
went in to telling the Machine how to
look for a brain and deal with it well
we just don't we we we if we have a
brain injury we want you to Emma just
immediately if we if we think we have
deterioration of mental capability the
first thing we want is an image in fact
today it's getting so people almost
asked for an MRI whatever they're going
into the hospital with so you know I I
think that one of the things we have to
do is we look at these ethical issues
around data concentration is the reality
of how they're used and and how they may
benefit and weigh the potential benefit
against any you know potential negative
issue now we're it seems to me that
we've had discussion here on where some
of the issue could go is that we know in
deep learning and as we get further into
deep learning
we know how it the learning is
structured we
informed on how it has gone from simple
stacking of photocopies into modeling on
the actual brain and how it works in
Canada has been elite what pride the
reason we're leader as we continued our
neurological research beyond that of a
number of other countries and so we now
get into a situation where the diagnosis
of disease we know that many diseases
are are culturally or ethnically related
they're statistically higher more
pronounced in certain ethnicities than
others and so the issue then becomes is
there sufficient data moving into it to
to lead and in my opinion your simple
example of the cell counting is a very
good basis for us to reflect on in that
this we get sufficient data it no longer
matters because the if you get a total
ethnic screen of a good solid sample of
a population then there's a much higher
probability that any factors will be
considered in fact there's probably more
diversity within it one ethnicity then
there may be a crossed ethnicity we know
that the genetic particularly active
microbiome level of individuals even
within any given ethnicity is is
considerably varied across that
population so those factors have to be
taken into consideration now when we
look at the microbe and and and so on
and so I I don't want to want life
because I do have a question for dr.
Pearson about is there is there anything
in what I just summarized there that
causes you to focus in on a further
answer to sender Eggleton s question
right so there's there's an issue which
you i think raised which is well studied
now is the issue of bias due to the
particular choice of data that we're
using to train the machine so the
machine is only imitating the things
that it sees in the
raining data and so if if the training
data reflects the biases of the people
or the the the lack of diversity from
which data came from that will be also
in the machine at least if we don't do
anything special about it but we can do
something about it and for a few years
and actually some of those papers came
from Canada we we've known some
techniques that can help us reduce
considerably that issue the idea is if
we also measure say the ethnicity the
quantity that would like the the the
variable that would like our system to
be insensitive to because we'd like
maybe the system to take a decision
irrespective of say gender race or
whatever is the variable we can do that
we can we can simply train it to predict
those variables and then become
insensitive to them and it's other
judgments it's not necessarily perfect
but we have knowledge of the mechanisms
to do that and I could easily imagine
that in some situations it could be
something that's legally required just
as a form of you know respect the values
of a particular country that some
systems in medical areas or legal areas
have those safeguards so we we know
scientifically how it could be done
there's extra effort when somebody would
deliver a product to maybe enforce these
these kinds of ways to make the system
unbiased and it may be at the expense of
accuracy of the system so this is
something that maybe companies want to
do unless they're asked to yeah well
thank you and you've said something I
wanted to get on I was hoping you would
say and that is the
vacation that if we get sufficient data
across sufficient ethnicities we not
only have the capacity for a first scan
to give us a more highly likely
successful scan but we have the ability
to ask the second question that is okay
now you've given us this data if we you
take your dad subset of a particular
ethnicity and apply it to the sample
that you're dealing with does your Oh
does the machine well here we're talking
to our our robotic instrument here does
your view interpretation of what you
have just scan change so ultimately we
have the capacity potentially if we scan
sufficient data into the system to not
only get a general quick answer which
may be absolutely correct the first time
through but to refine questions based on
different structure body structures
ethnicity and and so on so I'll leave
that just a badass points in one go to
dr. Pearson um but first in felt I was
really struck by the hollow port example
that you gave which if I understood
correctly is in the first instance the
ability to bring the global three
dimensional physical structure into view
but first glance doesn't go internally
within the individual I want to take
that next step now a question that I've
been asking with regard to our abilities
with optics and deep learning that is
having a reference background is
surgeries in very difficult areas to
which are two that are in very close
proximity but involved two very
different disease issues but are
complicated because of their location
anal cancer and prostate cancer yep and
we know that errors are made in both
because the surgeon is unable to see all
at once behind an organ in the intricate
see and so in a very slight nick in
those areas can do long-term turn damage
there there are reports that the system
is becoming advanced rapidly in giving a
three-dimensional on-screen view of the
area in which the surgery has to occur
and to actually reveal details of the
physical structure the proximity of
various systems though I'll leave it at
that that are in both those areas all of
which are enormous ly important and very
tightly packed do you see from what your
experience with the hala port do you do
you see this being able to move
internally and being able to help with
that presentation of in those taking the
two examples that I gave yes I think
that we're already seeing it but not in
real time and that is in surgical
planning so if you take images that have
been created for example CT images or
MRI images and you know a procedure
that's going to be followed so the
example that we have at the U of A that
I think is quite compelling when you see
it is replacing a heart valve that was
previously implanted and now needs to be
replaced and this is a catheter
procedure so it's not open-heart surgery
but of course it's pretty tricky to feed
the instruments through the veins to get
to the right place and then remove the
old valve put a new one in especially if
it's not located ideally so to be able
to rehearse that operation before it's
undertaken significantly or has a
potential to significantly reduce the
risks of the kinds of problems you're
describing so I would say the
low-hanging fruit in this area would be
in surgical planning and rehearsing and
simulating a situation but doing it with
the patient's own data so what we've
been used to in the past is generic
models that are pretty
that enable people to practice recently
in some areas individual customized
models are made of the patient
themselves where you can practice a
procedure but that requires you know
producing a physical model which is of
course where 3d printing can be helpful
but the opportunity in VR and AR is that
you can take that MRI image and you can
take it for that individual patient you
can start to rehearse the procedure but
also you can change its scale so unlike
the physical in the physical device
where you're fixed with the scale this
you can actually get inside I mean you
can take a look around from the
perspective of the blood vessel or from
another part of the of the heart for
example where you're wanting to see you
know exactly what the shape is so that's
where I think the immediate
opportunities lie in that kind of
surgery thank you very much that was
great I want to come to the issue of
confidentiality of information it seems
to me that in Canada we have been
substantially retarded held back in the
health area because of our paranoia over
privacy of information for example we
still do not have electronic health
records for Canadians am i looking at
that we've we've had testimony from
Canada away and others here we have
delved into this in a number of areas
I'm increasingly of the view that the
requirements put on providers where they
have confidentiality protection as the
highest requirement in the our RFP for
these things is such that it makes it
virtually impossible to make a practical
electronic health record we can't even
do an electronic health record we're not
going to get to the things that you're
talking about here using data in Canada
to base decisions for instrumentation
development technological developments
and so on which are we're already at a
disadvantage even on a national
population is smaller than some state at
one state in particular
a very advanced state south of us and so
we have to be able to deal with it I'm
always amazed that we have this paranoia
in the in this particular area where is
in our income tax people are jumping
over themselves to get an electronic
submission of their income tax on
numbers as high as 80% this year maybe
in an electronic format and I suspect in
terms of immediate injury to people
there is nothing more potentially
sensitive than their private financial
information and yet we've been able to
deal with that in these kinds of areas
so I really just want to come back to
the issue that you've raised
I believe the access to large data is
critical for our companies moving
forward to be able to help Canadians let
alone to be able to compete in the
products in the end and so we have to be
able to deal with this issue and the
real issue I think that you did touch on
it and going through it is the
protection against using an individual's
data against their opportunity for
employment or for those are very real
and but they're they're different than
the issue of total data in a system
analyzed for things that appear to arise
in a given disease symptom
over a wide range of patients in a wide
range of different sorts of things and
if we are going to be as advanced as dr.
ben geo wants us to be with regard to
artificial intelligence and its benefits
to Canadians we have to be capable of
dealing with a realistic problem
otherwise we're not we're not going to
get there okay I'm going to turn to the
second round now and I'll start with
Senator Eagleton and I have senator
Seidman next understood
Oh gentlemen the government in bill c-45
Ida dand 25 million dollars to the
Canadian Institute for Advanced Research
see far support a pan Canadian
artificial intelligence strategy and
understand professor NGO you're involved
with that what what are the components
that you see of this strategy and what
is the timetable you see in the
development of it so there are a number
of components the bulk of the money is
going to the three Institute's so as far
as I know for Montreal and Toronto this
the plan would be to have something like
forty million dollars over five years
and out of those forty millions thirty
would be used for chairs so easy P to
attract and retain the best professors
in the area and and pay for students and
postdocs and so on and ten millions
would be for allowing for the operations
of the Institute that's what we're the
five years so that's like two millions
per year and I don't remember the
numbers for Edmonton but these these are
I don't think these have been made
official this is from the discussions
that I've been part of and then so that
that comes to about a hundred million
dollars and then the rest goes to more
pan-canadian activities managed by CFR
so one aspect of which is to promote the
discussions around the ethical and
social aspects of AI another is to
encourage collaboration between the
different centers and finally there's a
ten million dollars to help other places
than the three major cities for free I
hear for example UBC used to have a
pretty important machine learning group
but unfortunately due to the brain drain
most of them went away they could
recruit more and then that money could
be used to help them attract professors
in this area
so that's that's roughly the division as
far as I know and your other question
was time frame time frame yes so the
three Institute's are being set up the
vector Institute in Toronto has already
been created as just a few weeks ago
hopefully the one in Montreal is gonna
happen in the next few weeks and the
plan is basically that all three will
start operations within this year so
will this strategy unfold increments
will there be reports from time to time
as to its progress yes
so CFR has been mandated as the
organization which will monitor progress
they've already they're already doing
this for their usual programs that are
fundamental research programs and there
is a whatever it's called the
Secretariat or a committee which is
gonna be put in place to evaluate but
also to take global decisions for
example put the bar on the quality of
the applicants for those chairs in a way
that's gonna be consistent across the
country okay do you think the amount of
money being invested by the federal
government is I mean it's always it's
always nice to have more but is it
sufficient to make a difference so that
money is really to help with the basic
research aspect and what we are working
towards is getting also some money from
the federal government for the
innovation aspect in other words you
remember I told you that we want to
build institutes which have both the
basic research groups and sort of the
Applied Technology Transfer groups and
and I think that extra funding is going
to be needed for for making that happen
the provinces are putting money that's
for both but I think having the extra
money from the federal government for
this
would be important because the of course
if if we only invest in the university
research and we don't also help the
transfer then we're losing a big
opportunity to you know make the whole
thing really succeed there's any federal
support into the program or is it
entirely the province of Alberta do what
I'm describing at the moment yeah it's
it's mainly in our area but what I would
apart from the CFI funding that we've
received the my tax funding and so on so
small amounts of funding but they they
can have a good impact what I would say
is that the interesting thing about the
field that we're working in is that it's
a pretty eclectic field and so there are
many secondary benefits of for example
the funding that is going into machine
learning indirectly benefits us too in
that imagine that data that is being
sent from a rural location into that
urban hub and put into a repository and
you do that nationwide and you start to
be able to mine that and start looking
at trajectories of care and being able
to predict what the outcome for a
patient might be with a complex chronic
disease that needs to be managed with a
lot of resources and a lot of careful
planning machine learning is probably
the only way that we're really going to
be able to get to the bottom of what
those trajectories are what I would say
is that we we have to expand our concept
of what we mean by data in that we're
earlier on we were talking about genetic
profiles for example people talk about
metabolites and other measurements that
are made that get put into a data pool
that lend themselves very nicely to
machine learning but let me give you
another scenario a chronic wound a huge
problem an extremely expensive problem
for our healthcare system what data are
we generating around chronic wounds what
are we measuring what do we look for
what characterizes a chronic wound what
helped us to understand what the
appropriate treatment for a chronic
wound is how can we optimize the rate of
repair to that chronic wound
how can we decide when it should be
treated with conservative management
versus plastic surgery so there is one
condition that is actually a very major
expense within our system that is not a
particularly pleasant topic to talk
about it doesn't attract the the attend
intelligentsia of an academia to work on
because it's messy and yet I think it's
actually a very interesting area that
could be looked at that there could be
one that would benefit from using
machine learning techniques so I go back
to the point and I think that is that
when this basic research is done the
benefits to society rely heavily upon
our imagination and ability to apply it
in interesting areas and challenging
areas in important areas including
chronic wounds a pressure ulcer a
diabetic ulcer a surgical site that
hasn't repaired properly and so on
offering to us a very stimulating
materials professor benjÃ£o you
mentioned element AI but we didn't hear
any real description of how that fits
into this whole puzzle but you've
presented them this hub there's
pan-canadian right aspects I mean there
are a lot of moving parts here so yes I
think that's always that way winter when
you know we're in the midst of of major
innovation so how does element AI fit
into this whole picture so we're trying
to build an ecosystem including
academics including small companies and
incubators startups large existing
corporate and
Elementary I started as a small startup
last fall and is now becoming a medium
company very quickly there are probably
gonna break the record for the largest
round a funding investment that's
probably gonna come to the next few
weeks so there's there's a huge interest
for these kinds of companies in Canada
and and and elsewhere in the world so
they're they're gonna be in a sense
complimentary to the kinds of things
we're doing with the Institute's so the
Institute's are I could have make led
they are not for profit element AI is a
company so it is for profit and and so
in a sense and and element I is gonna
have is already has recruited a number
of high-level researchers so it's doing
both basic research and and fairly
applied research so one could think that
over this why do we have the Institute's
and companies like this because it's
it's a different way of operating right
and and we attract different kinds of
people and we solve different kinds of
problems the so there are all of these
different actors and elemÃ©ry is I think
playing an important role as at least
for the Montreal ecosystem in in having
a fairly large group that has a lot of
international visibility to attract the
kinds of people who are currently going
to say deep mine in London which is one
of the largest company doing AI these
days they can compete with those kinds
of companies that are specialized in the
eye and a large enough to attract really
strong people is there you know part of
this is what you've described before
milla for example yeah it's private
public so there's government funding and
private funding yes yes but but it's
it's really a nonprofit so even though
we are getting contracts from companies
one we choose which contracts we take so
and and what guides our decisions are
you know how how much is it gonna impact
the ecosystem how good is it gonna be in
terms of social impact so these
considerations of course are things we
can have the luxury to consider if we
are a you know government-funded
organization but a company like element
AI is going to look for profit which
addresses a different objective okay
you've already anticipated we're going
question here because that's exactly
what I was trying to understand was yeah
how you determine priorities and yes if
you even do determine parties and on
what basis so the Miele for example yeah
there's a social yes good yes exactly
and then I might take just one step
further given that our committees as
particular interest in health in
healthcare yeah so we're putting a lot
of emphasis on the healthcare
applications irrespective of whether
they're gonna be profitable and for
these in many cases we're looking we
were talking to a lot of medical
researchers and and we're gonna get our
funding well in part from what the
government already gives us but also
from existing other government funding
like yeah it's like CHR or answer and
and things like this and potentially
companies where where it's appropriate
so it's gonna be a mix but at the end of
the day we're not limited by purely you
know is this investment profitable in
two years or something like that is
there some indication you can give us
about what the best
the best investments could be in the
health field where it could have the
most impact what your brain power tells
you are the real you know the real
investments for the future right so so
the medical images is of no-brainer it's
like it's the low-hanging fruit and and
that's why they're already companies
involved there
I think another area but that depends on
our ability to collect data is helping
to for example process medical reports
that are natural language so one thing
that's happening with deep learning is
that we can now use computers to extract
information from pure texts it doesn't
have to be structured data and and and
doctors reports are even hard for humans
to make sense so this is a place where
we could you know extract a lot of
information in fact this could be used
also as a complement to medical medical
images or to train the Machine about you
know what did the doctor think about
what you know what was the problem with
that person based on the medical image
so there's a lot of places around
medical data where we have the usual
numbers test and so on but the new thing
really
besides our ability to exploit textual
data so well we have to make sure that
we collect that data usually it's the
case I know in Quebec at least but that
opens up a lot of potential applications
where those reports can be used to help
training all the systems or to reduce
the workload of people who process those
reports and so on okay
okay I think we have probably exhausted
this issue in a general sense today
certainly not in terms of the actual
applications and implications
dr. Ferguson fell we we were fascinated
a number of years ago when we were asked
to review the health accord and we
looked at health delivery across the
country of some of the really
interesting telemedicine examples that
were occurring in the West centered in
Winnipeg in Saskatoon and so on and your
illustration has added to that the
tremendous potential that exists there
ultimately of course we know from all of
the observations that no matter what it
is you're dealing with in health the
very best place to recover most quickly
and it is in the home or at least in
your local area and we know that the
technologies that are evolving have the
enormous potential to help deal with
that to take the very example you gave
and take it to somebody the the
practitioner the nurse practitioner in
the home dealing with the person at the
center based on a diagnosis that has
already been provided on the basis of
information gathered and transported to
either a robotic tool or to a real
practitioner who is interpreting that
data as it's coming in so some of the
issues I don't want you to respond to
this today but if you have any thoughts
as you go forward these are gonna have
an enormous impacts they're gonna be
very disruptive to a healthcare system
that is already overburdened largely
because of lack of innovation and
delivery of healthcare and so
particularly to you a doctor in pellets
you go away and if you have any thoughts
about how you know the we don't really
have a system in Canada we have a ball
cannot we have a collection of
balkanized systems and so how are we
going to innovate
in actually responding to the demand
from citizens who are going to be able
to know have a pretty good idea that
they've got to have a response on a
medical conditions that their iPhone has
just told them but they've got to get to
a center based on that sort of thing so
I'm going to leave you with a with a
request to think about that and of
course dr. ben jill we would like to
have any thoughts you might have with
regard to the large impact issues you've
been dealing with him AI I happen to
think that we have finally moved to
something we where we are a laggard in
international competition is centers of
true centers of excellence that bring in
a broad spectrum of interrelated
activities the in the in the biotech
area we were not able to advance as
rapidly because we were not able to get
a collection of expertise in a center
where the applications would occur
immediately because as you have hinted
at as you go through with the researcher
level in order for the researchers to
know exactly how they can benefit they
have to be in dialogue with people who
have needs of the use of knowledge and
so to again use the biotechnology
example in San Diego alone there are
more biotech companies than there are in
all of Canada you go out to lunch and
you two are sitting on a adjacent tables
you spot one another and you say to dr.
Ferguson pel look I we just observed
this and I heard you give a talk just
the other day that's how it spreads and
so I'm hopeful that in the AI area where
we are really putting serious money into
bringing collections together that we in
Canada will move forward with true
centers that will have the the huge
magnitude of impact and benefit for
Canadians but also in the larger sense
the economic and the knowledge to be
sent from delivering to the world and
bringing back to Canada so I want to
thank you both very much for being here
and if you have anything further
communicate through our Clerk and we'll
be delighted to hear from you once again
thanks to my colleagues and we'll see
you my colleagues at least
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
