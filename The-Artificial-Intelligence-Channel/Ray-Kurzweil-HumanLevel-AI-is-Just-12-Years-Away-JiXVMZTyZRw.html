session of the Council on Foreign
Relations 22nd annual term member
conference with reycarts while I'm
Nicholas Thompson I will be presiding
over today's session but also like to
thank Andrew Gundlach and him in the
Emory and Steven Keller foundation for
their generous support of the CFR turn
member program I was at you remember a
couple years ago I love this program
what a great event I'm so glad to be
here I'm also glad to be here with red
all right I'm gonna read Ray's biography
and then I'm gonna dig into some
questions about how the world is
changing and he will blow your mind
so Ray Kurzweil is one of the world's
leading inventors thinkers and futurist
with a 30-year track record of accurate
predictions it's true if you look at his
early books that are like 96% 98%
accurate called the Restless genius by
The Wall Street Journal the ultimate
thinking machine by Forbes magazine he
was selected as one of the top
entrepreneurs by Inc magazine which
described him as the rightful heir to
Thomas Edison PBS selected him as one of
the 16 revolutionaries who made America
reading his bio I was upset that he
quotes all of my competitors I'm gonna
add a quote from Wired magazine which is
his mission is bolder than any voyage to
space Wired magazine Ray was the
principal inventor of the first ccd
flatbed scanner the first Omni thawne
optical character recognition the first
print to speech reading machine for the
blind the first text-to-speech
synthesizer the first music synthesizer
capable of recreating the grand piano
and other orchestral instruments and the
first commercially marketed large
vocabulary speech recognition among
Ray's many honors he received a Grammy
Award for outstanding achievements in
music technology he's the recipient of
the National Medal of Technology was
inducted into the National Inventors
Hall of Fame holds 21 honorary
doctorates and honors from three US
presidents amazing Ray's written five
national best-selling books which you
should all buy immediately if you're on
your phone including New York Times
bestsellers the singularity is near and
how to create a mind he is the
co-founder and Chancellor of singularity
University and director of engineering
at Google heading up a team developing
machine intelligence and natural
language understanding also as I learned
walking here is the father of one of my
sister's friends from grade school who
referred to him as the cool dad with the
electric pianos so
welcome Rick but great to be here all
right so some of you are probably
familiar with his work some of you may
not be but let's begin ray by talking
about the law of accelerating returns
what that means for technology lay out a
framework for what's about to happen and
then we'll dig into how foreign policy
is gonna be turned on its head
sure well that's the basis of my
futurism in 1981 I realized that the key
to being successful as inventor was
timing the inventors whose names you
recognized like Thomas Edison or my new
boss my first boss Larry Page we're in
the right place with the right idea at
the right time and timing turns out to
be important for everything from writing
magazine articles to making investments
to romance you got to be in the right
place at the right time so I started
with the common wisdom that you cannot
predict the future and I made a very
surprising discovery there's actually
one thing about the future that's
remarkably predictable and that is that
the price performance and capacity not
of everything out of every technology
but every information technology follows
a very predictable path and that path is
exponential not linear so that's the law
of accelerating of trends but it bears a
little explanation so I had the price
proponents of computing calculations per
second per constant dollar going back to
the 1890 census through 1980 on a
logarithmic scale where a straight line
is exponential growth it was a gradual
second level of exponential but it was a
very smooth curve and you could not see
World War 1 or World War 2 or the Great
Depression or the Cold War on that curve
so I projected it out to 2050 we're now
36 years later it's exactly where it
should be so this is not just looking
backward now and overfitting to past
data but this has been a forward-looking
progression that started in 1981 and
it's true of many different measures of
information technology and the
progression isn't is not linear its
exponential and our brains are linear if
you wonder why we have a brain it's
the future but the kind of challenges we
had you know 50,000 years ago when our
brains were evolving real inia ones we'd
look up and say okay that animals going
that way I'm coming up the path this way
we're gonna meet at that rock that's not
a good idea I'm gonna take a different
path that was good for survival that
became hardwired in our brains we didn't
expect that animal to speed up as it
went along we made a linear projection
the primary difference between myself
and my critics and many of them are
coming around is we're looking at the
same world they apply their linear
intuition for example halfway through
the genome project one percent of the
genome had been collected after seven
years so mainstream critics said atole
this wasn't gonna work here are seven
years 1% it's gonna take 700 years just
like we said my reaction at the time was
well we finished 1% we're almost done
because 1% is only seven doublings from
100% it had been doubling every year
indeed that continued the project was
finished seven years later that's
continued since the end of the genome
project that first genome cost a billion
dollars we're now down to a thousand
dollars and every other aspect of what
we call biotechnology understanding this
data modeling and simulating it and most
importantly reprogramming it is
progressing exponentially and I'll
mention just one implication of the law
of accelerating a transfer because it
has many ripple effects and it's really
behind this remarkable digital
revolution we see is a 50 percent
deflation rate in information technology
so I can get the same computation
communication genic sequencing brain
data as I could a year ago for half the
price today that's why you can buy an
iPhone or an Android phone that's twice
as good as the one two years ago for
half the price we've put some of the
improved price performance in price and
some of it into performance so us may
actually just a few minutes ago and a
question that I was also asked by
Christine Lagarde head of the IMF at her
annual meeting recently how come we
don't see this in productivity
statistics and that's because we
factored it out we put it in the
numerator on the denominator so when
this girl in Africa by
it's a smartphone for $75 it counts as
$75 of economic activity despite the
fact that it's literally a trillion
dollars of computation circa 1960 a
billion dollars circa 1980
it's got millions of dollars of free
information apps just one of which is an
encyclopedia far better than the one I
saved up for years as a teenager to buy
all that counts for zero in economic
activity because it's free so we really
don't count the value of these products
and people have compiled these to say
well we taken in consideration quality
improvement of products but really it
using models that use the old linear
assumption so then Christine said yes
it's true the digital world is amazing
we can do all these remarkable things
but you can't where information
technology you can't eat it you can't
wear it you can't live in it and that's
my next point was all of that's going to
change we'll be able to print out
clothing using 3d printers not today
we're kind of in the hype phase of 3d
printing but the 2020s early 2020s will
be able to print out clothing there'll
be lots of cool open-source designs you
can download for free we'll still have a
fashion industry just like we still have
a music and movie and book industry
coexistence of free open-source products
which are great leveller and and
proprietary products will print well be
able to create food very inexpensively
using 3d vertical agriculture using
hydroponic plants for fruits and
vegetables in vitro cloning of muscle
tissue for meat the first hamburger to
be produced this way has already been
consumed it was expensive was a few
hundred thousand dollars but
but but it was very good but that's but
that's research so it's a long
discussion but all of these different
resources are going to become
information technologies a building was
put together recently as a demo using
little modules snap together lego style
printed on a 3d printer in Asia put
together three story office building in
a few days
that'll be the nature of construction
and the 2020s 3d printers will print out
the physical things we need she said ok
but we're getting very crowded land is
not expanding that's not an information
technology I said well actually there's
lots of land we just have decided to
crown our selves together so we could
work and play together cities was an
early invention
we're already sweating out with even the
crude virtual and augmented reality we
have today and try taking a train trip
anywhere in the world and you'll see
that 97% of the of the land is unused
alright so lots coming let's talk about
intelligence so like the phone in my
pocket it's better than I am at math
it's better than I meant go it's better
than I am a lot of things
when will it be better at me at holding
a conversation when will the phone
interview you instead of me we do have
technologies you can have conversations
I mean my team at Google created smart
replies you know when you ray actually
answers all of your emails there's
another way to describe his job at
Google which is amazing yeah so we're
writing millions of emails and it has to
understand the meaning of the email it's
responding to even though the proposed
suggestions are brief but your question
really is a turing equivalent question
you you need its equivalent to the
turing test and i'm a believer that the
turing test is a valid test of the full
range of human intelligence you need the
full flexibility of human intelligence
to pass a balancing test there's no
simple natural language processing
tricks you can do to to do that that's
where a human judge can't tell the
difference between talking over what he
called teletype lines basically instant
message
with an AI versus a human if you and if
the human judge can't tell the
difference then we consider the human to
the AI to be at human levels which is
really what you're asking I've been
that's been a key prediction of mine
I've been consistent that same 2029
in 1989 and the agent tells her machines
I bounded that between the early 2020s
and late 2013 and age of spiritual
machines in 99 I said 2029 Stanford the
Stanford AI department found that
daunting so they held a conference and
the consensus of the experts at that
time was hundreds of years 25 percent
thought it would never happen my view
and the consensus view or the median
view of AI experts have been getting
closer together but not because I've
been changing my view and in 2006 there
was a Dartmouth conference called AI 50
celebrating the 50th anniversary of the
1956 Dartmouth conference where
artificial intelligence got its name by
John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky who was
my mentor for over 50 years and the
consensus center was 50 years so at that
time I was saying 23 years median we
just had it actually in AI ethics
conference at Asilomar pattern on the
successful biotech selmour conference of
40 years earlier and the consensus view
there was about twenty to twenty to
thirty years I'm saying well at that
time 13 so the median view now is I'm
still more optimistic but not by that
much and there's a growing group of
people who think I'm too conservative I
think that a key issue I didn't mention
with the law of accelerating returns not
only does the hardware progressed
exponentially but so does the software
and that's a long discussion but we can
see now the daunting pace of progress
with one milestone after another falling
2 to AI and we can talk about some of
the techniques but 20 so I'm feeling
more and more confident
and I think the AI community is gaining
confidence that we're not far off from
that milestone all right so I got 12
more years I can do this kind of thing
so anybody in the CFR booking Department
please keep inviting me because I do
enjoy doing these and time is limited
let's talk a little bit about regulation
and a lot of people in this room let me
comment on that that this is not an
alien invasion of intelligent machines
from Mars we create tools to extend our
reach couldn't reach that fruit at that
higher branch a thousand years ago so we
invented a tool that extended our reach
who here could build this building with
our bare hands when we created machines
that extends and leverage our muscles we
can now access all of human knowledge
with a few keystrokes and we're going to
literally merge with them with this
technology with AI to make us smarter it
already does I mean these devices are
brain extenders and people really think
of it that way yeah and that's a new
thing I mean people didn't think of
their smartphones that way just a few
years ago they literally go inside our
bodies and brains but I think that's an
arbitrary distinction even though
they're outside our bodies and brains
they're already brain extenders and they
will make us smarter and funnier well I
could use some of that might be five
years away so let's let's talk about how
to make this future go forward in the
best way so we have an opportunity here
you have three hundred people who are
gonna be making some of the most
important policy decisions I see people
from tech companies here making big
decisions at tech companies people in
Congress people in the White House
people probably in Foreign Ministries
explain the sort of the framework for
policy makers in how they should think
about this accelerating technology what
they should do and what they should not
do well I mean there has been a lot of
focus on AI ethics how to keep the
technology safe and it's kind of a
polarized discussion like a lot of
discussions nowadays I've actually
talked about both promise and peril for
quite a long time I started in the 1990s
and did extensively in 99 you might
remember Bill Joyce cover story in Wired
I wasn't there at the time right but
that was a reflection on my book
special machines which has just come out
talking about the great promise and
peril and he focused on the peril and it
created quite a firestorm then 2006
chapter 8 of the singularities near is
the deeply intertwined promise versus
peril of GNR genetics and technology and
robotics technology has always been a
double-edged sword fire kept us warm
cooked our food and burned down our
houses these technologies are much more
powerful it's also a long discussion but
I think we should go through three
phases at least I did in contemplating
this first is delight at the opportunity
to overcome age-old afflictions poverty
disease and so on then alarm that these
technologies can be destructive and
cause even existential risks and finally
I think where we need to come out is a
appreciation that we have a moral
imperative to continue progress in these
technologies because despite the
progress we've made and that's all
another issue people think things are
getting worse but they're actually
getting better and we could talk about
that but there's still a lot of human
suffering to be overcome it's only
continued progress particularly in AI
that's going to enable us to continue
overcoming poverty and disease and
environmental degradation while we
attend to the peril and there's a good
framework for doing that the 40 years
ago I lived to this a moment ago there
were visionaries or both the promise and
the peril of biotechnology basically
reprogramming biology away from disease
and aging neither of which was feasible
40 years ago so they held a conference
called the Asilomar conference at the
conference center in Asilomar and came
up with ethical guidelines and
strategies how to keep these
technologies safe so now it's 40 years
later we are getting clinical impact of
biotechnology it's a trickle today it'll
be a flood over the next decade the
number of people who've been harmed
either accidentally or intentionally by
abuse of biotechnology
so far has been zero that doesn't mean
we can cross it or a list okay we took
care of that one but it is because we
have to keep revising these guidelines
because the technology keeps getting
more sophisticated but it's a good model
for how to proceed and we just we just
had our first Asilomar conference on AI
ethics and a lot of these ethical
guidelines it's particularly in the case
of say biotechnology have been fashioned
into law so I think that's the goal it's
the first thing to understand the
extremes or oh let's ban the technology
look let's slow it down they're really
not the right approach that's guided in
a constructive manner there there are
strategies to do that that's another
complicated discussion mm-hmm well let's
let's delve into that complicated
discussion at least at least for a
minute or two what you know you can
imagine you can imagine some rules that
say Congress could say that anybody
working on a certain kind of technology
has to make their data open right for
example or has to be willing to share
their data sets and at least to allow
competitive markets over these
incredibly powerful these incredibly
powerful tools you can imagine the
government saying actually there'll be a
big government-funded option that we're
gonna have kind of like open AI but run
by run by the government you can imagine
a huge national infrastructure movement
to build out this technology so at least
people with public interest at heart
have control over some of it what would
you recommend well I think open source
data and algorithms in general is a good
idea Google put all of its AI algorithms
in the public domain with tensorflow
which is open source a lot of data is
open source I think that's a good
direction to go in I think it's really
the combination of open source and the
ongoing law of accelerating returns that
will bring us closer and closer to the
ideals
I remember in fourth grade my social
studies teacher put on the board from
each according to his ability to each
according to his need
and he asked a class well what's wrong
with that or so no that's great and he
said well that's the premise of
communism and god oh my god is he could
commie and but that is a good goal
forced collectivism was a bad strategy
but I think we can get to that goal
through a combination of open source and
the ongoing exponential progress in both
hardware and software so I think it's a
it's a good direction to go in there are
lots of issues such as privacy that are
critical to maintain and I think people
in this field are generally concerned
about the issues there was a lot of
representation by Google and deep mine
you know at this Asilomar conference
it's not clear what the right answers
are I think we want to keep continued
the progress but when you have so much
power even with good intentions it can
be abusive what worries you I mean your
view of the future is very optimistic
that's very encouraging to hear but what
worries you well I've been accused of
being an optimist but as a as a and you
have to be an optimist to be an
entrepreneur because if you knew all the
problems that you're going to encounter
you'd probably never start any project
but I have as I say being concerned
about and written about the downsides
which are existential where the first
existential risk to humanity when I was
in grade school we would have these
civil defense drills where we'd get
under our desks and put our hands behind
our heads to protect us from a
thermonuclear war and it worked so we
have we have new existential risk these
technologies are very powerful and so I
do worry about that even though I'm an
optimist and I'm optimistic that we'll
make it through I'm not as optimistic
that there won't be difficult
episodes world war two fifty million
people died and that was certainly
exacerbated by
the power of technology at that time
yeah I think it's important though for
people to recognize we are making
progress and there was a poll taken of
24,000 people in 26 countries recently
and asked has poverty worldwide gotten
better or worse 90% said incorrectly
it's gotten worse only 1% said correctly
that it has fallen by 50 percent or more
there's a general pessimism that things
are getting worse or world's getting
more violent so I say yeah oh this is
the most peaceful time in human history
and people say don't you pay attention
to the news there's just an incident a
few days ago and a few days before that
well our information about what's wrong
with the world is getting exponentially
better and certainly it's far from a
perfect world but your chance affected
Steven Pinker doctors Pinker documents
this and this book the better angels of
our nature there's been an exponential
decline in the likelihood of your being
killed by interpersonal or
state-sponsored violence and so that's
another discussion but we're not gonna
be killed we're gonna have a Q&amp;amp;A and
about five minutes so I'm gonna ask you
one more question which is about their
futures which is what should they do
right they're about to enter a world
where the career choices are career
choices mapped onto a world with
completely different technology so in
your view what advice do you give the
people in this room well it really is a
old piece of advice which is to follow
your passion because there's really no
area that's not going to be affected or
that isn't a part of this story my
father knew he had a passion for music
from a very young age and music is
relevant to the story the neocortex is a
hierarchy of modules and we got an
additional amount of neocortex two
million years ago and it got these big
foreheads and what we did with it put it
at the top of the neocortical hierarchy
and that was the enabling factor for us
to invent music every human culture ever
discovered has music and no
other animals have music humorists came
with that additional neocortex language
hard science technology magazines we're
gonna do it again we're gonna merge with
the air quotes simulated neocortex in
the cloud and they get so again we'll be
smarter will create new forms of
communication that are as profound as
music is try explaining music to an
animal that doesn't understand that
concept so everything is really relevant
and it's not going to my view is not
that the AI is kind of displace us it's
going to enhance us it does already I
mean who can do their work without these
brain extenders we have today and that's
going to continue to be the case and
people say well only the wealthy gonna
have these tools and I say yeah like
smartphones of which the three billion I
just I just I was saying two billion but
it just read the new statistic now it's
three billion it'll be six billion in a
couple years that's because of this
fantastic price performance explosion so
these technologies only the wealthy will
be able to have these technologies at a
point in time where they don't work by
the time they work well
they're virtually free so you know find
where you have a passion some people
have complex passions that are not
easily categorized and to find a way of
contributing the world what do you think
you can make a difference use the tools
that are available the reason I came up
with the law of accelerating turns
literally is was to tie my own
technology project so I could start them
a few years before they were feasible so
try to anticipate where technology's
going and it's people forget where where
we've come from I mean just a few years
ago we had the little devices it looked
like it smart phone but they didn't work
very well and so that revolution and
mobile apps for example did you know
hardly existed five years ago the world
will become probably different in five
years so try to time your projects to
kind of meet the train at the station
all right if council information turn
members do not have questions break for
as well I will eat my shoes and already
we have half the front two rows so right
here
police say state your affiliation ask
the question a reminder this meeting is
on-the-record
so your words can and will be used
against you so at a diovan will deutsche
bank would all due respect sir you're so
smart it's kind of scary and I think the
same holds true for the technology so I
was wondering what sort of strategies do
you envision for people in your spaces
of explaining this and to make it less
scary for normal people
well the the unknown is scary so part of
my mission has been trying to explain
where we're going and show how it has
been beneficial we've overcome I mean
human life used to be extremely
difficult if you want to read something
scary read about life 200 years ago
thomas hobbes described as a short
brutish disaster prefer disaster prone
disease and poverty filled and there's
no understanding the germ theory of
disease people got diseases
all the time there was no antibiotics a
routine infection withdraw a family into
economic desperation there are no safe
social safety nets life expectancy was
37 in 1800 and even the kings and queens
didn't have amenities a century or two
ago that the poor have today like flush
toilets and refrigerators and radio TV
computers so the future really will
provide an opportunity to continue to
overcome human affliction and add to our
creativity there's a lot of fear about
jobs but the movement has also been in
the right direction
fire oppression features in 1900 I'd say
well 38% of you work on farms and 25% of
your kin factories it's 2/3 of the
population but I predict in a hundred
years that'll be 2% on farms and 9% in
factories and everybody go oh my god
we're gonna be out of work and they say
well don't worry well every job we
destroy at the bottom of the skillet
we're gonna create more than one job at
the top of the skill ladder and people
would go oh great what new jobs and I
say well I don't know they haven't been
invented yet which is part of the
problem we can clearly see today we can
see even better because they're a better
communication and knowledge the jobs
going away if you're driving a truck or
a car you've probably heard about
self-driving vehicles and we can't see
what's coming for our really prescient
in 1900 I say well you'll be creating
websites and doing data analytics and
apps for mobile devices nobody would
have any idea what I'm talking about
so some economists say yes that's all
true but it slowed down in recent years
that's not true the whole mobile app
economy which is many different ways to
make money didn't exist five years ago
and so and I think most importantly not
everybody's thrilled with a job but
increasing fraction of people actually
get some of their self identification
and and gratification and self
actualization from their employment
which wasn't the case a hundred years
ago
so I try to articulate the the benefits
and and what we can see that's positive
about the future like to say I'm glad we
don't all drop that at 37 thank you
right well I gave a talk to junior high
school kids 13 and 14 year old science
winners from around the country and I
said to them if it hadn't been for the
scientific progress we've made you all
would be senior citizens because life
life expectancy was 19,000 years ago
hi Ilana Ackerson and I just did a
doctorate looking at how the development
of newer and better technology is a way
that we as humans express faith in a
better future for Humanity and so from
that lens I'd love to hear your thinking
on as we are now as intelligence is now
transcending us as humans in some ways
what are your thoughts about how we are
going to be redefining our understanding
of who we are as humans and taking your
phrase an age of spiritual machines how
we are from a spiritual perspective so
how is this going to fundamentally
change you know our lens on these things
right well great question we are the
species that changes ourselves and
changes who we are that came with that
additional neocortex two million years
ago and that we could then conceptualize
different features we had one other
evolutionary change which is this modest
appendage opposable thumb so I could
imagine I could take that branch and I
could strip off the leaves and create a
tool and then I had the dexterity to
actually carried out and so we created a
whole new evolutionary process of
evolution of Technology
you mentioned spirituality I think this
is all the spiritual process I'm a
theory is basically one of evolution and
so what what do we see in evolution both
biological evolution and technological
evolution which is really continuation
of biological evolution I have a chart
showing the the acceleration of change
which
goes very smoothly from biological to
technological evolution it took hundreds
of millions years from animals to evolve
for example and now we have paradigm
shifts in just a few years time well
what happens to entities in evolution
they get more complicated they get more
knowledgeable to get more creative they
get more beautiful so if we look at how
God has been described in different
religious traditions I grew up in a
Unitarian Church where we studied all
the de world's religions and there was a
common theme although they all have
different metaphors and different
stories God was described as an ideal as
being unlimited in what in those very
same qualities all-knowing infinitely
intelligent infinitely creative
infinitely loving and so on and that so
we actually improved those very
qualities at an exponential rate through
an evolutionary process never achieving
an infinite level but growing
explosively in that direction so we'd
never become God but we become more
godlike in these various qualities so
you can say that evolution is a
spiritual process bringing us closer to
God and the other implication that
spiritual and really where that title
age of spiritual machines come from is
what is as what is spiritual it's really
a word for consciousness our whole moral
system our sense of values is that
consciousness is the precious thing
that's the sort of underlying debate and
animal rights conscious entities are
what's important non conscious entities
are only important insofar as they
affect the conscious experience of
conscious entities so who and what our
conscious is the key question and that's
the underlying question and animal
rights that'll be a question when it
comes to I so I alluded to earlier we're
going to merge with this technology I'd
say we already have done that to some
extent medical nano robots will go
inside our brain connect our neocortex
to the cloud so your smartphone even
though it is itself a billion times
per dollar than the computer I use when
I was an undergraduate at MIT it
multiplies itself again a million fold
by connecting to millions of computers
in the cloud we can't do that directly
from our neocortex we do it indirectly
through these devices we'll do it
directly in the 2030s and not just to do
things like search and translation
directly from our brains but although
they will do that but to actually
connect to more neocortex so it'll be
just like what happened two million
years ago when we got these big
foreheads and we got this additional
neocortex who put it at the top of the
hierarchy that was the enabling factor
for humor and language and music and so
on we'll do it again only unlike two
million years ago it won't be a one-shot
deal we couldn't keep growing this
enclosure without making birth
impossible the cloud is pure information
technology it's not limited by a fixed
enclosure so we will become more and
more non-biological so people say oh
we're gonna lose our humanity well if
you define human that's being
necessarily by purely biological I think
already not purely human anymore because
we're not purely biological anymore and
we're gonna become increasingly
non-biological but that that's who we
are I mean that is the definition of
human the species that changes itself
that creates tools it goes beyond our
limitations
anybody conscious in the back of the
room how about way back there and red
dark hair yeah maybe you're not in red
but yeah it's part of a pink my glasses
aren't advanced enough
Remo's senator dick durbin Zaffis thank
you this is the most elegant description
of the robots coming that I've ever
heard and I'm just curious you know so
much the emphasis has been on sort of
the lovely side of human nature on
science and exploration and I'm I'm
curious as we sort of move more towards
a robot partners what about the dark
side what about war and war machines and
violence I think already and some early
AI experiments that have this issue of
sort of when you take the internet and
aggregate there is you know sort of a
hostility or negativity
and verbage that is put into the you
know put into some of these machines and
you know what is I guess what is your
thinking on that what is the reaction or
what are the controls for that and I
asked that as someone whose I'm an
optimist
it just I think at least from sitting in
Washington one of the worries about this
is you know how do you how do you filter
for that when we haven't even be able to
answer that question for the internet
yet no well let me come back to what I
think can be done about that but just to
make a overriding point that the
increase in communications I think has
fostered democracy and peace so that
started with books in the Middle Ages
and then we had other forms of
communication you could count the number
of democracies a century ago on the
fingers of one hand you could count the
number of democracies two centuries ago
on the fingers of one finger the world
is not a perfect democracy today but
that has been accepted as the ideal and
people these argue as to how they are a
democracy that's become the the model
that wasn't the case a century ago there
wasn't that consensus and the world has
become more peaceful as I just mentioned
and there's a lot of documentation on
that doesn't appear to be the case
because our information about what's
wrong with the world is getting
exponentially better and there's
actually an evolutionary preference for
bad news because there was actually in
your interest you know tens of thousands
of years ago for you to pay attention to
bad news a little rustling in the leaves
it might be a predator that was
important to pay attention to the fact
that your crops were 1% better than last
year that was not critical for your
survival for you to be aware of that
being said you know we're learning a lot
about how these platforms can be used to
amplify all kinds of human
inclinations and be manipulated and a
lot of this is fairly recent information
that we're learning but we can so ai
learns from examples there's a model in
the field that life begins at a billion
examples and the best way to get
examples is to learn from people so they
are very often learns from people not
always alpha go zero just learned from
itself by playing Co games against
itself but that's not always feasible
particularly when you're trying to deal
with more complex real-world issues
there's a major effort in the fields
going on and all the major companies and
in open-source research as well
2d bias AI because it's kind of pick up
biases from people if it's learning from
people and people have biases and so to
overcome gender bias and other types of
bi racial bias that can actually be a
goal as humans we pick up biases from
all the things we've seen a lot of it's
subconscious we then learn as educated
humans to recognize bias and try to
overcome it and we can have conflicts
within our own minds the metaphor that
my mentor Marvin Minsky used in the
title of his book society of mind I
think it's a good one because I very
often hear the society in my own mind
bickering about some issue and there's
different factions for different issues
but there's a whole area of research 2d
bias AI and to overcome the biases it
may pick up from people so that's one
type of research that can overcome
problems with with machine intelligence
and in these ways machine intelligence
you know can be actually less biased and
the humans that it learned from over
although I think despite
the promise in parellel that's
intertwined in social media is its
overall been a very beneficial thing I
walk through airports and every child
over the age of two is on their devices
and it's become a world community in I
think the generation now growing up more
so than any other generation feels that
they are citizens of the world because
they're really in touch with all the
cultures of the world hey Adam Geddy
with ionic security wray really
appreciate all the work you keep doing
with singularity but I do want to leap
forward to 2030 timeframe we've got the
nanobots were connected now I've got a
collective set of kind of thought and
and almost infinite capacity comparative
to 2030 2035 we're there that happens
and kind of on the same progression of
more information has created more peace
better kind of understanding of global
community versus these isolated
communities when we have the ability to
have that kind of much higher bandwidth
access to this extraordinary processing
and intelligence infrastructure does
that deeper appreciation now of
everybody else and every other culture
because we have the bandwidth to absorb
it and process it what are the
implications you see on nation-state
structures and global government
governing structures when the world is
truly connected that way I'm we were
already part of the way there you know
there's some issue in the retirement
funds in Italy in the whole world
that's only aware of it but it affects
everyone so we are not isolated islands
and haven't been that way for a long
time and there's appreciation how pieces
in issues of economics or Foreign
Affairs anywhere in the world have an
immediate effect on us it's not just
that we care about these other people
and you know old institutions continue
there's still horses and buggies not far
from here there's still mechanical
typewriters religion is still an
institution but it has much less effect
than it did say a century ago wasn't
that long ago in human history that it
really governed and had deep influence
on every facet of everyone's life now
has a role that varies depending on the
person but it's a much less pervasive
force same things true of nation-states
I mean people really are increasingly
identifying as citizens of the world and
I think over time nation-states will
become less influential I mean I think
we're on that path wait can I just in
the last year in this country we have
not grown closer to the rest of the
world and a lot of people would say our
democracy has not gotten better is this
a blip in the ongoing continuing
progress and mankind coming together or
is this or many people misinterpreting
it well I mean the the polarization in
politics in the United States and some
other place in the world is I'm watching
it I don't think it's is an issue for
the kinds of things that we've been
talking about today we've had a you know
major blips in the world World War two
was a pretty big blip and actually
didn't affect these trends at all I mean
one of the remarkable things I noted in
81 when I first noticed this is where is
world war ii or world war 1 on these
graphs so it kind of has a mind of its
own
and there may be things that we don't
like in say certain government officials
the government but this very robust
discussion we're not in a totalitarian
era where you can't voice your views I'd
be more concerned if we moved in that
direction but I don't see that happening
so
not to diminish the importance of
government and who's in power and so
forth but it's it's at a different level
the kinds of issues we're talking about
are not really affected by these issues
so there there are existential risks
that I worry about that I mentioned
because technology is a double-edged
sword hi Aubrey Ruby Africa expert
network my question is about inequality
from a human history perspective maybe
we started out very equal as hunter and
gatherer but there are a lot of phases
at most of human history where
inequality is quite high and I'm
wondering whether you think the 20th
century was an anomaly in that sense and
how the diffusion of Technology is going
to impact inequality if you look at Gini
coefficients worldwide well I think
there's been a worldwide movement
towards greater equality ancient
societies were not equal first of all
gender roles were very rigid and there
was no concept of gender equality my own
family's been involved in this my
daughters right here but my
great-grandmother started the first
school in Europe they're provided higher
education for girls in 1868 taken over
by her daughter who was a became the
first woman to get a PhD in chemistry
and wrote about about this title of her
book it's one life is not enough which
kind of president should my interest in
life extension but if you talk about
gender equality we've come a long way
but there's all kinds of issues I mean
slavery was considered the norm
certainly here in the United States but
around the world not that long ago in
human history and this been our you know
recent issues with gay rights and gay
marriage and where there's a continual
progression I think of Human Rights the
the Unitarian Church I grew up in one
motto was many paths to the truth so we
studied all the world's religious
traditions but they were also focused on
the here now and several liberties and
we went to civil rights marches in the
South in the 1950s and so I think we are
making progress I mean there wasn't it
wasn't even discussion that these issues
not that long ago I mean when I was
economic equality is getting better
poverty and Asia has fallen by over 90%
according to the World Bank in the last
20 years they've gone from primitive
agrarian economies to thriving
information economies Africa and South
America have growth rates that are
substantially higher than the developed
world so this this any snapshot you take
there's inequality but it's dramatically
moving in the right direction
poverty world while it's fallen 50
percent in the last 20 years and there's
many other measures of that digital
people say the digital divide but you
know the Internet's smartphones like
very strong in Africa that's that's a
change just in the last few years so
we're moving in the right direction at
any one point in time this grave
inequality and people who are suffering
but but the numbers are are growing in
the right direction very far back last
man against the law hi my name is Lester
Melvin I guess my question is a question
very generic that you probably get asked
every day and I'm father for kids so I
think about it all the time so and that
is really why we have people like
yourself but in our country why do we
poor why do we score so poorly in STEM
why do you think that happens and what
do you think is the answer to that
because I'm trying to get my kids
prepared for 2035
well it's a interesting dichotomy we do
various measures fall behind on stem
there's still a gender issue with with
stem the girls are right up there with
the boys up through junior high school
but then they tend to drop out and we
don't really understand the reasons for
that there seem to be powerful cultural
issues at work and people are working on
overcoming that but we don't fully
understand it but despite all that the
United States leads in stem I mean the
most leading high tech companies are
American certainly other countries like
China are are moving rapidly but we do
we do have kind of an entrepreneurial
leadership there's a frontier mentality
that comes from the United States being
a place that you went to overcome
oppression and to seek a better life
that is I think ingrained in the
American character and also we are the
land of of all the world's peoples so we
understand all the different markets
around the world because all those
people are here and that's what makes up
America that's not true of most other
countries there's some diversity in some
countries but not nothing like the
United States
I do think stem literacy scientific
technological digital literacy is should
be an important part of Education
shocking to me that many high schools
don't have don't teach computer software
it should be it should be teaching
programming in elementary school it's a
good way to think it's a good way to
develop intellectual skills and good way
to view the world so I think this is a
good thing for us to focus on as a
nation we're doing well in
I think just to be a world citizen it's
important to actually have literacy in
these areas right there in the middle
adam Pearlman with the US courts taking
her hypothesis of you know connected
collective consciousness maybe maybe
collective maybe not what does that do
to individuality comparative advantage
on an individual level and the concept
of leadership if we're all connected
through implants or anything else well
yeah people another way of asking that
is aren't we going to all become the
same if we all have access to all this
knowledge and thinking capacity I think
we'll actually become more different
we're actually pretty much the same as
you know unenhanced we all have a very
similar architecture of 300 million
neocortical modules and some fixed
capacity we'll be able to delve much
more deeply into specific issues or
skills or areas of insight as we enhance
our thinking capacity and we can do that
already to the extent that we have these
brain extenders it's very hard to write
a book 30 years ago my most important
information technology was a roll of
quarters to feed the copier in the
public library so we do have the ability
to think more deeply so people will I
mean we already see a tremendous
diversity for example of musical fields
I mean when I was a kid there was pop
music and there was jazz and classical
music and that was it and now there's
hundreds of genres and so that's will
continue there'll be a tremendous
diversity of ways you can approach
subjects and I think people will become
more different when they have more
capacity to think more deeply last
question I'm always moved exponentially
at the
so you're out of it Jamie Asif from the
open philanthropy project thank you for
coming to speak with us today I I hear
from your remarks that you're making a
prediction that artificial general
intelligence is 12 years out and you've
you mentioned a couple times that
notwithstanding your optimism you are
concerned somewhat about existential
risks so I was wondering if you could
elaborate a little bit more on what you
mean by that and and what is the most
important thing that you think
technologists should be doing to reduce
those risks well I mean existential
risks are risks that threaten the
survival of our civilization so the
first existential risks with humanity of
her face was nuclear proliferation we
have had the ability to destroy all of
humanity some some number of times over
this debate about what the number is but
doesn't really matter and these new
technologies it's not hard to come up
with scenarios where they could be
highly destructive or destroy all of
humanity so biotechnology for example we
have the ability to reprogram biology
away from disease immunotherapy for
example which is a very exciting
breakthrough in cancer I think it's
going to be quite revolutionary just
getting started it's reprogramming the
immune system to go after cancer which
it normally doesn't do but bio tears
could reprogram a virus to be more
deadly and more communicable more
stealthy and create a super weapon and
that was the specter that spawned this
first Asilomar conference 40 years ago
and there's been recurring conferences
to make these ethical guidelines and
safety protocols and strategies more
sophisticated and so far it's worked but
we keep making the technology more
sophisticated so we have to you know
reinvent them over and over again so we
just had our first Asilomar conference
on AI ethics we came up with a set of
ethics which
all signed off on a lot of them are
somewhat vague I think if you look back
at the Scylla more guidelines for
biotech 40 years ago it was the same
thing they've got more teeth and more
specificity and more significance over
time I think it's an important issue to
give a high priority to you know this
issue we're finding we have to build
ethical values into software a classic
example is your self-driving car the
whole boat whole motive for self-driving
cars is there of you know they'll
eliminate 99% of the 2 million deaths a
year from human drivers but it will get
into situation where it has to make an
ethical decision should should it drive
towards the baby carriage towards the
elderly couple or towards the wall and
and perhaps kill your passenger do you
have an ethical guideline to your
passenger who might own you
you can't send an email to the software
designers in that second stance so gee
what should I do it's got to be built
into the software so that those are
practical issues and there's a whole
area of AI ethics going over this but
how do we deal with the more existential
risks weaponization of AI which is not
something in the future I mean Defense
Department's all around the world have
been applying AI there was a document
going around asking people to agree to
ban autonomous weapons which sounds like
a good idea and the example that that's
used as well we banned chemical weapons
so why not autonomous AI weapons it's a
little more complicated because you know
we can get by without anthrax and
without smallpox it's ok to just ban
them but autonomous Thomas weapon is is
a dual use technology the Amazon drone
that's delivering your frozen waffles or
medicine to a hospital in Africa
could be delivering a weapon it's the
same technology and kind of the horse is
already out of the barn so it which is
just to say that it's a more complicated
issue how did it deal with that but the
goal is to reap the promise and control
the peril
there's no simple sort of algorithms
there's no little subroutine we can put
in our eyes okay put this subroutine in
and it will keep your a is benign there
are technical strategies when it comes
to biotechnology and nanotechnology but
intelligence is inherently
uncontrollable you know if there's some
entity that's more powerful than you and
I and it's not for our destruction the
best strategies not to get in that
situation in the first place and failing
that the best next strategy would be to
get some other AI that's even more
intelligent than the one that's out for
you on your side intelligence is
inherently uncontrollable and so my
strategy which is not foolproof is to
practice the kind of ethics and morality
and values we'd like to see in in the
world in our own human society because
it's future Society as I say it's not
some invasion from Mars of intelligent
machines it's going to it is emerging
from our civilization today it's going
to be an enhancement if who we are and
so if we're practicing the kind of
values we cherish in our world today
that's the best strategy to have a world
in the future that embodies those values
all right that's the perfect note to end
on
