Edinburgh Nielsen and Alison goes well
so thank you all for coming
why don't you start by telling us a
little about your book okay I guess
we'll dive right in you start the book
is called mushy flat for proud and it's
available for sale and we will drive
down the resale value of it by signing
it for you afterward exactly so it's
about three great rebalancing mind and
machines product and platform core and
crowd we couldn't fit all those words on
the cover so we just use the last three
and that's the direction that the world
is changing right now not all the way
but part way from decision making moving
more from human minds towards machines
both data-driven decision making and
especially artificial intelligence
moving from products towards platforms
like the five most valuable companies on
the planet Apple Amazon alphabet Google
Microsoft and Facebook and moving from
the core to the crowd the core being the
people at the center of the cup of a
company or organization that
traditionally have made most of the
important decisions towards the crowd
which is people outside of it and now
could include literally billions of
people connected with a digital network
in a way they never were before and we
should tell you a bit about where the
book came from because as we heard
during the introduction Eric and I wrote
a book that came out in early 2014
called the second Machine Age and it was
all about this period of crazy tech
progress that we're living through and
as soon as we published it we noticed
this really interesting phenomenon
we'd go to conferences and we talk about
the book and then we would have really
interesting hallway conversations over
and over again in the same hallway
conversation somebody would come up to
us and say essentially look I run
company X and I believe the story you're
telling now what what do I need to do
differently how do I need to think about
my business model the industry I'm
competing in this world that we're
heading into I know things are changing
I need kind of a guidebook for this and
the more we heard this or the more we
realized this was going to be the next
book that we were going to work on the
central problem was we didn't know the
answer to that question when we first
started hearing it over and over but we
turned that bug into a feature and said
look this is really intellectually rich
territory to go to go out and try to
write a like a guidebook to this new
economy to this new business world that
we're heading into so we headed out in
our main research approach in addition
to doing what academics are supposed to
do which is read lots of research and
digest papers and do all of that of what
we do that's a little bit different and
that's much more fun is we go out and
talk to the Alpha geeks these the this
is a term we learned from our friend Tim
O'Reilly these are the people who are
inventing the future their companies and
their organizations are changing things
quickly so we went off and hit the road
and talked to them a lot and then what
our homework we think was to try to
distill down what they were saying and
and come up with some kind of framework
or a way to think about the changes that
are happening so quickly and that's
where Eric's the three-part structure
that Eric just described came from we
kind of heard that machines were getting
just ridiculously more powerful we
couldn't leave out the artificial
intelligence and machine learning
revolution we kept on seeing these weird
companies appear in disrupt industry
after industry and they all look like
platforms to us and we kept on seeing
these examples of companies and/or
individuals and things like look at
Linux and Wikipedia that were activating
the energy of lots and lots of very
diverse people all around the world
the crowd was clearly a really powerful
phenomenon so that led to the three-part
structure that's in the book so I think
one of the anecdotes that comes up a lot
on these topics in which you have early
in your book is about alphago and that's
sort of a good way who here is familiar
with the alphago story we see yeah how
much yeah okay okay for those who aren't
do you guys want to explain what
happened
sure alphago is an example of a machine
learning algorithm that was trained to
play again the game of go the ancient
game of go it's a sort of a little board
game but it turns out to be vastly more
complicated than say chess which we
beat by humans back in five machines
back in 1997 there are it's been copy
that there are more possible moves in a
game of Go than there are atoms in the
universe and that means the traditional
programming techniques of trying to
search exhaustively even a tiny fraction
of the moves is completely infeasible
and for that reason as recently as 2015
computer scientists were surveyed and
asked when they thought machines would
be able to beat
humans at the game of Go and they
predicted a probably around 2027 that
was the median estimate and these were
insiders we polled they pulled
artificial intelligence experts and
asked this question but as some of you
in the audience know a machine did beat
the world champion and go just last year
and they did it by using this new
technique not of trying to exhaustively
search the moves but it by looking at
the board and seeing patterns in it and
that's the way humans do it humans when
they play the game of Go they don't even
know how they do it if you ask them how
do you play go they can't explain it
they just say I look at the board and I
see a move that seems right but I can't
explain how I can't describe the
strategy I can't tell you exactly what
I'm doing and you can imagine if they
can't explain - how are you going to
program it how are you gonna code it but
this new approach to machine learning
where the machines look at lots and lots
of examples of successes and failures
the machines can figure out the patterns
on their own and by appliance technique
called deep neural nets and
reinforcement learning the machines were
able to very rapidly learn the game of
go to the level where they could beat
the humans at the game of Go and now the
human champions when they see what the
machines are doing they say you know we
have not even touched the edge of the
game of Go we have been setting this for
3,000 years but the machines are so far
ahead of us we realize that we have no
conception of what is possible and the
reason Eric and I think that we are
still under estimating the impact and
the power of machine
despite the fact that we all read about
it in the press all the time is exactly
what he just said that here is a domain
of intense human study for three
millennia for three thousand years we
built up this body of what we thought
was really exhaustive knowledge about
how to play this game
this piece of machine learning
technology comes out of nowhere and
shows us how much more Headroom there is
in this particular domain that's pretty
amazing and when we think about all of
the other incredibly complex things that
we're trying to get good at whether that
is solving the mysteries of cancer
whether that is unlocking the secrets of
protein folding
whether that is figuring out what to
invest in whether that is dealing with
the silly complexity of the human genome
we now have a colleague for that work
and a colleague that can not be limited
by the knowledge that we humans possess
right now might be able to show us some
ways forward and this last point is
really the key one and one of the
reasons we call it sometimes we call it
the second wave of the second Machine
Age the second Machine Age is this idea
that machines start doing mental tasks
the way that in the first Machine Age
they started doing physical tasks but
the way for the past few decades that
we've taught machines to do mental tasks
is we've programmed them we've codified
our own knowledge and encoded it so that
the machines could do it that tell them
how to do tax preparation or how to do
any of spreadsheet it's all stuff that
we already knew exactly what needed to
be done and we just had to be very very
very precise and the machine would do
the same thing that's great I mean that
generated trillions of dollars worth of
value so that's great but there's so
many problems that it sounds paradoxical
but that we don't really know how to do
them like I wouldn't know how to code
how to recognize my mother's face or how
to ride a bicycle
these are things we just know how to do
intuitively but we can't explain them
and so we know more than we can tell
with the machine learning that we just
described we now have opened up those
possibilities these machines are
learning on their own how to solve those
problems not by having a humans teach
them painstakingly step by step but
instead by giving them examples of what
works and doesn't work this is a cat
this is a dog this is a human face this
is the word yes or
in French or in English and the machines
and you give them enough examples we'll
figure out the patterns on their own
it's really a remarkable transition that
has really become important only the
past few years mostly really since we
wrote the last book the second Machine
Age there was an example that went viral
on Twitter a while back it was can you
tell could the machine tell whether it's
a blueberry muffin or a dog because it
had the little dots on the cyst but one
thing I loved about that there was
another one that came at the same time
there was the Labradoodle or the
Kentucky Fried Chicken and it's actually
surprisingly hard to tell the difference
at a quick glance I was like dog dog
chicken dog and not getting it right all
but this is one of these stories that
really works better if you look at the
picture so I encourage you all if you
google because right now you don't
really see like that someone would
accidentally bite into a piece of
Labradoodle but it could if you see the
pictures they could be hard to tell
apart but we humans can often do it and
and what's really remarkable is that
seven years ago machine had about a 30%
error rate on a big database called
image net and that was using the best
techniques now the error rate is down
lower than 5% which importantly is less
than the error rate of humans on that
same data set so we've kind of crossed
an inflection point it's not just a
matter of degree but it's just like when
you when you raise the temperature of
water past the boiling point it's a
fundamental transformation if a machine
can do a task better than a human then
if you're an entrepreneur or a manager
and you have to make a decision who do I
sign this time you're gonna pick the one
that can do the job better well so so
one thing I was hoping we could talk
about is this idea that in the future or
even now people will be learning from
machines in addition to teaching them
and one thing I like about the alphago
story is that after the world champion
was defeated he said so beautiful so
beautiful about the moves because it
wasn't something he'd ever
conceptualized before and that's
something that we could see in a lot of
fields and we're seeing it over and over
and you're exactly right about people
learning side by side with machines
you're talking about Lisa Dahl who was
the Korean guy that got beat
last spring by alphago and a very very
widely televised match it's part of the
reason that there was a downward blip in
the Korean economy for a while everyone
stopped what they were doing it wasn't a
big deal
to what we think really important things
happened along the lines of your
question
one was that sudol was beating about 75
percent of his top-level human opponents
before he played alphago after he got
done playing alphago and dealt with that
technology for a while he was beating
about 90% of his human opponents so he
made a big quantum leap upward in his
game already a very high level made a
quantum leap upward the other thing that
happened is that sales of go boards in
Korea and throughout Asia skyrocketed
and little kids started playing the
games and much much higher volume than
they were before
so Ellison one thing we hear once in a
while is only heavens isn't it terrible
that we're no longer the best at this
particular activity and doesn't that
reduce human value or dignity
i I think that's dead flat wrong because
if we define ourselves by the things
that were best in the universe at that's
a pretty silly thing to do we now have
this neat thing happening out there that
people want to be part of if technology
is part of that neat thing I think
that's good what do you think I think
it's good and let me underscore one of
the points that Amy made Lisa Thal got a
lot better wife because he played a
bunch of games raised this machine no
that wasn't it it's because this machine
came at the game from a fundamentally
different way when they saw some of the
moves that the machine made the the go
expert said at first it oh my god that
is idiotic
yeah there's a bug here that's a
disaster everybody every beginner knows
not to do what the Machine just did and
then a few moves later guess what the
Machine won and they're like oh I see
what he did there that is really
innovative and so for three thousand
years humans have been learning from
other humans they got learning from
their masters yeah if they made that
move the machine made that their master
would slap their wrists and say stupid
human don't do that but the machine came
out of fourth with fresh perspective
they have a different way of thinking if
you want to call it that and
they came up with some innovative
approaches and it's not just true in the
game of Go it's true in all kinds of
problems
the machines aren't just better in
certain ways but more importantly
perhaps they're different in certain
ways and they come out with a different
perspective and that opens up the
possibility that humans and machines can
work together and help each other
because they're not just two clones of
the same thing there are two different
kinds of intelligence and what's cool
about that story lots of things are cool
one of the things that's cool is they
you probably needed to be a player
somewhere near the level of Lisa doll to
even get the insight about why alphago
made the move that it did he needed to
be really good at this domain to start
to unpack why the machine was behaving
in this way because the machine was kind
of mute about why it was doing what it
was doing we need really high-level
humans to look at that and say I think I
know what's going on here let's go test
that idea so where are some company's
parts of the economy that we're already
seeing this instead of a replacement of
people with machines we're seeing like a
mutual collaboration in learning so let
me describe one it's not in a book it's
something we learned afterwards but it's
very much in the spirit of the book so
one of our friends Sebastian's run runs
a company called Udacity anybody here
know the company Udacity a bunch of
people yeah it's like an online learning
course company that has a bunch of
courses you can learn different things
in 90 days these 19 Android degrees so
people come to the their website and
they have a chat with sales reps say you
know is this course right for me is that
one what should I be doing human sales
reps not sales BOTS yeah yeah well
stories just wait stay tuned stay tuned
so when they come the human sales reps
some of them are better than others and
some of them are able to answer the
questions effectively convert the people
convince them that hey this is a good
course for you to take others not so
much
well Sebastian throne is a machine
learning expert and along with the grad
student they recognize you could take
the transcripts of all these chats that
becomes the data for what's called
supervised learning basically supervised
learning is giving examples of successes
and failures to a machine and letting
the Machine figure out what matters so
they gave these transcripts and they're
machine learning algorithms started
seeing patterns that the successful
sales reps had different ways of
answering questions at that point they
did not turn it over to the bot to the
answers because there's still too many
unstructured questions that the machine
would just be clues that but there is
sort of an 8020 rule there's certain
very common questions that account for a
big percentage of the queries and what
they did was they still have the humans
doing the interactions with their
incoming traffic but the bots would kind
of watch them and when one of these
common phrases common questions came up
the bot what kind of promise that you
know here's afraid you might consider
using it to work really well in the past
and then the humans would pick up on
that and especially the the not-so-good
sales reps saw their performance
improved dramatically and overall the
sales closing rate went up by about 50
percent so it's a tremendous improvement
but part of it was the ability to
combine the humans and machines in a way
that neither one of them wouldn't have
been would have been a successful on
their own and we should be clear in some
cases we are going to automate work and
just slack give it from minds over to
machines and that's the appropriate
thing to do but it's naive to think that
that's the unidirectional the only force
going on I we love that story because it
shows a real fans of technology and
automation realizing they still needed
humans involved in this process but we
could kind of amplify their abilities or
turbocharged their abilities with a lot
of smart technology in the background
and in the broader lesson that's going
to apply to machines platforms and cots
it's that each of those pairs of words
we're not saying turn the dial all the
way to one extreme instead we're saying
you got to think about the balance there
sometimes it makes sense to pull the
automate or go totally platform it go
told a crowd but in most cases you need
to find a balance there and the balance
is more towards machines platforms and
crowds than I think most companies or
individuals realize but it's not as
simple as just chopped but right the
first part of the words so this question
comes up a lot but but what do you see
as areas that are most resistant to the
advent of machines and computers like we
we were talking earlier about there's a
part in your book where you mentioned
this famous saying by
your bird would you like to quote it
yeah and Roberta's a lyricist and he
said a while back that the only thing
that that the only difference between a
completely unlinked series of
observations and a hit song is excessive
confidence on the part of the songwriter
and I think that's just a lovely way to
look at it but he's low-balling himself
really badly because it would be
trivially easy to program a computer to
spit out observations that might rhyme
and that might have words associated
with love and loss in them you can
program that computer pretty easily we
are incredibly confident that the lyrics
would be probably drivel would probably
not make a lot of sense and would not
activate any emotions on the part of the
rest of us and what what I believe great
writers what great human lyricists do is
they link they have those barely linked
observations but in a way that resonates
with other human beings and that is a
skill that we have not seen computers
come up with yet there's a concept from
linguistics that I find incredibly
helpful here then the concept is called
the intuition of the native speaker and
what that means is if I look at almost
any length or any complexity sentence in
English I can immediately tell if it's
grammatically correct or not before my
brain is processed its meaning before I
know what it's trying to convey my brain
goes yeah that that's kosher or not it's
I can't do I speak some French I can't
do that in French to save my life
English as a second language speakers
can't do that anywhere near well as I
can or any other native speaker can the
reason I bring that up is I believe we
humans have the native speakers
intuition about the human condition
about this the social world that we've
created about the physical world that we
move through trying to teach computers
to have that native intuition man if we
ever do that I believe that it's decades
away in the same way they're just second
language speakers about this world that
we've created so I have a lot of
confidence that that the human ability
to evoke an emotional response via words
and language man that when if that gets
automated quickly I'm actually going to
be surprised but but at the same time we
also have algorithms that are starting
to compose music yeah
hard to tell apart from the music of
famous composers so not not hard
actually impossible right very best so
the interesting question is what is the
difference between music yeah and lyrics
yeah and where what about that makes it
automatable and not automatable and and
this is getting far away from our area
of my area of expertise I'm not a
musicologist but but the aesthetics of
music are kind of well-known in western
music we know what chord progressions
sound good to our ears in which one
sound like like like
sirens clanging on a New York Street
right and we want to do more of the for
more and less of the latter so you can
encode that stuff and you know the rules
of a few you know the rules of a real
you know these kinds of things so it's
relatively easy to hit the button and
send those things out I think it goes
beyond that and that's part of it but
the machines that are doing a really
good job in music they're not
necessarily encoded with the rules of a
few or the code or the courts but there
are patterns that emerge and you don't
have to know anything about the deep
structure or meaning of the music you
see these patterns yeah and machines are
actually quite good at these more sort
of shallow pattern-matching recognition
but for the lyrics to really be
evocative you need to understand the
meaning it's not just that two words
often appear next to each other in
sequence if you really want to go beyond
that you need to understand something
about the human condition and and the
machines although they can recognize
patterns in words pairs or triples they
still do not really understand what the
words doing machine can translate one
word to one language to another but
they're not actually understanding
what's going on there and that's very
different similarly like machines can be
very good at certain kinds of video
games that are sort of Quick Reaction
shooter video games you shoot them
missile and it hits the space invader
great at that but if the if they game
involves some kind of deeper planning
and structure they're hopeless at that
and I think language is a little bit
more like a complicated video games and
music is more like the pattern-matching
we included in the book an excerpt from
a machine learning system that got
trained on Jane Austen novels and then
generated some Jane Austen ish Pro
it's not even that it's gibberish it
actively makes your head hurt to try it
it's it's bizarrely unpleasant to read
so unless we can turn and like make that
go 180 degrees different
I'm with Eric I don't think that's gonna
happen anytime soon well so that the
patterns thing is an interesting point
because it's often said when you look at
jobs and what jobs are most likely to
become automated that it's not the the
divide isn't high skill low skill so
much as repeatable and high frequency
tasks versus variable unpredictable
tasks and those are that's a good way
but I mean the broader lesson here is
that machines are not just good they're
superhuman at certain types of tasks we
I mean they've been superhuman at
arithmetic for decades so we shouldn't
be surprised and now they're getting
superhuman at certain kinds of pattern
recognition and if things are repeatable
as you say you're gonna be able to get
the data to be able to train a system if
they involve more complex planning
creativity those are things that are
much harder to have a machine at least
with our current wave of artificial
intelligence and one thing we want to
stress is we're talking about what's
available circa 2017 there's a bunch of
very very bright people working on all
sorts of things that may be
breakthroughs in 2018 or 2080 we're not
sure they haven't happened yet
but based on current technology these
these matching basically taking a bunch
of inputs X and mapping them into a
bunch of outputs Y and figuring out the
mapping for that they're really really
good at that if there's not too much
complexity between the XS and the Y's
and I even think that framework the
second one that you brought up is
rapidly becoming out-of-date because I
never would have thought of medical
diagnosis as any kind of routine
repeatable low-level kind of work that
you would hand off to a machine it's an
incredibly important and difficult and
subtle and complex pattern matching
exercise right machines are better at
those things than we are now and they've
come out of essentially nowhere and
reach superhuman levels of performance
so I think that medical diagnosis is
squarely in the sights of a very highly
autumn
double task and one that we should apply
a lot more machines to that we would
that did not appear to be the case five
or ten years ago and parts of it have
already crossed that threshold so if you
look at image recognition we talked
about recognizing dogs and cats or
recognizing faces but guess what you can
also apply it to medical images you know
here's a picture of a lung which one has
cancer which one doesn't have cancer
human pathologist and radiologists spend
long you know years of training to learn
exactly what to look for you train a
machine learning system to do that and
they can very rapidly learn not all not
only all the markers that are taught in
medical school but a number of new
markers that no humans had ever noticed
before yeah and so what what is the
accuracy comparison I mean you also talk
in your book about how machines are
rapidly eclipsing human experts in their
own subjects well this is a number
that's changing as we speak and even
since we finished that book there's been
significant improvements an article
published in Nature in February of this
year that example I gave of going from
30 percent to 5 percent on image
recognition was an example from a in
voice-recognition understanding speech
it went from eight point five percent
error rate to four point nine percent
Erik but what's really striking is not
just the improvement but that
improvement was done over the past not
ten years but past ten months since July
of actually 11 months yeah since July of
2016 so we're getting these these I mean
as we speak they're improving it more
and more and a lot of it just comes from
taking broadly the same set of
algorithms but a a lot more data a lot
more examples and be a lot more
computational power and with medicine
the studies that we've come across are
kind of conservative you want to be
circumspect about these things but they
generally say that a properly done
machine learning system will be at human
level performance even experienced
diagnostician performance I think that's
probably low balling it I think they're
better than the average doctor in a lot
of cases today
so so where most people are gonna first
really encounter this kind of technology
I mean is it is it Alexa right
it's Alexis saying buy me Whole Foods
yeah exactly did you get those kinds of
errors and but but but I think yeah a
lot of it one example is voice
recognition and that's improved line and
you know it's clearly not perfect yet it
still makes those kinds of errors and
some that you just described but it's
been measurably better to the point
where I now dictate rather than type a
lot of the texts that I write and
there's a study out of Stanford that
dictating as opposed to typing is about
three times faster and more accurate for
the setup of applications they looked at
but we encountered we've been conquering
some of them that you know it's kind of
sad but probably the the leading example
the one that's been most obviously
profitable some of the almost maybe
secret has been deciding what ads to
serve up next to your your searches and
if they can figure out what you're
likely to click on versus what you're
not likely to click on that is worth
billions upon billions upon billions of
dollars and one of the things that's
driven some of the algorithmic
improvements so that's one that we
actually encounter quite a bit and that
seems a little sad that we're throwing
all of his brain power in all this
computing power at ad placement
however the insights that we get from
that are being translated over into all
kinds of other domains so I the main way
that we're coming across these
cutting-edge technologies is via devices
like these like Eric says speaking into
them having them understand what we want
getting decent quality translations type
in a few letters it figures out the rest
of what you're looking for and gives it
to you you know these are all flavors of
artificial intelligence or you may have
noticed those of you who use Facebook
along with about two billion other
people as of yesterday that it will
offer to label the names of your faces
of your friends there it recognized as
who they are using exactly these
technologies we've been talking about
that's something it couldn't do just a
couple years ago so what is the line
between these things being helpful and
creepy because just just me personally
when Facebook offers to label my friends
and pictures I find that creepy
time that somebody else tagged me in a
photo and put that up on Facebook was
years ago I found that deeply creepy you
mean another human another yeah another
human did that so a creepy is a creeping
boundary and I think creepy turns into
familiar very very quickly the analogy
that I use is when I was learning to
scuba dive the very first breath I took
underwater was abject ly terrifying to
me you're not supposed to breathe
underwater the second one was kind of
weird and then after that it's like I'm
just you know there's that classic
arthur c clarke clark saying that any
sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic
and maybe that is a little bit creepy
but i think that the companies that are
that are pushing them out need to think
a little bit about how people are going
to react and there are certainly
examples where they cross that line and
and they animate the exact they yeah
they reveal that they know more about
you than maybe you wish they knew and by
not exposing that they still know it but
then they're not letting you know and
that's one of the things I think maybe
we have to think a little bit about is
what can these machine learning
algorithms infer about us from our
behavior from who our friends are from
our social networks from where our
iPhone or Android phone has been all
these things are providing data to
machine learning algorithms and whether
we know it or not or whether we like it
or not they can potentially be used to
infer things about us well and then on
the other end of sort of public
awareness there's like the whole
self-driving car issue right where
there's a concern that some companies
are moving too quickly with self-driving
car technology it's gonna cause an
accident but you guys cause a nice house
caused an accident will cause more
deaths will cause regulators to clamp
down the whole program so we so we have
a view on this which is that
self-driving cars are not going to
perfect certainly not anytime soon and
there will be deaths there have been
deaths but the right standard isn't or
at least shouldn't be profession as you
guys may know there are about 30,000
highway deaths per year
with human drivers so even if
self-driving cars were say 90% better
that would be 3000 deaths and to me as a
cold-hearted economist I'd say less
improvement we've saved 27,000 lives but
the reality is that you know those
self-driving car manufacturers are
probably not gonna get 27,000 thank-you
letters they're gonna get 3,000 lawyer
subpoenas so so a bit but this is you
know this is something that I think we
have to it's back to this these cultural
changes that Andy and I were just
talking about we have to think about
what we are what our expectations are
for the machines and how we'd like to to
you know where we'd like to set that
threshold and Eric and I have been in a
couple different self-driving cars and
that was know and lived to tell the tell
the tale and and it was another one of
those scuba-diving moments the first
minutes of autonomous driving are
terrifying because this is not an
abstract thing you are hurtled we were
on a highway going down 101 the car was
doing 60 Plus and nobody was driving the
dang thing I was there was blowing 55 it
sure was if they had a little dial but
this was this was initially not cool at
all and then it turned into
extraordinarily cool and then it turned
into kind of boring because the car was
going down the highway obeying all
relevant statutes who is going 55 and I
didn't break it and brake them correctly
like it was it was an amazingly boring
experience I was in a sauna gruber
self-driving cars in Pittsburgh and and
mine was basically fine like the whole
trip there were a couple like abrupt
accelerations but otherwise funny
the New York Times reporter his car when
they let him drive it didn't start so he
got the best lead for his story oh you
have a right about this car was fine the
experience was fine he got I'm in my car
I press the start button it won't turn
on yeah but but this is actually really
important this whole question about
autonomy as an aspect of turning things
over to machines is a very important
question we need to keep in mind
technology right now is increasing
highway fatalities distracted driving
deaths are going up in America road
deaths have been going on the
self-driving type of self-driving like
us driving it going like this this is a
this is the worst of all possible
texting technology yeah my view is for
heaven's sake let's bring forward the
day we can just turn this over to the
machines they will do a demonstrably
better job and think about how that will
open up life to the elderly the blind
and disabled the infirm people like that
why would we hold this technology back
from those groups one of my favorite a
self-driving car mental exercises is
what happens if you have a self-driving
car coming down the road and someone
just decides to walk into the road and
just just stand there how does the car
negotiate that the car will stop right
the pedestrian have like a newborn kind
of power yes we've been driving through
to New York pedestrians here believe
they have a great deal yeah we don't
think the power imbalance is a huge
issue yeah well so there are two things
one one just to give you an example of
the progress the early stage cameras in
those cars as they were testing before
they they mobilize them made about we're
able to recognize pedestrians and made
about an error once per 30 frames that's
about once per second that's really not
usable now it's about one per 30 million
in the latest mobile Isis so that's a a
huge it gives you a sense of how much
better the systems got about a million
full but you're right one of the things
in fact this is one of the reasons we
wrote this book is that it's not
necessarily the technology that is kind
of the most interesting thing it's how
our norms and expectations will change
and you're actually right if a human
encounters a self-driving car the car is
going to be trained in to stop without
question it's not gonna play chicken
with the with the human and humans you
know something which may take advantage
of that I've heard people saying well
you know we're gonna they're gonna start
bullying the self-driving cars and you
know thinking like they're gonna go in
front of it and making the car flinch
you know so I don't know there may be
some people start doing that and we may
have to think a little bit about how we
update our norms and our expectations
just like with social media and with
email things like fake news and other
things have emerged that weren't
necessarily expected by the inventors of
those technologies so there's a constant
evolution of our business processes our
norms or expectations to
use these technologies and ways that
effective as opposed to destructive and
fake news is actually a great example
fake news is a product of our minds it
is amplified by our minds and it brings
up that great quote Eric and I were
arguing about who said it first that a
lie is halfway around the world while
the truth is still getting its boots on
we have a colleague back at MIT named
Shannon oral who's about to write a book
about about how viral fake news is it's
incredibly viral that quote is actually
really accurate so what do we do about
that can you convince people to stop
generating fake news and trying to pass
it on
I believe you probably can't do that but
can the great social media platforms
tweak their algorithms and use machine
learning for example to deliberately
damp down the the the bouncing around of
those particular signals they could
easily do that what our society be
better served by that I believe it would
so I hope they do those kinds of
experiments and if people who really
love propagating think news are unhappy
about that they can take their nonsense
elsewhere well and so one of the
questions that you raised in your book
is sort of about the supposed neutrality
of algorithms right like no algorithm is
unbiased because algorithms are created
by humans at some point and so so how do
you reconcile those things
so let me nuance what you said a little
bit it's usually not so much the
algorithm cipher I just used it that way
natural understanding of the human
language that's evolving as well so the
the issue is the type of data used to
train these systems and that data can be
biased and that can lead to bias and I
wouldn't go as far as saying it's always
biased but they can be biased because
the data comes the real world often
comes from humans let me make a little
bit more concrete if suppose you have an
algorithm that's deciding how to make
got loans who gets loans as we doesn't
and if you train it based on the human
loan decisions and say here's here's
some examples of people who get loans
and people who don't get loans well if
those humans had some kind of bias these
racial ethnic gender or what other
biases then the example
are gonna be biased and the system may
learn those biases and embed them into
its own decision-making and as a result
you can get a biased algorithm and this
is this is a genuine problem it's a
concern a because it's biased because
it's often hard to suss out where that
bias comes from the algorithm is
generated on its own if I something
somebody encoded and therefore we don't
know exactly which way it's driving it
but and this is a really important
button we have to remember that humans
are biased too and so as with our
self-driving car example and and I don't
think I think I can speak I know I can
speak readings we've talked about this
we we don't think the right standard is
necessarily perfection it's whether or
not we can do better than the existing
system and the algorithms had the
potential for being improved over time
in a way that's often harder to do with
reducing or eliminating human biases and
I want to be clear about my beliefs here
we can beat the baseline with algorithms
very easily because the baseline is how
are people doing on these decisions gang
we are biased as hell we have all kinds
of problems in our mental hardware we
are our brains are amazing they are
buggy
they are glitchy they have a huge number
of very well-documented biases let me
give you one example that's in the book
and maybe my favorite one there's a very
careful study done that showed that if
you were going up for parole in Israel
the single best determinant of whether
or not you got parole was the blood
sugar level of the judge at the time of
day they heard your case this is a
really bad way to make this decision
right there's there's no rational basis
for defending that and the judges were
completely unaware that they had this
bias judges are supposed to be neutral
dispassionate people they're doing a
terrible job on this societally
important decision that study as far as
we can tell it was not a fluke that was
a demonstration of really really
pervasive things that we humans with the
best of intentions and with putting our
mental energies to work still get wrong
I'm not going to speak for Eric although
I think we've just we've discussed this
enough it'll I believe it's going to be
very easy to have less biased higher
quality decisions in domain after domain
after domain with a little bit of data
and some smart algorithms
okay let's shift let's go to the gig
economy the future of work yep
outsourcing of jobs platforms you start
it's one of the really important
phenomena in the business world and one
of the important phenomenon in our
workforce is a couple things are going
on the percentage of Americans who have
good old fashioned stable w2 40-hour
week health plan benefit jobs those are
still around the percentage of working
people who will have a job that looks
like that is going down in a pretty
steady clip technology is probably
accelerating the pace at which that at
which that situation changes because we
have the demand the rise of the
on-demand economy and these very very
powerful very rapidly growing platforms
that connect people who want a service
with lay people who are offering their
labor and/or their assets to provide
that service we all know about the you
know the uber ization of the of
Transportation and cities around the
world the conclusion Eric and I came to
when we looked around the world and and
tried to understand this issue there are
many many more opportunities out there
entrepreneurs are building platforms to
connect all kinds of different networks
of people and assets and resources and
we have not yet seen the end of the
platform ization of the economy yeah in
fact this is one place where we can
learn a lot from outside the United
States in particular China has an
explosion of what's come to be called
the o2o economy anybody here how many
people here familiar with that phrase Oh
- oh so this is a this state is stands
for online to offline it's the idea that
you can have an online device like your
phone and it connects you to a whole set
of online services it's like the uber is
a ssin of not just picking up a car or
renting a place but if you need your dog
walked or your car washed or any other
kinds of service that you may want to be
able to have a person come and help you
with you can click a button and it's
like a remote control to the world
people will come and take
and it connects you to a burgeoning gig
economy or on-demand economy and it's
one of the most rapidly growing
phenomenon not just in China but now
something we're bringing back the United
States and lots of other dimensions
people are playing around with we
recently recently talked to Leah busque
and and TaskRabbit is another example of
that but you could see that potentially
it leads to a much more fluid kind of
labor market place and also capital too
when you think about the use of homes in
and rooms in air B&amp;amp;B that is making
capital more efficient and Hoover
actually does both uber cars can be a
more lift can be a more efficient way of
using the capital asset of an automobile
those of us who have cars most of them
are sitting idle about 95 percent of the
time in the parking lot or driveway
somewhere imagine if you increase the
utilization by sharing it among lots of
people in a service to say 50 percent
not a hundred percent that would be a 10
times improvement in the capital
utilization of that asset one of the
weird outcomes of writing this book is
that I go home at night in Cambridge and
I pass by my car in my driveway and it
pisses me off because I've got this big
expensive hunk of metal sitting there
idle greater than 95% of the time that
didn't use to incent to incense me in
the past and now I just find it this
colossal waste the opportunity that we
have is to take the infrastructure
that's out there in the world everything
with spare bedrooms two cars two truck
and capacity to warehouse capacity and
make it much much more efficient by
having it used more heavily and you can
be underwhelmed by that who cares about
efficiency we should all care about
efficiency efficiency is massively
important if we want to tread more
lightly on the planet if we want to make
better use of our resources if we want
to stop cooking it over the course of
the 20th century we're not gonna walk
away from consumption we had better get
more efficient with our use of resources
these phones that we're all carrying
around are unparalleled
assets for making greater use of the
other assets and the other
infrastructure out there in the world
so now that we've introduced this does
anyone have any questions or should we
continue you do have questions we have
lots of questions
err you asked me to see if I can ask
some hard questions we love that
I'm hard on but I'm the president of the
Center for the Study of the life right
here in New York City we've known each
other for a while and I'm noticing that
you kind of have shifted as you
described to begin with there's a
dystopian and utopian way to do these
things you've shifted more towards to
utopian side of this driven by the
creases you have more I'm not trying to
private the other side drive away
thank you you may have seen this past
sunday New York Times
Tyson Lee who has suspect you personally
know for fascinating editorial did you
happen to see that I did great so what
kind of Lee said and this is a man who
ran serious pieces of Google and
Microsoft in China he first the top of
the Chinese experiment on these things
he said we're hanging situation in which
every economy in the world is going to
have to decide whether they will become
subsidiaries of the United States or the
Chinese economy because in fact these
machines are going to require massive
welfare transfers and what he was saying
of course is that we the Chinese will do
this better than the US does my question
to you is if we head into a world in
which we do in fact have again New York
Times today had a headline rope up
robo-cup lips real complex Robocop arose
from a meeting in work if we do in fact
go
there how will world leaders deal with
such a radical transformation which by
the way was the conclusion of your
previous book but it's not what we'll be
talking about today so great question
thanks for asking about that it was not
the conclusion of our previous book but
we did talk about some of the big
changes we saw what we talked about was
on one hand the bounty which is this
wealth and we've been touching on that
so far
the potential for the technology to
create a lot more wealth not just more
millionaires and more billionaires but
more GDP per person lifting a lot of
people out of poverty in China and
elsewhere great news so that's good news
but we also talked about what we call
the spread which is that for the past 20
plus years there's been a growing gap
between the rich and the poor growing
levels of overall inequality and while
there are many drivers of that a big
part of the reason we said and what we
believe is because the way that
technology has been used we are neither
utopians nor dystopian 'z we are people
who think that we have choices and none
of this is going to happen automatically
we're if we sit back and wonder whether
it's going to be good or bad that's the
wrong attitude these tools can be used
in lots of different ways kai Fuli takes
I think a more extreme position than is
warranted by the evidence we are not in
a in a world without work right now or
on the verge of a world without work
we're in a world of very rapidly
transforming work there's plenty of work
to be done but it's different kinds of
work than before and the result that you
see in the data is that many people are
having falling wages about the median
wages that 50th percentile are lower
than they were 20 years ago and the
people below that have done worse and
there's pressure on those kinds of wages
it's not that there aren't any jobs in
fact there are more jobs now people
working than there were ever ever before
in the United States and other countries
but we need to do a better job of
lifting the incomes of people on the
bottom half of the
distribution I don't see a Robo
apocalypse or whatever the the word is
on it at anytime imminent but I do see
the biggest challenge that our society
has ever faced over the next ten years
in using these technologies to create
more broadly shared prosperity I am
quite convinced that it's possible and
it's possible to create that kind of
shared prosperity if we update our
policies or institutions the way our
organizations are run this is not
something that somebody is going to just
do to us it's something that we get to
choose and one of the reasons we wrote
the last book and this book was to help
provide some guidance on how companies
and policy makers and individuals can
make that adjustment and we'd be happy
I've already spoken enough there be
happy to get into some of the details of
that but I want to sort of calibrate a
little bit there is definitely a huge
challenge the biggest challenge that I
think we are there our society faces
today is the challenge of how to use
these technologies to create shared
prosperity but we shouldn't despair we
should think there's a robo apocalypse
this is something we are totally capable
of managing and if we do it right it's
going to be the best thing that ever
happened to humanity but there's no
guarantee we're going to do it right and
we should also be clear on where another
challenge is and isn't it is true that
the big tech companies of America and
China are large really impressive
powerful companies in a lot of ways that
is categorically different from saying
they're about to take over the global
economy how do we know this math tells
us this if you take the total sales of
those companies and compared to the size
of the global economy
they vanish it is rounding error and if
these companies all grew much faster
than their historical growth rates which
are almost unprecedented in history they
would have to grow for decades and
decades before they had any meaningful
share of the global economy so there's
some heavy breathing going on about Oh
My heavens these big powerful tech
companies we need to calm down about
that a little bit I'm not saying be
blasÃ© and just let them do whatever the
heck they want to all great
concentrations of power demand vigilance
they also demand a little
chan ality okay next question you ever
air every wire I have been following it
work for several years and I haven't had
a chance to read the book because it
just downloaded my Kindle a couple of
days ago but I had really - two
questions one is there's a lot of
concern about the implications of
artificial general intelligence
ultimately when computers start to
become autonomous but be interested to
hear about how you address some of the
concerns the ethical concerns that are
emerging about
purely autonomous systems and what needs
to be thought about the other question
or the other what are your thoughts on
is that the conflict between
centralization and decentralization was
brought by technology and do you think
about things like Dao just distributed
autonomous metallization - you're kind
of a new concept in the last couple of
years that have come out of blockchain
and cryptocurrency
you know how are you looking at how
organizations policymakers and people
who were entrepreneurs who may want to
overturn the status quo think about
using these technologies
the definition of a great question in
this context is one that we devoted two
chapters of the book to so that is a
great question and when we spend the
final two chapters of the book talking
about exactly that second question that
you brought up which is what are the
implications of these new these very
very new technologies that we have for
radical decentralization we've all heard
of Bitcoin right a lot of us are
familiar with blockchain - blockchain is
the ledger that keeps track of who's got
the bitcoins all around the world all
right we've had Ledger's inside banks
for a long long time the crazy thing
about the blockchain is that it is a
ledger that is accurate that is
constantly updated that appears to be
unhackable and immutable and is not
owned by anybody not controlled by
anybody not and apparently not control a
bull by anybody so even if the central
bankers of the world decided they want
to take that thing over it would be
really really hard probably impossible
for them to do that okay this is weird
we have not seen this kind of thing
before in the history of the world
Satoshi Nakamoto who's at which is a
pseudonym for we don't know who wrote
the paper outlining this possibility in
2008 this whole world is less than a
decade old so you bring up this great
question
where on earth is this taking us and
went out when Eric and I went around and
talked to a lot of the Alpha geeks some
of the Alphaeus geekiest people are
convinced that as taking us headlong
into this amazing new territory where we
build organizations that are a
completely distributed and B completely
autonomous and we stick code in those
block chains in those Ledger's we stick
contracts in them we invent new
currencies we find new ways of doing
business together and the concept of a
good old fashioned corporation that's a
with you know stable ma hierarchies and
managers and courts of law where you
iron things out these these some of
these people believe that stuff is all
very rapidly in the rear
view mirror I don't believe that and you
bring up the Dow we and the Dow is
pretty cool this completely au Dao Dao
intended to mimic the Dow this mystical
Asian force of nature the Dow was this
thing that was built to be the first
really distributed autonomous
organization it fell flat on its face
weeks after it was launched because it
said hey man whatever happens whatever
we decide to do with this thing is cool
and you all have to abide by that
and one hacker said ok here's what I
want to do with it this was so poorly
written I can treat it like an ATM that
continues to dispense money even after I
have a zero balance and he siphoned off
about a third would think it was a he
siphoned off about a third of the total
currency that had been deposited into
the Dow okay if there's no contract if
there's no cord if we all got to play by
the rules that's a completely kosher
thing to do except at the community that
built it said no that's actually not we
want to do and they unilaterally revoked
everything and tried to hit the reset
button on it so it kind of got us it got
me thinking that maybe these aren't as
distributed and totally autonomous as we
thought we were and that it had a good
old fashioned management just like
companies have a management my
conclusion from this whole episode is
that we are not in the post organization
post company world at all and my bumper
sticker is hey man you kind of got to
trust somebody and and when we worked on
that part of the book we relied on some
research by Nobel Prize winners that
basically talked about how much as you'd
like to write a complete contract that
covers every possibility and codify it
in the blockchain or a piece of paper or
wherever the reality is is that most
contracts all contracts are at some
level incomplete and there's a whole set
of literature on that and because
contracts are incomplete that's one of
the main reasons we have organizations
and companies and ownership of assets to
say what happens when the contract isn't
fully specified and that's why we have
course and we don't see that a
technology is going to resolve that fact
of nature that we can't anticipate all
possibilities and Vance liked the fact
that this technology could be used to
create a de-facto
and in general we tried in this paper in
this in this book to draw on those kinds
of insights to kind of battle test some
of the amazing technologies that are
being ascribed in some of the the very
strong claims let me briefly touch on
your segment I know there's other people
if questions so I'll be quick I think
we're low on time okay so I'll very
quickly say about artificial general
intelligence so that what is that well
you've heard of artificial intelligence
most artificial intelligence is is
narrow it's very good at a particular
thing that alphago system that's
superhuman and playing go it can't play
checkers or chess or tic-tac-toe or talk
to you in Chinese and there are other
systems that have other very narrow
vertical capabilities one of the things
that researchers are working on is
so-called artificial general
intelligence that like humans if it can
speak Chinese it also knows a little bit
about what restaurant to eat in and all
the other things that you'd expect a
good Chinese speaker to know that
doesn't exist yet and it's not likely to
exist anytime soon nobody knows for sure
because the inventions the breakthroughs
haven't happened yet I think it's great
that there are some people working on
what's going to happen to society if and
when we get artificial and general
intelligence there may be some profound
implications for the economy for
security for the military that's not
what we mostly work on what we work on
is what we can do with the technologies
that are available right now I think
there's a mazing challenge and
opportunity that's happening to the
economy there are hundreds of millions
maybe billions of jobs as Marc's
questions were raised earlier that are
being transformed and that's just from
plain old art narrow artificial
intelligence it's amazing enough and
that's been more of our focus but but
there's a whole other set of people who
are working on that who knows how far in
the future is an area of artificial
general intelligence so do we have time
for one more question okay in the corner
removing bias from the process getting
into normative issues I mean 2000 plus
years Greek philosophers we've we've
tried to figure out what's right and
wrong right what systems we should set
up how how is it gonna be defined it's
gonna be defined by the majority in your
model or by the minority will it be a
Plato's Republic where you know five
decide following up on the last two
questions yeah III think I don't think
those decisions in the future
substantially different we've been
making them up until now so we kind of
muddle through you know we have we have
companies that have decision rights we
give decision rights to organizations we
have a government and laws and overlay
things we have public discourse about
all these things I don't think any of
that's going to change substantially
that was the real question no well if we
do that were idiots right yeah machines
and that and the the the tools that we
create and and the societies that we
create should reflect our value if we
outsource the value definition and value
implementation to the machines then
shame on us and we should have to live
with the nonsense that ensues from that
I didn't that's getting it categorically
backward this is one of the most
important lessons that we've taken away
from from a research in this area
machines are great at answering
questions Pablo Picasso once said hey
computers are Lieut useless all they do
is give you answers and that underscores
the that machines are great at doing
that
but there's a more important thing which
is asking the right questions and
deciding what our values are where we
want to focus not only I think our value
is going to continue to be important but
I would double down what Andy said and I
think values that can become more and
more important going forward because as
we get these more powerful tools the
most powerful tools we've ever had in
history well what does that mean it
means we have more power to shape the
planet to change the world than we ever
had before that means that what we
decide to do is more important than ever
before when we don't have very powerful
tools it doesn't really matter what you
want to do because you can't do much now
we can do amazing things we can cook the
planet we can blow things up we can
vast prosperity we have to think hard
about what our values are do we want
shared prosperity we can we take care of
very vulnerable populations or we can
leave them flat behind you want more out
of those choices and so the values
question is absolutely essential
essential it's something we end the
first book with it's something we end
the second book with and I think your
question is really key and something we
need to focus on okay we have one more
question I just have a question about
neural networks and I don't know how
much you've spoken about them and I see
there oh there's someone in your book
but can you talk a little bit about them
and how they relate to machine learning
exactly yeah very briefly they are the
core technology of modern approaches to
machine learning so most of the
impressive developments that we've seen
have a really really elaborate huge
neural network somewhere at the heart of
them you can think of artificial
intelligence is a broad category within
that is machine learning and neural nets
it's a particular technique or
particularly so called deep neural Nets
they're loosely modeled on the way the
human brain the neurons connect to one
another deep neural Nets have a dozen or
more layers in them and sometimes up to
1 billion connections and it's very hard
to know all the what's going on inside
all those connections in the black box
but they are immensely powerful as I
said earlier getting you from a set of
inputs X to a set of outputs Y they can
fit any arbitrary function and just in
the past few years they've gotten so big
and so powerful that they can solve this
class of these many classes of problems
that we never touch before and they're
one of the reasons the name the I are so
excited about the first word in our book
here the machine word it's really
driving a lot of the AI revolution yeah
ok well well thank you to Andy and Eric
and I might be misremembering but I
believe their book is on sale
