subject to the laws of physics and all
three laws of biology our bodies wear
down we need nutrition were vulnerable
to all kinds of environmental insults we
are ability to behave depends on the
structure of the brain that were were
born with and the culture that were
embedded in on the other hand were free
certainly free in the sense that one
couldn't predict anyone's behavior down
to the last choice even knowing
everything about his parentage and
culture and individual history and
there's an enormous scope for the brain
to craft new forms of behavior in
response to the person's particular
situation and perhaps in response to
random factors that that we don't
understand
well certainly people can control their
own behavior that's what our big
prefrontal cortex is for we respond to
incentives that's why you generally get
more peace in order when there's good
government than in a state of anarchy
why people do everything from not park
in no-parking zones if they think
they'll get a ticket to refrain from
killing people that they're jealous
about or or angry at we can control our
behavior we can seek to improve
ourselves we can learn more we can apply
mental discipline to avoid temptation to
refine our own ability to to reason on
the other hand we not everyone can do
everything I don't have any illusions
that with any amount of practice I could
be as good a fit assisters richard
fineman or as good a basketball player
as michael jordan part of wisdom is
knowing what the scope is of your own
room for improvement and discipline it's
equally foolish to think that nature and
culture give you no options and to just
be fatalistic about your prospects in
life or to imagine that you could do
anything that you set your mind to a
part of the wisdom of being an adult is
knowing what the fences are on both
sides of the range in which you can
improve or change yourself
I think people mature people recognize
that they have a certain temperament and
a certain cognitive style some people
are more lighthearted others are more
morose some people are apt to be
conservative in their outlook others
looser I think part of being a wise
immature individual is to recognize your
own quirks and traits to discount them
when you're trying to arrive in an
objective appraisal of events realize
well I would think that given that I'm
by temperament conservative or by
temperament an anarchist and try to see
reality objectively subtracting out your
own biases when it comes to choices of
how to live your life then there many
are areas in which you want to indulge
your own temperament you don't want to
continually put yourself in situations
that will just make you grumpy or
anxious if there's no ulterior benefit
to forcing yourself to do what you don't
what you aren't otherwise inclined to do
we have every reason to believe that
genes matter in terms of a person's
temperament or outlook identical twins
that were separated at birth for example
will share all of their genes but not
their environment tend to be correlated
in political attitudes that is to some
extent your tendency to be liberal or
conservative seems to be affected by
your genes degree of religiosity not
whether you'll believe in Jesus or
Buddha or one God or many gods but the
extent to which spiritual experiences
are an important part of your life and
you're likely to engage in religious
practice and belief that has a heritable
component intelligence has a heritable
component personality whether you're
anxious or calm open to experience or
more timid whether you are conscientious
or more aggressive and irresponsible all
of those have some degree of
susceptibility to influence from our
genes now in no case is the influence
100% there are always differences say
between identical twins even brought up
in the same home who share both their
genes and their environment which
suggests that there are influences on
personality and temperament and
intelligence that are not genetic and
perhaps not cultural either there may be
idiosyncratic quirks that shape the
development of the brain in utero or in
the first few years of life that also go
into what makes us what we are but
certainly the effect of the genes can
cannot be negated by now we have many
sources of evidence from studies of
twins from studies of adoptees that show
that genes probabilistically matter
people use the word human nature to
refer to the characteristic ways of
experiencing emotion of having motors
and drives of categorizing and reasoning
about the world that are common to all
members of Homo sapiens the fact that
humans speak the fact that we remember
often not very accurately that we judge
probabilities also with systematic
biases that we follow love that we
experience fear and indeed fear of
particular kinds of objects and
experiences like Heights predatory
animals darkness venomous snakes and
spiders social scrutiny we get angry
when we feel that someone else hasn't
taken our welfare into account we we
trust people we feel grateful when they
do us favors we feel angry when favors
are withhold we withheld from us we feel
sympathy to people in need we categorize
and label our experiences we think that
living things have an internal essence
that gives them their form we think that
other people have minds that govern
their behavior and their thoughts and
feelings we think that physical objects
continue to exist whom you don't look at
them those are just some of the many
psychological traits that collectively
make up human nature
I think that understanding ourselves is
a prerequisite to just about everything
that's valuable in life to enlightenment
to cooperation to escape from the
self-deception that wires us in conflict
and argument check off once said man
will be better when you can show him
what he is like and as a psychologist I
think those are words to live by
and part of understanding what makes us
tick is understanding the forces that
that organized us that put us together
the gave us our designed that means that
ultimately we have to look to evolution
as part of the solution to who we are
the human brain is a highly non-random
piece of biological machinery it doesn't
learn to do everything equally easily it
does some things without having to learn
anything to understand why it works the
way it does we have to know something
about the forces that shaped it and that
means the an understanding of the
ecological niche that our species
evolved in the strategies that our
ancestors used to make a living in that
environment as a way to figure out why
we're built the way we are
educating someone enhances the cognitive
tools that you need to determine what is
true or false or sound or unsound
it consists of facts about how the world
works and what happened in human history
that that are generally agreed upon more
importantly it includes ability to think
critically to examine arguments to
recognize fallacies in reasoning
including the kind of fallacies that the
human brain makes us vulnerable to to
make finer distinctions to sharpen
analyses all of these are very different
from indoctrination where it's a matter
of enforcing particular beliefs or
ideologies on people as opposed to
allowing them to test and verify them
for themselves even when it comes to two
facts scientific or historical facts
what an education should equip you to do
is to understand how those facts could
have been were discovered what could
lead them to be falsified and the
ability to satisfy yourself that they
really are facts as opposed to taking
them on Authority in the case of science
it means understanding the experiments
that led to a particular conclusion
order for field observations in the case
of mathematics it's being able to
retrace the proofs in the case of
history it's being able to evaluate the
physical and documentary evidence that
led historians to come to some
conclusion now no one has enough time to
track down every justification for every
fact if historians tell me that the
Normans invaded England in 1066 I'm
pretty much going to take their word for
it if scientists tell me that
fossils are 550 million years old I
probably won't learn everything that I
would really need to know in
stratigraphy and dating and geology and
so on to verify it for myself but if I
ever wanted to I could I would know what
kinds of chains of reasoning led
scientists or historians to their
conclusion and if I was skeptical about
any one of them I could check for myself
I believe that most historians and
scientists and and other scholars have
established enough of a track record so
that even for those claims that I don't
bother to go out and check I them and
generally that trust is repaid in the
areas where I am skeptical but the point
of education and the point of
scholarship is that there's ultimately
nothing that has to be taken on faith
anything that you take tentatively as a
as a belief is simply because of the
trust earned by the scholarly
establishment as a whole but
individually any fact can be questioned
and its basis in evidence examined
I think indoctrination takes advantage
of certain traits of human nature that
we would do well to identify and
understand one of them is self-serving
biases people like to believe things
that put them or the group they belong
to in a good light everyone thinks
they're on the side of the angels
realizing that that you are apt to think
better of yourself and your gender and
your religion and a nation then you
ought to is the first step towards
getting an objective assessment of what
you and your group are like
that there's reason to think that our
self-serving biases in our
self-deception may not be a bug as far
as evolution was concerned but a feature
something that it might pay to have for
certain purposes in particular people
are often in a situation in which they
can get an advantage by distorting the
truth in their direction by portraying
themselves as more honest or trustworthy
wiser more knowledgeable more objective
than we really are
now that will only make other people
skeptical of our claims to wisdom and
generosity and the question is how do
you persuade other skeptics that you are
as wise and generous as you are selling
yourself as well if there's a kind of
arms race between deceivers and lie
detectors then and if any twitch or
inconsistency or a bit of nervousness
can give you away the most effective way
of persuading a skeptic is to believe
your own lies the best salesman is the
one who believes in the product the best
liar is the one who believes his own
lies because if you believe that you are
infinitely wise impatient and
knowledgeable and generous sincerely
you're not lying and therefore you can't
give yourself away by your lies the
problem of course is that when everyone
is built that way there's apt to be
human conflict and an argument where two
opposing sides sincerely believe that
they are in the right and that the other
person is just impervious to argument or
a self-serving I think it's a source of
of great tragedy that were apt to
believe our own self-serving story to
sincerely believe that we are seeing the
world as it is and that other people are
looted or dishonest or impervious to
reason and you could have two people
sincerely believing opposing views about
themselves and the other side
evolution is descent with modification
the fact that organisms a lineage of
organisms will change over time
natural selection is the most important
mechanism of evolution it's not the only
one because they're also random factors
in evolution but natural selection is
the process that gives rise to the
appearance of design to eyes that see in
wings that fly and arms that grasp all
the kinds of illusions of Engineering
that's so impress us about living things
the way that natural selection works is
that it's a process that is kicked off
by replication you've got to have some
kind of system that can make a copy of
itself including the ability of the
copies to make copies of themselves when
that happens you'll have an exponential
explosion in the number of descendants
no finite environment can support an
exponentially growing number of of
gadgets they'll inevitably compete for
the raw materials to build the copies
and for the energy to power the
replication since no copying process is
perfect copying errors will inevitably
crop up if any of those errors by chance
increases the rate of replication it
will over a very small number of
generations crowd out its competitors as
that process is iterated over many
generations of copying and occasional
errors the population will come to be
predominated by replicators that look as
if they've been engineered toward
efficient replication but in fact have
simply accumulated all of the copying
errors that made them more effective
replicators that process when we see it
backwards we look through the wrong end
of the telescope
and look back from from the present is
gives rise to what we see today as
design but which in fact was just
differential replication of replicants
with copying errors
I think there's a lot of reason to
believe that the idea that there is a
unified self a single eye that's in
control of our entire minds is something
of an illusion there can be multiple
selves that are operating simultaneously
we there are some clever experiments
that show that when people are
distracted they will often be more
objective about their own generosity and
ability than when they can set their
mind to it
suggesting that the that there is an
unconscious thought process that has an
accurate view of the self but then
there's a spin doctor or an advertising
executive pushing that unconscious voice
down
so that it's damaging insights don't
leak out to the disadvantage of the
entire person and we know from
neuroscience there are other ways in
which there are multiple selves they're
the two cerebral hemispheres to some
extent operate independently and shunt
information back and forth across the
corpus callosum the cortex and some of
these subcortical structures are each
doing their own thing and talking to
each other in the intact human different
parts of the cortex are processing
information in parallel we there are
mechanisms that harmonize the different
parts of the brain when we act it's not
as if the right leg wants to go in one
direction and the left leg wants to go
in another direction ultimately they all
have to be reconciled but inside the
skull we have every reason to believe
that there are many selves all thinking
and wanting at the same time
I think any explanation of what makes us
tick has to take place at several levels
we have to understand the flow of
information in the mind what
representations of the visual world of
language of emotions are active and how
they exchange information we have to
know how it's all implemented in neural
tissue and we have to know the
evolutionary forces that explain why the
brain is the way it is as opposed to
some other way it could have been there
wasn't any cosmic engineer or designer
who wired the brain up according to some
explicit plan but the process of
evolution implicitly organized the brain
to do some things better than others and
that explains why they of various
intelligent devices that were familiar
with computers and cameras and human
brains brains are very good at doing
certain things that computers are bad at
like recognizing faces or digesting the
gist of a story or controlling arms and
legs and computers are good at doing
things that brains are bad at like
multiplying five digit numbers evolution
is the source of answers to the question
of why the brain is good at some things
and bad at other things and I think the
ultimate source of the answers to
questions about why there are certain
quirks why there are certain biases why
there are certain desires that we have
desires for food and sex and safety and
and esteem and the knowledge that
organized the brain to seek out certain
goals and not others evolution is the
ultimate source of those kinds of
constraints on the operation of the
brain
oh this enormous room for improvement in
the human condition there are vast parts
of the world that have only begun to tap
the mechanisms of wealth creation that
we've enjoyed in the West vast parts of
the world that haven't began to enjoy
the levels of freedom that we've had in
the West and needless to say there's
lots of improvement that the West itself
can and ought to do there are we have no
one can reasonably predict what Gifts
technology can deliver to us in the
future and it's we desperately need
technological advances that will
generate energy more cleanly that will
grow food more efficiently that will
lengthen human lifespans and just as a
hundred years ago no one could have
predicted some of the huge advances in
well-being that we've enjoyed I don't
think that we can predict the potential
for what our children and grandchildren
might enjoy and of course we have the
challenge not just of trying to make
life better but to prevent it from
getting a lot worse which of course
could happen if we don't deal with
problems like global climate change
energy shortages new pandemics increased
in increases in population decreases in
available water and many challenges that
if we do nothing will make the state of
the world a lot worse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
