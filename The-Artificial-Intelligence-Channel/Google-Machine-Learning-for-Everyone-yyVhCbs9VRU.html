have an open-source project so that
everyone outside of Google could use the
same system we're using inside
good morning everyone
I'm really pleased to be here to talk
about one of the things that we're most
excited about for the future and that's
artificial intelligence or AI and it's
transformative potential both at Google
and beyond today we're in the middle of
great change this new era is
characterized by advances in computing
particularly in artificial intelligence
and at Google we've seen firsthand the
possibilities that AI can create in fact
today there's very little technology at
Google that isn't using machine learning
or ml which is the primary approach
underlying advancements in AI ml is
reinventing existing products from maps
to YouTube and is powering new
experiences we never thought we'd be
able to create so what actually is
machine learning and artificial
intelligence let's start with a quick
story in the late 90s when I was a
student at Cambridge I took a course
called neural computing and this course
investigated the mechanisms by which
biological nervous systems accomplish
useful stuff like vision and response to
stimuli and these are functions we were
interested in replicating with machine
intelligence but of course we would use
completely different strategies
architectures and hardware so for a
young computer scientists like myself
the goal was to learn how to build an
artificial neural system that could
emulate some of those biological
principles in the hope of capturing some
of the performance of humans on
real-world tasks in other words starting
to create AI and this is a field of
research that has existed for a long
time many decades before my university
days and even then we were building
statistical models that were little more
than cartoonish representations of how
the brain worked and in fact it's only
very recently that we've had real
breakthroughs and what changed wasn't
the invention of new techniques but the
availability of much much more compute
power in the cloud and
large datasets which could be applied
together with these much older ideas
like neural networks so how does it work
at its core machine learning is a new
way of creating problem-solving systems
for decades before we used to write
programs by hand to generate outputs
given a certain set of inputs by
applying very precise step-by-step
instructions for the computer to follow
but rule-based systems don't always
account for the messiness of the real
world so the breakthrough with machine
learning is having computers improve
their performance by showing them lots
and lots of example data and correcting
for errors rather than having to program
them with rules and that might mean
something fun like searching your phone
for photos of cats and dogs and we can
do this by showing the system lots of
examples and it starts to learn from
them we call that process training and
then inference is when you apply that
model you trained to new inputs it
hasn't seen before in order to get a
recognised output so here's a fun
example of something my team and I
worked on and maybe we can bring the
camera onstage to take a look so I'm
wearing an Android wear SmartWatch and
when these watches first came out
entering text on the small screen was
sometimes a bit difficult and also
pictures convey much more meaning than
words so what we did was we trained a
neural network to recognize emoji based
on sketches on the screen so let's take
a look you can see I've got a message
here from my friend asking hi we're
getting on I can press reply and tap
into the emoji recognizer and I'm going
to sketch my favorite emoticon see how
that goes
there's a lovely ice-cream which we can
have after the keynote so you can see
that the system is automatically
recognizing what it was that I drew
let's take a look at another fun example
a team at Google extended this
technology to create a tool called
quick-draw which uses a neural network
to recognize doodles let's take a look
at what I mean so with this system what
you're going to see is the icy lightning
or
and then as you draw it's going to try
and gasp for today so let's let's roll
the video again I see garden hose or
rainbow or squiggle or mountain i see
dumbbell or stethoscope or apple or
tooth i see foot or bear or cat or
rhinoceros
I see frog or raccoon I see Fox or crab
or dog I see spider sorry I couldn't
guess it so no quick enough that time
let's try again I see snake or spoon or
moon oh I know it's mustache oh one more
well maybe we'll leave it there and and
so it's it's fun and it's really useful
and I'm proud to say that the team
created the world's largest doodle
dataset which they've shared publicly to
help with future ml research in the
future and recently the team took that
research one step further with a even
more useful tool called Auto draw so
basically it can take my unintelligible
scribbles and know that it's learned
what they are it can suggest the picture
that I'm trying to draw so let's create
a little sketch of what's going on here
and can that I can send back to my team
so I'll sketch out a palm tree and you
see up at the top here it's actually
producing a tool that lets me choose the
image I want so we've got the palm tree
let's have a nice bottle of Rose a
sketch that out we can choose exactly
the picture we want and then maybe we'll
add a glass to drink that wine out of
and that one with the wave looks nice
and then we put it all together to
create a really useful diagram that I
could send to my team to explain what
we're doing here in can a little bit
better and it may look like fun and
games but we're pushing computers to do
things they've never done before if you
think about it understanding what
something is and how to build it is a
fundamental precursor for deep knowledge
of the world and for creativity so how
do we take this one step further how do
we move beyond drawing and connect ml to
art for example the Google Arts and
Culture team used ml to map over two
hundred thousand artworks based on their
visual similarity the output should
see here is a single virtual map showing
how all of this art connects together
visually you'll see clusters of
impressionist landscapes silhouettes
pottery and so on and let's zoom into
one cluster in particular what you're
gonna see here are portraits of people
in robes we can see here it's going to
show us a courtier from the Ching
dynasty in China which is hundreds of
years old and then we can move on to a
more recent portrait of a woman from
Oaxaca in Mexico and these paintings are
from different centuries different
countries and they're located in
different museums but through machine
learning the tool is able to recognize
their inherent similarities and it can
form similar insights across the entire
collection so imagine how useful that
could be to a student or a researcher in
art we're also using ml to develop new
avenues of human expression as humans we
inherently understand when things are
musical and for much of human history we
were limited to building instruments
that create notes through physical
properties like air moving precise
distances through a tube or vibrations
across a string and we then learned to
assemble musical notes to create chords
and scores and composers go one step
further by combining multiple
instruments to create complex
arrangements and symphonies well a team
at Google recently built a music
generation tool called ensign an ensign
began as a massive database of signs
from a thousand different instruments
the team then applied a neural net which
learned the audible characteristics of
each instrument from first principles
and it can in turn mimic the sign of
each instrument the team took this work
further to build a slider which lets you
explore the audible space between
different instruments creating entirely
unique signs so let's take a look let's
start with the flute
and then the guitar and now let's
combine them so the samples aren't
always perfectly in tune and they do
sound a little unusual but we think
that's what makes them fun and since you
could never create such an instrument
like this and synth is a novel approach
to music synthesis that can aid the
creative process so those are just a few
examples of how we're using machine
learning to explore the boundaries of
artistic creation and what's so exciting
about this technology is how powerful it
can be in solving a range of problems
for people and that's why we're also
using advances in ml to make Google
better so it can be more assistive to
our users the best example of this is
the Google assistant the assistant lets
you have a conversation with Google
across devices and contexts it can help
you get things done in the real world by
bringing together all of Google services
and ml power tools for example you can
use your voice to ask things like show
me pictures of the okonomiyaki I had in
Hiroshima and yep that is the actual
okonomiyaki I had in Hiroshima and it's
pretty amazing especially since I had no
idea how to spell okonomiyaki so the
Google assistant is available today on
more than a hundred million devices
across Android phones the iPhone Google
home and Android wear and it's coming
soon to new devices like cars and TVs
but for the assistant to better help
users get things done it needs to
connect them with the services and the
brands that they already like and use
the same ones that all of you in this
room are working on every day so we
created actions on Google it's a
developer platform that enables everyone
to build apps for the assistant already
many leading brands such as Spotify
Netflix LG and eBay have done this
and let's take a look at an example
here's an upcoming app from Panera which
is a large us casual food chain so I can
just call up the assistant hi how can I
help
I'd like to livery from Panera hi this
is Venera I'll need your delivery
address which one can I get from Google
so let's just tap on the one at the top
what can I get you started with I'll
have the strawberry poppy seed salad
with steak instead of chicken got it how
about one of these cool drinks ok well
that a goof a lemonade looks pretty good
so we'll just tap on it great are you
ready to check out yep okay
the total is eighteen dollars and forty
cents are you ready to place the order
yes and I can just use my fingerprint to
confirm the payment I'm we're all set
thanks you're all set
so as you see you can create today
delightful and useful experiences and as
we expand the capabilities of the
platform you'll be able to apply your
creativity to connect authentically
through natural conversation with new
and current users alike today you can
build apps for the Google assistant in
US English only but before the end of
the year we will enable all of you
agencies partners developers and
marketers to create these apps in UK
English French German and many more
languages and we really look forward to
working with all of you closely and
connecting your services with Google
assistant users you can visit
developers.google.com slash actions to
learn more or get in touch with any of
the Google team here at can we're
excited about how we can continue to use
AI to reimagine our products and
services at Google but we know that
technology is most powerful when
everyone can use it
and the applications of AI and ml
classification prediction understanding
intersect very naturally with the
challenges of enterprises worldwide and
that's why we're working to ensure that
AI is widely available and that everyone
can leverage its benefits including
businesses
so we do this principally in two ways
through Google Cloud ml which is a set
of API s that enable any enterprise to
access easy to use machine learning in
Google's cloud and tensorflow are open
source machine learning library that
anyone developers researchers businesses
can use for machine learning projects
let's start with tensorflow
a little more than a year ago a former
automobile designer in Japan named
Makoto Kui Kei started helping out at
his parents cucumber farm and he was
amazed by the amount of work it takes to
sort cucumbers in Japan the best
cucumbers are believed to be straight
and thick with vivid colors and lots of
little prickles and bringing premium
cucumbers to market really impacts a
farmers bottom line so Makoto had heard
about tensorflow
and wondered if it could help speed up
this task at his parents farm and if you
think about it
recognizing patterns is one of the
things that ml is really good at and he
was right Makoto used our software and a
camera and a mechanical sorter and
succeeded in training a computer to
recognize the best cucumbers and the
more cucumbers that pass through this
order the better the computer got at
selecting the very best ones for sale
and Makoto was happy because he could do
the things he cares about most like
actually for
tasks like sorting and it applies to
more serious examples as well take
Airbus defence in space they create
aerospace products and they're one of
the world's largest suppliers of
satellites my satellite imagery is
oftentimes obscured with imperfections
like these clouds that you can see and
historically removing them has been a
very time-consuming and manual task but
it's also important everyone from
precision farmers monitoring crop yields
to environmental groups monitoring
forestry need highly accurate satellite
imagery to do their job so to make this
process easier
Airbus used api's from Google Cloud ml
to automate the detection and correction
of their satellite imagery this improved
the accuracy and the speed with which
they analyzed images and in doing so it
solves a problem that the business had
struggled with for decades and we've
even applied machine learning to our own
business operations by using ml to make
our data centers more efficient data
centers of course are the physical
infrastructure that underlie the virtual
world and these buildings of thousands
of servers use a lot of energy and with
like careful management that energy
demand would grow as rapidly as the
internet does so making them run
efficiently is a really big deal for us
and using ml we've seen a 40% reduction
in the amount of energy used for cooling
it's still early days for these
techniques but we're also exploring ways
to apply this same technology to improve
power grids and other in energy
intensive processes around the world our
data centers also contain our own
custom-built silicon called cloud TP use
and that's hardware that is designed to
handle the computationally intense
training and inference tasks I mentioned
earlier and we now make them available
to our cloud customers like Airbus so
they can take advantage of the same
technology that we use to power our own
products and services and that makes
using ml faster and much much cheaper
and we make them available for free to
the ml research community so we can all
work together to accelerate ml
for everyone as technologists we're
always aspiring to create tools that
help the greatest number of people and
we're optimistic that ml can be applied
to all kinds of things from
understanding language to fighting
climate change to making enterprises
more efficient and one area where
applied ml may be able to help is
improving conversations online
discussing things that you care about
can be difficult and the threat of abuse
and harassment online means that many
people stop expressing themselves
altogether and even give up on seeking
different opinions to tell you more
here's Jerrod
good morning everybody
and thank you David for that
extraordinary presentation even being in
the same kind of Google alphabet family
I really never get tired about of
hearing all the innovative things that
are happening with AI throughout the
company this David mentioned my name is
Jared Cohen I'm the CEO of jigsaw
alphabet where I also serve as chief
adviser to alphabets executive chairman
what David talked to you about this
morning with some of the amazing
innovations happening with AI at Google
what I'm gonna do today is talk to you
about something specific which is how
we're using artificial intelligence to
tackle what is arguably the most
universally understood challenge for
anybody on the Internet which is just
the decline in civility of conversation
and toxicity beginning to happen at
scale but before I do that let me give
you a little bit of a background on
jigsaw and what we're all about
jigsaw is an engineering group within
alphabet that at its core is about
making people around the world safer so
what that means is we're literally
throwing the best engineering that we
have at some of the toughest global
security and geopolitical challenges in
the entire world from fording censorship
and combating the most robust in
nefarious cyberattacks to countering
online radicalization and disrupting
state-sponsored disinformation efforts
and of course more recently looking for
ways to use our engineering capacity to
curb online harassment now if you think
about the gravity of these challenges do
you think about the seriousness of these
challenges they're a little bit more
controversial and thorny and I would
argue different than the types of
challenges that you typically think of a
Silicon Valley company working on so not
surprisingly at jigsaw we have a unique
methodology that we use for going about
addressing some of these so our team of
engineers product managers research
scientists they get out into the world
they travel to some of the most restive
and complicated environments around the
globe so what that means is we've sent
engineers to the Syrian border and to
the Iranian border to talk to activists
and dissidents about this
the censorship machine in their
respective countries we've also met with
activists and dissidents around the
world to understand what they're up
against from the Syrian electronic army
to the Iranian cyber army I have a group
of people who literally on their first
week on the job we sent them to Iraq to
interview Isis defectors in some of
these cases these individuals fled the
Islamic state just three or four weeks
before our team interviewed them and
they interviewed them to try to
understand you know what role technology
may or may not have played in their
radicalization process and more
importantly what role technology could
play and potentially having diverted
them off the radicalization path you
know we've sent product managers down to
do ride-alongs with police in some of
the most violent favelas in Brazil with
the goal of seeing how technology can
help bridge a divide where erosion of
trust has happened between law
enforcement and citizens now we've sent
individuals to investigate some of the
most prominent state-sponsored troll
farms in the entire world
we've sent most recently a group of
people from jigsaw to Macedonia to track
down fake news editors who launder in
disinformation to try to understand
their rationale their motivations their
incentives and the methodologies that
they use so that we could begin to look
for ways to reverse-engineer that and
hopefully combat it we've done the same
sending people to interview pirates in
Somalia four one nine scammers in
Nigeria etc etc all again with the aim
of understanding how these challenges
are evolving in these complicated
environments so that we can use
technology to disrupt what are an
increasingly complex set of issues in
the world now I mentioned to you that we
kind of get out there into the wild and
you have to do that in order to really
appreciate firsthand you can't sit in a
Google office you can't sit in front of
a screen without building the sort of
human intelligence necessary to
complement the engineering capacity but
back to the issue at hand you know which
is this issue of toxicity on the
Internet so let's look at toxicity by
the numbers
so we look at toxicity by the numbers
how many of you by show of hands have
ever witnessed cyberbullying or online
harassment in a discussion that you've
been part of raise it raise em high so I
can see a lot of you so for those of you
who raised your hands you're part of 72%
of the global Internet population that's
had a similar experience now how many of
you by show of hands have ever had
somebody just lob nastiness at you or
you know harass you or bully you online
how many of you are direct you know sort
of recipients or have been on the
receiving end of that again raise them
high so I can see okay so for those of
you that did that you're you know
roughly part of an almost 50% of the
global Internet population that's had
that experience but here's a number
that's also not up there roughly a third
of people online say that they
self-censor at a fear of what people
might do in retaliation for something
that they say so obviously if you look
at these raw numbers this is a huge
problem right and it's not just a
societal problem it's a business problem
as well right so toxicity on platforms
means that engagement you know ends up
floundering it means that people flee
the conversation and there's this
awkward irony that it's in the
democratic societies where you want to
allow the free flow of information but
also protect people from harassment that
many publishers and platforms out of
just an inability to figure out how to
manage all this end up shutting down
comments and discussion altogether or
partially shutting down comments and
discussion but there's also a normative
issue here how many of you by show of
hands have small children so like you I
have a three-year-old and a one-year-old
two girls and you look at this sort of
spread of toxicity and you can't help
but to wonder if this is the frame of
reference that they're gonna have for
how people talk to each other and
they're going to be the first generation
to split their time between physical and
digital worlds basically from the time
that they're born is this just what
they're gonna come to expect you know
are they just going to sort of assume
that this is how people talk to each
other and it doesn't have to be that way
so you know enter you know enter sort of
the this sort of the methodology that I
mentioned at the beginning so when we
thought about
you know this sort of problem of
toxicity on the Internet well you're
hearing me talk about right now is
essentially the meanness problem and the
nastiness problem and I'm not
trivializing that by any stretch of the
imagination but there's actually an even
bigger challenge on the horizon that the
team of engineers and research
scientists and product managers at
jigsaw became particularly fixated on as
they travel to some of these complicated
environments and in particular as we
spent time in countries that are ridden
with political ethnic and sectarian
violence there was a concern among the
engineers on the team that the nastiness
that is seen in the street as these
societies come online will spill over
onto the internet and they desperately
wanted to do something about that and
they developed a view that there's a
window of opportunity as these societies
come online to use the best technology
that we have to ensure that that
spillover doesn't happen now like any
project where you want to apply in
machine learning it comes down to how
much data do you have what's the quality
of that data and what's your capacity to
make use of that data so what's
interesting is in the process of wanting
to address the ways in which political
ethnic and sectarian conflicts manifests
themselves online
the engineers stumbled onto a different
problem which is the one that you know
we all sort of refer to as the kind of
meanness problem or the bullying problem
they just viewed it a little differently
right as they talk to citizens in some
of these countries what they were
worried about is what happens when
cyberbullying becomes better organised
better funded and state-sponsored but
again if you look at where the data is
it's largely right now with mainstream
publishers and platforms which is a
fantastic place to start so enter a
perspective which is the technology that
we built that uses machine learning to
spot harassment and toxicity on the web
and what we did was we trained the
machine learning model by showing it
tens of millions of examples of abusive
or toxic language thanks to strategic
partnerships with the New York Times
with Wikipedia and a number of others
and in this case by the way we're
defining toxicity
like a comment that is likely to cause
somebody to leave the conversation so in
building this initial model we then sort
of went through a stage where we were
doing some experimentation and some
iteration getting more data doing more
research to accompany that engineering
development that focused on making sure
we are accounting for things like
machine learning bias and so forth and
the result of this the result of this is
sort of an early version of perspective
that we released in February in the form
of an API which and let me sort of
describe for you how it works if you're
a publisher or a platform you can run
all of your comments and discussions
through this API and you receive a score
back zero to 100 of how likely that
comment is to be toxic now it's a
measurement tool so what you do with
that score as a publisher or platform is
entirely up to you our goal was to put
the power of machine learning in the
hands of the platforms and publishers
that are facilitating these
conversations and by the way we did this
as a reaction to a demand that we knew
was out there you know most publishers
and platforms have human moderators that
just sort of lack the sort of you can't
hire enough humans to manage all the
discussions in the way that in the terms
of service they they sort of articulate
a desire to so right now you know this
is available as I mentioned you know
there's lots of different ways that it
can be used it's ultimately for the
publishers and platforms to decide but
let me sort of walk you through some
obvious integrations and before doing
that I'll observe that there's basically
three types of characters on the
internet right you have moderators you
have readers and you have authors and
let me start with an example of readers
so you write here in the front row
what's your what's your name yes Leon so
where do you work okay so Leon is a
student in Munich and let's do a little
role play here let's assume Leon is the
sort of nicer and sort of more sensible
of the two of us and let's assume that
I'm just one of these people that I want
to see it all there's no reason why Leon
and I shouldn't be able to read the same
article
with the same common thread but
dynamically turned the volume of
toxicity up or down depending on our
threshold and even though Leone is very
nice let's say after lunch he sort of
like you know has a higher threshold so
after he's eaten and he feels better he
can turn the volume up and he'll see
more comments you know so here with this
demo you see a discussion of climate
change where you know as the slider
moves in one direction or the other
you'll see the comments that are visible
changing dynamically and in this case
the machine is filtering not by topic
it's filtering by tone now another
example that I'll show you has to do
with the authorship experience so here
you'll see you know sort of the
prompting you could imagine a situation
on a platform where somebody types in a
comment and you receive a score back of
how likely that comment is to be toxic
now what's interesting is we incorrectly
assume often times that the majority of
toxicity on the Internet is the work of
organized trolling efforts and trolls
you know certainly play a role
individually and as a sort of collective
enterprise but the research has also
shown that a lot of toxic comments are
people that either just lack
self-awareness or having a bad day or
something else and the research also
shows that this tiny little bit of
feedback can actually have a huge impact
in making somebody alter what their what
they're writing so again these are just
sort of a handful of examples with
viewership and authorship but you could
also imagine the following situation
how many of you by show of hands have
ever just been in a really bad mood you
know I've been really mad about
something you just sort of fire off an
email that's you know sort of
unnecessarily obnoxious and maybe you
didn't sort of click on do within 15
seconds be be honest I mean I'm sure
every one of you right and we're all
we're all human so what if you could
just set you know what if you could set
a toxicity threshold on the emails that
you send and say I never want to send an
email with a toxicity score north of 75
you literally could write your emails
and not have to worry about what kind of
mood you're in but you could also
imagine publishers and platforms you
know having a threshold for toxicity
that they set across their platform and
using the equivalent of spell check for
toxic
to help the people writing the comments
Deus make their sort of obnoxious point
within the sort of boundaries that that
particular publisher or platform has set
forth now as you hear this you might
think to yourself well isn't that sort
of shutting down speech isn't that
making it harder for people to convey
their point you know two points on this
quite the opposite
right now the default position is
publishers and platforms because they
can't manage all this or increasingly
shutting down comments or partially
shutting down comments to the sensible
people are all fleeing the conversation
so what you get is sort of troll talking
patrol or toxic person talking to toxic
person and in this case you're actually
using machine learning to make it easier
for people to convey their point in ways
that calibrate for varying degrees of
comfort with toxicity from viewer to
author to moderator so I've shown you a
sort of reader experience I've shown you
an author experience now let me show you
a moderator experience and let's use the
New York Times as a case study so the
New York Times which rightfully so it's
considered among the best at human
moderation both in terms of capacity and
in terms of quality control right now
hires ten full-time employees who are
able to look at 10,000 comments a day
and moderate them and that may sound
like a lot except those 10,000 comments
only account for 10% of the total 200
articles that are published on the New
York Times every single day so despite
the aspiration to want to allow comments
and discussion across every single
article in The New York Times the limits
of human moderation only allow them to
get to 10% so we built a partnership
with the New York Times to help them
integrate perspective you know and as a
result as of I think a week and a half
ago they're now able to expand comments
and turn them on for all their top
stories and all their opinion pieces and
what was sort of remarkable about this
is and somebody can correct me if I'm
wrong but but we believe that this may
be the very first instance of a major
publisher reversing a trend that has
sort of been forcing publishers and
platforms to
comments and reverse that trend towards
expanding comments at scale so just to
sort of visualize this a little bit
let's look at a little before and after
so here what you see is about a week and
a half ago and try to ignore this sort
of Trump Comey Theresa May stuff because
it's distracting and what you'll see is
you know this is the before you know
you'd have comments on only three of the
top stories and this is the after you
have comments now on eleven of the top
stories which is almost a 4x increase
it's the same thing for opinion pieces
so this is the before you have comments
aloud on five of the opinion pieces and
this is the after you now have it on
eleven which again more than a 2x
increase so the question is sort of how
did we do this
so I mentioned you know you have
moderators you have readers you have
authors and there's no one application
that needs to be the sort of gold
standard for how perspective is used in
any of those capacities in the case of
the New York Times we co developed a
tool with them that as you can see here
allows them to represent all the
comments on every article on a sliding
scale so they can set toxicity
thresholds for what will require what
will be flagged for human review what
will be batch accepted what will be
batch rejected and again this is just
sort of one this is just one example now
what's interesting is this is just one
model right so what I've talked about is
your perspective you know down the road
is going to be a collection of models
that are designed to empower publishers
and platforms to facilitate better
conversation so what you've seen today
is the toxicity model but we're also
experimenting with a number of other
models we're experimenting with the
model around insubstantiality obscenity
personal attack attack on commenter off
topic so why are we doing all of this
well just because a comment section or a
discussion is civil it doesn't mean that
all of you will necessarily participate
in a conversation you know ideally a
conversation is most efficient when it's
civil and it's coherent and again it's
not up to us you know
at sort of Google alphabet to determine
you know how sort of which models are
used to facilitate better conversations
and how the scores and measurement tools
are used for moderation readership or
authorship we just want to make it all
available so as we sort of progress on
this you can imagine if you're a
publisher or platform looking at the
sort of range of models that you have at
your disposal and deciding that you know
you want your moderators to be able to
you know measure language for
insubstantiality for toxicity and for
off-topic and again you'll receive
scores back zero to 100 for each of
those and the sort of number of models
that we can build over the course of
time you know is kind of is kind of
endless it's a pretty exciting chapter
again we just launched this in the early
stages in Feb in February and what's
nice is the more the more we experiment
with it in the wild you know the more
opportunities there are for iteration on
the model so I encourage all of you go
to prospective API calm and play around
with typing things into the toxicity box
I'm not sure if that's what we call it
and see if you can get yourself a 100%
score I'm not sure anybody ever has many
people have tried but play around with
it and you'll find some false positives
and I think that's you know that that's
by design because we want those false
positives flagged and we want them
corrected now you know as we sort of sum
up here you heard David talk about you
know some of the amazing things
happening with AI at Google you've heard
me talk about how machine learning can
be used to tackle some of these sort of
seemingly intractable problems right and
there is a lot of you know sort of
hysteria oftentimes around AI and nobody
would claim that you know artificial
intelligence or machine learning is a
panacea to all the world's problems
right so you know debate is healthy but
if you look at what I just showed you in
terms of discussion online
here's a seemingly intractable problem
right and it really is seemingly
intractable that you can reverse the
trend of conversation becoming more
toxic and more people fleeing the
conversation and more discussion
platform shutting down but the
evidence of machine learning means that
for the first time we're able to have
the technology catch up with our values
which is a pretty exciting moment you
know it's also exciting to do things
that for once make things more difficult
for trolls right level the playing field
so that they have you know they're sort
of asymmetric tactics no longer have a
disproportionate advantage but the other
aspect of this is if we look at how the
world is changing and I want to sort of
leave you with this point about machine
learning we look at the last decade and
a half it's largely been a story about
you know the advent of Technology you
know that is to say an access revolution
but if you just look at the numbers they
say by 2020 you know there'll be more
smartphones in circulation than there
are people in the entire world and
that's before you even get into the
Internet of Things and everything else
so what that means is you literally have
massive amounts of data being generated
by citizens in 196 countries on earth
and all of a sudden the challenges of
the world you know that we're seemingly
intractable or the challenges in the
world that you know prior to this moment
had no potential technological solution
all of a sudden we can at a minimum
begin to ask the question can we use
machine learning to make a dent in these
challenges and sometimes we can
sometimes we can right you can't it's
not it's not obvious how you would use
machine learning if you were sort of you
know a starving individual or if you
were you know if you needed you know
water or if you needed to inject
yourself with medicine that you didn't
have available so it can't solve every
problem but what we do know is that if
you look at the history of our society
in our world it's never been a smart
move to decide that we're not going to
use the best technology that we have at
our disposal to troubleshoot some of the
world's greatest challenges and so it's
a particularly exciting time to be
working in machine learning it's a
particularly exciting time to work in
technology and as I look out at all of
you it's a particularly exciting time to
do the work that all of you are doing
because so much of what is out there so
much of you know the visibility that we
have into the world challenges today
again for the first
I'm have an opportunity for us to come
up with innovative solutions that may
never have been possible in the past so
thank you for your time and it was a
pleasure to be here with you this
morning
thanks very much to Jared cohon Thank
You Jared Jared came from jigsaw and to
