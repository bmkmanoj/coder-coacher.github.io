revolution estimates nearly 42 percent
of jobs are at a high risk of being
affected by automation in the next
decade or two we're gonna see more and
more things that look like science
fiction and fewer and fewer things that
look like jobs welcome to part three of
our special series automate this we are
looking at the future of work in an
artificially intelligent world machine
learning is already transforming
workplaces around the globe and the rate
of change is astounding even to the
people who built the technology the
advances in the last even 5 years have
been startling last week we added
pharmacists and open heart surgeons to
the list of occupations that experts
believe could one day be overtaken by
machines introducing automation and
robots to the pharmacy industry is the
only way we can get as close to making
zero errors as possible up to 7.5
million Canadians could lose their jobs
to automation in the next decade alone
and according to Michael Osborne there
are more compromises to come even if
only some of the tasks within a jawbone
automatable the skills required to
complete that job may change completely
if robots take our jobs we'll still be
able to make art or at least binge watch
Netflix but even Hollywood is an immune
to the changes that are coming this week
we're asking how AI could transform the
world of entertainment from pop music to
blockbuster films that's why it's good
the black box that's really pesky a a
professor at Simon Fraser University who
specializes in what he calls
computational creativity he's showing us
around the black box a computer lab
where he's teaching machines to make art
and compose music
real musicians and not robots
but what's happening is that they're
playing from his car
I was not written by a human but was
written by a computer
Felipe's algorithm reads musical scores
and uses the patterns it finds to
imitate real composers we made
experiments to try to answer the
question can people make the difference
between an original piece from nasa's
show panel Brahms and a piece generated
by a machine and then we find that
people contrary make the difference you
can test your ability to distinguish
between a fan tech Chopin and a
computer's best imitation at cbc.ca
slash de sex but Philippe's machines
don't just write music the main thing
people do is computer is organize
pictures prepare video montage and play
video games and so that's really what we
try to do in the lab is to empower users
to create better creates faster and
eventually create different thing that
they would create without those
technologies Phillipe sees his programs
as creative assistants that enhance
artists toolkits rather than replace
them and he sees no reason to view them
as a threat provided I have my cell
phone there's a number of things that I
don't even bother memorizing anymore so
I've been offloading some of my
cognition to this machine I see no
reason why we wouldn't do the same thing
for some creative tasks the list of
artistic tasks that could be offloaded
to computers is growing machines can
already write high queues design
computer animations even build cgi movie
stars and according to Nick Bilton
that's just the beginning
Nick is a senior correspondent for
Vanity Fair and he says AI is poised to
have a huge impact on the entertainment
industry with consequences that reach
far beyond Hollywood Nick Bilton good
morning welcome to day six thanks for
having me on no one is questioning the
potential for disruption in sectors like
manufacturing or retail but there hasn't
been a lot of talk about how AI could
affect the entertainment industry do you
think that people who work in the
creative sector are prepared for the
changes that you say are coming no not
in the slightest I don't think people in
any sectors are prepared for the changes
that are coming I think people kind of
tend to look
the way and from the reporting and the
research that I've been doing for more
than a decade I think that they should
be actually looking directly into the
eye of what's coming because it's it's
going to be big how far-reaching do you
think that the impact of artificial
intelligence could be in the
entertainment industry well I mean I
think it's going to touch everything you
know from the actors the musicians the
singers producers you know when you
think about a movie or a musical number
or something like that
the number of people involved can
sometimes be in the hundreds and I think
that in the future the number of people
involved could be in the in the double
digits rather than in the triple digits
we just heard Canadian researcher
Philippe sta describing some of the AI
tools that he's developing for musicians
if we look at the music industry what do
you think the major disruptions there
will be well maybe you don't necessarily
need actual musicians you could start a
band with artificial intelligent
versions of them and you know you could
imagine doing what we call a bee testing
so you create a different versions of a
song and you can imagine that you create
a thousand different versions of a song
that you have written with some sort of
artificial intelligence it's helped you
do it and you put it out there to see
which one people like the most things
like that so it's kind of like a focus
grouping except for it's a giant focus
group that will determine which one is
going to be perhaps the most popular
correct and then you know you're
starting to see that happen a little bit
here and there with the way that they do
title testing and things like that with
songs and movies but you're really gonna
start to see it happen with the actual
creative content but there are skeptics
out there who say that when it comes to
the actual creative tasks a I probably
will have a limited impact and one of
those is John Seabrook of The New Yorker
he's the author of the song machine
here's what he said when we asked
whether he thinks AI will disrupt the
music industry we experience music the
way we discover music it already is what
area in which I think that machines will
not automate is the actual writing of
yes that's kind of a being an artist is
really ultimately is taking off in some
direction that is not the one that the
data is telling you necessarily to take
you know that's
and I don't know if that is when an ad I
could ever do what do you make of John
seabrooke's assertion Nick Bilton that
there's something unpredictable and
maybe something human about the art of
pop hit making that that might not be
replicated by a machine
well I mean in many respects pop hit
making today is formed by machines and
the fact that artists like Lana Del Rey
and things like that are they're
manufactured they're not these really
creative people that come up with this
form of music there are a bunch of
marketing people that come up with the
concept and create someone like her and
that happens in the raw in the music
industry every day and I think that you
give them an opportunity to use
computers and algorithms to help them do
that
you can be sure they're going to I mean
for example just to segue very briefly
to the film industry imagine that you
could come home and you got to think
about it not from the creative
standpoint but from a consumer
standpoint so imagine you come home and
you've had a long day at work and you
say I want to watch a comedy that's 45
minutes long because I have to be up
early for a meeting and I want it to be
based in New York and have to female
lead actor correct those are the things
that you will be able to do but will
about what do you think it will be any
good what will it be watchable I think
it will I mean looked I think today
they're you know you you probably don't
realize this but if you pick up a
newspaper there are articles that are
written by machines I'm very simple
short articles so a sports story about
you know to say the Yankees and the Red
Sox played yesterday it writes those
things that does it with stock reports
and I think that it will start to happen
with other things slowly but eventually
the speed with technology changes is
gonna be much more rapid there's a
reason though why Jennifer Lawrence gets
paid 25 million dollars a film what what
about movie stars you've written that
Hollywood is dying do you think that AI
is playing a role in that demise and
could it mean the end of the movie star
well I think Hollywood is dying because
of its own stupidity to be quite frank I
think that they don't allow creativity
anymore 10 20 years ago people would
come up with a movie idea and then they
would make the movie and come out on a
certain date yeah now all these big
production companies say oh we need a
movie for January 24th and then they
work backwards to create one and so what
I think is going to happen in the future
is that actors are not going to be
needed in the same way that they are
today you know there were two people in
the last last star wars that were not
real actors they were computer-generated
Burton
that so what if you could do that with
everyone do you think in the future
Jennifer Lawrence could just license out
her 3d image to a production company
rather than ever appear on set without a
question in my mind that is gonna happen
there's this I mean there will be worlds
where she still acts in movies but I
think that there will be another world
where you are watching films with
Jennifer Lawrence or even people who
have passed away maybe Marilyn Monroe or
something like that and it's all
computer-generated and and done by
artificial intelligence how close are we
to those worlds now technically speaking
are there audio and video editing
systems in existence now that show us
what the future might look like in ten
years well we're not close but we are
close and so Adobe for example who makes
Adobe Photoshop has been working on a
version of Photoshop for audio and they
did a demonstration last year where they
showed you could take ten minutes of
audio from someone ten to twenty minutes
of audio you put it into this machine
and then you can type words and it will
speak them in a way that you literally
cannot tell what that person did not say
those things right they're thinking of
it for the ad industry okay of course
the way we imagine any technologies used
is never the way it's actually used I
wrote an article for Vanity Fair last
year which got a lot of buzz about the
future of fake news and what I was
looking at was the fact that in the next
2018 2020 elections in the US you're
gonna have not just fake news articles
but you're gonna have fake videos of you
know Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump
talking that are going to be created on
on computer generated technologies or
fake audio from fake radio transcripts
that never happen and those things exist
today and I think that that's speed with
which the thing can happen is around the
corner at some point we started this
conversation Nick by talking about
Hollywood and you said that it isn't
ready for the disruption that's coming
do you think our political systems are
ready for what you just described I
don't think that our political systems
are ready for what I just described but
I do think there are certain people in
the world who are aware that they should
be you look at Vladimir Putin who just a
couple of weeks ago put out probably the
most honest thing I think I've ever
heard him say which was whoever controls
artificial intelligence in the future
controls the world and the reason he
knows that is because once you control
that you can control anything Nick
builtin thank you for being with us my
pleasure thanks for having me Nick
Bilton is a senior correspondent for
Vanity Fair
AI has the potential to radically
transform nearly every facet of daily
life and doctor you've all her re says
it's time to decide what kind of society
we want to build some people envision a
wonderful situation in which all the
dreary jobs are taken care of by the
Machine and humans are supported through
some kind of universal basic income
scheme and then there are of course and
more dystopian scenarios in which
humankind is split into a tiny
all-powerful elite and the vast
underclass is life totally at the mercy
of the elite next week on our final
episode of automated this we chart the
possibilities of a world without work
and what's at stake if we get it wrong
we don't take decisions the free markets
will take the decisions on our behalf
and Ivan across the free market to make
the best decisions for you can con
you've all her re
author of homo Davos on how AI will
transform society for better or for
worse that's coming up next week on day
six and if you're concerned about the
future of your job we want to hear about
